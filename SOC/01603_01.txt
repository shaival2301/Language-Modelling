Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
In opening the Third Session of the Sixteenth
Parliament of Canada I desire te join with yeu
in profound thankfulness for the recovery of
our beloved Sovereign, King George the Fifth.
I share your fervent hope that His Majesty
may be completely restored in health, and that
he may be spared te continue that devoted
service te the Empire which bas won for him
an abiding place in the hearts of the people.
The unprecedented
prosperity which is
,apparent throughout the Dominion affords
cause for the deepest satisfaction. Never in
the history of Canada bas there been such
industrial and commercial expansion as that
which bas taken place during the past twelve
months. The industry and enterprise of our
people have been rewarded under Providence
with an abundant harvest. In the production
78600-1

of agricultural and other basic industries all
previous records have been surpassed. New
records have also been established in the volume
of construction and in the volume of foreign
trade. Employment bas been maintained at a
high level and all indications point te a continuance throughout the country of the present
favourable conditions.
A notable feature of industrial development
lias been the continued advance and prosperity
of the mining industry in almost every part
of the Dominion.
The production of the fishing industry durIng
the past year bas shown a substantial increase
over that of 1927. In accordance with the
recommendations of the Royal Commission on
Fisheries, the Fisheries Branch of the Department of Marine and Fisheries bas been
separated from the Marine Branch, and a
Deputy Minister of Fisheries bas been
appointed. A reorganization of the Fisheries
Service along lines recommended by the
Commission is being effected. Certain other
matters covered in the report will, during the
present session, be dealt with by legislation.
Plans are in progress cf complettion for
the construction of the National Research
Laboratories to provide scientific and technical
knowledge for the various branches of production.
The past year witnessed the inauguration of
the Canadian National Steamships service
between Canada and Bermuda and the West
Indies. The many advantages of this service
are already apparent. In view of the importance of our ever increasing expert trade it is
intended to augment and extend the existing
facilities for furnishing Oanadian exporters
with commercial information in respect to
foreign markets.
It is also proposed te
establish additional Trade Commissioner offices
at strategic points in different parts of the
world.
Communication within the Dominion bas been
facilitated and improved by an extensive
development of air mail services, and communication te all parts of the British Empire by the
restoration of penny postage.
The expansion in trade and commerce which
the country bas experienced bas been strikingly
reflected in our transportation returns. The
net earnings of the railways have exceeded
those of any previcus year.
Satisfactory progress continues te be made in
the construction of the Hudson Bay Railway.
The laying of steel is now within thirty-seven
miles of t e terminus of the line at Churchill,
where a substantial commencement bas been
made in the provision of port facilities. The
rapid development of Western and Northern
Canada imposes on the railways the necessity
of providling increased transportation facilities
in the imnmediate future. A further branch line
program by the Canadian National manage-

servative; and he represents it very appropriately, because, though brought up in the
East, he has imbibed to a large extent the
atmosphere of the West, and we have in him
a fair medium of representation of public
opinion in the whole of Canada.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
gentlemen, I did not anticipate the remarks
made by my honourable friend to the right
(Hon. Mr. Poirier); still less had I occasion
to anticipate the remarks of the honourable
leader of the Government. It is very satisfying to myself, however undeserved, that he
should be so generous towards me to-night,
and I hope that our relations in the future
will be just as pleasant as they have been
in the past.
1, too, recognize that this is not the House
of Commons; yet, not only do we sit on
opposite sides, but by habit, which of course
we acquired before we came into this Ifouse,
we do more or less incline to parties. I do
not profess to be neutral in this respect, but
I do profess to be somewhat progressive in
thought. I have nover ben a reactionarywhetîler tihat fact is due to the atmosphere of
the West or net I <lo net know-but none the
less I stand for safe and stable government,
net for foolish experiiet rs in the field of
visionary legislation, which perhaps have been
attempted at times by more than one Govern-

ment in responee to popular clamour. I think
both sides of this House should ahvays resist
that.
It is a pleasure to me, and a very great
honour indeed, and wholly undeserved, that
my friends on this side of the House should
live sclected nie as their leader when in the
field there were more distinguished comîpetitors-if I miglit se describe them, although we
ar-e all friends. I shall try to merit the conidene
ithatthey have kindly reposed in me,
if not by any display of marked ability, which
I do net claim, at least by assiduity and
attention te the duties of this House.

HIS MAJESTY

THE KING

JOINT ADDRESS

A Message was received from the House
of Commons informing the Senate that the
Commons had passed an Address to His
Most Excellent Majesty the King expressing the thankfulness and rejoicing of the
people of Canada on the proinse of coimplete
recovery of His Majesty, and requesting Their
Honours to unite with the louse of Commons
in the said Address.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved:
That the Senate doth agree with the House
of Commons in the said Address and do fill in
the blankr space therein with the words
"Senate and."
He said: Honourable gentlenen, the resolution was presented te the House of Commons
without previous notice, and was passed by
that House. I hope the sentiment that actuated the HJouse of Commons will actuate this
Cliamber in permitting the Address to be
considered now.
It reads:
To the King's Most Excellent Majesty:
Most Gracious Sovereign:
We, Your Majesty's ditiful and loyal subjects, the
Conimons of Canada, in
Parliaient assenbled,i huimbly beg leave to apw iti the expression of
proacli Your Majesty
our thankfulness

arnd rejoicing that, under

the

providence of God, there lias been vouchsafed
to Your Majesty the promise of complete recovery froin the severe and protracted illness
whlich Yourr Majesty lias borne with so great
patience and fortitude. We have watched the
course of Your M\ajesty's illness witi an.ious
solicitude and vitli profound sympathy for Your
Majesty, ler Majesty the Queen, and for al]
the mniembers of tie Royal Farnily. It is withr

sentients of the deepest sincerity and loyalty
that, as representatives of the Canadian people,
we joie Our prayers to those from all parts of
the British Empire for the early restoration of
Your Majosty to the fulleess of health and
strength.
The Speech from the Throne lias rightly
expressed the thouglits and ionrmost feelins of the Canadian peuple towards His

FEBRUARY 11, 1929
Majesty King George the Fifth. The purpose of the Resolution now submitted to
Parliament le officially and soleninly to record
the unanimous sentiments of our Dominion.
The anxicty of ail Canadians, bas been
dýaily demonst.rated throughout the many
weeks of His Majesty's illneas. Many millions of subi ectis who had neyer seen their
Sovereign and did not know hlmn in the flesb,
were apt to think of the King as they did
of the Crown-as the em'blem. of sovereignty,
the ideal link binding the members of the
His Maiesty's illness bas
Commonwealth.
brought us ail nearer to a realization of bis
humanity. Filial affection for the man himself bas sprung Up in every breast. A subdued ehord bas vibrated, and a new link ham
been forged in the chain of fealty.
Since the dictum that the King reigno but
does flot govern bas impreased itself more
and more deeply into the Constitution, the
Sovereign has lost many of tbe opportunities for contact with tbe nation which a
greater share in the administration formerly
allowed hlm. But if bis respo-nsibility bas
diminiý,hed, flot so bis moral influence. As
the stipreme head of the nation,' the King
stands as an example, and bis lufe le a standard which draws out the best instincts of
tbe people. The simple and kind-hearted
manner in which the manifold duties of the
King in tbe social if e of the community bave
been daily accomiplished has draiwn unto him,
the affection of one and ahl. Tbere have been
moments since bis Coronation when bis constitutional functions bave brougbt him face
to, face with problems wbich be alone could
solve. At no time bas he been unequal to
his task; hile clear conscience and bigh sense
oyfduty bave invariably led bimn to the right
solution.
The war opened for tbe nation a chiupter of
anguish and sorrow wbicb was fully shared
by is Mai esty. His constant tbought and
concern were for the sailors and the soldiers,
whom be visited at the peril of bis life. From
one visit ýhe returned on a stretcber. If the
democracy over wbicb. be presides acclainis
his sovereignty, and p'rays the Alm-ighty for
a prompt and complete restoration of bis
health, is Majesty but reaps where be bas
sgown, bis people returnýing in fullest ineasure
the devotion and affection wbich, witbout
stint, he bas bestowed upon them.
Hon, W. B. WILLOUGHiBY: ilonourablc
gentlemen, because of the short tenure of
my new position, and hecause of the extra
work which the undertaking of new responsibilities bas involved, I bave not had the opportunity to consider this matter as I would
bave wished. I should like, howcver, to say

5

a word or two as to the increased power
in this demnocratic age of tbe King of England.
Students of bistory will remember tbe uncertainty, not of the legal or constitutional
powers of paet sovereigns, but of their sway
in the minds and hearts of the English people.
The King was once ahl powerful; but we
know that in the time of the Stuarts, and
even in more recent times, during the Guelph
and the Windsor dynasties, t-here was in the
hearte of the people no such universal loyalty
to the Crown as there je at the present time.
We know that even wben lier Gracious
Ma.jesty Queen Victoria ascended the Tbrone
it was contended by the incoming ministry
that the ladies of the bedcbamýber in the
Queen's suite should be replaccd by others
more in sympatby witb the Government in
power. Anybody who is familiar with the
letters of Junlus, supposed to be written hy
Sir Pbilip Francis, knowe how different was
the position beld by the King a.t that time
in the hearts of the people of Great Britain.
It is due to the present dynasty ýto say that
it bas been able to reconcile the, monarchy
with tru-e democracy, and to keep pace witb
the growth oif democracy tbroughout the
world. The power of tbe aristocracy as against
the democracy le diminishing enormously in
England, tbougb it le still a stable and very
important factor in British hie. as I hope it
may long -continue to be. Before the rule of
the people in England, democracy bad very
little voice in the election otf representatives
such as oit in tbe other Chamber, because the
The
franchlee was prodigiously restrict-ed.
sweetness of temper of the House of Windsor
was exemplified by lier Gracious Majesty
Queen Victoria, afterwards by King Edward,
and is now recognized la the reigning monarcb,
and 18 the spirit by which we bave a true
democracy in England. If we had not bad
such a spirit in Engl'and the war migbt have
-had a serions effect upon the monarcby. We
bave only to look at Europe: in some countries
thrones have tumbled; and in countries where
tbrones bave not tumnbled there have been a
growing numnber of dictatorsbips. But in
Britain, because of the spirit wbich actuated
the monarcby-tbe spirit of adjustment to the
widiening ephere of democracy-tbe Crown today stands in a pre-eminently strong position.
The thirone bas perhaps neyer been filled more
ably, or more acceptably to the nation, than it
is at the present time, and the hearts of
Britleh people througbont the world reepond
to the message wbich we are going to> transmit.
Through tbe kindneoe of this House in selecting me as one of the parliamentary delegates, I went to South Africa and there had an

his opinions in the committee rooms and in
this Chamber. His sound judgment was
clear to all who listened to him. He was fairminded, and, as I have said of my honourable
friend who now replaces him (Hon. Mr.
Wiloughby), he was quite dispassionate in
debate. He went directly to the root of the
questions before him, examined them in the
best interests of the country, and worked
constantly to modify and improve the legis'lation which came from the other Chamber.
Senator Ross was a most valuable member.
We all feel the loss to the Senate caused by
his sudden departure, and I know that we
shall long cherlish his memory.
A few months ago we lost the honourable
member from Brockvil-le, Senator Webster.
He had been in the dairy industry, and was
quite active in all that pertained to it. ce

questions affecting that industry, or relating
to transportation. The dairy industry throughout the world was familiar to him, and there
was never a question affecting it, in whatever
form it came before this Chamber, on which
we did not have the benefit of his experience.
He was an enthusiast, an optimist, in the
development of agriculture in Canada, and it
was always with pleasure that we listened to
the information which he brought to the
Senate.
I am sure that you will all join with me in
extending to the families of Senator Ross
and Senator Webster our most heartfelt sympathy.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
gentlemen, may I add a little to what the
honourable leader of the Government has said
of our two beloved and deceased members. I
first came into contact with Senator Ross
when he was Chairman of the Divorce Committee, and we sat on it together for a considerable time. It very soon became apparent
te me that he had a fine legal mind. He was
keenly interested in the legal aspects of the
cases. I do not say that he was not interested
in other aspects; he certainly was, to the
extent of seeing that justice was done, but
anything that pertained to the legal aspect
was what interested him particulaly.. Up
t'll practically a year ago it was his pleasure
to confer wiith me now and again in reference
to ilegal questions that arose before the Committee on Divorce.

The honourable leader of the Government
has briefly recounted the history of Senator
Ross, but R know a little chapter that is probably not known generally. I went west some
time late in the last century, when the western

cities were very much smaler than they are
to-day. [ then heard of a young lawyer who
had come from the East to the city of Regina.
Judgments were rendered there at that time
by a man, now for many years deceased, wh
had been a lieutenant-colonel. He was a
st'ipendiary magistrate. In those early days,
and for a considerable period, there was no
High Court judge nor any other judge, but
only a stipendiary magistrate, and there were
no law libraries of any kind anywhere in the
prairies of the Middle West. This stipendiary
magistrate, with military training, rarely had
appearing before him on behalf of
,nybody
a client; so le became a littie irked at any
opposition. However, this young lawyer had
ithe temerity to ask the magfistrate what
authority he had for the position lc held
in dealing with a certain legal matter before
him; and the magistrate was quite horrified
that anybody should question his authority
for a proposition that he was laying down
as law. This aggressive young lawyer in the
end not only won out at the Bar, but insisted
on the right to have the judge's opinion supported by authority, and not by a mere declaration of the judge's own view. That
young lawyer afterwards told me himself that
he went to Winnipeg and practised there for
a time; and he was no other than the honourable gentleman to whose demise we are referring. He had a great legal mind. I think
he exceHed in what we might call chamber
counse:-not necessarily in court, but in the
giving of advice-because he was a profound
student. Anybody who knew his personal
habits knew that when out on his walks he
would hammer out his thoughts and alarify
them in his own mmd. He was always
thinking, always of a most active turn of
mmd.
He was kindness itself to everybody in this
House, and he was courtesy itself to everybody on the other side. He was absolutely
without affectation, simple in his habits, approachable at all times. There will never be,
in this or any House, a leader who will be a
more lovable character than was Senator
Ross.
As for Senator Webster, I came into contact with him early. I entered the Senate in
1917, when the Senate was sitting h the
Museum Building, and he was my room-mate
during all the time we were there, until we
moved to this building.
Senator Webster was genial, kindly, and
intensely human. I know he loved a good
horse, and what is more, he liked to drive a
good horse.

knew Senator Webster day by day as a
neiglibour, a friend, an ail-round mnan.
The honourable leader of our friends to
the left cf the Speaker (Hon. Mr. Willoughby)
has referred to Senator Webster's love of
horses.
Did you ever know a man who was
fond of animais and was flot a pretty good
man?
Look out for the man who does flot
like some kind of animal life besides his own.
John Webster was devoted to horses. In My
you.nger days I occasionally dabbled in the
buying of horses myseif, and there were two
men I aiways tried to talk ta ai-ter I had made
a purchase: one waýs the late Mr. Comstock,
And I
and the other was John Webster.
assure you th-at Senator Webster knew as
much of many other thinga as he knew of
horses.
1 esteemed him as a neiglibour and fellow
citizen of the town of Brockville, and 1 may
say that no man who has passed away has
carried with bim on his going a greater and
deeper respect than our late colleague.
Hon. G. D. RIOBERTSON: Honourable
gentlemen, as desk-mate for several years of
our late leader, Senator Ross, I crave the opportunity of saying a word in passing. We
ail know that Senator Ross was greatly beloved by Sir James Lougheed, b-is predecessor.
Shortly after Senator Ross came into the
House Sir James recognized and appreeiated
bis particular ability as an interpreter of constitutionai questions; so when Sir James laid
down bis work it was fitting and naturai that
Senator Ross shouid take it up.
Althougb Senator Ross and I did not walk
ini exactly the same pathe of life, his associations 'being somewbat different, from mine,
and his mind working in different channels,
we found many thinga in common; and often
we diseussed problema in whîch we were interested in the most friendly way. As a
result of that association I feel that I learned
many tbings, and was enabied to, understand
manY things that otberwise I shouid net have
understood. I have aIse boped and beiieved
tbat Senator Ross gained conceptions of many
things connected with the activities of our
national life that he had not realized before.
I therefore agree with a previous speaker
that it is a splendid thing that the members

9

of this buse are drawn from various walks
in if e, for by beinýg throýwn together we have
the opportunity of giving an ear to the views
of those who have a knowledge of problems
with which we are nlot familiar.
On the 24th of July last I returned from
Newfoundland to Halifax, and one morning
I caiied to sec Senator Ross and found him
recovering fi-cm an illness. He had not been
able to leave the bouse for some weeks,' but
for a few days previous had been up and
walking about the bouse, and xvas looking
very weii, and confldentiy anticipated that
be was on the road te permanent recovery. It
was a very great shock to me, therefore, to
see shortly afterwards a notice of bis death.
I was net aware that he had left Halifax until
that notice appeared. We are aiýl grieved at
the loss of a leader who *has been of great
service to bis country both in and out of
this House.
I heartily concur in ail that bas been said
with reference to Senator Webster, and need
flot dilate upon wbat the right bonourabie
gentleman frora Eganville (Riglit Hon. Mr.
Grabam) bas so fittingly said.
Hyon. F. L. SCHAFFNER: Honourabie
gentlemen, I esteem -it a privilege and an
honour Vo be permitted to say a few words
on this occasion, especiaily in regard to my
friend the 'late Senator Webster. 1 thorougbiy
agree witb ail that bas been said of tbe late
Senator Ross, but it was net my privilege to
know bim as well as I knew Senator Webster.
The right bonourable gentleman from
Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham) bas said
that he and Senator Webster were neigbbours.
I tbink we will ail agree that neighbours, tbose
wbo are familiar with the growtb and development of men, can speak of those men
witb the greatest assurance. It was my privilege for some years Vo be intimately acquainted not only witb Sènator Webster, but
witb bis family, and I must say-and I think
every member wiii agree wiýtb me-that if
tbere ever was a loyal, bon-est, since-re friend
or mac of business, John Webster was that
mac. He was very f-amiliar witb the mntricacies of his business. He carried bis
bocesty and sincerity into bis business ife
as he carried it inte the work he was called
u-1pon to do bere. I sbouid not feel that I
bad donc my duty if I faîled to express my
appreciatien, my love, of tbe laVe Senator
Webster, and I shahl always deem it an bonour
to bave been bis friend.

The new Canadian-British West Indies Trade
Agreement was proclaimed in Canada on April
30, 1927, bringing into force, with the
exception of bananas, the tariff preferences
ta be exchanged between Canada and the
British West Indies, Bermuda, British Guiana,
and British Honduras under the 1925 Trade
Agreement. The preference whicha Canada is
te grant on bananas was deferred pending the
establishment of certain steainship service as
provided for in Article XIII of the agreement.
The Leeward and Windward Islands, whicha
were bound only te endeavour to grant some
larger preferences, have done se te an appeciable degree. The Windward Islands formalily
proclaiened the agreement in effect as from

in the Leewards has been received, but official
notice ham been recei-ved that ordinances
effective fromn July 1, 1927, would implement
the agreement in Antigua, Dominica, St.
Kitts-Nevis and Montserrat. Se the agreement
has been in force oniy fer a period cf a little
over twenty-ene months. Honourable gentlemen will remember that before the making of
the agreement it was stated, by certain peeple
who were presumed te know something about
West Inýdian trade, that we had then ail the
trade which could be procured. Suffice it te
say that the imports into Canada during the
past year, without pyroper ships and witheut
the assistance of the Royal Mail Line, whicha
withdrew freým the service, and without the
part of the treaty referring te bananas being
put into, force, amounted te $22,165,689 as
compared with $17,825,086 for the year ending
March 31, 1927; and the experts of Canadian
produce from Canada to the British West
Indies for last year amounted te $20,068,153,
as cornpared with $17,702,013 for the year
ending March 31, 1927.

been almost entirely from the United States,
alt.hough many of the hananas imported were
undeubtedly grown in the British West Indies.
They were conveyeýd te United States ports
in United States vesselýs, paying port and
brokerage charges, and were then shipped on
American railways te the point nearest conFor instance, bananas going te
somption.
Winnipeg would be shipped over the American
roadb te Emersen, which is only sixty or
seventy miles south cf Winnipeg. Under the
terms of the agreement, bananas thus shipped
in future wvill pay fifty cents a buýnch, while

those coming in through. Canadian ports will
be free of du'ty. This will mean a diversion
of this trade. Owing to the season in which
bananas mature, a very large percentage of
these bananas, 1 think about eighty per cent,
will corne iup the St. Lawrence, during opt-n
navigation, to Montreal, and wil'l then be
nearer te the great consuming publie of
Canada than if they came in through the port
of New York or Boston. They will be transported on ourr own ships fýrom Jarnaica,, and
wiîl1 be shipped ovýer our own railways to
censuming points throughou't Canada. To give
some idea cf the increase i11 railway tonnage
which will resuit from the banana trade,
it has been cstimated that to transport bananas
consumed in Canada in one ycar, we shaîl
require flot less than six thousand ordinary
freight cars.
1 cannot sce why there should be an increase
of the price in Canada. When I was in
Jamajica last the price of a buncha or steme of
bananas was Is. 3d., or about thirty cents in
our money. Upon the ste.ms there wouid be
about 120 well matured bananas. This would
miake tihe price paid to the producer in Jamaica
one cent for four bananas. When you consider
the price that is being paid in Canada to-day,
of five, six or seven cents for one banana,
you can, readily see that there is a great spread
between the price paid to the producer and
the price paid by the consumer. This diffcerence
has helped te build up one of the most gigantic
fruit companiýes in the world. I can only hope
that in the future coaasumers in Canada wvill
benefit hy the banana provision of the agree,ment.
We are now putting on new ships; tihre
of them, namely, the Lady Nelson, Lady
Hawkins and Lady Drake, to the Eastern
Islands, are already in service, and the other
two, Lady Rodney and Lady Somers, which
are b-anana boats, are nearing completion.
These shi'ps are not onl'y palatial, but fitted for
this tropical trad.e. They are a credit to
Canada.
I had the ho-nour and pleasure of going from
Halifax te British Guiana in the summer, on
the Lady Nelson when she was making her
initial trip. We ca'lled at Bermuda, St. Kitts,
Nevis, Antigua, Montserrat, Dominica, St.
St. Vincent, Grenýada,
Lucia, Barbadoes,
Trinidad and British Guiana. In aIl those
countries the new ship was hailed with delight,
and it was realized that a new era had dawn.ed
ir the history of these islands of everlastir'g
fertility and eternal sunshine.
We bave the agreement and the ships, but
there is much yet te be done. In ail the islands
there must be better facilities for handling the
goods between the ship and the shore. The

prescrit system is rmuch as it was a hundred
years ago. In ofliy three of the colonies
visitcd docs the Alip lie at the wharf; in other
places she is sometimes anchored out two or
thrce miles fcorn the shore, an'd goods are very
often transported to and lromn the ship in open
boats propelJcd by oars. There is great lack
of cold stocage facilities, and of co-operatiîîn

This brings me, honourable gentlemeon, to

FEBRUARY 12, 1929
powers and the operationa carried on in the
mines and the forests have increased their
wealth in a phenomenal manner.
The mines of British Columbia are most
promising.
The development of our fisheries, which
constitute a great part of our national wealth,
is an important matter. Announcement is
made of the establishment of a new department, whose duty it will be to promote the
interests of this valuable industry.
It is well recognized that no prosperity
quite equals that created by man-power capital. The importance of preserving the lives of
our people is increasingly appreciated. The
establishment of health units in each county
would be a great forward step in the cause
of public health in Canada. The Evenement
newspaper, of Quebec, recently demonstrated
this necessity when it published the surprising
results achieved under the operation of this
system. Briefly stated, the system consists
in the organization in each county of a medical board composed of a medical health officer, a sanitary inspector, two nurses and a
secretary. This board is entrusted with the
task of enforcing health laws, controlling outbreaks of contagious diseases, and carrying on
an intensive educational oampaign on all
health matters.
Already, in Beauce county, where the system has been in operation now almost a year,
thanks to the temporary assistance of the
Rockefeller Institute, some wonderful results
have been recorded. The infantile mortality
rate has been considerably reduced. The death
rate attributable to infectious diseases has
shown a decrease of more than sixty-six per
cent, compared with the death toll from the
same causes the previous year, and the situation that still prevails in the neighbouring
counties, where there are no health units.
The Dominion Board of Health, composed of
the chief medical health officers of each province, with Dr. Amyot, Deputy Minister of
the Federal Health Department, an active
and capable official, as chairman, strongly favours the organization of these health units
as the most economical, expeditious and effective means to spread the knowledge that
will result in stopping the waste of precious
lives, so essential to our country. Financial
co-operation of the Federal Government with
the provinces and the municipalities can ensure the application of this highly important
and much to be desired progressive measure.
Sane immigration is necessary, and one
notes with pleasure that the new inspection
system being carried out in certain parts of

13

Europe by our Canadian doctors, with the
object of making a more careful selection of
prospective immigrants and eliminating individuals who are undesirable from a physical
and moral standpoint, is working efficiently.
One cannot repeat too often or urge too
strongly that the type of citizens our country
needs most are farmers who have made up
their minds to seek their well-being in the
tilling of the soil. We do not need day labourers, who corne here to swell the ranks of the
unemployed or displace our own people in
industry. Every effort should be made to induce our rural citizenry to remain on the
land, where they can lead a healthier and
more profitable existence than they will find
in the cities. Italy offers us an example of
what may be achieved in this respect. Mussolini has decreed that farmers must continue
to till their farms, and that no agriculturist
may take up residence in a city unless he can
prove that a position awaits him.
Here we have a demonstration of what can
be accomplished by an energetic policy, and
the wisdom of this great Italian statesman who
has set himself the task of regenerating his
country. He has added greatly to his renown
by settling that long standing major problem
known as the Roman question. He has restored to the Holy Father that complete independence which he requires in order to
exercise freely his high and exalted function
as chief of the Universal Church.
We note with pleasure that the Government
intends developing still further means of commuaication within and without the country by
helping our railway companies to construct
branch lines and granting subsidies to certain
shipping companies. We shall take the necessary steps to increase our trade development
through the appointment of trade commissioners in various parts of the world where our
country has been hitherto unrepresenited.
These posts offer splendid careers to the
students of our high schools of commerce.
The appointment of ministers plenipotentiary marks an important era in our history.
We shall ienceforth be able to discuss questions directly with the representatives of other
nations and conclude treaties. I may state
that no appointment could have been greeted
with more warm-hearted approval in France
than that of our former colleague, the Hon.
Philippe Roy, who has filled with honour
during a long term of years the post of High
Commissioner. He has by his tact and talents
won the consideration and esteen of the most
eminent men in the country in which he is
serving as our accredited representative. The

SENATE

14

Paris press was unanimous in congratulating
our Government upon this judicious appointment.
France has sent us, in the person of M.
Jean Knight, a diplomat of the highest distinction. J have not the least doubt that,
with such able men acting as intermediaries,
the two
the relations existing between
countries will always be most satisfactory.
The Speech from the Throne inforns us
that the treaty to renounce war, signed on
behîalf of Canada on August 27, will be submitted for our examination. I may state in
advance that the pact will be approved as
heartily as we shall give approval to any
other movement aiming to secure universal
peace, so essential to the welfarc and happiness of mankind.
In conclusion, may I be allowed to express
mv sincere wislies for the complete recex cry
of His Majesty the King, and the hope that
he may long be spared to continue his reign,
which lias boen tiarked by so much wisdomî
and devotion.

THE GOVERNOR
ADDRESS

GENERAL'S SPEECH
IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the opening cf the
Session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Logan
for an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
gentlemen, in resuming the debate I promise
you that I shall net be very long. It has
been my humble opinion, for a considerable
time, in any event, that any measure to be
submitted to the House can be more adequately and properly discussed when it is
Hon. Mr. TESSIER.

actually laid before us. I have no desire
to attempt to shine as an orator in making a
general statement as to any of these matters,
but I will deal with a few of them now, and
as particular measures are brought before us
for actual legislation, or the reverse, I shall
crave the indulgence of the House while I
discuss them, if not adequately, at least at
some length.
However, it is a courtesy perhaps due to
the House to refer to some of the questions
mentioned in the Speech from the Throne
and in the speech of the mover of the Address
in reply; and I hope that some of the
honourable gentlemen who sit behind me will,
if they sec fit, deal with matters on which I
shall not touch.
The first question mentioned in the Speech
from the Throne to which I shall make reference is the construction of the National
Research Laboratories. I am now, and I was
when the matter came before us some years
ago, in favour of a generous expenditure of
money for the development and encouragenient of scientific research. We in Canada
are becoming more and more industrializcd,
and the indications are that in the proximate
future that development will be accentuated
froin year to ycar. W hen we were net so
miuch engaged in manufacturing, the necd
for scientific research on the part of the Governmîicent was not so pressing. In the meantime nany of the large institutions have
provided facilities for scientific research in
their own laboratories. The Department of
Agriculture has aiready donc much in the
matter of purely scientific research. Perhaps
it lias gone as far as any institution in this
respect.
I thinlk that this Government, and in fact all
Government.s in Canada, should recognize
agriculture as the most important industry in
the whole country.
It is a basic industry.
The necessity of scientific research in connection with agriculture has been growing
stronger every year.
In two or three fields
at the present time the Governments of the
Provinces, or the Governnent of the Domîîinion, are rendering valuable assistance. The
(e'crnment
at Ottawa bas done splendid
wvork, from a scientific point of view.
It is
now a commonplace te say that Western Canada and the whole country were enriched by
the magnificent discovery of Mairquis wheat
by Dr. Saunders.
In the universities of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, by a coordination of effort, an attempt is now being
made to solve some very grave difficulties met
with in the growing of grain in the West.
One of the outstanding problems is that of
rust; and another is the developing of earlier

FEBRUARY 13, 1929
ripening kinds of wheat. Progress has been
made. Since the discovery of Marquis wheat
the Depart.ment of Agriculture has developed
a variety which ripens a .ittle earlier than the
Marquis. The best brains in the Department
are now engaged in attempting to discover
other varieties of wheat that are not only
earlier in maturing, but more likely to make
a good return. Any scientific problem to be
solved must be attacked from many sides.
One might discover a method of avoiding
rust, but that method might have the effect of
weakening the plant. The vigour of the plant
life must be preserved, yield must not be
lessened, and the grain must be able to stand
up under adverse weather conditions. These
are a few of the things that have to be considered in agricultural experiments.
I hope that through the efforts of our various colleges and the opportunities that the
Government can make available a field will
be opened in our own country for Canadian
experts, so that they may not find it necessary
to emigrate to the United States for employment.
I want te deal also with the question of
the W.est Indian Treaty, because it was referred to at some length in the Speech from
the Throne, and also by the mover of the
Address in reply. I have no special knowledge on that matter, but, if it is not considered too personal, I may say that I know
a little from having travelled through the
West Indi-es some ten years ago. I tried to
go via Halifax, but as the war was in progress,
the ship on which I had obtained passage
I went by one of the
was commandeered.
Quebec Steamship Company's vessels from
New York, and travelled over nearly all the
territory which would be affected by the West
Indian Treaty save Jamaica only; and I returned via Halifax, on one of the boats of
the Royal Mail Steamship Company.
I found during my little holiday in the West
Indies a very keen desire on the part of the
people to increase commercial relations with
Canada. The people, on the whole, were intensely British; they did not want to be
Americanized, as far as I could gather from
Their products, as
my talks with them.
everybody knows, are entirely different from
ours, and they are large consumers of many of
our products of which we have a surplus for
export.
Abthough the two lines of service have not
yet been established, I am glad to see that
the partial carrying out of the Treaty bas
already developed the trade both in exports
from Canada and imports from the West
Indies. I, as a Westerner, living out, as

15

some of you may think, on the bleak prairies,
know that in the aggregate there are very
large numbers who go from Western Canada
to California in the winter. Some go every
winter, or periodically, every two or three
years, and thus go many times. They leave
our country and spend their money abroad.
I have not compared the distances, but it is
a very long way from the middle of Saskatchewan to Los Angeles, which seems to be the
haven that many seek, and I think it would
not take much longer to go to the West
Indies. I imagine that if the people from
Western Canada and those from the older
portions of the Dominion who desired a
change of atmosphere and surroundings were
to visit the West Indies, a very considerable
passenger traffic would be developed and trade
might be cultivated. I have holidayed in Los
Angeles, but I have had no enjoyment there
to compare with that whieh I had in the West
Indies. I hope that when we get the other
ships going, on the western coast, there will
always be " bananas to-day." I have no doubt
that if we can bring them in commercially,
in the way that bas been suggested by the
mover of the Address, with satisfactory arrangements as to the freight rates, and as
to the cost at which they can be purchased
and the price at which they can be sold, that
.
trade should develop in Canada.
It is an absurdity to think that that trade
should go through New York, when the distances to our great markets are no shorter
by the New York route, and there is perhap5
an even greater desire in northern latitudes
for the fruit. New York and other ports in
the United States have access to many other
markets, such as their own islands, and all
Central America. It is due, I think, to the
wonderful energy and the magnificent resources of the Union Fruit Company in New
York that they have been able to exploit
the West Indies market to our disadvantage.
I have, therefore, no criticism individually
to offer on the Treaty with the West Indies.
It is, in any event, on the right lines. I am
not in a position to say whether we did or
did not pay too much for a fleet of five
vessels-I think the number is five-for the
purposes of the West Indian trade. Those
honourable members who are familiar with
navigation and shipping are in a better position than I to pass judgment on that. I
assume, in any event, that the Government
is going to have those ships construoted as
quickly as possible and to see that they are
of adequate dimensions for the purposes of
the trade.

FEBRUARY 13, 1929
Then J notice that ýthere is a change or
addition proposed in the duties of the Railway Commission; but until I know what the
concrete measure is J am going to refrain
from any comment at all upon it.
Another subject that is referred to in the
Speech from the Throne is the return to the
Prairie Provinces of their natural resources.
A Commission is at present sitting for the
purpose of investigating the terms as between
Manitoba and the Dominion Government.
In view of the fact that, technically speaking,
the matter is now in the hands of the law,
I think it would be perhaps improper for me,
as a member of this House, to enter upon a
subject that is being inquired into before the
Commission. Any of the members on my
side of the House, for whom only I speak,
may discuss the matter if he is so minded,
and I have nothing to object to in that respect; and anybody inside this Chamber
who has any views to present may introduce
them, and his doing so will not by any
means hurt me.
It is indicated, also, that the Province of
is renewing negotiations. I
Saskatchewan
lived in that province for a considerable
number of years before autonomy was
granted. When I went west I did run unsuccessfully in an election for the other
House, and in my own mind I disclaimed
any intention of ever being interested in
polities again. I kept that resolution until
1912, which was not perhaps doing too badly.
The question of autonomy became very acute
in my comparatively early days in the West.
When the Autonomy Bill was brought in I
was of opinion-and I am still-that the
Dominion of Canada should not have passed
that Bill in the form in which it was passed.
I have always thought that the Dominion
should deal with the natural resources of all
the Prairie Provinces merely as a trustee,
with the right of administering those resources during the early development stages,
and that when the Provinces were ready to
set up housekeeping on their own account
they should be given all the resources
absolutely. It may or may not have been
necessary to make some kind of monetary
arrangement to enable them to carry on in
the early days, but I do not think that the
British North America Act ever contemplated
two kinds of provinces in Canada-the landless province and the province of the reverse
kind. All the old provinces got their natural
resources.
I do net think that the Dominion Government, in the ordinary sense, bought the lands
from the Hudson Bay Company. When the
rebellion broke out in the Northwest it be-

17

came necessary to make some settlement so
as to bring peace and order into that country,
and obtain the surrender of the charter of
the Hudson Bay Company; but it was surrendered to the Crown in England, and all
that the Government at Ottawa did was to
pay $1,500,000. Some people said ,that Canada
had 'bought all the lands in that territory
and had the right to do with them what it
liked. On legal and constitutional grounds
I differ absolutely from that view. The matter
will be up for discussion again, but I do
not think it will be brought into this House
until some arrangement is made. These are
my individual views, and I am not going to
enlarge on them, but anyone who was interested in knowing them could have had
then at any time. They are also the views
of a very large number of people in the West,
including the most distinguished public man
ever on the Prairies, the present Chief Justice
of Saskatchewan, Sir Frederick Haultain.
As we all know, the Province of Alberta
had been negotiating for the transfer to it
of territories and other lands on conditions
to be mutually arranged.
Constitutionally
and legally I would say that its position is
exactly the same as ýthat of Saskatchewan.
There is now a resumption of the negotiations
begun some time ago, and therefore I am net
going to comment on ,theqn, for the same
reason that I do net comment in the case
of Manitoba.
The honourable gentleman who moved the
Address (Hon. H. J. Logan) enjoys a reputation as a distinguished speaker and statesman
that was well known to me, although I never
had the pleasure of meeting him before he
spoke in this House. He has sustained the
reputation that he won as a leading member
of the other House, and I am sure he will be
an adornment to this Chamber. He was well
known in .the West as one of the fighting
brigade, shall I say, and a leading public man
on the Liberal side in Nova Scotia.
Then an old friend of mine in this House
(Hon. Mr. Tessier) followed him, and seconded the Address. As to this, may I say
a few words in French?
(Translation) I
desire to felicitate in his own language the
seconder of the motion for the Address. The
honourable Senator from De la Durantaye
(Hon. Mr. Tessier) is an old parliamentarian, a
distinguished jurist. a journalist accustomed to
enter the lists. His words are always listened
to in this Chamber will all the respect due
to sincere conviction, especially when expressed by a veteran in political combat. I
cannot subscribe to all that he bas said, and
I shall have occasion to deal, in my own
languagé, with some of the questions to whioh

FEPBRUARY 13, 1929
gentlemen will remember that we were se
fearful of the difficulties confronting the
Canadian National Railways that a Committee of the Senate was appointed te examine
into the problem. The Canadian National
had a very large deficit and we were wondering hew the situation could he remedicd.
That Committee sat for a f ew weeks and
heard the he-ads of our banking system. and of
our railways, and other prominent citizens,
problem.
effort te reach
in an were strongly a solution of thethe stateimpressed by
We
ment that there was net enough traffie in
the West, if it were equally divided betwecn
the twe railway systems, te permit either of
themn to meet its obligations. The suggestion
was made that we should try to bring tbema
both under a single administration, without
merging the two systems, euch .maintaining
its separate entity, and this was the unanimous resolution of this Chamber, based on the
conviction that cempetition between themn
would be minous, as there was net sufficient
frcigbt to maintain the two systems in a
healthy condition. That was in April, 1925.
What do we now find to be the case? We
find that the pessimnism. which prevailed four
years ago was net justified.
The remedy whichb was then proposed would
perbaps have given very satisfactory results.
I do net mean te criticize the opinions wbich
we sought and which. we sharcd at the time.
Three or four years have passed and we sec
that there is enough trade net only to maintain those twe railways, but to bring large
returns to their treasuries. What has bnppened during the last three years is an indicatien that the most optimistic dreams for the
future of -Canada are quite within the bounds
of realization.
Many times of late the statement bas been
made that aîl that Canada needs to increase
ber prosperity is immigration. This situation
bas presented itself te many minds from many
angles. Complaints have been heard frem
seme quarters that the British immigrant is
net coming in sufficient numibers, that the
foreign edement is cemning in tee great numbers; and question bas arisen as to the needs
of the rural parts of the country on the one
aide, and the cities on .the other. Tbe problem
thus presented is net an easy one te solve.
The Çlovernment at the -helm in Ottawa bas
te turn towards the provinces te ascertain
their needs, and te a large extent bas te
folIow tbc advicc of their gevernments. The
Government bas te sce that immigrants are
net brought in in such numibers that tbey
flow baeck from the rural sections inte tbc
tewns; a constant watch must be kept that
78800-2,j

the needs of the country may 'be met as they
appear. I arn quite sure that this wiIl always
be a matter of controversy, because the needs
of the rural sections are flot the neecLs of the
urban centres.
I have been struck repeatedly by the statement that we are flot, making ail the efforts
necessary to get British immigrants. On the
other hand the statement bas been made
that we are spending sixteen dollars for every
British immigrant to Canada, as compared,
with eleven cents for every foreigner whoý
reaches our shore. During 1928 there wvas a
total immigration into Canada of 166,782
people. 0f that number 55,848 came from
the United Kingdom, and 29,933 from the.
United States. 7i have examined inte the
racial origin of the immigrants whe came to us
from the United States during 19R27 and 1928,
and I have found that a little over 50 per
cent of themn were of British origin. So, in
order to obtain a true estimate of the British
stock that is coming to us, one must include
in bthe British quota that 50 per cent who
crossed the line from. the soutb. SRne of
those people had been one or two generations
on the other side, but they were aIl of the
British family and of British stock.
The statement bas frequently been made
that we have cxerted ourselves to bring immigrants to this country simply to replace Canadian stock which, has gune te the United
States. I flnd 'that this statement is not
exact'ly in accord with the records of the
Immigration Departîment. A statement from
the Minister of Immigration shows that from
1011 to 1921 the total immigration to Canada
was 1,780,868, whi-le the census of 1921 shows
a total foreign-born population in Canada of
onily 368,775. Apparently over 1,000,000 had
left the couttry between 1911 and 1921.
Hon. Mr. MdMEANS: Did those millions
of immigrants that left the country cost us
$16 a head?
My hope is
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
that further inquiry would show that those
who cost 1~1cents per head were the ones
who had been attracted. to the other aide, and
that those who remained were mostly
Britishers who feit more at home amongst
their brethren on this side of the line.
It is interesting te find that it is far from
the reality that the immigrants who came
bore bad simply taken the place of goodl
Canadians who had crossed over to the other
side. It appears from the statemýent which
I have just made that only a very small,
proportion of those wbo joined the procession southward were Canadians.

affaira cf Canada now for seven years, and

FEBRUARY 13, 1929
I think an observation, in passing, as to the
net resuits accruing thus far miglit be of some
interest.
I point to the fact that Canada's net débt
at March 31, 1928, was $2,296,000,000, a. decraeof $50,984,000 as compared with the
year before. But, while we reduced the
national mortgage to that extent, we gave a
second mortgage of $65,000,000 by way of
guaranteed bond issues for the National Railways account. So the, net performance of the
nation was actually a loss or deficit of
$15,000,000 for the year.
Let us apply the same yardstick over a
wider field and over a longer period, in order,
as I Say, to have a fairer conception of the
accomplishment of the administration. It is
to be remembered that the national net debt
of Canada at Mardi 31, 192, was 82.340000,000 and that at Mardi 31, 1928, six ycars
later, it was $2,296,WOOPO; a decrease of
M4,000,000 în those six years. The figures for
192'2 may lie verifled by reference to page
2107 -of Hansard of that year. Du.ring thc
latter part of that period there were annual
decreases, and during the first part, annual
inierealses, in fhe national debt. But the net
resuit is that over the period from 1922 to
1928, inclusive, the decrease in the national
dcbt, according ,to the ýGovernment's own
statements, lias been $44,000,000.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Do you include the
guarantecd bonds in that amount?

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Those bonds werc
guaran-teed on railways account to the amount
of $253,279,000, as shown in the Railways
Report which. was put into the hands of
members a coupleof days ago. So during thýat
entire period there lias been wiped off $44,-

000,000) net frorn fhe first mortgagc on the
State, and there has been added to its obligations, as a seeond mortgage, by way of
guaranteed bonds, the sum of $=5,279,000.

Thus. the deficit for that entire period on
account of all our national undertakings, for
which the country is responsible, is $209,000,000.
This lias occurred during the time of so-called
national prosperity.
Hon. Mr. BELCiOURT: Does my honouraile friend include the gu'arantced bonds in
arriving at this result? Are not the bonds
includcd in the calculations he lias made? My

honouraile f.riend lias in-eluded the guarantecd
bonds as actual obligations, notwithstanding
his statement to the contrary.

Honý. Mr. ROBERTSON: 1 mnost assuredly
do regard this as an obligation undertaken by
the Government of Canada. It is an obligat ion
to meet that guarantce, if neccssry.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is not a debt.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Oh, 1 sec. A note
is not a debt, yoà say.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: If it replaeed
another note, it would flot inerease the debt,

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Tuoening to another
su-bjeet, Canada's trade, we aIl recognize the
fact that there bas been an expansion in our
trade, and we ýaIl rejoice in that. But I wonder
if the so-callcd unprecedented prosperity of
1927 and 1928, which is under discussion, is
clearly understood. I wonder if honourable
gentlemen ahl appreciate -the fact that our
exports for the fiscal yea.r 1927 were $1,267,573,000, and for 1928, $1,250,456,000, a decrease
of $17,117,000. Du-ring thc fiscal year 1927 wc
imported from ftreign countries $1,030,892,000,
worth nif gonds, while the total for 1928 wvas,
$1 .108,956,000, an incresise of $78,064,000.

Wlien we realize that for the year 1922 our
total' imports were $740,000,000, that they had
increased in 1928 by almost 8400,000,000, and

that our exports did not inerease in thc ýname
proportion, we are not likely to be carried away
with thc hallucination
of unprecedcnted
prosperity.
The fav-ourable trade balance of Canada in
1927 was $236.68M1.000, and in 1928, $141,500,000,
a decrease of 89j5,181,000.
That decrease
occurred notwithistanding the tact that diiring
the samne year our wheat exports increased by

846,000,000 over those for the preceding year.

Now, I thiri,
that we an conmprehiend the
real situation by surnming ttp a few of the
main ýfacts regarding exports and imtports. We
are told in the report of the pluesident of one
of our large-st banks, one ni the most re-liable
institutions in Canada, that during thie fiscal
year 1928 our exports of cattie, particularly
miloli *cows, practilcally doiibled, but owing to
the sale of those cows our exports of butter
and chee.se were largely dccrea.sed. At flic
sanie time, our butter im~ports, partioularly,
froni New Zealand, were grcatly increased.
He states t.hat hani and bacon exports continued to decline, to the extent ni a deorease
ni 5-ý millions nf dollars as comparcd with
1927; anid the exports oi farmi imp1cmcnts decreased in 192, as compared with 1927, by
3j millions oi dollars, whilc the imiports incrcascd by 15J millions ni dollars.
1 -mention these things, honouraible gentlemen, to bring home the fa.et ühat if eur imaports oi manufaeturcd gnods continue to incre-ase whilc our exports oi thera axe decreasing, wc eannot absori tic labour ef Canada,
let allone tliat of tic immigrants who arc

Again. of flic nearly haîf a million eimployees in manufactýuring industries in Canada,
23 per' cent are women and girls. We find
tha[t the bcads of faînilies are being gradually
crowded out of employaient, while t.heir places
are- being taken by those who have not the
sanie responsibilities.
I think it is therefore cîcar that the manufactîîring industry is flot absorbing, and
conseqîîently' is not requiring, vcry many immigrants. The fart that ils requirements are
bccoming less and less each year is flot due
f0 a dccrease in the volume of production, for
the figýures show there has been a substanfial

considlers the situat ion why immigration is
more difficuit to obtain and absorb now than
it w-as in 1913 and prior thereto. The adx'ance

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: No; they disapproved cf them ahl hefore that.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The Governmnent
brought down ail the details, with the individual requirements, with a description cf
each branch, and when that was done there
was ne difficulty. They were aili approved cf
when the Senate understood what they were
apprcviflg.
Ncw, with referenoe te transportation, the
transportation companies have made progress
against difficulties, and 1 want te refer te
the Canadian lines cf the Canadian National
Railways. lIn 1922 the gross ea.rnings cf these
Canadiaxi lines were $203,062,000; in 1926 the
wvere $225,547,000, which is the iast officiai1
record that we have fromn the Canada Year
Bock; showing a gress increase in earnings
in those four years of 322,485,000. Their
operating expenses on týheir Canadian linesI am net referring te the United States lines
at ail-mn 1922 were $205,572,000, or two
millions more than their gross receipts, while
in 1926 the operating expenses cf the Canadian hues were $190,173,000, or a decrease of
$15,399,000. That is te say, while the gross
revenues advanced $22,000,000,

the operating

expenses were reduced by $15,000,000, the net
imprevement thus being 338,000,000, on the
Canadian lineo cf the Canadian National
Railways.

That reflects credit upon the management, but I submit it also refiects credit onthe 100,000 employees who served this country
and its people through the immediate opera-

tien of the Canadian National lines. I advance those figures and facts just for the
consideration of honourable gentlemen, lest
they hurriedly conclude that the resuit of
efficient management and operation through

Now may I pass to the question of immigration? Up to 1926 there had corne into
Canada sixice 1897, when officiai figures of
immigration were put on the basis which. has
continued ever since, 4,218,355 immigrants,
an average of 140,612 per year, and the cost
to Canada for the total number averaged
roughly $8.45 per head. But during the period
from 1897 to 1921 the cost per head was only
36.30, and from 1921 to the end of 1926, the
last year for which we have a published officiai
record, the cost was $22.30 per head. Wby
was that? It is ýtrue that the Government
from 1922 onward increased its efforts and
expenditure to get immigrants to corne to this
country, and while the average immigration
over a period of 30 years has been roug.hly
140,000 per year, yet with this redoubled
effort, with more than double the expenditure,
it did flot get as many immigrants.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The cost must be
much more than $22 a head, hecause families
corne in without paying any fares. Families
corne in with children below a certain age,
and somnebody must pay the steamship coinpanies; s0 the cost must be much more than
$22.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: This is the cost
te Canada. Most cf the immigrants paid
their own Lares. But within the Iast couipie
of years we have heard a good deal of comment on the unequal proportion of nonEnglish-speaking immigrants coming te Canada. If I were to offer any comment with
refereýnce te t.he recent action and policy of
the Minister of Immigration it wouýld be te
commenýd it.
In 1919 there came into Canada 57,700 immigrants and in the next year 117,336. In
1919 there came fromn seven central European
countries 108 immigrants, and in 1920 from
those samne seven countries we received 208;
the total being one-'fifth of one per cent cf
the total immigration in those respective

the j1oint effort of management and men resuilted only fro.m Government action, which.
I humbly submit was net the case.
May I further point out, in conneotion with
transportation, that in 1920 there were 185,177 years.
In 1926 we had a total immigration of
permanent employees on the Canadian National railways, with a total pay-roli cf 96,064, and from those samne seven countries
$290,510,518, and in 1926 there were 174,266 28,497. In other words, 31 peir cent of t.he
employees, with a total pay-roll cf $253,412,- total immigration we received came from
English is
424; sO there wvas a decrease in the naumber countries where net ene word cf
spoken or understood by the people. lIn 1927,
of employees in steam railway transportation,
was the situation broýught before
over that period cf six years, cf 10,911 men, sa vi-vidly that the Minister of Immigration
the country
with a decrease in the pay-roll exceeding
took action. In 1927, eut of a total imimi$37,000,000. Transportation, like manufactur- gration of 143,991, tlie number of 51,2S3, or

FEBRUARY 13, 1929
Hon. Mr. HAYDON: A few years ago the
United States established a Commission to
inquire into the immigration situation. That
Commission produced a report stating that
40 per cent of those who came to the shores
of the United States did not stay in that
country, but went elsewhere. If that was truc
there, how does my honourable friend say
that the theory he supports is applicable to
a comparable situation in Canada?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: What that meane,
I suppose, is that owing to a peculiar situation
in the United States 40 per cent of the immigrants to that country do not remain. The
honourable gentleman asks, "Why should not
a similar condition prevail in Canada?" My
answer is that all our emigrants take the
same road. Dees the honourable gentleman
understand?
Hon. Mr. HAYDON: No.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Just a moment. If
immigrants that come into the United
States go out again, they leave by many different roads; certainly they do not all go to
Mexico, and I am sure they do not all come
to Canada. A poor man who comes from
Europe-an Italian, for instance-lives in the
United States for a time and when he has
made sone money he goes back home to
spend the rest of his life there without having
to work. The situation in Canada is not
comparable. Every man who leaves this
country takes the same road; he is attracted
in the same direction, and is urged by the
same reason. What is the use of denying it?
Hon. Mr. HAYDON: Why do they not
stay in the country that has made them rich
with its protective tariff?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The point I am
trying te make is this. While we have always
suffered by reason of the tremendous attraction exerted by the United States, never has
that attraction been such a scourge to this
country as it has been under the present
administration. The people are going out of
this country in the sane ratio as the tariff
protecting industry is reduced. And will any
man of business, any man who knows the
industrial or financial life of the States and
Canada, deny that it is true that our Canadians go to look for work in the Unilted
States? Does any sensible man think that a
Canadian would leave this country and seek
work elsewhere if ho could find it at borne?
Why should he abandon his own home, his
own family, his own friends, and finally his
own country, and set out for a country in

which he is a stranger, without family and
friends, and must perforce strike out anew
in life?
I shall come in a moment to the honourable gentleman from Lanark (Hon. Mr.
Haydon). I intend to discuss a little a subject which I think is his specialty.
There is no doubt a great wave of prosperity in this country, but we are still bleeding
to the extent of losing 75,000 Canadians
annually-75,000 who were born in this country, not Englishmen, or Scotchmen, or people
from any other country who have migrated
here. When people who have come to our
country leave for other parts later, they are
listed as emigrants from their country of
crigin. But 75,000 native-born Canadians
went to the United States last year.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: How many have
returned during the year?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I was coming to
that. Whenever we say that our country is
losing much of its best blood to the United
States my honourable friends across the House
invariably point to the number of Canadians
who are returning from the United States.
In 1924 we in this House had to compare
statistics from the United States Bureau of
Statistics with those of our own country, and
we found, unfortunately, that very many
Canadians who passed through the turnstile
into the United States left no mark as they
went by. They had gone south, but there was
no trace -of them in the statisties prepared at
Washington. To-day Canadians have a reason
for refraining from announcing their departure
for the United States, in the fact that they
may thus be able to avoid the head tax that
is required of thern when they cross the frontier.
Why should statistics from the United States
be truer to-day than they were in 1924? They
are not. At the bottom of the page of the
Washington statistics with regard to immigration from Canada there is a note which says
that the figures therein stated must be increased by at least 25 per cent, to take care
of the number who crossed the border without
being detected.
Is it not possible for the Government to
recognize that if we are to deal like business
men and patriotie citizens with the entire
question of population, not only with emigration and immigration, there is one thing
we must do: we must make this a land in
which our own children will stay. How can
you reasonably expect that strangers, who are
not attached to the land, will stay here when
our own children are obliged to go? Is it
reasonable?

FEBRUARY 13, 1929
You are now face to face with the energetic
and legitimate protest of the Province of
Qu'ebec. You have waived aside the honest
protection that the Senate gave you at the
risk of its own reputation. Now fight it out
witli the people of the Province of Quebec.
1 have the honour to present to you the
arguments of Hon. Mr. Taschereau and Hon.
Mr. David, t'wo great political leaders of my
province, and, 1 'believe, tw.o very respectable
friends of the honourable leader of the Governiment in this flouse.
You will have to
fight it out with the Provice of Quebeo,
and you ivili have to bear the responsibility
of a law which is unjust, impracticable, and,
besides, anti-social.
We ventured in Vhis bouse *ast year, 1
think, and the year before, Vo draw the attention of the Government Vo the very dangerous
propaganda ,oarried on by Communists in this
country. We ventured to submit to, the Government a petition signed, by no less -respectable a body than thje Catholie Woinen's
League of the Dominion of Canada. What
did they ask? Simply that we should expel
from Canada those men who are paid by a
foreign country for the dastardly purpose of
improperly influencing tlie minds of immigrants. But what lias been donc? Nothing.
Worse than nothing, I might say. I do not
sec the honourable gentleman from Lanark
(Hon. Mr. ilsydon). But lie rose in his place
in the Senate last y.ear and made a. very
pretty speech; lie almost convinced me that
I was wtong. Why, lie said, there was no
Communisrn in this country. He had written
to two of lis friends-one of wliom was an
inspector of sehools in Ontario, and the other
held a position which I cannot remember at
the moment-and botih stated Vhey knew
nothing about Communist propaganda in the
scliools of Canada.
But, honourable gentlemen, what is the
situation? Thc Cliairman of the Board of
Education at Toronto declares there is a most
insidious campaign being waged now by Communists, not only in thc primary sdliools but
in Vhe higli sehools of tliat city. And in
Montreal Communists have attempted Vo distribute Communistic literature for propaganda amongst the school chuldren. Ontario
was forced to take measures to cope witli the
situation. Very energetic steps were taken
flot only in the city of Toronto, but, I understand, in Sudbury, wliere tlie editor of a Red
paper was arrested.
The question that cornes to my mind is,
whîy have not the Governmnent, who have aIl
the power at their beck and cali, removed the
abscess, the centre of pollution and of corruption, in our political body, which breaks

out here and tlhere in masty crulptions? We
have a.skcd. the Govern.ment to take action,
but nothing lias been donc. We have Vold
the Goveroment that there is in this country
a man by the name of Popovitch, wlio, as
cverybody knows, is paid by Moscow to go
about and pervert the minds of people whio
know no Englisli and no Frenchi, and Vo make
thcm Communists according Vo the tenets of
tIc Boîsheviki of Russia. Hie is a source of
great unrest in Vhis country, because, forsooth, where tîcre is any trouble brewing,
the Communist is always Vo be found.
We have told the Government they can
have ail the information tliey want fromn the
Mountcd Police. They have the information,
and I think 1 can say that they have carefully examined it. But why do the Government not expel these black shecp from VhIs
country, where everything is so beautiful,
where cverybody is so prosperous, where law
and order arc rcspectcd-in short, from this
land whicli is becoming, according to some
honourable gentlemen, the Promised Land?
Why is it that we must wait until the poison
lias gone through the social body and been
absorbed and breaks out in festers, hefore any
action is taken? Why? Honourable gentlemen, Canada produces many goods of differcnt kinds, some of which are probably not
equalled anywhere in the world for quality,
but wliat Canada produces lest is lier manh-Àood.
Let us in Vhis flouse forget any
politicail advantages we may have, and agree
on adopting measures Vio preserve the admirable quality of our race in Canada. one
of thc lbest steps we can take is Vo protect Vhis
country from pollution frosn outside elernents.
The second point is that we shoul-d saleguard ly our legislation wia'tever there is in
our customns or ýlaws to fortify and preserve
these good qualities whioh have come down
to us fromn our forefathers, and which we
revere and chenalh. Ais the Government -have
failed in this matter, let t'hcm now repair the
damage donc.
May I in closing remind the honourable
leader of this flouse that with lis extraordinary ability he introduced into this flouse
in 1927 a malodorous subjeet, and prefaced
it with a promise by eaying:
"1We exrpect
shortly to have legislation which will mitigate
and improve thc Bill now laid before, you.
W-e shall look for a systemn whereby old
age pensions, instead of being fed from the
Tre'asury, will be made dependent upon contributions from thoee who ben-efit therefroni."
May I therefore express thc h-ope that the
Govenumenit. having sinned and desiring duly
to repent, will fulfil the promise given to Vhs
flouse.

the Oid Age Pension Act I stated that the
British Parliament had passed sîmilar legisiation, sshich later on had been followed by a

would perhaps follow in the same path. I gave
it as my own opinion that th.e time would
c-orne when the sehemne, broadening out, would
have to rest on a special levy either from the

therefee very pleased te say that se far as
I am concerned, I concur in the ratification of
the Treaty.
Hon. J. D. REID: Honourable gentlemen,
I should like te say a word or two on this
question. Of course I do not raise any objection at all to the development of additional
power at Niagara Falls. I saw the Treaty for
the first time only a few moments ago and
have not had time te study it. But what
I am afraid of is that the Treaty as it now
stands contains a clause which would give
this Board power to say how much water
shall go te the United States, for the present,
and that we may never be able te get it
back. The clause te which I refer is clause 6:
The Board shall have complete supervision
and control over the additional waters permitted to be diverted, with power to diminish
or suspend such additional diversions.
Though I have had no opportunity of conferring with lawyers who understand such
matters, or with others who know more about
this question than I do, I am afraid that this
clause might be interpreted by the United
States Government te mean that if the export of any power is allowed, Parliament by
this Treaty transfers te that Board its right
over export. My judgment is that the Treaty
cannot be construed in that way at all.
We have had treaties pass this House which
have been interpreted in a way that we did
not intend. The Ashburton Treaty specially
mentioned that no obstruction should be
placed in either the north or the south channel
at the Long Sault Rapids without the consent
of both GovernÉments. The time came when
a certain power company wanted te dam the
South Sault in order te obtain more power.
The Dominion Government took issue, claiming that the company had no right whatever
te do that without the Government's consent, and I remember a very strong protest
was made. The International Joint Waterways Commission, composed of three members from the United States and three from
Canada, considered the matter, and one of
our Commissioners voted with the three from
the United States and thus that work was
allowed to proceed.
The United States Government took the
position that in 1909, many years after the
Ashburton Treaty, a Treaty was made which
gave that International Joint Waterways
Commission power to examine into matters
of that kind. We contended that they could

not act without the consent of the Government or Parliament of Canada. When that
Treaty of 1909 was cited, Sir Wilfrid Laurier
was asked whether there could possibly be
put upon it any interpretation that would
give the International Commission power ta
act; whether Parliament had transferred ta
that Commission absolute ,power te deoide
a question of that kind. I well remember
that the position was taken by Sir Wilfrid
Laurier himself, and by his Minister of Railways and Canals, who I think was the right
honourable member for Eganville (Right Hon.
George P. Graham), and others, that there
could be no such interpretation of that clause.
It seemed that that view was probably right,
but the moment this matter came up the
United States Government interpreted the
Treaty te suit themselves, with the result
that the obstruction was placed in the South
Sault rapids. The understanding was that it
might remain for five years, and should then
be removed; but it was not removed at the
end of five years, and it never will be. There
was the result of a clause of the Treaty nott
being sufficiently plain, and thus Canada lost
a right that it had under the Ashburton
Treaty.
The Dominion Government alone has the
right te permit the export of power, but
private corporations who were developing
power in the Province of Ontario-I believe,
at this very point on the Niagara Riverapplied te the Government of the day for
permission te export power temporarily, until
it could be used in that province. Permits
were granted for the -exportation of power,
but for only one year at a time. After a
short period the Province of Ontario was using
all the power available, right up to the limit
of what was being developed, with the exception of what was being exported. Efforts
were made by the Dominion Government
then, and have been renewed from that time
until this, te exercise control; but notwithstanding the fact that power companies had
been allowed te export power only from year
te year, a contract for some fifty years was
given te a power corporation on the United
States side, and they got from Our Canadian
side between 50,000 and 70,000 horse-power
te which we were entitied as the producers
of it.
We were entitled, in addition, te a certain
proportion of the power on the Niagara River,
under a Treaty that had been made, but when
we pressed our claim very hard upon the
United States Government, one of the Washington officials replied that if we eut off power
under that contract, it would be considered

78600-S

SENATE

an unfriendly act, and the result is that we
have not been able to get that power back.
I am not objecting to the further development of power or to the Province of Ontario and
the State of New York getting their respective shares, but if the power is ready to be
delivered to industries that will use it, I wish
to see that there will be no possible danger
of the Treaty being interpreted se as to give
this Board the power to say, without the
consent of Parliament or the Government,
whether or not any more electric power may
be exported. I think we should bc very careful on that point.
I do not know whether the question of the
power to be developed at Niagara Falls came
up in the reference to the Supreme Court,
but whether the power belongs to the Dominion or the Province, I understand the
Dominion bas the right to say whether or
not it may be exported. I believe that the
Government and this Parliament want to
do everything they can to meet the wishes
of the Province of Ontario as to giving them
this extra power, and also as to protecting
the scenic beautics of Niagara Falls. As I
have hurriedly read the Treaty, it says that
at the end of seven years, if the works are
not satisfactory, they are to bu taken away.
Well, we bad one agreement with the Tnited
States which was vitiated by the International
Waterways Commission allowing an obstruction to be built which Parliament said could
not be made, and it strikes me that once these
works are constructed, they will never bu
taken down, if it is to the advantage of the
United States to continue them.
But that is not the main issue.
It is
this: tha-t the Dominion Government and the
Parliament of Canada, and they alone, have
the right to say what power shall or shall not
be exported.
We in the Province of Ontario
are very jealous of our power interests.
I do
net believe there is any difference of opinion
among the Ontario people. We want whatever power is being developed at Niagara
Falls to be used in the Province of Ontario.
We have now a Treaty that gives 60 per
cent of the water-power te us and 40 per cent
to the United States, 'but there is so muclh
of our Canadian power required that we shoild
ect very carefully now. We are taking pOWer
noow into the Province of Ontario from the
Gatineau at probably $15 a horse-power, because we cannot get our rights in regard to
65,000 or 70.000 hor-e-power now exported to
the UniLtd States at $10 a horsepower. Thus
the people of Ontario are paying $5 more per
horse-power to get the power froin the
Gatineau, plus the cost of transmission fron
lion. Mr. REID.

Ottawa to Toronto, all because the agreement
with the United States limiting the export of
power frocm year to year has not been
observed. I fear that this particular clause
of the Treaty could be interpreted by the
United States lilve the one in reference to the
Long Sault.
I am not a lawyer, but I think some legal
gentleman should have had time to look this
over, in order to make sure that any action
taken by the Senate -on the point which I
have raised should be legally sound.
So fat
as the developnent of power is concerned I
have no objection whatever to the Treaty, but
I have cited two or three cases, and I think
others might be mentioned, which would
justify our going slowly in such a matter as
this, because once this Treaty passes both
Houses it cannot be ch.anged.
It may be
very long before another treaty is made, and
there should be no question about the intention and meaning of this one.
I claim that
if the United States Government can in t erpret
this Treaty to the effect that the Board will
have power to dictate to us in regard to
power-and they will carry out what their
power interests over there wish-Canada will
never sec th-at power again.

view taken by the honourable member for
Prescott (Hon. Mr. Reid).
He is referring
to the diversion of power, whereas this Treaty
deals with the diversion of water for the purpose of creating soenic beauty. They are two
entirely different things.
There is not one
word within the four corners of the Treaty
with reference to the diversion of power from
Canada to the United States; but there is a
point that comes to my attention now, and
this is why I rise.
Section 6 of the report
of the Special International Niagara Board,
which is made a part of the Convention, says:
The Board shall have complete supervision
anîd control over the additional waters permuitted to be diverted. with power to dimiinisi
or suspend such additional diversion.

of the diversion as weil. New, is it possible
for this ýsituation to arlise? , Under the Convention as it stands power is taken to divert
10.000 cubie feet per second on each
uide of the clannel, that water to go through
tise works of the existing Electric Commis-ion and the Comspany, and all tie power
resulting therefrom to bu owned respectively

FEBRUARY 14, 1929
by those companies. But is it not possible
under this sectiion that the Board may decide
that 10,000 cubie feet may be taken on one
side and not on the other?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I ask, is it not possible? Is it not possible for the Uni;ted States
te put in there weirs, or dams or other works,
in order to divert water into certain channels to secure the scenie beauty that is required, and that the water may be taken in
such a way and in such places that ït will
be on one side or another of the river?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: My honourable friend
says no; but what reason has he for saying
no?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: What is the good
of making a Treaty if they are going against
it?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The Treaty does not
say explicitly that the saine quantity of water
shai be taken on each side of the river.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Ten thousand and
ten thousand.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: No; it simply says
a maximum of 10,000 cubic feet per second
may be taken on each side of the river. It
does not say it must be. It does net say
that if 5,000 cubie feet are taken on one side,
5,000 must be taken on the other. What it
does say is:
The Board shall have complete supervision
and control over the additional waters permitted to be diverted, with power to diminish
or suspend such additional diversions.
May I ask again, is it possible that such a
condition might arise?
Hon. Mr. REID: By way of an answr-r
te the honourable gentleman, I shall read
clause 6, stopping first at the place where I
think he should have stopped:
The Board shall have. complete supervision
and control over the additional waters permnitted to be diverted ....
Now, if you stop right there-and there is
a comma there-you will see that the Board
has complete supervision and control over
the additional waters permitted te be
diverted. Then it goes on:
-with power to diminieh or suspend such
additional diversions.
I submit that the first part of the clause gives
the Board complete supervision and control
over the additional waters permitted te be
diverted.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That is over the
diversion.
78600-3à

Hon. Mr. REID: The clause gives them
the power to lease it, or expert it, or do as
they like with it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I would draw
the attention of this House te the fact that
these proposed works are to be an experiment,
from which the engineers expect certain results. In order te test the extent te which
water may be diverted it is provided that
during certain months of the year a further
diversion may be made te the right or te the
left. Honourable gentlemen must net forget
that continuously since 1909 there has been
a great diversion on both sides, under the
supervision of the Niagara Board of Centrol,
which has records of the total hourly diversion of water each way.
All the water comes from the same stream.
The works may be modified se as te throw
a little more water on one side than the
other with a view te the beauty of the Falls,
which is the main object, as the honourable
gentleman from Saltecoats (Hon. Mr. Calder)
has said. The purpose of the additional
water is that an experiment may be made.
But that additional water comes from a common source; it does net run on each side
separately. The end in view is a mutually
satisfactory distribution of the water over
each side.
It may be decided after an experiment of
a year or two that seme further weirs should
be put in. But they would not prevent each
country from wiithdrawing 10,000 feet under
the centrol of the Niagara Boaird of Control,
which keeps minute records in order ta see
that the Treaty is lived up te by the two
counItries. The Treaty has been observed
honourably and to the satisfaction of both
countries, and I do not see that by granting
the Board further control of 10,000 oubie feet
per second on each side we are altering in
the least the obligations of its members te
their respective counteies or to the two countries. The Board is composed of twlc Canadians and two Americans; se we are sufficiently protected in equaility of representation.
Under ithese conditions I do not see that
there is any reason te fear that power will
be transported from one side te the ether.
We ail know that under the Treaty of 1909
Canada is allowed 36,000 cubie feet per second,
and the United States 20,000 cubic feet. The
proposal is to add 10,000 cubie feet temporarily for seven years, and during the winter
months only.
We have felt completely protected since
1909 in the administration of the diversion.
Why should we feel differently regardling a
provision that simply wou'ld increase the
ratio?

SENATE

Hon. Mr. REID: I want to say just a few
words in answer to the honourable gentleman. Our action is important not only because of the Treaty itself, but because of
other treaties that may be entered into. Will
the honourable leader of the Government say
that if we make a treaty with the United
States in connection with the water-powers
on the St. Lawrence, as we are likely to do,
he would be satisfied with that particular
clause so far as it specifies those who are to
decide what quantity of power is to be allotted
to this country? Would he be satisfied to
put in the Joint Waterways Commission?
We have had an experience that should
cause us to act carefully in this matter.
There was a dispute in regard te a Treaty
we had with the United States, and that
country's interpretation of it was absolutely
opposed to the interpretation of the Prime
Minister and the Parliaiment of Canada. The
honourable gentleman states that the Treaty
under discussion is to be in effect for only
seven years. Well, the arrangement in connection with the South Sault Dam was to
have expired at the end of five years. Does
the honourable gentleman think that in that
respect we were treated fairly? Should not
the United States Covernment have removed
the obstruction which turned water the other
way, riglit down the Massena Canal, and
diverted a great deal more power? That arrangement, which was to have been effective
for only five years, is still in operation, although it was made probably twelve or fifteen years ago.
Will the honourable leader of the Government in this House say thaýt we have been
treated fairly with regard to the Niagara
River? A Treaty was made between Canada
and the United States by which we were to
have 36,000 cubic feet of water per second,
and they 20,000 cubie feet. Will the honourable gentleman tell this Chamber to-day
that we are getting the power from 36,000
cubie feet? Of course we are not. Why?
Because we allowed some of it to go over
temporarily until our full quantity could be
developed, and the United States Government has made it clear that if we insist on
cutting off that power and using it in the
Province of Ontario it will be regarded as an
unfriendly act. The Treaty that was made in
connection wifth the water power on the
Niagara River at this particular point has
been violated in an outrageous way, in that
the United States Government would not agree
to our cutting off the power that we rerely
leased from year to year. And when we were
consiidering the placing of a tax on export
power it was stated that that too would be
regarded as an unfriendly act. Though the
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

Treaty provides that Canada should get 36,000
cubie feet per second and the United States
20,000 cubie feet, in actual practice the quantities have been reversed and we are getting
now the 20,000 cubie feet. Furthermore, Ontario is losing £5 per horse-power on 60000
or 70,000 horse-power.
For the reasons I have mentioned I say
we should be very careful in dealing with a
clause of this kind, if there is any possibility
of the water heing diverted and our being

power that is being exported from Canada
under contracts made some time ago, from the
quantity we are entitled te under the Treaty,
I think you will find that Canada has been
given all the power allotted to her by the
Treaty. If we are exporting some of this
power, that is net the fault of the United
States.
Hon. Mr. REID: I wish to say that the
Ontario Power Company, a private corporation, and two other companies were given the
right to expert power from year to year only,
right from the start. But they made a contract for fifty years, depending on a yearly
renewal of their permit. Now, the HydroElectrie Power Commission or the Government of Ontario are making an application
for the privilege of exporting that power. Of
course they are. How can they do otherwise,

move in that direction has always been met by

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Honourable
gentlemen will remember that a few years
ago a large deputation came te this House
from Toronto, to oppose the development
by the Federal Government of certain water
powers, one of which was the Carillon. It
was pointed out te them that the HydroElectric Commission was perhaps the largest
exporter of power in the Dominion of Canada.
Mr. Maguire, one of the Ontario HydroElectric Power Commissioners, explained that
the Commission could not do otherwise than
continue to expert the power during the
lifetime of the contracts assumed by the
Commission in the taking over of a private
company.
I wish to point out again that we have
been getting the power to which we are
entitled under the Treaty, but we have been
exporting it back to the United States.
The motion was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I move that a
Message be sent to the House of Commons
to acquaint that House that the Senate has
adopted this resolution and request that House

THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SPEECH
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the . opening of the
Session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Logan
for an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Honourable gentlemen, I waive my right to continue
this discussion, in favour of any honourable
gentleman who desires to speak.
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: Honourable
gentlemen, following the time-honoured practice in this House, I desire to congratulate
the proposer and the seconder of the Address.
The proposer of the Address, the new Senator
from Cumberland (Hon. Mr. Logan), is well
known to Parliament. He has been in and
out of Parliament for the last thirty-three
years. We all know that when he was in his
twenties he successfully contested an election
against -the then Minister of Justice, the
Hon. Mr. Dickie, in 1896. That was a great
victory for so young a: man.
In 1917 I do not believe any other candidate, on either side, was se badly treated as
he was. He had an absolute majority, a large
majority, in his county, but a train from
Seattle stopped in the county at a convenient
station, and a whole trainload of votes was
polled against him. Notwithstanding that,
he still had a majority. Then the free votes
of the Government-if you could call it a
government--came in, box after box of ballots,
and the honourable gentleman was counted
out by the returning officer.
I welcome him to this House. He will be
a valuable addition te our membership. He
is a public spirited man, and if to-day we
are doing a trade with the West Indies it i
largely due to him. I had the pleasure of
being in Bermuda not long ago, and was the
first to tell him that he would be a Senator.
It is something to win a senatorship-the blue
ribbon of Canadian politics. I have been a
Senator for thirty years, and I know from
experience. It is all very well to be a
lieutenant-governor; but even a lieutenantgovernor is apt to find himself out of a job
within five or ten years.
As for the seconder of the Address, the
honourable gentleman from De la Durantaye
(Hon. Mr. Tessier), I do not believe there
is a better loved man in this House. Many
of us have known him for more than half a
century. For 43 consecutive years he has been
a member of the Legislature of Quebec or
of the Senate. It was in 1886, if my memory
serves me rightly, that he was first elected

SENATE
for the old county of Portneuf, where his
electors remained faithful to him until he
was called to the Senate by Sir Wilfrid
Laurier. He occupied no mean position in
the Quebec Legislature, having been for a
long time Speaker of the House.
Now I corme to the leader of the Opposition. As the leader of the Government has
very often said, we oceupy a quasi-judicial
position and there should be no leader of the
Opposition in the Senate.
Of course, when
he said that, there were not very many
members on the Governnent side of the
House. Many good men might have been
chosen as leader of the other side. I think
it might have been a good thing for the
Conservative party to apply the principle
adopted by the Liberal party, of having a
French leader in this House when there is an
English leader in the other House, but if I

The fi-rst thing which comes to my 'attention in the Speech from the Throne, which
does not say very much, is the statement
that we are going to have more railways in
the West. The West is certainly being wel-i
treated, as it always has been well treated,
no matter who has been in power. Ontario
and Quebec always foot the bill, and they
do net get very many railways.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The great metropolis of Canada, the city of Montreal, has no

If you want to get 'to Amos you travel
90 miles east to Hervey Junction, and 90
miles west again to be only opposite to the
city of Montreal.
I believe if I were in another place I would insist upon Quebec getting
more railways.
Honourable gentlemen, are
you aware that in the West there are four
times as many miles of railway per capita as
there are in the Province of Quebec, and two
and a half times as many per capiita as there
are in the Province of Ontario?

They are to carry wheat, the

Pacifie Railway built over a mile of road a
day for every day in the year; during the
same period the Canadian National Railways
built 442 miles of new railroad, not including
the replacement of rails or improvements of
existing roads.
In Canada to-day we have
twice as many miles of railway per capita as
they have in the United States.
In the
United States at the present time they have
240,000 miles of railroads.
You may remark
ilso, honourable gentlemen, that the mileage
in the United ýStates has not been increased
during the past twelve ycars; in fact some of
the railroads there have been scrapped.
In
the United States, with a population of 120,000,000, there are 400 souls per mile of railroad.
When we turn te Canada with its
10,000.000 of people-our population may net

tention to the fact that to-d-ay there are
millions of acres of unoccuipied land ahnost
adjacent to rairoads. Nevertheless, the West
wants railroads; therefore the West must have
them.
Justfhere I should like to quote a f ew lines
fro-m the Drayton-Aeworth Report of 1917.
Sir Henry Drayton at Ot t bime was Chairman of the Board of Railway Commissioners,
and surely sbould have known how many miles
This
of railroad there were in this country.
is what lie says in that report:
We niay put the same thing in another way.
The growth of the mileage has f ar outstripped
the growth of the population. In 1901, with a
population of 5,371.315, Canada had 18,140 miles
of railway in operation; roughly, a mile of
railway for every 300 inhabitants. In 1911 the
population had increased 34 per cent, to
7,206,643That was under the benign reign of Sir
Wilfa'id Laurier.
-while the mileage liad increased by 40 per
cent ta 25,400 miles; a mile of railway to every
284 inhahitants. Since 1911 the population bas,
it is understood, not mucli inereasedThat was under the Government of the
Right Hon. Mr. Borden.
-but the railway mileage open and under construction bas grownu to 40,584 miles. In other
words, Canada bas to-day, taking the present
population as 7,500,000That was in 1917.
-only 185 inhabitants to support each mile of
railway. Taking the four western provinces hy
themselves, there are only two-thirds of that
number for each mile of railroad.
That is 125 persons to support a mile of railway. If you re.duce that population to famil-ies
of five persans, you will see that 25 families
have to keep up one imile of railroad. Yet
on the western plaine tbhey have flot enough
rail ways.
The United States have 400 inhahitants per
mile of huie; the United Kingdom, 2,000;
Russia, 4,000. Even Australia bas 274 inhahitants for each mile of railway; Argentina,
238.
Af ter such a statement as Vhis, there sbould
be no tbought in the mind of anybc'dy that

is believed not only by Conservatives, but by
some Liberals. I hope the statement of Sir
Henry Drayton wbich. I have just read, and
whioh the righ't honourable gentileman fromn
Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham) knos
to be correct, will settle the matter for ail
time. To give you an idea of the situation
in Canada, I may teill yo'u that du-ring 1,928
there was one freiglit car loaded for every
three persons.
Now may 1 refer to government ownersbip? We know that tbhey have government
cwnership in Germany, Italy and France.
We know what a dismal failure government
ownership bas 'been in the UJnited St-ates. We
know the disappointing experience of the
United States with governmen't ownership of
railroads. In that country they loat money
at the rate of $2,000,000 a day, and wheni
government ownership terminated there the
railroads were very much run dow-n and
dilapidated because of lack of maintenance.
I invite honourable gentlemen ýto go to the
library and read any books tbey can find on
government ownership, and if they do so
tbey will learn how -it resulted in defieits
and failure. In this country we are fortunate
indeed; we have a miracle man, Sir Henry
Tbornton, who bas worked wonders witb the
Canadian National Railways. Take for example the old Intercolonial Railway and think
of what it is to-day. I venture to say there
is flot a railroad anywhere in the world that
is hetter equipped and operated than that
road. When You compare its preýsent condition, with its condition in the old days, no

We have heard also about the watered
stock, the capitalization, the general financia
organization, the cost of management; but we
find this:
We have set out figures which show the
capitalization of the Corporation, and we point
out that no dividends have since incorporation
been paid on either the second preference or
common shares; so that so far as the wage f und
is concerned it has not been adversely affected
by this aspect of the financial arrangements of
the operators.
Therefore that loud cry about the watering o
stock is silenced. It might have been a
billion, and it would not have affected the
matter in any way whatever, because there
have never been any dividends paid on it.
Here is another part of the report:
We believe that the steel works operations
have been of very considerable help in the past
ta the proper development of the coal properties, by affording them a market for slack coal.
We believe, furtler, that there is still considerable advantage ta the coal properties--particularly in view of the character of the coalin having a market for the disposal of their
slack, in the immediate neighbourhood. Even
if industrial developments have been such, and
the coking possibilities of the future may be
such, that there is a prospect of a wider field
for the disposal of slack coal than there was in
the past, it will obviously take a considerable
time before those markets can be developed in
such a way as ta enable all or even the greater
portion of the slack coal ta be placed.
Now about accidents. They are less, much
less, than in the United States, but more than
in Great Britain. The report says:
However firmly the law is administered in
regard ta safety, and it should be rigidly administered, there can lbe no doubt that very many
accidents arise from individual disregard and
overlooking of the ordinary canons of safety
ta himself and others.
I like that word "canon"; it is a new word
ta me in that connection. I may say that
this Dominion Iron & Steel Company is now
in the hands of a receiver, following the
unanimous report by this Royal Commission.

SENATE

The existing conditions certainly constitute an
unfair discrimination against Nova Scotia coal

that millions of dollars have been paid into the
Dominion treasury in that way at ports far
removed from the steel ports themsedves; and
in considering what the Governient have received in return for the bounties, it would be
well to bear that in mind.
Honourable gentlemen will remember that
I am not saying this. Mr. Fielding continued:
Bounties Developed Industrial Expansion
But suppose we put that aside. Let us look

and coke.

The payment of such a bounty would undoubtedly stimulate the coal and ihon and steel
business and this would have such a beneficiai
effect urpon trade generaIly that the revenues

of the Government would be increased by an
amount much larger than would be required to
pay the bounty.
This would only bc a repetition of past experience, whieh is generally a very good guide.

at the condition of the revenue at the steel

Now, what did Hon. W. S. Fielding say il
another place? He said:
Revenue Growth Resulting fron Bounties
In this connection, I would like to invite the
attention of the
ouse to the question of what
these bounties have accomplished. I know that
with some excellent citizens of Canada the idea
of bounties is not popular. More than once 1
have met people of the very best class who
shake their heads over the idea.
I think,

however, that it can be clearly shown that the
treasury of Canada has not lost one dollar
from the payment of bounties. The iron and
steel industries which have been established
in the .country have undoubtedly had a great

effect in the develotpment of the trade in Canada. Just how far the influence of a steel industry is felt may be a matter of debate. 1
have no doubt that honourable gentlemen have
found many cases where business has been influenced favo-urably a long distance from the

location of an iron and steel plant; I have
found such cases nyself; and it must be remembered that in ail the principal! trade centres
of Canada vast quantities of goods have been
purchased and sold to these steel ports, as i
may describe them.
The cities of Toronto, Montreal, Quebec,
Halifax and Saint John will ail testify that
their merchants have sold great quantities of
goods to these steel making ports. The duties
on these goods have been paid at Toronto, Montreal, Quebec, Halifax and Saint John, as the
case may be. It is not possible to measure
just what these duties have amounted to, but
they woudd not have been paid if there had not
been the consumers of these goods at the steel
ports. I do not think it is too much to say

ports themselves.

directly to the developmuent of the iron and steel
industry.

Every one of these communities was

a small conmunity before the steel business
began; every one lias grown to be a large and
important commnunity under the influence and
developnent of the iron and steel business.
Here follows a table giving the details.
With the permission of the House I will put

1899, a period during which sorne steel bounties
were paid, but during which the industry was
in its infancy, and not very miich progress had
been made, except at New Glasgow, and even
at that period New Glasgowv had contributed
very largely to the revenue by reason of her
steel operations. We compare that period of

Board on Tariff and Taxation, November 27,
28, and 29, 1928:
The combined industries as represened by
the British Empire Steel Corporation employed
d.uring 1927 an average of 20,124 wo'rkers,
dr.ain $24,400,000 in wages and salaries.
Worker numbering 18,000 were employed in
Nova Scotia and received wageo and salaries
to the amount of $22.200,000. It has been
estimated on this basis that a.bout a sixth of
the population of Nova Scotia was directly
dependent on steel and coal industries of that
Province in addition to the Iafige nunuber who
directly derive their liveidihood from these lndustries.
At a time when the Progressives were alIpowerful in another place, their leader, Hon.
Mr. Forke, said, " I amn not in favour of protection, but I understand that the coal la
very liard to get and when you do get it
it is not of the very best quaiity?" When
nearly one-quarter of the population of Nova
Scotia depend on those industries for a living,
what are we to do? Let them starve?
The importance of the industry may also lie
judged by the fact that when it is working in
full force it employa 23,000 workers, whose
wages mean $24,000,000 a year.
I see the honourable gentleman froan
Nipîssing (Hon. Mr. Gordon). He may be
surprised to hear that 40,000,000 feet of lumber were used for pit props alone. How
many milîs ea.st of the Rockies cut more than
40 millions?
Then, they have 500 Miles Of railway. Their
railway is the third largeât ini the country,
next after the Canadian National Railways
and the Canadian Pacific Railway. A large
number of men are emjpîoyed in operating
and maintaining this railway. And this company pays in royalties to the Nova Scotia
Governiment the su.m of $628,000 annuallya large proportion of the provincial revenue
of Nova Seotia.
Nothing has been donc on the firet Duncan
report, and foliowing the second report there
has been a reduction of rates on railways.
I now ask honourable gentlemen to consider
what would happen to, a quarter of the wage
earners of Nova Scotia if, perchance, this
great concern were forced to suspend business.
Those wage camnera could not possibly exist

43

in Nova Scotia and they would have to leave
the province. What would be the effect on
that province if one-quarter of its population
lef t there? If sucli an exodus should happen
through any iack of wiilingness or attention
on the part of 'the Government, then the
Government would have to take the responsibiiity.
I desire now to mention ano-ther subject,
the recent judgment of the Supreme Court
concerning rights in the water. The h-onourable gentleman from Hamilton (Hon. Mr.
Lynch-Staunto'n) posseesff a good share of
that Hibernian intellect whic-h 1,100 years ago
was shining so. brightly in Ireiand, when ail
the universities of Europe were supplied with
professors from the Emerald Isle. He is an
able counsel, and for six monbths was retained
by the Ontario Governiment to diagnose and
study the question, who owned the water in
Canada. Hone'urable gentlemen will remember that he aloine diagnosed the case in regard to the St. Lawrenice River Ship Canal,
when lie located the whole case be-tween
Prescoît and Montreal, a distance of 120
miles. The wççhole question was the difference
in freiglit in these 120 miles. In the case
submitted to, the Supreme Court oniy one
question was necessary: "Who owns the
water?" That is the only question that any
tribunal should be caiied- upon to dçcide.
A very important personage was surprised
when he read the judgment of the Supreme
Court. Someone said to him, "Sureiy, in your
exalted position, you had some inkling of
what the judgment wouid lie?" This gentlieman of very high position replied, "No, I had
no înkling before, and I have no in'kiing af-ter
having rea-d the judgment."
The judges of the Supreme Court, the six
or seven of them, are iosing their time in
Canada. They should go to the League of
Nations at Geneva. After hearing the case
argued for three weeks by the very best legal
talent that Canada possesses, and then deliberating for three or f our months, they
finaliy came to the conclusion that they were
unable to corne to any conclusion.
I was toid by an eminent lawyer, a K.C.,
in Quebec on Tuesday evening, that the notes
od the Court go very mucli farther than the
judgment, in favour of the provinces. Why
shouid not the Federai and Provincial Governments corne to a conclusion on this matter
and stop further useless litigation?
I should like to put on Hansard a few remarks coneerning the new statua of Canada.
The matter to which I amn about to make
reference is a statement that was made *by
Sir Robert Horne in the presence of at lest
two honourable members of the Senate, the

44

SENATE

honourable gentleman from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Belcourt) and the honourable gentleman
from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien).
I
think the honourable leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Willoughby) was present also.
Sir Robert Horne gave an example of bis
good sense at the meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union at Washington in 1925. Mr.
Thomas Johnson, of the Irish Free State, had
proposed that in case of Great Britain becoming involved in war the other nations
would agree to consider the British Dominions
as neutral territory and not attack them. Sir
Robert said that would be a very convenient
arrangement for Great Britain, as it would
leave them that much less territory to protect, but be could not imagine any belligerent state which happencd to be in hostilities
with Britain at the time agreoeing to a plan
by which their course of action and their
power of injury to the countries against which
they were fighting would be more limited.
"I wish to tell the Conference quite definitely," he continued, "that Great Britain dots
iot ask for this concession; nor do I know
of any .other part of His Majesty's Dominions
that would ask for this 'elecmosynary aid in
the evcnt of confliet breaking out."
He
added that any Dominion of the Empire was
free to assist Great Britain or not, as it
might choose, in case of a war, but that that
would not free it from liability to attack
on the part of any enemy who would choose
that method. Thus quietly but effectively he
punctured any idea that a Dominion could
stay out of an Empire war by more choice.
We ail rejoice in the recovery of His
Majcety the King. Praycrs were offered in
ail our churches for the restoration of his
health. The Pope of Rome prayed, and he
said that the King would not dic. The Pope
knows that under no otlice flag do Roman
Catholics enjoy privileges and respect as
under the old British flag.
Those Senators who were present at the
Coronation of His Gracious Majesty must
feel even more deeply than others on this
occsion. The British Empire offered on Coronation day the most admirable spectacle. At
the very heart of this vast empire, in London,
n the ancient Abbey of W'estminster, in a
magnificent setting of oriflammes and rich
draperies, in the presence of tihe highes
dignitaries of his Court, of the representatives
of all his people, and delegate
froin all
nation-, at the foot of the sane altar whern
knelt bis ancestors of the mnight hou-e of
Hanover, lis Mocst High and Most Gracious
Majesty George V received on bis brow the
double crown of King and Emperor.
Hion.

Mr.

CASGRAIN.

Great Britain gave a noble example to ail
the worid in uniting in a ritual almost coeval
with Christianity the worship of the Sovereign
Ruler of the Universe with the traditional
worship of monarchy. Now, under the beneficent reign of the ancient house of Hanover,
as in the reiote ages when the dynasties of
the Saxons, the Normans, the Plantagenets
and the Stuarts succeeded one another on the
throne, the King is sure of the respect and
fidelity of bis people. George V is twice
sacred in the eyes of his subjects, because his
crown, a-ready precious by many centuries of
glory. shines with a. divine halo borrowed
from the splender of Westminster, whilst its
purest refulgent rays come from Heaven.
As Christians we were proud to see our
Sov-ereign, withbis crown and the insignia of
his majesty, kneeling before God and asking of
the King of Kings the confirmation of bis
power and the inspiration of his life. The
solemn grandeur of the Abbey is a severe and
potent rebuke of modern materialistic ideas.
The spectacle of many thousands of bis
fellow men arrayed in ail the evidences of
worldly wealth and dignity, yet reverently bent in contemplation of things unseen
and eternad. is one that muust cenvince the
most frivolous of the verities that underlie
our creeds.
It vas in such an atmosphere that the King
and Emperor took the vows of fidelity to
God, to duty and to the nation, a magnificent
testinony of faith and example to other nations. In that great consecration the King
had aIl the world for witness.
Wiat enormous ohange-what portentous
growth there bas been since the coronation of
Queen Victoria, 91 years ago! The great overreas Dominions joined not only in the symbolical pageant of the Coronation, but in the
processional march of the ages. Gradually
but surely and naturally they fell into
step, without compulsion and almost without conscious volition, because most are
of the same blood, and the same ancient traditions imipel then to consentanecous motion.
In that lie tlie greatness and permanence of
the imperial idea and the secret of its hold
on men ýliving in the most various cenditions.
We should do well to consider closely what
this attractive and cohesive force depends
upon, in its ultimate analysis; whether
it
appears to belong to consanguinity or rather
to its unquestionable power over men of other
races by virtue of the fundamental principles
of our policy guarantoeing them liberty and

equality before the law.
Not the exploits of soldiers, not the intrepidity of seamen, not the loud wrangling of

party, not the fumbling of statesmen has
built the British Empire. Not any of these
things alone ean maintain the vitality of the
Empire. It is the product of millions upon
millions of undistinguished people, for generation after generation, who have been content
to do inconspiouously the duty that lay nearest to them.
The King at his coronation took upon himself very solemn obligations towards his
church and his people, as their chief magistrate.
Each of us has his share in these obligations
and, whether he will or not, must play his
part in strengthening or undermning the
foundations of Empire.
Hon. A. B. GILLIS: I desire to add my
expression of gratitude at the recovery of
His Majesty the King.
There is one paragraph in the Speech frorn
the Throne, narnely the prosperity of the
country, to which I would like to make brief
reference. It is very gratifying to know that
some of our industries are so prosperous. The
Speech also states that agriculture is in a
very flourishing condition in Canada. Now,
I agree that it is very encouraging that our
banks and other institutions are successful,
and that our railways show larger earnings;
yet I think we should give serious consideration to the question whether the basic industry
of this country, agriculture, is on a sound
foun-dation.
According to newspaper reports Mr. Kemp,
a member of the Ontario Legislature, stated
that 75 per cent of the farms in the Province of
Ontario were for sale, because the farmers are

told on fairly good authority that similar conditione exist in other provinces in Eastern
Canada. I believe that in the great province
of Quebec and in the Maritime Provinces
agriculture is not in a flourishing condition;
but I am not familiar enough with conditions
in those provinces to make any definite statement about them.
I desire to call the attention of the House
for a few moments to conditions in the West.
The Speech from the Throne refers to the
large returns from our railways, and previous
speakers bave commented upon them. It is
largely owing to the fact that we in the
Prairie Provinces are able to produce such
vast quantities of grain to be shipped that
the railways have an opportunity to earn these
large returns.
But there is another side to the picture.
During the past three years we in the Prairie
Provinces -have been somewhat unfortunate.
The fall of 1926 was exceedingly wet, and a

condition existed in 1927. But even in the
face of those conditions prices were fairly
good, and in many instances the farmers
received a fair return for their crop.
In the autiimn of
Now I come to 1928.
1928 the crop prospect was probably the
brightest in the history of the western provinces. Everywhere the crop promdsed to. be
an abundant one. Unfortjunately, just a few
days before the grain was ready for harvesting
we were visited by three or four very severe
froots, in consequence of which the grades were
very much reduced.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Was the frost general?
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: The eastern part of
Manitoba and other spots here and there
escaped, but I think I am safe in saying that
80 per cent of the crop was touched by the
frost. Honourable gentlemen will of course
understand that, as the grain was nearly ripe,
the frost would discolour it without deteriorating it to any extent for milling purposes. It
is an old saying in the West that if we get
a frost there will be a harvest for the grain
dealers, the elevator men, the grain exchange,
and so on, who take advantage of the lower
grading which results. Last year, as a consequence of the frost, the grades were reduced,
and probably 75 per cent of the grain grown
in places where frost appeared was sold as
No. 5, No. 6, and feed, notwithstanding the
fact that most of the wheat weighed anywhere
from 60 to 65 pounds to the bushel. Tests
were made of the value of this wheat for mil!ing purposes, and in many instances it was
found that it was almost equal in value to
what is known as the standard grades, 1, 2 or
3, as fixed by statute. But while grades 1, 2
and 3 were bringing a fair price, the other
grades, No. 5, No. 6, and feed, were sold for
probably less than half of their actual value
for milling purposes. I have seen grain that
many considered first-class for milling purposes
sold for as little as 58 or 60 cents a bushel
while the price for No. 2 or No. 3 was bringing
$1 to $1.25 per bushel. From this you will
see at a glance what a loss the people of the
western provinces sustained by reason of the
frost and wrong grading.
It costs, I think, roughly speaking, at least
70 cents per bushel to produce wheat.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: More than that.

46

SENATE

Hon. Mr. GILLIS: That is the lowest possible figure. But putting it at that figure, you
will readily understand that the prairie farmers
are not in a very flourishing condition, because
they actually received less than the cost of
production of the wheat. This is true also
of the coarser grains including barley and rye,
all of which were more or less touched by
frost.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
of that frost?

What was the date

to the bushel would have been given a reasonable valuation. I blae the Government for
not taking action. The situation was well
known from the lst of October last. The Government should have foreed the Grain Commission ta take action in the matter, for by
doing so they would have saved the farmers of
Western Canada millions of dollars that have
been lost to them.
The condition of the farming community,
particularly those farmers who are entirely
dependent upon grain growing, is anything but
prosperous. It is not only the farmer who is
suffering, but the storekeeper, the implement
dealer, and everyone el-e who comes in contact with the farmer. I do not want to be
too pessimistie, or to throw a wet blanket
over the prosperity about which we have heard
so much; but when in some instances men are
not able to meet their accounts because they
could not get a reasonable price for the wheat
which they produced, prosperity is not much
in evidence. In the present Government we
have ýthree ministers from the Province of
Saskatchewan-the Prime Minister, the Minister of Agriculture, and the Minister of Railways-yet as far as I have been able to
discover no movement has been made to
remedy conditions in that province during the
past season. I trust that if this unfortunate
condition should occur again the Government
and the Grain Commission will try to meet a
situation which bas caused a serious loss to
people of the western provinces.

Hon. Mr. GILLIS: About the 14th, 15th
and 16th of August. I think we really had six
frosts. Of course that is an unusual thing in
the western country of recent years.
Now just a word in regard to what I consider should have been the policy of the
Government to alleviate that condition. They
could have stepped in and donc something in
the matter of grading. What was known as
the Turgeon Commission was appointed a few
years ago, and brought in a very elaborate
report, with some very sane recommendations,
but as far as I have been able to gather,
many of those recommendations were not put
into effect. To-day we have another Commission, appointed by the local Government,
the oowers of which, I understand, have been
incrcased by federal Order in Council, to enable
it to inquire into the grain industry in Saskatchewan and Alberta, and probably in Manitoba. To my mind the appointment of this
Commission is more or less of a farce, as
practically all the crop has been disposed of,

very sub.stantial deficit in the general operation of the Canadien National Tailways and
steamships, and that the Province of British
Columbia contributes very largely towards its
payment in the way of taxes. We do think
that wben unprofitable services are being
given in other directions, and wben our trade
can be benefited by continuing services that
are to a smail degree unprofltable, we are
entitled to some consideration. At aIl events,
I ýread in the press that there is a delegation
on its way to interview the Government to
press our dlaims in this connection.
I refer witb pleasure, for my own part,
to tbe promise in tbe Speech fromn the Throne
of the furtber development of the lines of

we are not told in detail, beyond a statement

a few months ago and the promises on the

tbat wben the choice comes to be made of
the lines to be taken over by the Government, the members nf the Ministry may think
well of that great enterprise of their political
colleagues in British Columbia, the Pacifie
& Great 'Eastern Railway. I can assure the
bonourable gentleman wbo. leads the Government in this House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
that a, far as the people of British Columbia
are concerned, great as is the pride which we
take in that railway and 'the develnpment of
the country wbicb it was intended to serve,
we would place no obstacles in the way of
its being incorporated witb so grand an enterprise as the Canadian National system.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: 1 tborougbly
believe that.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: However, to corne
down frorn a prospect to a certainty, I rnay
say that I was very pleased to see in the
program of the Canadian National an expression of the intention to proceed with the
lines on Lulu island, down the Fraser river
from New Westminster, to give a connection
with the great industrial centre of the lower
mainland of British Columbia.
The Canadien National Railway, as some
may flot k-now, is ini the peculiar position of
ending 15 miles short of its terminus, the last

47

1'5 miles of the journey being accomplished
over the rails of the Great Northern Raidway,
a foreign company operating in Canada.
Under the terrns of the contract with that
railway the Canadian National is flot permîtted to handie any way traffie or to pick
up any industrial traffle between New Westminster and Vancouver. Because o-f this condition the Canadian National bas had no connection in the past with the great industrial
area of the lower *main.land. We are assured
now that the plan of the original promoters
of the road is to be carried out, and that the
railway is to be extended down the Fraser
river to that industrial area.
In this connection I may say that the direcetors of the railway have looked very kindly
in-deed upon the ambitions and prospects and
possiibilities of New Westminster, my home
city. In -co-operation witb the Canadian Pacifie
Railway, tbe British Columbia Electrie Railways, and the Consolidated Smelter enterprise
of the C. P. R1., and in conjunction witb -the
Department -of Agriculture, they are now
engaged in a great soheme of port development, with terminal facilities for the aoading and unloading of vesseis, a.nd for cold
storage. Althougb it is not our habit in
that particular part of British Columbia to
support the party represented by the present
Governqment, we have sense enougb to be
grateful when they do not remember our
political deliniquencies, but join us beartiIy,
as tbey bave done on this occasion, in a
development of such great importance to the
port of New Westminster.
ýHon. Mr. CAISGRAIN: They want to convert you.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: I think we are partieularily indebted to the gond services of our
Minister from British Columbia, Dr. King,
who has the great task of representing in bis
own person the interests of that immense
province, and wh.o seerns to be rnaking a very
fine flst of it. I arn pleased to be able to
speak in this way of a Minister who has heen
s0 kindly ta everynne frnrn the province wbo
bas had business with hirn.
I sbould like to compliment hirn upon the
new era which be seems to have established
in the department over whicb he presides, in
treating dlaims for pensions and increased
pensions with a littie more bumanity than has
been custornary in the past. I should like
to see more bumnanity displayed in regard
to pensions than bas previously been shown.
I very well know that the Minister is bound
by the law, and that he cannot go outside

ordinates to administer the law so severely
as to cause very great distress to persons who
are well worth consideration by the Pensions
Department.
I desire to caul the attention of the
Government to another matter referred to
in the Speech from the Throne; that is the
matter of reorganization of the Fisheries
Department, mentioned with a simple reference to the appointment of a Deputy Minister. As has been pointed out, that is not,
as it purports te be, following the recomof the Fisheries Commission.
mendation
Their recommendation was for the appointment of a separate Minister, and the entire
separation of the Fisheries Department from
the Department of Marine. I have noticed
a reference made in another place by the right
honourable gentleman who leads the Government, in which he said that it is really the
intention of the Government to appoint such
a Minister, but that the moment that seems
most opportune must be left to be determined by the Government itself. I would suggest, in this connection, that there could hardly
be a time more opportune than the present,
in view of the fact that the fisheries of British
Columbia represent, in their value, 50 per cent
of the whole yield of the DominionHon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
would that be?

How much money

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: The fishery product
of British Columbia last year was about
$27,000,000; and I would call attention to a
note in the annual report of the Fisheries
Department, just presented, that while there
had been a general inerease in the fisheries
yield in Canada, there had been a substantial decrease of $6,000,000 or $7,000,000 in
the yield from British Columbia, mainly due
te the falling off in the take of salmon and
halibut.
Halibut is the most serious subject. As
te salmon, it has been a subject of consideratien for many years, and the salmon are net
doing at a.il badly, with the exception of the
one variety of sockeye salmon, always the
favourite. We have more than made up in
other varieties for what we have lest in the
sockeye. But as to the halibut we are facing the absolute extinction of that industry.
I quote from the report of the International
Commission on the protection of halibut,
appointed about four years ago, which las
been making a serious study of the situation
ever since, and which one year ago made te
this Government a representation from which
I will read only a few sentences:
The rapidity of the decline is regarded as
especially serious because of the very slow rate
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR.

of the growth of the halibut, an adult being
frocs twelve to twenty-five years, or over, in
age. Hence the present decline bas taken place
within the life span of one halibut of ordinarily
large size. As nearly all the fishs whieh are
being eaught now were spawned eight or ten
years ago, the abundance of the younger fish,
whieh will annually be available for capture
in the next ten years, has already been establisled. If these are greatly reduced in nunsbers,
and the intensity of the fishery is maintained,
the outlook for a future stock of spawning fish
sufIlcient to imaintain the supply, presents a
hopeless picture. In fact the consmissions investigations indicate that relatively few mature
halibut are now found on the older banks.
These illustrations demonstrate beyond a
doubt that the fisiery l3 in a very serious condition, and that the banks cannot stand the
intensity of fishing to which they are subjected.
The commission is fully convinced that the
conditions art so serious that no delay should
be permitted in the adoption of additional conservation measures. In the lighst of the investigations made, such action is essential to the
maintenance of the fishery.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Do we understand
from the honourable gentleman that they are
being fished out?
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Yes, they are being
fished out. The halbut industry was started
about forty years ago, when they fished off
Cape Flattery, only a few miles outside the
Thon ticy operated export of Victoria.
tensively off the banks of Queen Charlotte
Islands. But now, instead of going only 200
or 300 miles for the halibut, the fishermen
have to go 600, 800 and even 1,200 miles.
They had been accustomed te find the large
adult fish, which used to be the whole thing,
but which are now the exception, and are
in cold storage places as a
segregated
curiosity. The great bulk of the catch now
are fish that a. few years ago would net have
been taken at all.
Are there anv
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
hatcheries for halibut out there, or can you
have hatcheries for halibut the same as for
salmon?
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Teire is no suggestion
of hatcheries for ialibut.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Is it the Provincia!
Governments that have the hatcheries?
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: I do not think anything like that can be done for the halibut.
My point is that we have been conseious for
twenty or twenty-five years of the deeline of
the halibut industry, and of what will be its
eventual fate unless action be taken; but this
consciousness has been of no use, because there

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
The people cf

aod I think that this flouse should ot be
responsible fer perpetuating it.

FEBRUARY 14, 1929
The second reason wby I think the Bill
sbould be approved at once is that if power
were given ta Courts in Ontario, proper redress could be given to deserving parties.
As it is now, many divorces are granted by
Parliament. to persans whose sole abject i-j
to be relieved from the obligations of marniage. I understand we have no jurisdiction
to deal wit'h the question of redress. If \ve
gave the jurisdliction to Ontario Courts, some
assisQtance could be given ta many a poor
woman who, through no fault of her own,
findýs it necessary to obtain a divorce and is
saddled wvith the 'burden of caring for minor
cbildren wbo ought to be supported by
somneone cise.
I humbly and earnest]y submit that that
legislation should no longer he held up. We
are flot dealing with the principle of divorce,
as to whetber divorce shall prevail or not.
It does prevail, and it will continue to prevail, whether facilities are provided here or
in the Ontario Courts. Injustice is being
done to many innocent, honest persons in the
Province of Ontario because of the Ontario
Courts having no jurisdiction.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: May 1 ask the
honourable gentleman a question? If Ontario
is given the right to grant divorces, of course
the Province, having already jurisdiction to
deal with civil rigbts, will be able to provide
for alimony in cases wbere that may be
proper?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes.
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: Under
our present
procedure there is no publicity given to the
divorce cases in the newspapers. I should
iike to know whether it would be possible for
this Parliament to ensure that there would
be the same lack of publicity if divorce courts
were establisbed in Ontario. Or would that
be a matter of provincial regulation?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I think that
would be purely and solely within the competence of the Provincial Legisiature.
Hon. Mr. Mc.MEANS: I thought there was
a clause in the Criminal Code that probibited
publication of divorce news.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved:
Resolved: that it is expedient that Parliament (10 approve of the General Treaty for the
Rentinciation of War, which was signed at
Paris on the Twenty-seventh day of August,
Nineteen Hundred and Twenty-eight, on behalf
of Hie Majesty for the Dominion of Canada
hy the Plenipotentiary named therein, and that,
this House do approve of the same.
H1e said: Honourable gentlemen, our gen,eration will have Iived through one of theastounding epochs in the history of humanity.,
It had grown up witb the s-elf-.satisfied conviction of its superior civilization, and, all of a
siidden it faced the abyss of barbarism. It
witnessed a period of sanguinary destruction
without example in history.
We had the consolation at the close of this
tragedy to witness the efforts of the principal
statesmen in Europe, under the leadership
of the President of the United States, to
guard the world forever against such recurring
calamity. Woodrow Wilson created the League
of Nations, which remains as a monument
to bis memory. Canada was also 'brilliantly
reipresented hy its Prime Minister, the Right
Hon. Sir Robert Borden, the Right Hon. Sir
George E. Foster, and the Right Hon. Charles

now cxcliange their vioxvs at the round table
four times a year, and fifty nations gather
at Geneva yearly to discuss matters %vith a
single object in view: the maintenance of
peace throughout, the world. They have alI

FEBRUARY 15, 1929
United States standing aloof, free to act as it
plcased towards an offender. The Kellogg
Treaty largcly removes this impediment.
Whilc the UJnited States -bas clcarly stated
that the Briand-Kellogg Convention does net
imply that it is in the least degree obligated
to use coercive measures ngainst a nation
violating its solemn pledge, it is generally
understood tilat no signatory of the Treaty
will ever treat lightly ifs moral obligation te
deny help to a violator of the pact. The
Treaty not only obligates a sign.atory to
renounce war as an instrument of national
policy, but it precludes him as well from
becoming the silent partner of one who vielates his plcdge. His elementary duty will
be te deny to such a belligerent access to his
own resources. The Paris Treaty has created
this new situation, in which the United States
travels along the same road as the League of
Nations. Thcy have the same end in vicw
and, although moving separatcly, they are
both a menace to the wrong-doer.
This interpretation of the Paris covenant
hais made so deep an impression upon the
rninds of the United States Senate, which has
just ratified the Treaty, that Senator Capper
bas pre9ented to the Senate a resolution
cmpowering the President to place an embargo
on the expert of munitions of war to any
belligerent nation violating the multilateral
pact. In the House of Representatives Mr.
Stephen G. Porter, Chairman of the House
Foreign Affairs Committce, 'bas proposed a
resolution to the same effect.
The Briand-Kellogg Treaty may help considerably to bring about an agreement among
the maritime powers te apportion their
respective quota for the policing of the seas,
because, with the pact before them, it will
ho much casier to define the rights of neutrals
in case of the violation of this agreement, the
policy of the signatories of the pact leading
in the same direction. It seems elear that the
Paris Treaty materialy reinforces the movement for peace.
What effeet will that Trea.ty have towards a
redluetion of armaments? We are at this point
facing what semns to be an illogical situation.
Before the ink on that peace Treaty is dry
many of the signatories vote large sums of
money for inereaises in their armaments. When
the question is askcd of soe of the naval
experts of a country if they are not re-entering
into cempetitive armaments and building
against one another, they answer that they
are building not against, but up to, the
strongest rival. This means, of course, the
same t.hing. And what is the explanatien?
One necd not look far for it: it is generally

53

the fear of the neighbour, and in some instances national pride. Ail are desirous of
pence. They know their own sentiments and
their own sincerity. They may net question
the motives of others for the time being. The
unknown quantity is fickle publie opinion.
Fear will be dispelled only by the longcontinued practice of peaceable methods,
which will influence and shape the mind of the
rising generations. This transformation may
be a slow one. The instinct of fear may
linger in the breasts of men for a long time.
It behooves ail governments to devote their
best efforts to directing their people towards
the same ideal: the promotion of friendly
intercourse with their neighbours.
1 submit this Treaty as a most important
step in the right direction.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourable gentlemen, the elaborate presentatien of this matter by my honourable friend
the leader of the Governmcnt in this Chamber
relieves me of any necessity of treating at
length several points in reference thereto.
I do not risc to criticize the pact, nor the
mnanner of its presentation. So far as I am
concerned, both have my complete approbation and acquiescence. 1 should be in faveur
of the adoption of this Treaty at the pregent
time for prudential reasons on the part of
Canada itself, if there were no other considerations in view. When one thinks of it,
one easily realizes that Canada is well situated
from a geographical point of view, as regards
its boundary lines and any internatonal
troubles which may take place thereon. To
the north we are protected from any menace
of national disputes. The North Pole and
aIl its cohorts and accessories present to us
no difficulties in that respect. On the cast
and on the west our national limits touch
the waters of immense protecting oceans. The
only nation to whose boundary we are contigucous is our great kindred neighbour to the
south.
Those of us who have had an extended
experience in Canadian polities and public
life and who have followed the course of the
national attitudes of the United States and
Canada towards each other, for forty or fifty
or sixty years, have found in that time great
changes therein on both sides of the
boundary. Bitternes:, dislike, menace, suspicion and fear have gradually given way
to better understanding, good will, mutual
friendships and confidence and neighbourly
relations. As a matter of prudence, therefore,
this Treaty should be adupted. for if there
can be final assurance by treaty, or custom,
with regard te this boundary, Canada will

FEBRUARY -15, 1929
six weeks there was a changed tone ini the
between Washington and
correspondence
Mexico. The public sentiment in favour of
peace had simply called down the agencies of
cold correspondence and letters diplomatie,
and turned the attention of the administration towards peaceful methods for getting
around. the difficulty. The difficulty was got
around, and pence establîshed.
To take another example, suggested in part
hy the discourse of my honourable friend
the leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand). The administration of the United
States, possibly piqued on account of the impossibility for the time being of coming to
an agreement at Geneva, with Great Britain,
on nav-al disarma ment, presented to the House
of Representatives, with the recomimendation
of the President and the Department of Naval
Affairs, a program of naval construction including a totail of seventy ships cl war. It had
searcely reached the Committee on Naval
Affairs in th, flouse and been, blazoned abroad
through the newspapeýrs bef ore it 'became
apparent to the peace-loving element cd the
.people of the United States that an immense
program of naval construction might become
pos.,ible. Again the peace-loving sentiment
of thE, people of the United States broke upon
Washington with a force even greater than
that to which 1 have already made allusion.
This proposition of the administration,
which was presented to the Coînmittee on
Naval Affairs, came out from that Committee with the seventy ships reduced to fifteen,
and even at that failed of approval by th
Senate. Thus a tremendous proposed expenditure of public money amounting to somne two
billions of dollars was eut down to the small
capacity of fifteen cruisers and an airplane
carrier, in quick response to aroused public
opinion. There, again, the people of the
Unitcd States, not fortified by any statement
of limitations by the United States itself, but
sustained only by world opinion in favour of
peae. hrought about an unexampled and
fundamental change in the proposition which
emanated from and was recommended by the
Government. How much more effective will
such public peace sentiment bo now that it
has the backing of renunciation of war by that
and the other governments of the world!
With reference to this present Naval Construction Bill which has been lately passed
by the United States Congress, we must flot
in fairness lose sight of the fact that it had
alroady suffered the drastie reduction from
the administration Bill of a year ago, from
scventy ships of war to sixteen. By the arrangement made in Washington in 1921 and
1922 a certain allocation was agreed upon up

à

to which the great naval powers could huild.
The United States, with this Naval Construction Bill, is flot beyond that allocation; it
is in fact well within its limits; so we must
take that into consideration, as well as the
significant statement of President Coolidge
himself that it is not the intention of the
United States to enter into competition in
naval construction with any obhier country in
the world, but that it is simply bringing up
its naval strength to something near the
allocation which was made in 1921 end 1922.
0f course the question does arise, and gives
a basis for criticism: "Why provide for even
that amount of added naval construction
when your pen is scarcely yet dry after giving
its signature to a pact with eývery other -nation
in the world stating that you have renounced
war and put yourself upon a plane of settling
ail differences of any andl every kind by penceable methods?" There is ground for that
critîcism. But, after aIl, I have faith that the
United States of America, in the great qnass of
120,000,000 people that filI its national boundaries, is sternly and strongly in favour of
peace and peaceful methods in the world.
There are many gestures and somne gallery
play, so to speak, which goverfiments feel
themselves obliged to perform, and which
may not after alI contain any great elements
of danger.
I coame now ta my third point. I amn in
favour of t bis Treaty, heart and soul, becatu--e it notes a miost important step and
marks a m.ost important epoch in the advancement of -the human race along the lines
of international relationships. Can we for
one -moment restrain an expression of wonder, mixed with 'hopefulness and with gratituîde, that the human race has at Iast reached
a point where it estalblhes -a policy by
which international relationships are baqsed.
on justice and right? Through how many
long ages has humanity struggled to attain.
within its national limits, the renuncia-tion of
violence and force and the construction of
its national and social relationships on the
basis of justice, rigbt, truth and good fellowshipl This has been achieved. Now we
have approached an era in which, long delaved though it snay have been, humanity
will have at last, reached a similar point in its
international development: it bas proclaimed
the reiýgn of peace and justice in contradistinction to violence and war. The individual. unatt-ached and independent, was

beginning, and that ail the people of each
nation and ail the nationailities have to work
together with good-wil and along Vheco«nmon
line in order to secure the f uil achievement
in the end.
My hcnoui'able friend bas mentioned the
Capper resolution. T-here la an illustration of
the oonsequential eataills, so to speak, of the
pact of itsel.f. Man is a somewhat logical
animal, though sometimes maightily illogical
in applying his 'logic. He progresses from one
stage te another along the line of reasoned
experience. An obligation assumed, a line set,
and upon it is worked a series of bilateral and
mul-ti!lateral and subsidiairy influences whbich
must follow and iwbich cannot ultirnately be
ignored. If I have made an agreement with
my frienqd here, that such and such shaR' be
a course of conduct between oursedves, we
both shall find, when we corne to look over
and 4th1nk about that bilateral agreement. tbat
it entails consequence-s and -nubsidiary effects
whicb probably neither had previously
tbought about. If we have reached an agreement about a particular thing, and that agreement dces not corne to its frution, be may
say to me, or I anay say to ihum, or each may
say to himself: "la there flot somethiung more
to do than simuply to niake that personal agreement?" So il the United States of America
se, ber hand and seal to that Treaty with
sixty-four nations of thbe wer]d, and if in the
course of events that Treaty 18 violated, tuhere
is some other thinking that thbe United States
bas to do.
Did she enter into this compact in good
faitb and without hypocrisy? Did she mean
wbhat the pact expressed? Yes. Very well,
bere is a brigand wbo purposes vielatuing it.
Wbat bas she to do n-ow? Serious t.binking
brings the unavoidable conclusion tbat sbe
bas to do sometbing to keep that brigand from
breaking loose, or if he breaks loose she must
do something to suibjugate bim and bring bim
into a peaceabe condition. If tbe belief is
,that tbe peace of the world ia an absolute
necessity, then sometbing hais to be done with
the turbulent fellow wbo breaks eut against
cominon world opinion. That is just what la
takling place in thie United Staites to-day, and
the .Capper resoilution, and the Porter resoluition introduced lu the House of Represeuntatives at Washington, have just that object
in view. If they become law in tbe United
States ef America, e.nd acoarding to thbe purport oif thbe resolutions are made into a inultiýlateral treaty among the signatories o! thbe
pact, then the argument is entirely against thbe
critàc who now says that there are no teeth
in this Treaty.

57

Wbat does thbe Capper resolution propose?
In briel, what it proposes is this. Here is a
selemn obligation which Italy, for instance,
bas undertaken witib thbe Un.ited Statues of
America; and if tly should break this
obligation by oesortiung to offensive war
against a neighbouring nation, then so far as
thbe United States of America is concerned
two things wouuld take place. An embargo
ivould be placed against Italy upon ail instrunients, implements and munitions o! wax,
and the nationals of thbe United States would
be probibited froan sending or setli.ng any
article of that kind to, %]ay. The very enactment cf sucb laws by thbe United States
alone would prove a tremendous if not an
absolute preventive to any country undertaking to vieilate thbe world pact, because it
would be certain tubat tubat country would get
no 'belp or oomfort or aid from the United
States of America; and if the Capper resolution
resulted in a multilateral treaty along tbe same
lines, this wold ha an infinitely more powerful
preventive, for it would deter any nation
from undertaking so insane a tbing as engagrng in aggressive waTlaire in spite of the sentiments and opposition and absolute emnbargo"s of thbe whoule civi'lized world. Soý, if
we. do not look for thbe Gaupper resolutien to
become law at present, there la this mntch to
he said: that it ia a logical sequence of thbe
original pact to rnake effective in practice
that wbicb it declares in principle is necessary
anýd eminently just.
Now, honourable gentlemen, 1 tbink I bave
pretty nearly exbausted mysedf, and I arn not
quite sure that I have not 'pretty nearly exhauste.d thbe rest of you. I have ne more to
say upon tbis point at thbe present time, except to express my complete approbation of
the proposed Treaty. One tbing that is parti-cuuarly ipleasing and sweet about it la that
in this arrangement tubera is no partisan fiavour. This la a unitedly national affair. It
la ahlso an înterlinking o! many nations in an
international unity. We have the united sentiment of our owu nation; we have tbe united
brotberbood of a&lthe nations o! the world
in a community o! spirit and puxrpose tending
towards one great end.
The motion was agreed te.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved:
That a Message be sent to the House of
Commons by one of thbe Cherks at the Table to
acquaint tubat House tibat the Senate bas
adopted tubîs resolution, and requesting the

The motion was agreed to.

from Canada, 'which was partieularly emph.3-ized by the fionourable gentleman fromn
I arn
Montarville (Hon. MT,. Beaubien).
quite willing to ýadmnit that, there is an exodus. which I regret, and which I tJhink has
been going on ever since Confederation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

And before.

HIon. Mr. L.EWIS: Arxd before. Perhaps
that makes it, not better, but rather worse.
NeVertheless, that ýis a matter we have to
con-sider. It is possible that the situation has
heen aggravated a littie in recent years by the
pass.age of the quot-a law in the United States,
whieh shut off immigration coming by way of
the Atilantic, and therefore naturally ýinduced
greater immigration through the nort-hern gate.
This too may have had a peculiar -influence on
native Canadians, 'bocause they pass acroes the
border lino very freely and easily, whereas a
foreignor or ovon an old countryman from
Britain betrays himsolf by his speech, and is
checked and asked questions.
The honourable gentleman from Montarville
seemed surprispd that people should leave this
country to look for work amongst strangers,
eamongst poople whose habits and language
were not altogether familiar to them. But
that is not quite the case. British Canadians
flnd themselves among mon whose habits and
language are familiar, and French-Canadians
who go to N.ew England flnd there probably
a larger French-Canadian population than can
be found in any province in this country outside of Quebec. I have bren told that in two
states the French-Canadians are s0 numorous
that in one state they elected a Governor,
and in tho other a nwmber of the Sonate of
the United States. The same is true of Swedes
and other Scandinavians who leave our country and go to the western United Statos, where
there is a large Scandinavian population.
As~ I have said. this exodus has not been
confined to recent years. In the decado from
1911 to 1921, acoording to tho officiai -figures.
ive received immigrants to, the numibor of
1,728,921. Whon the census came to be taken
wo found that there was an increase in population of 1,581,000, which shows that we made
a loss of 147,921. In that connection we must
not forget to consider the natural increase,
which is estimated by the experts to have
been during that period 1,050,000. In other
words, in 1911 we had a population of
7.200,000; the natural1 increase in 10 years, not
including the natural increase of the nowcorners, was 1.050,000; and immigration
amounted to 1,728,921; therefore the total
expccted population in 1921 was 10,086,000.
But the actual population as shown by the
cousus wvas 8.788,483. We had lost in some

way nearly 1,300,000 people during those 10
years.
Now I want to go ba.ck a little to what
may seemn to ho ancient history. The period
fromn 1881 to 1891, folloiving the adoption of
the national policy, is particularly instructive,
not as casting any reflections on any particular party, but as showing that the doctrine
advanced by the honourable gentleman from
Montarvillo (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) is not borne
out. 'Phere could not have been a more
favourable opportunity for the carrying out
of any kind of high tariff policy than that.
The Conservative party ie 1878, and1 again
in 1882, had a majority of 2 to 1, elected
wholly and defleitely on the issue of protection; and ie 1887 it stili had a clear working
mai ority. Lt had the advaetage of the highest administrative ability for carryieg out that
kind of policy. Its leader was Sir John A.
Macdonald; its Finance Ministers wore Sir
Leonard Tiiley, Sir Charles Tupper, and the
right honourable gentleman whom we cal1 suppose on acecouet of his immortal youth
-the junior member for Ottawa (Right Hon.
Sir George E. Foster). They were all mon of
the highest administrative ahility.
There was no free trade West at that time
to hamper the Finance Minister in carrying out
any sort of protective policy that ho waned.
There were only fi-,ie inembers froma the
Prairies, and afterwards nine; and the most
of those supportod the Protectioeist Government of the day. In addition to that, the
Canadian Pacific Railway was built during
that period, aed of course in its construction
a large number of mon were employed and
huge sums of moeey were speet on wages aed
supplies, to the great benefit of the whole
country. But what was the result? The
population increased by 6M5,000 or 171 per
cent, in the decade from 1871 to 1881, whichi
wvas supposed to have boen one of groat depression. while in the national policy decade,
from 1881 to 1891, notwithstanding ail the
a.dvantagos I have mentioned, it increasod
by only 508,000, or 1114 per cent. Not only
that, but there was a decline in the rate of
,progress ine manufacturing-the very thing
that tihe national policy was supposed to promoto. The volume of manufactured products
increased from 1871 to 1881 by more than
$88.000.000, and fromn 1881 to 1891 by bas
ihan 860,000,000.
I mention thesQe t.hings not to show that
one party is superior to another, but to cast
very sorious douýbts upon the hopes of those
who imagine that aIl our problemrs would
ho solved and that we should have no more
migration or other troubles if only we had a
higher tariff.

60

SENATE

There alwavs has been migration to the
Unoitedi States, rînder ail tariffs ani under ail
policies, due to the attraction of a larger
population, larger cities, greater opportunities
for young mon, and so on. I do nlot regard
that situation complacently; I shouid like to
see sometbing done that would prevent it.
I do flot like to sec so many Canadians ]caving th(, country ; but 1 tbink tha t the migration will continue until the larger population
of the United States becomoes a disldvantage
instead of an advantage te nui- neigbbours.
That is te say, I think the tinie xviii come

population, w'ben manY of ber peopie wil

the migration northward will bogin.

I could nat heip being stirred up a littie
by the remarks af rny eloquent and honourabie friend fram Mantarviiie (Han. Mr.
Beaubien) against aid age pensions, of which
I amn very strongiy in favour. I da nat suppose I shall be abie ta convince hirn, because it is probably a matter of paint af view
rather than af anything that can be decided
by argument. But I do not understand him
when he says that aid age pensions are gaing
ta pauperize the people of Quebec ar any
other place. It does not seem ta me that
you can pauperize a man by giving him an
independent incarne. That might be the resuit if aid age pensions were regarded as a
matter of charity, but I do flot so regard
them. On the eantrary, I look upon them
as a matter of right. I hold that aid working
people are entitied ta pensions just as weli as
aur judges and saldiers and athers ta whom
we have been aecustomed ta giving pensions.
If I saw an aid man getting down an bis
kn.ees petitioning for a pension, I shauid say
ta hirn: "Don't da that. You are entitled
ta the pension as a matter of right."
Nor do I foIiaw my hanaurabie friend when
he says that aid age pensions wiii destroy
the home life and weaken home ties by giving ta chidren the idea, that they no langer
have ta pravide for their parents. It seems
ta me that argument carnies us very far, because it is an argument nat anily agaînst aid
age pensions pravided by the State, but
against the provision by a man for an incarne
for bimself through his awn thrif t. According ta that point of view, if a man saves

61

money so that wben be becomes 65 or 70
years of age he bas a sufficient incame ta, live
an, and his chiidren are not under tbe obligation ta support bim, then they do nat lave
him and the family life is destroyed. In the
same way, it is an argument against the provision by a man for bis wife, or bis widow
that may be. Holding that view, be may say:
"Il my wife bas an income ahe wiii be independent af ber chiidren, they wiii feel that
they have not to support ber, and the home
life will be, destroyed." 1 cannot agree with
that sentiment. My opinion is that the mare
independent you make an aid man or an aid
waman, the bappier you make hlm or ber
and the better the famiiy relation. That
reasoning, it seems ta me, is true in famiiy
circles, just as we say it is in aur relations
Independence makes for

good-wiIi in bath cases.
Certainiy I do not think that aid age pensions would result in any af the dire effects
that have been predîcted in Ontario, and I
rather think tbat the peaple of Quebec wiii
be converted ta become supporters of the
measure. As ta the contributory seheme, I
am quite in favour af that where a man can
begîn making contributions in bis youth ta bis
own pension fund; but we need ta consider
now the making of provision for men who
are, say, over fil ty years of age and who wiil
be unable ta make any considerabie contribution tawards a fund for tbemseive%. In the
future I sbouid be very gIad ta see put into
effeet a contnibutory seheme sucb as my
bonourabie friend proposed.
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourabie gentlemen, I hope I -amn ot late in associating myself with the honourabie mernbers af this

1 hold, and on acoount of conditions that may
occur within the next year or two, 1 think
th-at it should be the duty of this, country to
]ook for mnarkets in the direction of the British
Commonwealth to which we helong. 1 believe
it to be a fact that the British Commonwealth
of nations is in a better position in the matter
of production than even the United States.
It was said a few yeurs ago that the British
Commonwealth covered. a quarter of the
entire surface of the ea-rth, that we had
territory in every latitude .and 'longitude of
the world, and that within our 'own territory
wo could produce everything necessary for the
human family. The seas and oceans, instoad
of being a barrier to trade aman.- ourselves,
are an advantage, hecause transportation by
wator is much cheaper than hy land.
I hope that as the years go on the Coinmonwealth of British nations will ho drawn
dloser and dloser together in trade and in
every other way. 1 should ho glad to support
any stops that wou'ld ho taken in that direction,
for 1 believe that the welfare of the Empire
to which we belong lies in such co-operation.
Trade among ourselves as a Commonwealth
increases and enriches &il our communities,
and with respect to the exohange of goods
we can make mutual arrangements that wo
know will not ho a'brogated. We have the
greatest opportunity that ivas ever presented
to any race in the world.
We should ho glad to trade with our neighhours to the south, for it is the natural thing
to do; but if we cannot do so, I think the
time bas arrived when we should seriously
consider the matter of Empire trade, and 1
should. ho glad indeed to support any movement in that direction.
1 desiro to ref or now to a matter that is of
very special concern to the Maritime Provinces.
We have there a condition of things that is
very injurious to the moral and physical welfare of our people. The duties on malt and
spirituous liquors hefore the war were less than
a third of what they are now, hecause on the
outhreak of war in 1914, at the first Session
of Parliament that was held to consider war
matters, those duties wore considerahly increased. I was a member o! the Houso of
Commons at that time, and I voted for that
law. I thou-Lght thon I was doing my duty,
and I think so stili. The law was fairly well
observed during the war period, and as a
war measure it was fine. The samne duties
have heen maintained since the war, hut such
conditions have arisen in the Maritimes that
the law is not observed. Those conditions lend
Lhemnselves to smuggling in a wholesale way.
The islands of St. Pierre an~d Miquelon lie a
short distance east of us, and there unlimited

63

supplies of spirituous liquors can ho ohtained,
and a business of smuggling has heen ostahlished. Four-flfths o! our people sympathize
with that business. I am quite safo in sayingI
after giving the matter ail the considoration I
could, and getting the opinions of others,
that 80 or 90 per cent of the liquors consumed
in the Maritimes do not pay duty. As a result,
a considerable number of persons are oraployed in trying to prevent smuggling. Thore
are several cutters and armed vessels on the
coast, yet the smuggling goos on. I helieve
it would take bal! the numher of mon that
xvent overseas at the time of the war, and haîf
the revenue of Canada, to provont that
smuggling; and if it could ho prevented. illicit
home hrewing would take its place, and it is
difficult to say which would ho the groater
evil.
From personal observation I know of whole
families, who were respectable a few years ago,
and who have lost everything they possessed
hecause of this illicit, trafflc. I know of ontire
settlements that have heen demoralized. 1
Iistened the other day to my honourable friend
fromn De Lanaudiere (Hon. Mr. Casgrain)
advising that something ho dono to promote
the steel and coal industries of Nova Scotia;
hut in my judgment it doos not much matter
what is done in that direction if something is
flot done to provent this illegal traflie. The
people are becoming demoralized. In parts
of Nova Scotia it is even worso than on Prince
Edward Island, if my information is correct
-and I have spoken to commercial travellers
and others. This remark applies particularly
to the Island of Cape Breton, because the
coast lino there lends itself to that vile traffle.
In my judgment the remody for this had
state o! aifairs is to reduco the duty on malt
and spirituous liquors to what it was hefore
the war, and thus tako away the inducement.
If this were done I do not helieve the revenue
of Canada would suifer. It would certainly
not suifer so far as the Maritimes are concerned. 0f course I do not know how it
would affect conditions in Ontario and Quobec,
but even a large revenue will nover justify the
Government, or the people of Canada-for no
Government is to blame for this-in allowing
a large section of the people to ho demoralized.
I have consulted mon and womon who are
very much interested in the tomperanco question, and they favour a very considerahle
reduction o! duty. Thoy want to destroy this
illegal traffie, and a small reduction would not
do it.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Is not Prince Edward
Island undor prohibition?

I arn very giad that

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I do not know how it
is. but 1 think that in ýmany places in Canada, as well as in Prince Edward Island, people
ivill vote for prohibition and at the saine time
assist in srnuggling. It is strange that they
do so, but it is a fact.
Iîîigbt Hon. M\r. GRAHAM:

It is hurn.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: That is the unfortunate part. If we were ail sober people, and
sinc(i'e in what xve are tloing. there xvould be
ne deinand for this. Vessels laden with liquor
lie oti tie coa.t, amd tish)ermen assd others go
eut la tfieir boats; and ibrin-, in boatloads. Uader
ordinarv circurnstances the t.raffic cannot be
fougbrt. for' the peuple engaged in this business
(le net suffer in the public estimation, or

condition in those provinces is serious. We
bave establisbed a sehool for crime. Youîsg
nmen are graduating from tbis sebeol in large
rumibe.is every year, and are becoining participants in crime because of the profits te be
derived frocs tbis traffie. Tbis situation wil
continsue te exist while tise present duties
reomain; ýo I boe that henourable gentlemen,
particuiarly those froim the Maritime Provinces, vilgive expression te their opinions
on this phase of the subject. I thank yeu,
isonourable gentlemen.
tien. Mr. HUGHES.

Prince Edward IËland or in New Brunswick,
but I think I have a certain knowledge of
wbat is goiag on in Nova Setia, gained from
my ýown observation and from the information
tbat une gets frem the press and otherwise.
I arnl satisfied that, my honourable friend
bas net exaggerated conditions in the slightest
degree .
Around the shores of Nova Scotia

we havec what we call cruisers, and a very
lîarge preventive force, both maintained by the
Fedoral flovernrnent for the purpose of keepîîîg eut liquor upon whicb, certain people intend te evade the payment of duty.
The
fact of the ýmatter is, as my honourable friend
bas stated, that these cruisers and these preventive officers do net keep the liquor eut.
On the contra-ry, it is corning in aimost everywvhere.
When this iiqtior bhas been iliicitly
landed we find the provincàia and municipal
gevernrnent officiais engaging in an attempt
te, catchs it.
They catch a bottlle here and
tîsere, or peichaps a dozen botties; they rnay
even get hold of $100 worth; btit in cernparison witha îvhat is thus illicitiy bro.ught inte tise province, the quiantity intercepteýd is
but a drop in the bucket.
I tbink my honourable friend is on abselutely sound ground when hie says that the
practical andi effective way of deaiing with t'his
situation is te reduce the duties.
It is the
promise of gain which actuates the bootlegger,
as sve caill hirn. For instance, a cert-ain class
of liqttor very com-mun in the Maritime Provinces corns frurn the West Indues, wbere it is
bought for 75 cents a galion; it is brought, at
a oost of a ferw cents more, te the shores of
Nova Scotia, w-bore, after it is landed, it is
rctailed freelv for $8 or $9 or $10 a gallon. The
spread 4etw-een tise cest, whicba cannot be more
titan $1.50, and the price at which it is solti,
makes t.îsa
vr lucrative business.
Ftbrtberiîere. ite-t of the peuple wio live
bx- the sea are fille-di with the spirit of adventure.
W-hen they appreisend that they
can get titis liquor for se little, bring it up te
Cainada, and participate in tise adventure
of ianding it and selling it te tfic local beotlegger, the suppression oýf the traffic by means
ut cruisers is practically impossible. Tise rea!
w-av te suppress this trafflc is te take away
the hope of gain.

smuggling trade was carriod on in certain

off the duty on those articles, and at once
the smuggling was stopped, because it was no

unite with mny 'hanourable friend in haping
that -the Goveroment will give it sonous consi'deration. I do flot believo that they wouald

oi the Bill. Unfortunatoly, on twa occasions
when it, ivent over ta the other branch o-f
Pa.rlianient, for one reason or another it was
not considered. On the other occasion it
was sent ta a spoci.il comrnittee which -carefully and critically considered it, made sorno
unimportant amendmients, and reported the
Bill ta the H-ouise. Thon for somne considerable tirne it stood on the Order Pa)per ai the

somotirnos suggosted that co'mpany legisiation
should be fully amended so as ta meet all
requiromonts. This is practically impossible.
The course af 'business is changing. The comnplexity of carnpany management is increasing,
and it is necessary from. time to timo ta make
arncndrnents s0 t.hat t.he Act may be adequate for business purpos. Thirty years ago
the incorporation of a company witb a capital
of $3,000,000 was made the subj oct of public
discussion, and the rosuit was that tho fiat
af the Finance Departmont was required in
the issue of company charters. Now a capital
of S1OO,000,000 is not unusual. A few years
aga the usui>l metýhod of prornoting a cornpany was through the issue of comman stock
and debonturos. Now it is through cammon
stock and rodeomablo preference shares. Adoquate provisions must be introducod in the
Act ta meet thoso changing conditions.
About the yoar 1900 the provisions respecting prospectuses were first introduced in the
English Act for the protection of investors.
It was afterivards discovered that there were
loaphalos, and ovasians af the Act. After
careful study theso provisions were revised in
1905, and.the Act was completeiy consýolidated ini 1908. It was not until 1914 that the
prospectus provisions were embodied in aur
Campanies Act. Since then other methads
of evasion have heen discoverod. These
clauses were under cansideration by an interdepartmoental committoe in London, corn-

The Provident Fund, which was started in
1907, followed the general English practice,
which is to build up a fund by contributions
from both ernployees and employer. It is not
self-supporting, -on account of the addition,
since its inception, of many railways and employees to the Canadian Government Railways System. It is, therefore, deemned advisable to give the Governor in Coun-cil power

years gone by. When the employees are contributing, the pensions are more adequate, and
at the sarne time they are regarded by the
employees as a right granted in return for long
service and fur the contributions which they
have made to the fond, in the same way as
The
one pays to an insurarice company.
principle of pensions donated by the employer
is, in my opinion, not sound. Had the railways management seen fit to go to, the extent
of devising a plan of pensions on a contributory basis, the employees would, I arn
sure, have been glad to join, if Vhey had been
consulted and the matter discussed seriously
with them.
The effect of the passing of this Bill, as I
undcrstand it, will be that the present employees who have contributed to the fund
will be protected in the rights that they have
heretofore enjoyed, but after this Bill becomes
law the new pension plan will apply to any
new employees of the Canadian National
Railways on the lines of the old Intercolonial, Prince Edward Island and Transcontinental railways, and as the fund will be no
longer on a contributory basis, there will be
substantial reductions in the pensions allowed
to these employees when they retire.
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: I agree absolutely with what my honourable friand the
ex-Minister of Labour (Hon. Mr. Robertson) has said. I believe that a pension fund
to, which employees do not contribute is not
appreciated. I know of one large concerfiI will not mention the name-which is paying out over 3100,000 a year in pensions, and
the employees do not appreciate the fact.
There is an old English maxirn to the effect
that you do not value anything that you get
for nothing. You do value anything for
which you have made sacrifices or denîed
yourself pleasures. If a man contributes to
a fund on which he may draw in his old age,
when he can no longer earn a living for hirnself, or to a fund which will provide for those
who corne after him, he appreciates its benefits far more than he would if he made no
contribution.
Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: Honourable gentlemen, I have not had an opportunity to examine the Bill, but I suspect that the reason
for not requiring contributions from employees is that under the plan as propoeed
the railway board would feel more independent and free in dealing with the ernployees.
The directors would hesitate to disrniss an
employee after he had contributed to a pension fund for ten or fifteen years, although
they rnight think it would be for the good
of the service to dispense with his services.

There might be a feeling that after a man
had contributed to the .fund for a long time
he should flot be deprived of any rights that
he might have under it.
I know of a number of companies, banks
and others, that have a pension fund to
which their employees do flot contribute, and
so far as I have been able to, see, those
schernes work out well in practice in every
case.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I did not intend
to handie this Bill; so I arn not well posted
on some of the questions that have been
raised. Information will be obtained frorn
the Railway Department and will be available
to-rnorrow when we go into Comrnittee on
the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

DEMISE OF MARSHAýL FOCH
EXPRESSION

0F SYMPATHY

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Hoxaourable
gentlemen, the news has reached, Canada and
the various other parts of the world of the
demise of Marshal Foch. It is fitting that
this event should be noted by the Parliament
of Canada, since Marsbal Foch was the Chief
Commander of the -armies of the Allies, comprising the Canadian units.
Marshal Foch wvas essentially a soldier from
the very day lie lef t college. He decided to
follow a soldier's career, and after leaving the
military school he soon became a professor in
the military collage. There he acquired the
experience which heýlpeil hlm to ascend the
laddar towards the position that he held when
the war opened, that of a general. H1e had
heen noted as a professor for the clear thinking and deep philosophy that lay at the basis
of his lessons. I remember a phrase of his
whieh was mentionad at the time his action
on the battlefield wvas attracting attention: it
was that war meant the opposing of two moral
forces, its material aspect being mainly that
of the instruments used in support of thnse
moral foi-ces.
In action, from August, 1914, he showcd his
faith in the~ judgmîerît hc had formed on the
ethies of war. His command nf army divi-

siens; was most brilliant, but it was only a
preparation for the role which ha assumed
after the meeting at Doullens between the
staffs of the British and French armies.
In March. 1918, there h'ad been a formidable onslauglit by the German armies, reinforced by ail the troops from the eastern
front, who had been freed after the Treaty
of Brest-Litovsk, sign-ed by Germany and the
llusQsiatns. A gýap of some twenty kiilomeýters
was made at the junction of the British and
the French armies. Twenty kilometers represented a con.siderable opening for the enemy.
The leaders in both camps, British and
French, had met and reaehed a decision
which, though it has net been heralded to a
very great extent, was yet a very important
one: it was that the British should separate
from the French by withdrawing towards the
sea, while the French receded towards Paris.
The men in authority, British and French, decided to review that momentous decision, and
lhey met at Doullens. There was considerabla discussion as to what was best f0 do.
Those who took part in that important meeting aIl reniember that f0 the question, "How
can the gap lie closed?"' the quick answer of
Marshal Foch ivas, "It is very easy f0 stop
the inroads," and in a rapid way be gave the
modus operandi by which it could be donc.
Affer deliberating for a few moments the
leaders decided f0 confide the fortunes of
the Allies to General Foch, and from that
moment, the supreme command being unified,
the Allies began f0 readjust their position,
with the resuit that we ail know.
Before he was in supreme command
Marilial Foch had played his part te the
absolute satisfaction and great idmiration of
the men wh-o surroundeil hlm. and froso the
moment that he emerged at Doullenis with the
supreme eeimm'and, acting aind manoeuve'ring
in the eyes cf the world, ho won the
unanimous encomiums and applausa of the
Allies.
As Marshal Foch 'bai the signal honour
and heavy rasponsibility of commanding fthe
Allýies, 1 t'hotuaht it was but just that the
Canadiian Parli-ament should recognize tbe
day of lus passing, and express ifs sympatby
with lich nation te, wbieh he belonged, in the
loss which they bave suffered.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
Honourable
gentlemen, the honourable leader of the
Goveront was good enough te ailvise me
a few moments ago of bis intention f0 speak
on this subjct, and suggested that something
miglt appropriafcly be said from f hii side of
the House in the same connection.

SENATE
The honourabie leader hias given in a very
succinct manner the miiitary career of Genierai
Foch hefore hie became Commander-in-Chief
of thc French army. From that timýe on,
more particulariy, bis career is known to ail
Britisiiers tliroilout the wxorld. Beore the
union of thc two arniie-s, or the coxubination
of thieir forces, it was but naturai that we
,,bouid foiiow wvith more jnterest our own
C encrai, Sir Douglas Haig. In this connectien, it is a tribute to Great Britain and the
Allies, anrd no less a tribute to Sir Douglas
Haig himiself, who had been in chief and
successfui com.mand of enormous forces, that
in the extreme pass that matters had reached,
they were wiliing to subordinate personai and
national considerations and under a unified
conmmand to present a, combined, common
fr-ont to the cnemy.
There is no doubit that Generai Foch will
go clown in hist.ory as cne cf the great
inilitary rommanders of the ages. The war
wxas the greatest of -aIl trne, and as the uitiniai e supreme commander in tiiat, war ho
iiiust of neccs.sity go clown in iiiory as oe

MARRIAGE PROTECTION BILL
FIRST READING

Bill X-1, an Act to make mental or physical unfitness an impediment to marriage.Hon. Mr. Girroir.
ELECTRICITY AND FLUID
EXPORTATION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. TANNER moved the second
reading of Bill 15, an Act to amend the
Electricity and Fluid Exportation Act (Exportation of Electric Power).
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Is there any explanation of what the Bill means?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Yes, I shall be glad
to give an explanation. The Bil, which bas
come down from the other House, deals with
the exportation of power. Under the present
law, as I understand it, it is necessary to have
a license for the exportation of power; but
under this Bill the approval of Parliament is
required before power can be exported. I
understand that the Bill comes down to this
House with -the full approval of the Government, which it had last year also.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The license
at present is issued by the Department of
Trade and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I may say
that I have received no memorandum concerning this Bill. I accept the statement of
my honourable friend. If before the third
reading of the Bill I receive any information,
I shall bring it before the House.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I presume that, of
course, the Bil will go to Committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
PRIVATE BILLS
SECOND READINGS

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM moved the second reading of Bill 16, an Act respecting the
Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this Bill
has been the cause of a good deal of discussion in the press and by the public. Last
year a somewhat similar bill was either not
reached in the House of Commons or not
passed there. What the press called the objectionable features of the Bill were those
referring to the issue of new stock. But the
Bill has been passed by the other House on

CIVIL SERVICE BILL (PRIVATE

SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second reading of Bill 7, an Act to amend the
Civil Service Act (Private Secretaries).
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this is a
Bill which deals with the private secretaries
of the Ministers, and the Leader of the Opposition. There are two amendments. One
bring-s under the operation of the Act the
private secretary of the Leader of the Opposition, and the object of the second is to
limit the placing of secretaries when the Ministers, or other members of the Government,
or Leader of the Opposition, for whomn they
are acting, cease to be such.
Heretofore a Minister could replace a sec-

In subsection 2 the words " other member
of the Government" are not repeated, and I
move to add these words, so that this subsection will read:
(2) If such person holds a permanent position in the civil service hie may be paid an
additional salary not exceeding six hundred
dollars a year wbilst so acting; but if hie does
flot hold a permanent position in the civil service, hie may be paid such salary as the
Governor in Couneil may prescribe, and in the
event of the MinisterThen I add " or other meniber of the Government "--the words that are in the first
subsection, but not repeateýd here-- or the Leader of the Opposition for whom hie
is acting as secretary, ceasing to be a minister
Then I add "or inember of the Government"-or to be the Leader of the Opposition, as the
case may be, the said secretary shaîl thereupon

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I desire to move
an amendment to section 1. Hýonourable
gentlemen will notice that section 60 of the

a new one. The first subsection reads as follows:
60. (1) Any person may be appointed by a
minister of the Crown or other inember of the
Government, or by the Leader of the Opposition
to be bis, private secretary.

I suggest the insertion of those words,

CAN-,ADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
PENSION BILL
SECOND

READING

Right Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM moved
the second reading of Bill 2, an Act to amenýd
The Gran.d, Trunk Act, ý1906-7, with respect
to pensions.
H1e said: Honourable gentlemen, a few
moments a.go I moved that the Order relafing
to Bill 3 be diseharged and -piaced on the
Order Paper for to-morrow. There are two
reasons for that, the chief one being that
Bis 2 and 3, the Pension Bill and the Provident Fund Bill, should be discussed coneurrently.
I now move the second reading
of Bill 2 in order to get it into Comrnittee
of the Whole, se, that we may discuss it with
the other enactrnent conccrning the railway
employees.
The objeet of the present Bill is to enable
the Canadian National Raiiway System to
provide a pension which is now payable by
the Grand Trunk under the nid Grand Trunk
Act of 1906-7. If wiil affect soe 83,000 empiuyees. When the amalgamnation toek place
it was found that while the Grand Trun< had
a pension systeim, the Canadian Northern had
none. The Goverement Railways had a
Provident Fund, and conducted ýwhat is rea*iy
a contributory systern. This is a ncw proposition, to bring under the Pension Act now in
existence ail the- empioyees who are, not
under the Provident Fund. It is in line,
pra'ctieaily. with the syvsterns in, force on flic
Canadian Pacifie, the Newi York Central, and
many otheýr leadinig lines. It differs from the
Providýent Fonýd in the fact that the eimployees
do not contribute. but the rnee in its entireýty is contributed by the cornpany itseif.
In Bill No. 3, which is about f0 'be considercd in Committee of the Whoie, provision is made te give the Governor lin
Council power te shut the door of the Provident Fund te any naw empioyees or new
applicants; to maintain the rights as they
exist to-dlay of ail those irbe are now under
the Prevident Fund Act, but to aiiew ne
others te cerne under it. The new Act,
aquivaient te the plan which xvas je existence
in the nid Grand Triînk, ivili place ail new
employees on an equai footing.
Several questions îuay arise concerning
those who are now under the Providenýt Fund.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

I may say the Bill wili net affect thern unýless
they wish te ba affccted. They m'iy retire
from the Provident Fond if they wish, and
cerne under this, or they *may remain under
the Provident Fond, the Goveromnent and the
raiiway protecfing ail their rights.
0f course these 'are Ouf the unly fonds of
the raiiway employers, for they have organizations prox iding insurance and sick benefits,
but those are conducfed by the men alone,
the raiiways contributing oniy a srnaii ameount.
Under tho old Provident Fond Acf, passed
in 1907, the empioyces of tue Government
raiiwa ' s contributcd one and a haîf pcr cent
of iheir wages. The Government, urder the
Act, was fo contribufe an amount equal to
thîat contribution by the men, but net te,
excecd $50,000 a year. As a matter of fact
the contributions were soon found te be insufficinnt, and veqr affer year larger amounts
were voted by the Goveronent te, proteet
the men, whose contribution (lid net coe
anywhere near paying haîf of the ameunt
required te carry on the fonýd.
I xxas going te sugge.,t thfit in order te put
the fwo Bis on a parity, I nîiglit be allowcd
te move the second reading of the present
Bill and move th'it if be referred te Cernmitiee of flic Whoie te-merrow, so that the
two Buis may then ho discussed together. In
flic absence of the honourable member from
Weland (Hon. G. D. Robertson) I wouid net
like te go any further.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
I know the
honourable gentleman from Welland is very
much intercsted in these Bis. Ha bas parhaps more techeical knowledge, on the subjeet
Ibmn anybody aise in the House. If if wiil
be permissible te discuss in Committea nef
only the details, but aise the prinýciple of the
Bill, I arn content te ]et the motion go.
The motion was agreed te, and the Bill was

The motion as amended was agreed to.
TECHNICAL

EDUCATION
BILL
SECOND

EXTENSION

READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND
moved the
rc'cond reading of Bill 34, an Act to amend
the Technical Education Act.
Hie said: Honourable gentlemen, the purpose of this amendment. is to clarify the
existing Act, which, by section 8, authorizes
the carrying forward of certain unexpended
portions of the appropriations provided for
therein, and to permit the carrying forward,
for the purposes of the Act, of aIl the unexpended portions of these appropriations
f or a lim ited period of five years.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committce on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Copp in the Chair.
On section 1--short titIe:
Hon, W. B. WILLOUGHBY:
Will the
honourable leader of the Government explain
what the position of the Government is now
with reference to the Technical Education
Act?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
As far as my
memory goes, the Act was coming to an end
saime time this summer, and there was considerable pressure from the various provinces
for an extension of it. Section 8 provides
for the extension of the Act with regard to
that portion of the 810,000,000 which was not
distributed to the provinces. The Act is
practically extended, therefore, for* five years.
The amendmnent reade as follows:
Any portion of the ten million dollars appropriated uinder this Act which may remain
unexpended at the expiration of the fiscal year
ending the thirty-first day of March, one thousand fine hundred and twenty-nine, whether
prev'iously carried forward or not, shall be
carried forward and remain available accoraing to its apportionment for the purposes of
78600--%

this Act during any one or more of the five
succeeding fiscal years, and no portion of the
said ten million dollars shaîl bo paid to any
province after the thirty-first day of March, one
thousand Dine hundred and thýirty-four.
As a matter of fact, in reading the Bill, I
sec that the Act ended on the 3lst of March
last; sa that the Bill practically providos for
reviving and continuing the Act for the next
five yoars, with regard to ail that portion of
the 810,000,000 which has not been distributcd.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: There is one
intorosting thing that the public, and perhaps
this flouse, would liko to know, and that is
whethor il is the intention of the Govornment
to continue the Act othorwise than to oxhaust
the monoys that wero ap.propriatod for the
purposos of the Act and are now lying in
tho exehequor. The press of the country
bas published repeatedly statements concerning the unwillingness of the Government to
continue to aid tochnical education. This
Bill provides not for the croation of a now
fund, but simply for the distribution of
moneys already appropriated. It is a kind
of bouquet placed on the grave of financial.
assistance to the provinces for this purpose.
I do flot speak with any special knowledge of the subi oct, but 1l think there are
a great many people in the country who
fool that the Govermnent should continue to
give this financial help over a long period of
years in the future; and I should like to know
if the honourable leader of the Govornment
is in a position to state what the Government's intentions arc. I think the demand for
technica:l oducation will grow, rather than
dimihish, with the increasing industrialization
of Canada. Porhaps it would not be too much
to ask what the Govornment intend to do not
only during the noxt fivo yoars, but after that
time. It sooms ta me it would be of advanm
tago to the provinces, and to ail who are literested in this question, to have somne definite
information as to what the policy of the
Government will be on this issue five ycars
from noîv, if thoy can forecast so far in advance-providod, of course, thoy arc in power
thon, which I do not expeot will be the case.
Right Hon. G. P. GRAHAM: And if they
were not in power, what would be your policy?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: My individual
policy would ho to wait. That is as far as I
can go.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think I have
a fair knowledge of what bas been the consensus of opinion, in, Coun-cil when the mattor
bas come up, and I have a vague idea that

RAILWAY EMPLOYEES' WAGES
STATEMENT

ON ATTITUDE
GOVERNMENT

OF

PREVIOUS

Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON rose in accordance with the following notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate
to certain matters affecting railway employees
in Canada.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, it is not
my intention to discuss at length the subject referred to on the Order Paper, but I desire to call the attention of the House to a
statement that appeared in the press, on
the 19th of March, I think, concerning railway employees and the attitude and action
of a previous Government towards them. That
published statement was so greatly at variance with the facts that I felt constrained to
correct it.
I regret that I have not the clipping before
me, but, as I recall the statement, it was
supposed to be the utterance of a Minister
of the Crown, and was to the effect that
about the last act of the Government in
power in 1921 was to reduce the wages of
railway employees in Canada by $50,000,000
a year. Both Ottawa newspapers carried the
same report; so apparently the speaker was
correctly reported and there is no reason to.
criticize the press.
I want to state to the House and to the
country, because many complaints have come
to me in connection with the matter, that the
statement was wholly inaccurate. No such
thing ever occurred. The Government referred to never interfered in any way with
the compensation of railway employees in
Canada, except in 1918, when it co-operated
towards securing a substantial increase in

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAýNt: Raîsing them
to the level of the McAdoo Award.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes. In 1920
there, was a further increase in wages, both
in Canada and the United 'States, based on
the rise in the cost of living since 1918. But
in 1921 the cost of living in bo-th countries
was on the downward trend; by July of that
year there was a drop of about 35 points.
Railwav e'mployees in this country and in the
States we're then asked by their crnployers,
neot by the Government, to accept a reduction in wages of 12-z per cent, which was a
littie less than one-hiaîf of the decrease there
had been in the cost of living from 1920.
Those Iower wages went into effect in the
United States on the lst day of July, 1921,
and the railways in Canada proposed te make
their reductions effective on the samne date;
but it was pointed out to thenm by the Department of Labour, of which I happened to
be the adininistrator at that time, that under
our law certain notice had to be given before
the drop cciild become effective. The railwvays recognized that, and sorved the necessary notice upon their employees, and this
resuilted in postponing the deecese in wages
until the 16(hi of July. The net resuit of
the Gov-ernment's action in c-ausing this delay
in the' reduction of wages for twvo weeks wvas
a saving to the railway empîcyees of a littie
over $1.000.000, because the total decrease
wvas e8,000,000 a year, or a littie more than
$2,000,000 a inonth.
I felt t-hat so grave an exaggeration of facts,
purporting to have corne from so reliable a
source as a Minister of the Crown, ought flot
to be permnittecl to go uncontradicted, and
the ten million people in Canada be led to
bdsieve that the statement 'was truc. The
very opposite was true, because the Govero.ment cf Ilhat day 'assisted in getting reason-able
wages for the railw'ay emiplovees; it folilowed
a policy that was adopted in the LUnited States
at that timie, and gave the railway companies
ccmpen.saticn that enablcd them to grant increase-- i0 wage(s to the extent cf $5ý2000,000
a year. As I have statcd, there \vas a considerable reductioti in the cost of living in
1921, and in October cf tlîat year the railwav

Hon. G. D). ROB3ERTSON:
Mr. Chairman, when this Bill ivas befere the Sonate
prior tc the Easter rccss I made a rew remarks concerning the discentinuance of the
principle cf empîcycs ccntributing to the
pension fund, as the present law providcs. I
risc, net te criticize this Bill nt aIl, or to
oppose it in any wny, but rather to express
again the opinion that pensions on the contributory principle are highly desirable in
any industry, and are preferable to pensions
that are provided entirely by the emnplcyers.
In reference te Bill 2, that we have juat
passed, I had a feeling that it might bc Ivise
te make it clear, by a provision iinserted
therein, that if at any time je the future
the Canadian railways management and cm-

87

APRIL 10, 1929
ployees shouid agree that a contributory pension scheme ought ta be launched, such
legisiation would permit of that being done
without having to be submitted ta Parliament; but after a careful perusal of that
Bill I think it is quite clear that section 4,
respecting the rules and regulatians ta be
enacted by the parties, leaves the gate wide
enough open ta permit of any action of that
sort being taken if thought desirable.
Hawever, I do flot want ta let the appartunity pass withaut again expressing .the hope
that as time passes the Canadian National
Railways and their employees may see fit ta
arrange a real, solid, stable and sensible pension scheme on a contributory basis, and
thereby set an example that may be followed
by many other industries in Canada. In my
opinion nathing more surely tends ta better
understanding and a stronger spirit of cooperatian between employers and employees
than such a scheme, in which the parties are
mutually interested. The employees feel that
they are part owners of the pension fund and
should contribute ta it, and that ut will be
sufficient ta guarantee them against want in
their aid age. Such a schemne would be of
substantial benefit in regard ta the standard
of service that the employers receive, and
would alsa minimize industrial difficulties and
controversies tihat arise from time ta time.
Theref are I think the contributory pension
scheme ought nat ta be hast sight of. I trust
that the time wilh came when the management and the emplayees of this great national
system will decide ta undertake this plan.
When that time cames, I hope Parliament
may remnember that we discussed it ta-day,
and felt that Bill 2 was broad enough in its
provisians ta permit employers and employees ta make such an arrangement by
miitual consent, without referring it ta
Parliament for further consideration.
Right Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM:
Hanourable gentlemen, I may say that I endorse what my honouratile friend from
Welland has just said. I have been discussing that same idea in my awn business. My
manager and myseif are strongly of the view
that a cantributory scheme is the better ane
for securing mutual understanding. The aid
saying is true, that where a man's treasure
is, there is his heart alsa, and the persan
wha daes nat cantribute has not the same
interest as one wha does.

INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION
NATIONAL MINORiITIES
INQUIRY

AND

AND DISCUSSION

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER rose
in accordance with the following notice:
That he will draw the attention of the Goverument to certain matters reepecting international arbitration and the treatment of national minorities under the covenant of the
League of Nations and inqui-re -as to what action the Government of Canada has taken or
propose& to take in relation thereto, and will
move for the production of ail correspondence
with the British Government in connection with
the adhesion of Canada to the reciprocal clause
of the protocol of the Permanent Court of lnternational Justice.
Be said: Honourable gentlemen, the significance of the action which was taken by
this Bouse on the l5th of February, and by
the other Blouse on the l9th of February, is
the only reason which I have for asking
the attention of this Chamber for a few
moments this afternoon to some observations
in the way of comment upon the Peace
Treaty, or the Peace Pact, as we generally
eall it, and other matters in connection with
the work of the League of Nations, and whilst
in some respects my remarks may seem to be
a little crîtîcal, happily they are entirely unpartisan. In Canada, as ini Great Britain and
some other countries, upon this great question of world peace, parties are not divided,
and the leaders of ail parties concerned in the
administration of publie aiffairs are equally
strong and consistent in their support.

89

Sometimes I doubt whether I myseif have
had a proper appreciation of the significance
of so outstanding a fact ais that which was
demonstrated on the l5th and the l9th of
February in the two Chambers of this Parliament. It is an outstanding fact in the history
of this young nation, and it is an outstanding
fact in the history of the world. I also douht
whetber we have ahl of us, myseif included,
really analyzed the Pact itself so as to perceive. its truc significance. The thought which
cornes to our minds when we speak of it is
that iA is a condemnation of war, and that
idea rather overshadows and obscures the
equally dominant fact brought into notice in
the second article of the Pact, which, te my
mind, is far the more important of the two.
It will not harma us to read thern.
Article 1: The Bigh Contracting parties
solemanly declaxe in the names of their respective peoples that they condern recouýrse to, war
for the solution of international controversies,
and renounce it as an instrument of national
poliey in their relations with one another.
It is something for us as' individuals, after
consideration, te conden a certain course
of conduct, and to say that we condemn it;
but I think we rnust ail eonfess that in our
individual experience we sometirnes condemu
a in-e of conduet, but do net renounce it.
The nations of the world, on casting their
eye back over the history of hurnonity frorn
its earliest stages, and seeing that during that
whole long history it hnts been the international practice, regarded by every nation as
a right, to obtain ils objectives and seutle dis,putes by the arbitrament. of war, have to-day
corne to a different conclusion and said, "We
condemn that international practice which
bas existed frern the earliest tirnes until the
present day." There is significance in that
fact, but it is still more to the peint that
they, after having condemned the practice,
renounoe it for ail future time. Having condluded that the international practice bas
been wreng, they net only denounce it, but
they aIse say, "For the future we reneunce
that method, and will net have recourse te
That is a very inclusive and pregnant
declaration, but it is only a declaration, and
if it stopped there the Pact would indeed be
littîn more than a gesture., though it is always
a refreshing and strengthening element for a
inan or a nation te corne te a conclusion on a
principle or line of conduct.
Now we cerne te the second part of the
pact, and I will read that:
The High Contracting Parties agree that the
settlement or solution of all disputes or conflicte, of whatever nature, or of whatever enigin
they may he-

90

SENATE

No language coulld be more inclusive.
-which may arise amoag them, shall never be
sought except by pacifie means.
Which, put in the affirmative, is: " shall always bc souglt by pacific means." Therefore
this second article of the pact is to my mind
practical and important, and an indispensable
part of an enunciation or undertaking which
is meant to be practical in results.
The first part is simply a declaration with
reference to what bas been a course of international conduct: it is a renunciation of
that course for the future. The second part
is really an agreement or contract: having
condemned and renounced war as an international agency, we now pledge ourselves and
make a contract with one another that henceforth we, as nations, will never have recourse
to war to settle our difficulties, but will settle
them by pacifie means.
Do we grasp the full significance of the fact
that Canada, having made that statement,
bas now established the fundamental basis of
her international policy for all ber future
years? We are a few millions now, we shall
bo tons of millions hereafter, and at some
time or other we may be bundreds of millions,
but however far we go, there is the national
road of international policy on which we have
placed our feet firmly, and along which we
have made up our minds to travel.
That is not merely a contract undertaken
by Canada with the United States, though I
have found some people have that idea of it
because of the precedent negotiations. Nor is
it a contract made by Canada with France
and the United States. We have to rise te
the idea that it is an agreement, a contract,
which bas been made by Canada with practically every other nation of the world; that
with each of them we have joined hands
and pledged our faith that, whatever differences may arise between us, we will seek the
solution of them, net by war, but only by
pacifie means.

That is a far-reaching international understanding. In nature it is like the understanding that mv friend Mr. Graham and myself
have as nationals of Canada. Suppose that
our estates, small as they are, conjoin, and
that difficulties arise between him and myself
as to certain markings of our line fences and
other conditions. It is a great thing for Mr.
Graham and myself to know that. whatever
happens, we are not going to fight about it.
That conviction is ingrown in us, because it
has beon established in practice and custom on
the plane to which humanity bas attained in
social and national affairs, and it helps us to
settle our difficulties. The other assurance
that we bave is this: I hold my right, my
1Ilght Hon. Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

friend holds his, and we know that if we
cannot agree there are means and methods
provided by which we may determine the
question according to the rules of equity, justice and fair-play between man and man.
That is the sort of relationship that Canada
is to have for the future with other nations
in the world. We know that whatever happens in the way of dispute or difference, we
are net going to fight about it, but must
settle it by pacific means, and consequently
the settlement becomes so much easier. These
are thoughts which, if we allow our minds to
rest lpon them, have within them a power,
a tendency and an impulse to make us look
upon this thing not as a mere gesture but as
something very real, very vital, and tremendously important in Canadian history, and in
the history of the world.
Another thing that I think we have a right,
as proponents and supporters of the League of
Nations, to take into account, for our comfort,
is the fact that this Pact itself, with all the
support given to it, is in direct line with the
work of the League of Nations itself.
A
much smaller number of people than are now
supporting the League undertook ten or twelve
years ago this magnificent and wonderful
plan of regulating international affairs by
peace mothods and according to the rules of
justice, and not by force, by war, by slaughter,
and by intolerable expenditures.
There was
less faith in the world then with reference to
the outcome of the proposal than there is now,
and for the initial years it bas been uphill
work to maintain our own confidence and
enlarge the area of confidence and support
among those about us. To-day this Pact
comes as an absolute vindication of the
principles and work of the League of Nations
itself, which in ten toilsome years bas built
up an organization acknowledged throughout
the worid as an indispensable piece of
machinery for international relations and for
the peace of the world.

It is also our privilege to recite the fresh
support boing gradually evolvedi
for the principles of the League of Nations and the
principles embodied in the Pact itself. The
facts are enýcouraging, and it is our duty
to think of them and use them for our
encouragement.
Take the United States of America itself.
A new President bas been installed.
We
keep in mind Harding, Coolidge and Hoover,
and in the course of the two past presidencies
and the one now commenced there is traversed
pretty nearly the historic lifetime of the
League of Nations.
In Mr. Hoover's inaugural there are some points that I wish to
emphasize.
Recollect that because of party

APRIL 11, 1929
difference, and perhaps lack of sagacious
tact, the League of Nations at its inception
was faced by opposition in the United States
of America which without doubt prevented
that country from ratifying the treaties and at
that time entering the World Court of the
League of Nations. There followed a time
when the United States Senate, on the
recommendation of Mr. Harding, and afterwards of President Coolidge, made a move
towards an entry into the World Court, as
I shall call it, and with certain reservations,
five in number, the Senate passed a resolution authorizing the Government to enter the
World Court if those reservations were
complied with. All the reservations except
one-half of the fifth were fully accepted.
With reference to that one-half of the fifth
it was felt that it struck so closely at the
efficacious working of the League of Nations
through its Court that it could not be complied with; but a proposition in answer to
that was framed and sent as a communication
to the United States Senate. That was in
1926, and the net result of aIl of it was that
the United States were granted four of the
reservations and one-half of the fifth that
they placed in their resolution; and with
reference to the latter half of the fifth, the
offer was made to put them in a position of
exact equality with every member of the
League who undertook to share its responsibilities and its workings. From 1926 until a
very late date that communication was not
even answered or acknowledged, and about
two years ago President Coolidge, in a speech
that he made somewhere in a western city,
declared that no further action would be taken
by him with reference to the matter, and that
the entrance of the United States into the
Wforld Court was practicalily a dead issue.
In President Hoover's inaugural address I
find this:
Firat, with reference to the Pact itself, the
recent treaty for the renunciation of war as an
instrument of national policy sets an advanced
standard in ouT conception of the relation of
nations. Its acceptance would pave the way
to a greater limitation of armaments, the offer
of which we sincerely extend to the world.
That is an expression of good-will-of a disposition to carry on negotiations with reference
to the diminution of armaments in the spirit
of good-will and of international amity.
President Hoover then alludes to the World
Court, and makes a most significant statement
After remarking
in connection therewith.
that a World Court was the desire and policy
of American statesmen for many years, he
says this with reference to that Court:
No more potent instrumentality for this purpose has ever been conceived, and no other

91

is practicable of establishment. The reservations placed upon our adherence should not be
misinterpreted. The United States seeks by
those reservations no special privilege or advantage, but only to clarify our relations to
advisory opinions and other matters which are
subsidiary to the major purposes of the Court.
A way should and, I believe, will be found by
which we may take our proper place in a
movement so fundamental to the progress of
peace.
We couqd scarcely ask for a more candid and
complete statement of approval than that
which we have here from the executive head
of the United States.
Since then, -Mr. Kellogg has opened negotiations with the nations signatory to the Covenant of the League of Nations, and with the
Secretary of the League, and has suggested in
effect a further conference or further negotiations with a view to the entry of the United
States into the World Court. Mr. Root bas
functioned in Geneva on the mission for which
he was chosen by the League of Nations, which
was to revise the articles of the World Court;
but he bas also submitted a plan or scheme
by which the differences between the United
States and the signatories to the League of
Nations might be overcome, and the United
States thus enter into that Court. Not only
bas this proposal been approved by the jurists
appointed to revise the articles of the World
Court, but it bas also met with the unanimous
approval of the Geneva authorities of the
League. It bas been amended in a degree by
the British representatives, and the amendment has been acceded to by Mr. Root. The
matter is now before the government of the
United States for consideration. I regard that
as a great move forward in support both of
the League and of the Pact by the great
nation to the south of us.
But the United States, within the last few
months, bas made another advance, which
we may not have noticed. As we all know,
a Pan-American Association bas existed for
some years and bas been very fertile in resolutions of good-will, if not in the practical
application of those principles upon which it
bas based its resolutions. But at the sixth
and latest meeting of the Pan-American
Association, in Havana, definite steps were
taken in a forward movement. It was decided there to renounce war as an instrument
in the settlement of international disputes
among the republics of South and North
America; and a resolution was passed authorizing the calling of a convention to meet
in Washington shortly afterwards, to prepare
two draft treaties for submission to all the
republics. One of these draft treaties was
to govern the handling of all juridical disputes, whatever they might be, that might

revolution. There is no wa.r. But there is
iiegotiation, which may ut times become
somewhat heated, but which. results in the
parties getting their rights by pacfiec means.
How natural, after humanity has travelled
s0 far forward in the peaceful settlement of
disputes, that it should at hlast carry the principles of conciliation and arbitration to the
final sphere of international relationships,
modifying the old practices, and perfecting the
machinery with whiclh all disputes shall be
settled by the principles of justice, equity and
good-wi-Il rather than by tihe antiquated
methods of force of arms and slaughter. la
flot that a natural Vhing? Aye, is it not an
inescapable evolution? It is the inevitable,
the irresistible growth of humanity froim
century to century, from age to, age, from
the lower to the higber. It may be delayed,
but it cannot be reeisted if humanity is to
triumph in the end. My strongest basis
of confidence and hope in tii new thing is
that it has the urge of the ages behind it,
and that the powers of immortal forces are
attracted toward 'it.
But in our nation-our Canada, our United
States, our Great Britain-notwithstanding ahl
that bas been gained in peaceful relationships,
in equity, justice. law, and machiner 'y for their
execution, we still have bandits, mnurderers,
burglars; we even have organized and comnmercialized criminality. Yet nobody, because
of these disturbances and exceptions, would
wish to overthrow the principhe which was
so long fougbt for and at last attained. So
in the international plane there may be minor
wars; there will be difficulties and troubles,
some of themn tremendously acute; and for
many years any doubter may be able to get
up on his two legs and- say: "Notîwithstanding
your League of Nations and your pacts of
peace, see what -is going on. Look at Mexico;
iook at China; look here and there and everywhere." But that is aîl by the way, and no
argument at ahl againsi the forward trend and
the main point.
Now, what are the next steps that we
sbould take? Here I must restrict myself
somewhat, partly because of lack of information; and it may be that 1 shaîl give utterance
to a little quiet, brotherly criticism. for a
course which is or is not being pursued.
What are the next steps? If I have not
pressied. the argument, 1I think honourable
gentlemen will be able to press it home,' that
we cannot stay where we are. Is it not plain
that we are to go forward? And we are to
go forward in doing what? In moulding the
sentiment of Canada, in shaping the policy
of the administration of Canada so that it
shall not be antagonistic to the great prin-

uâ

ciples which underlie the League of Nations
and the Peace Pact, but shall be in accordance therewith. 1 think no one will dispute that dictum. 1 tbink that if we are
true to ourselves and are flot simply using
words and gestures, but have the root of the
matter in us, as I believe we have, we must
follow such a course.
What are the next steps that Canada has
to take? We must disillusionize ourselves
in a great many ways. 1 cannot look f orward
one hundred years, nor even fifty years, and
see the world with these immense departments organized and conducted for the sole
purpose of waging war. W'e cannot proceed
towards disillusionmient by leaps and bounds,
and dispense suddenly with a systern which
is the growth of centuries upon centuries,
but gradually that adaptation of measures
and policies to the principles of the Pact and
of the League of Nations will resuit in the
complete reorganization of our naval and
milit«rý departRmental work, our public affairs,
our national expenditures, and the uines of
endeavour in wbidh we arTe enlisting thousands of our oitizens for a wihole lifetirne
of effort and energy. That will corne about
gradually, but corne it must, and begin it
should at the very present moment and not
a minute later.
As the League of Nations is flot a party
matter and is not established in the interest
purely of one class against another, but is
designed to function for the benefit of al
classes, I think it is a fair thing to suggcst
that the Government, dispensing with partisan
motives for the time being, and actuated solely
by the desire to 'benefit the whole country,
should take some action in helping to infoýrn
the Canadian people of what this ail means,
and the methods by which it is proposed to
carry out the purposes and aims of the League
of Nations and the Pence Pact. When you
give twenty millions of dollars a year for
military purposes, and several millions besides
for naval and other war purposes, it is only
fair that something should be done to inf orm.
our people, who are woefully lacking in real
understanding of what this all means, and to
change their mentality from a war to a peace
n.entality.
Leaving that for the moment, 1 think that a
secondary step should be taken by Canada to
carry on the good work nationally, and that we
should avail ourselves of all tlie possibilities
presented to us by flie Piact and by the League
of Nations. What I say with reference to our
own country ,is equally pertinent to every
other country in the world. Probably there
is not a counitry in the wide world in which
someone is not now makimg a plea similar
to the one I am making here.

SENATE

Now, wbat hiave wxc? Canada is ton years
01(1 if the L'eague, and yet she bas flot pronouniced her adherence to the compulsory
clause cf the Pretocol of the Tribunal of
International Justice. Is it becausc the Canadian Governmcnt as at prcsent constituted
are opposed to it? I think I bave read, if I
have not heard tbeir utterances, that they are
ail in faý'our cf that step. Why is it flot
takeon?
Is there any good reason wby we
should not tako it? Twenty-nino nations of
the world bav e alroady taken the stop, amongst
themi Germany and France and other very
important nations. Why flot Canada? I have
just told you that the United States cf
Anierica, a power cf 120,000,000 cf people witb
trernendous interests at stake, have already
affirmed their adberence to that principle as
far as the repubies cf North and South
America are concerned. If the United States
can, without reserve, take that stop in combinatien witb nations such as are te lic found in
the continents~ of North and South America,
surely C-inada mighit trust herseif in reference
to that matter te a court cf which she approves and in wbichi shie bas undoubted confidence.
I shall be to]d that Canada bas nct done.
se hecause Great Britain bas net donc so. I
would likçe, in cer-tain instances, te sec Canada set a gocd e'çample te Great Britain. But
I do nlot take it that Great Britain bas cvcr

APRIL 11, 1929
the motion, se that the person of the representative would be lSat in the background. Weii,
il it were a stop t.aken by the Governiment
itself, whieh in this case is acting flot as a
pa.rty Govemnment, but for C-anadýa as a wbele,
why was it th-at when there was ample time
neither the House of Cômmons nier the Senate
was advised, s0 that it might make helipful
suggestions, or at ieast be seized of the
information?
Then 1 ask-ed myself another question-and
information on ail these points wil'l be given
to m.e by my honouirable friend: was the other
member of the Empire who is a member of
the Gouncil consulted, and was it in agreement
as te the step which was Vo be tiaken? Alter
ail, we are .teuchy. If Great Britain, wi'thouit
giving us full information, and without full
consultation, does anytbing in a matter of
this kind, which is so vital, so important, s0
extremely delicate, what then? I think there
is something Vo be said in reference te thjat.
When my bonourable friend gives me the
information asked for we shaili have another
copportunity of forming our judgment. For
my part, I -have formed no judgment -up to
the present time; and I amn noV disposed to
forrn a hasty judgment in this matter. It
may he that the very best thing has been
done in the very best manner; at the same
time I feel that I must make thýese few
observations.
Furthermore, we have la Canada the
League of Nations Society, a body of able
and disinterested men and women froma al
provinces and ail parts of the Dominion.
That body was in annual session. My honourable friend was here, and had that project
in his mmnd. It would have beea the fair
thing for bima to place it before that Society
to secure their opinion upon it, for after ail,
none of us can become too wise by gathering
counsel fromn ail possible sources.
Now, having said practically ail that I want
te say, I will end with the observation that if
my remarks have any effect I hope it will be
aloag the lines of making us sit down to
seriously consider this question. We have not
done that. There are througbout Can-ada, and
in this House and in the other House, many
good people who have not really considered
the obligations that we have undertaken, or
the opportunities whicb lie at our thresbold.
We must do that la order to be true to ourselves and true to the world in which we as
a natioa are now taking se honourable and
forward a part.
Hon. J. P. B. CASORAIN: Honourable
gentlemen, I mise simply te ask the right
honourable gentleman (Right Hon. Sir George

E. Foster) a few questions. We have been
so cbarmed by his eloquence that it is really
a pity to spoil the love feast. The right
honourable gentleman talks of peace. Surely
he must have been asleep for the last few
years, or else he bas not been reading the
papers. He talks, for instance, of the Kellogg
Pact, which was written probably by Mr.
Aristide 13riand, and banded around by Sec-.
retary Kellogg of tbe United States. What
if evemybody did sigu it? Why not? "Dû
you want war?" Everybody said ne. Nobody wants war. Mr. Kellogg migbt just as
weIl have gone around and asked, "Would
you like to have fice weather?" Everybody
would be in favour of nice weather.
But a question that I want to ask the
right honourable gentleman, who seems te
have spent the last ten years of bis life on
the League of Nations, is this: Wby did Mr.
Kellogg and Mr. Briand together prepare an
instrument and bave everybody siga it? The
League of Nations bas been carrying on at
tremendous expense for the Iast ten years.
Why was this net; signed by the League? I
arn putting that question te the rigbt honourable gentleman, but perhaps someone eise may
answer it.
The right honourable gentleman speaks cf
twenty-nine nations, but there is ne such
number as twenty-nine; there are oaly eight
nations, and the other states exist by the goodwill ef those eight. He says the Germans
signed for peace. 0f course they would siga
for peace, because they have been disarmed,
and until they geV up an army they will be
ahl for pea.ce; everybedy knows that. But
what dees the rigbt honourable gentleman
tbink about the "'scrp of paper"? Sixrely he
remembers that. And there will be more scraps
of paper, likely. What is the importance of
ail tbese instruments? .There is only one
effective instrument, and that is might. Tbat
is the only thing that rules, and bas ruled
since the womld began, and will ruie as long
as the worldf lasts; there is no doubt about
that. The "scrap of paper" seems now te be
forgotten and people are taking the signature
ef Germnany seriously when they kaow that
that nation in tbe last war repudiated wbat it
signed. Wbat guarantee have we that the
Germans have ohanged, their mentality? Why
should there be any difference now? Here is
a nation that bas heen set on war since the
year 800, from the time cf the old German
Empire. There is where the wars have nearly
always originated. There is where the Huns
came from. They are a warlike people, and
they will remain a warlike people as long as
any of thema are left.

SENATE
Now, in regard f0 the great republic to the
south, wvhat is thc boncst answer about the
K~ellogg Paer? Mr. Coolidge want.s, thirteen
new cruisers. Does that look like peacc?
Right
Fifteen.

Hon. Sir GEORGE

E. FOSTER:

Hon. Mr. CASCRAIN:
Ail right, fiffeen
rîew cruisers. I xvanted to be conservative.
Only yesterday we wcre reading about other
instruments of war. The illustrated papers
are filcd with pictures of the biggcst guns, up
to 18 loches, whcreas evden the Queen Elizabeth during tbe last w'ar biad only 16-inch
guns. Does that look like peace? It is pleasant to hear to-day that nobody wanf s war,
but wby sing tbese songs of peace when nations are arming? It is like a, man walking
along heside yoiî with a xxapnn in bis hand,
and saying, "I arn your friend," while be
sharpens bis daggcr or loads bis revolver.
Now about England. If seems that Article
10 of the League of Nations covenant was
desircd so thaf England might be called upon
f0 police
the world. But if costs the faxpayers of England immense sums to keep lip
the navy, and wiïv should it be placcd at the
bock and cail of natfions that bave nonai,
andl (Io flot wanf to pay for navies?. Why
sholuld we bave f0 police the whole world
excepf for oursolves? That Article 10 is still
in the L'cague agreement. I remember th'it
one of the most distinguished Canadians, the
late Sir Lomer Gouin, tried to have an interpretat ion placed on it and thaf went through
the various stages at the League uintil it got
to the lasf hurdle, and tben it fell down. It
had to be passed unanimously, but if was
blocked hv whom dIo you tbink? Tbe Shabof
Persia. He would not agrec to if, and ail fbe
work wenf for notbing.
The right bonourable gentleman spoke of
the Pan-American Union.
0f course thaf
Union works.
I visited one place wvbere tbey
had at onc time a chair from Canada,
prcscnted by a gentleman wbo had visited
Canada and cnjoycd the bospifalify of Quebec,
including the Qucbec Lîquor Commission, and
be w'as invifing us to join.
I said to him,
"You bad bett-er go and ask the parent of
this nation-ask Englind, because we are not
free to make any alliances like that."
So
the chair bas been reTnoved from its offices
tbere.
But this Pan-American Union has the
Ameiican fleet bebind if, and the Ameriran

Wben there was trouble lately befweeo Bolivia and Paraguay the League of

honourable gentleman may rest assurcd that
there is soine valid reason, wvhich explains
and justifies the present delay.
I might remind my right honourable friend
that in March, 1924, Canada informed the
League of Nations that it could flot adhcre
to the Protocol, but declared that it was
considering favourably the advisability of
adhering to the optional clause. The Government bas not changed its mind on that
subject, and altbough it had qgreed to suspend action the right honourable the Prime
Minister, speaking for the Cabinet, declarcd
that Canada was proceeding towards that
goal.
My right honourable friend has asked why
Canada, or the Government, either in Ibis
House or the other, bad not expressed its
intention of moving for a modification of the
procedure appiied to the disposai of complaints of minorities before the Council. The
reason appeared to the Gcverniment to bc a
simple one. The notice gix'en by the representative of -Canada at Lugano in December
last bore exciosîvelv on the question of
proccAure, whieh question had aiready corne
before the, Courncil in varions forma since 1920.
Tlîat sanie question hiad aIse been frequcntly
discusseci hefore, the Asýsembly.
My riglit
honourable friend knows that Canada's representat ion in the Couril is dite to the
will cf the Assemblv; Gînada-- must draw its
inspiration from the Assembly. At its, last
reunion, in Septeraber, 1928, that same question raiseci quite an important debate. Some
suggestion was made that there should be a
perin:incint
cornmitîce
on
minorities.
It
semied elear, from the discussion whieh took
place, that no unanimity could be obtainod
for ýzuch a proposition.
So thie Canadi'in
delegate, x'ho had had eighteen months' experience in the Counecil, and had been for the
tsame lengthi of time a member of the Commiliee of three which had charge of the
exarnination of comphcînts from mînorîties,
feit th:ît hc should bring before the Council
sorne suggestions for the reform of the procedure followed.
It is reckoncd that before the war there
were some 100 millions of people outside their
national ethinical groups fi roughout Europe,
mostly uneler Germ:in, Austro-Hungarian, 'mnd
IRu.'.i'n rule; and thlat as a rcuit of the war
there were liherated front foreign rule some
80 millions of people, cornposed of Polos,
Tugo-SI vs, Rournianians, the peoples in the
newvlv-for-medl republics aiong the Baltic, and
French, Itatians, and others. But it secms

many becamo minorities becatise of geographical reasons, and unfortunately in some
;mtances because of strategical and üooniomti
reasons which had to be taken into consideration when the various treaties were signed
after the war, in and around Paris. Some of
those minorities who recently were dominating have become dominated.
When tbc
Allies ivere drawing lines tbrougb countries
and changiog frontiers, they felt that wben
a million or two of people were being detached from their ethnical groups and put
under foreigýn rule, some protection of their
civil rights, their religins tenets and their
language should be granted.
Fourteen countries have accepted clauses in
the treaties wbich create tbemn or which increase
their possessions.
These clauses are called

I must remind this Chamber that the treaties concerning those minorities were flot entered into by the respective Governments and
their nationals, but were treaties that the
Governments of those nations entered into
with the Allies. Sa that the claim. is made
by those nations that the minorities are flot

and that the latter are obligated only ta the'
Allies or the powers with whom they made
the agreement.

Here is the clause which governs the matter:
The country concerned(Each treaty cofitaifis here the naine of the
country coflcerfled.)
-agrees that the stipulations in the articles
in question, so f ar as they affect persons belongiug ta racial, religions or linguistie minorities, constitute obligations of international concern antI shall le place-d under the guarantee
of the League of Nations...
Thec country concerned agrees that any member of the Council of the League of Nations
shall have the right to bring ta the attention
of the Concil any infraction or danger of infr.action of these provisions, and the Council
may thereupon take such action and give such
instructions as it may deem proper and effective in the circum.stances.
This has been interpreted by the nations
that are thus obligated as gîving fia rights
ta the minorities ta appear before the Council and complain of the violation of any of
the rigbts which were guaranteed ta them.
Those nations from the outset said that these
minority clauses were restrictive of their
sovereignty, and were not being applicd. ta
the world at large. They claimed that these
enactmnents should be interpreted restrietively. They contended that fia minority
could dlaima the right ta go before the Council with its grievance, but that any individual
in that minarity could give. the necessary
information ta any member of the Council
who would be willing ta assume the responsibility of înforming the Council of the violation of a Treaty obligatian.
Under th-ose conditions no complaints ould

Czecho-Slovakia, who officîally notified the
Sec'retariat that they were agreeable ta it
although according ta, their interpretation it
went beyond the ternis of the clause of the
Treaty which I have read. This complaint
or information would be examined by a
committee of three. That committee of tbree
was not ta decide anytlhing, but si.mply
ta receive that information and examine the
observations by the government conoerned;
and the three members, or any one of themn,
could decide that there was sufficient cause for
a grievance ta be laid before the Council.

These commi-ttees of threc-and I may say
that 1 have sat on many of them, and arn
just now on three or four-examine the information of the minority and the observations of the government. The observations of
the governmcnt are not transmitted ta thc
complainant. It is true that the committee
may ask for supplcmentary information froin
the government, but honourable gentlemen
will realize the state of mind of those minoritics who have sent petitions and who remain
in total ignorance of what has been donc,
except in cases wbere the action of the coinmittee of three bas brougbt about a change
in the situation complained of. Since 1921
there hes not been from these committees
of three a single report ta the Council stating
Ihat there is matter for investigation. Sa those
minorities hav e been, from the beginning, in
the dark as ta what has taken place. They
have sent in thieir petitions, but they do not
know whether they have been received. Because of the procedure which they know ta
exis't, theiy may surmise that their complaint
has been communioated ta the gavernment.

that on tbe question of publicity something
should be done to improve tbe present situation. The debate w~as closed 'by a reply from
the Canad-ian delegate. The ambassador of
Japan, who is the rapporteur on minorities,
presented the next day the resolution whicb
appears at the end of the discussion.
[Followring are tbe reports of the discussion
wbicb took place at the Fifty-fourth Session
of tbe Council of tbe League of Nations at
Geneva on Marcb 6, 1929:
2375. Protection of Minorities: Procedure
applicable to Minorities Petitions.
Mr. Dandurand submitted tbe following
1
memorandum :
.The Council bas more than once considered
the procedure to be followed in the discharge of
the duties entrusted to it by the treaties with
respect to the protection of minorities.
"It may be well to re-examine this question
in the light of experience.
"In interpreting these treaties, the Council
has laid down that the minorities have no legal
personality enabling thýem to submit their comnplaints direct to the Council, but that aIl that
they can do is to forward individually to the
'Document C.51 (r). M. 36 (1). 1929. 1.

101

Members of the Couneil information on the
basis of which one or more of those Members
can refer the complaint to the Council in their
own names.
"This view was based on the following text:
-'[The country concernedil agrees that the
stipulations in the articles [in question], so f ar
as they affect persons belonging to racial,
religious or linguistie minorities, constitute
obligations of international concero and shahl
be placed under thé guarantee of the League of
Nations... [Tlie country concernedi agrees that
any Mvember of the Council of the League of
Nations shaîl have the right to bring to the
attention of the Council any infraction, or any
danger of infraction, of any of these obligations.
and that the Council may thereupon take such
action and give sucb direction as it may deem
proper andl effective in the circumstances.'
"Had this narrow interpretation of the
treaties been in no way modified, it would have
been the duty of every Member either to forward the information automatically to the
Council or to make a preliminary enquiry on
bis own account.
"Before a Member can act, he must necessarily
receive information from the complainant. Al
the Members of the Council may receive the
same complaint, in whicb case they are al
equally obliged to ascertain whether it is weil
founded.
"The Council took the view that the duty
of each Member became the duty of the Council
as a wbole, and agreed that the information
sbould be received by the Secretariat, and that
a Committea of Three should be set up to
examine the allegations made. The SecretaryGeneral, in a note submîtted to the Council on
June lOtb, 1926. 2 explains the relations between
the petitioner on the one band and the SecretaTiat anid the Council on the other. The substance of this note is set forth below.
"The Secretariat gives an entirely formai
acknowledgment of receipt of the petition, and
does, not state whetber it bas been beld to be
receivable. If the petition is beld by the Secretariat ta be receivable, it is communicated ta
the interested Government for observations, and
is circulated to aIl the Members of the Council.
The Presîdent then calîs upon two of his
colleagues to examine the documents with him.
If the question is then referred to the Council
hy the Conimittee of Three, aIl the documents
relating to the case are accessible ta the public,
but, if this procedure is not followed, the
petitioner is not informed of the contents of the
observations of the interested Government on
his petition, either by the Cornmittee uf Tbree
or by the Secretariat. If the Minorities Comnmittee (the Comniittee of Tbree) does not refer
the question to the Council, the matter rests
there, and the Secretariat does not inform the
petitioner of the resuit of bis petition.
"This procedure bas not given satisfaction ta
the minorities, wbieb neyer cease protesting
tbrougb aIl the channels at tbeir disposal.
Altbough the metbod bas yield-ed good result8, it
leaves the mincrity under the impression that
its case bas not been beard and that it is beinz
victimised by the inaction or indifference of the
Council. The minority complains, but is left
ignorant wbat action, if any, bas been taken on
its representations. Its complaint; is generally
referred ta its Goveroment. but the latter's
reply is neyer communicated to the minority.

upon their sovereignty vis-à-vis the other

"These countries should not forget that they
have thus contributed to the establishment

regarded as an honour to the twentieth century.

the minorities treaties obliged at least morally,
to respect the same principles, and were not
these principles unanimously accepted by the

With regard to the resolution proposed by
M. Benes in 1924 whereby the Council went
into Comnittee te draw up the programme of
the preparatory w-ork for a Conference for the
Reduction of Armaments (see above), Mr. Dandurand observed that, if he were not mistaken,
this general Committee of the Council had included other experts and that it had sat for
more than two years.
He added that, in submitting these proposais
to the Council, lie had been actuated by a sense
of justice and by a desire to do his duty towards the League of Nations.

Without doubt,

To dispel all doubts and to remove any
semblance of justification for fears which had
beçn so often expressed, Canada was endeavouring, in a spirit of complete disinterestedness, to
contribute to the solution of the minority problem.

powers should be extended, for he appreciated
the fact that a Member could not be bound to
lay a complaint before the Council. He felt,
however. that the least which the minorities
were entitled to expect from the Council was
that all its Members should be in a position to
acquaint themselves with the facts.

APRIL 11, 1929
result they have grave fears as to the future
of their civilization. It is easily understood
that the disappointment which they have had
to endure has expressed itself in strong criticism of the organizations of the League. This
is not the first time that such criticism has led
to long discussion within the League itself.
It appears, however, that every effort made
to remedy the existing sbortcomings bas encountered basic objections which might cause
public opinion to believe that the League desires to deviate from the principle whic formas
the basis of the protection of minorities.
I cannot refrain at this point from referring
to the statement made by a former Rapporteur
to the Council in 1925. That statement had
a considerable effect, as did also the Council's
discussion which followed it. In that statement, and in the discussion, certain fundamental views are to be found regarding the
object of the provisions for the protection of
minorities and the guarantee exercised by the
League of Nations. These views can be interpreted as meaning that such provisions are
intended to some extent to cover a kind of
transition period before the final disappearance
of minorities as such-that is to say, to cover
the period up to the time when the minorities
would be absorbed by the majority of the
population of the State to which they belonged.
If these declarations were really interpreted
in some way as a theory of assimilation-as
certain observations made at later sessions
of the Council might lead me to believe-I,
at any rate, should be compelled energetically
to oppose such a view. A theory of this kind
is contrary to the idea-which was definitely
put forward when the new systea was instituted-that the protection afforded to minoritics is of a permanent nature and not merely
sonething which covers a transition period
instituted in ord-er to overcome temporary
difficulties.
In this connection, another point of principle
arises. At the moment, the existing procedure
is confined to dealing with petitions addressed
to the League. No institution or procedure
exists, apart from petitions, for putting into
operation, in a general manner, the guarantee
entrusted to the League. There can, however, be no doubt that that guarantee cannot
be limited to settling concrete cases in which
the actual or threatened violation of the rights
of minorities bas been brought te the knowledge
of the League of Nations.
The fundamental report of 1920 to which
I have already referred explicitly states that
it is the duty of the League of Nations to
assure itself that the provisions for the protection of minorities are constantly applied.
This idea has perhaps also inspired certain
suggestions for the establishment of a Percanent Minorities Committee. It seems to me
in any case necessary to take into account the
way in which the League of Nations may keep
itself continuously informed as to the situation
of minorities.
The provisions for the protection of minoritics imply a duty which it is neither impossible
nor beneath the dignity of a Sovereigin State
to fulfil. The fact of belonging to a minority
and the special position resulting from that
fact are certainly in no way incompatible with
the acconplishment of the duties of a loyal
citizen towards his State. This being so, it
equally follows that the interest taken by a
country in the minorities of another country,

tUâ

an interest which may take the form of an
appeal to the guarantee of the League of Nations, cannot be regarded as an inadmissible
political interference with the domestie affairs
of a foreign Power.
I am well aware of the political considerations which are urged against the ideas which
I have just developed. It is said, for example,
that the rights of minorities may have the
effect of supporting a movement which is
directed against the integrity of the State
and that it nay lead to an irredentist agitation.
Frankly, I do not think that we have in the
present century established a condition of
affairs which is eternal, and that idea is very
clearly expressed in the Covenant of the League
of Nations. These, however, are considerations
which have nothing to do with the question of
minorities to which our attention is now devoted. It is quite a mistake te say that, in
supporting the rights and the educational
liberties of ninorities, use is being made of
a weapon with which to break up States. The
peace between nations will be all the more
stable in proportion as the appeal of minorities
threatened in their cultural life is more widely
reflected in the public opinion of the world.
Anyone who works in defence of the rights of
a man to his mother tongue, and of the maintenance of his race and religion, without
prejudice to nations or frontiers, is working
at the saine time for the maintenance of peace,
-and not with a view to provoking excitement
and violence. States composed of several races
and cultures, sometimes of recent creation,
will lose nothing of their importance or prestige
by offering an example in this field. I would
point as an example to the fortunate country
in which we are at present meeting, where,
in spite of differences of race, language and
religion, love of a common country, which has
become rooted for many centuries among the
people, has never been disturbed.
What methods must the League of Nations
adopt, in conformity with existing treaties and
guarantees, in order to attain the object whieh
we have in mind?
I have already referred to the necessity of
forming a clear idea of the way in which the
guarantee may be realized even outside the
sphere of petitions.
As regards the treatment of petitions themselves. Mr. Dandurand's memorandum emphasizes that the procedure followed by the
Council. the essential point of which is the
institution of Committees of Three, gives rise
among the petitioning minorities to the impression that their grievances are not heard
and that they are the victims of the inactivity
or indifference of the Council. This impression
is due to the fact that the minorities learn
nothing of the steps taken to deal with their
complaints and more particularly remain
ignorant of the attitude adopted by their
own Governments. This is one of the principal
shortconings of which the minorities have
unanimously complained for a long while. The
means by which Mr. Dandurand endeavours
to overcome this difficulty are extremely interesting and deserve our most caxeful attention.
I should be happy to contribute to a settlement of this question by explaining in outline
my own ideas on this matter. Those ideas
point in the same direction as Mr. Dandurand's.
At the time of their institution, the Committees of Three were entrusted with the task
of facilitating, on behalf of the members of

APRIL 11, 1929
which I desire to attain and which I recommend to the serious examination of the Council
is, first, a careful study of the existing possibilities for an improvement of the procedure
Secondly, I would ask
applied to petitions.
that the participation of certain interested
nations should be considered instead of their
exclusion as hitherto. Thirdly, it is necessary
to examine in what way the League of Nations
can accomplish its duties as a guarantor outside
the sphere of petitions. Finally, I think it
of importance that the principles of the guarantee assuned by the League of Nations should
be elucidated in the spirit which I have just
indicated.' I quite realize that this is too great
and too important a task for us to be able to
settle it finally during the present session of
the Council. We must, however, make a beginning with this task. It seems to me that the
best way of dealing with it would be the
appointment of a special committee of inquiry.
The committee should be composed with a view
to giving it the authority and competence necessary for its object. It should afford the possibility of giving due weight to all the aspects
of the problem. If we give sufficiently precise
instructions to such a committee it will certainly be able, within a reasonable period, to
achieve results which mîay constitute a useful
basis for the final discussions upon which we
shall subsequently have to embark.
Fears have been expressed on the part of
public opinion that these discussions may inaugurate a conflict between two opposed theses
within the League of Nations. I do not share
that view. The League of Nations would be
untrue to its purpose if it abandoned the principles which formerly guided it, w-hen it accepted
the task of guaranteeing the rights of minoritirs. I was glad to note that the representative
of France, at the December session of the
Council, impressively and solemnly endorsed the
principles which govern the protection of minorities. I would add that I do not admit in
this question any distinction between interested
and disinterested nations. The problem with
which we are dealing is a problem which necessarily concerns the League of Nations as a
whole. If we review history, we shall see that
there is in the life of nations a perpetual change
in their relations. On many occasions dominion
exercised by one nation bas been followed by
a period in which the members of its race and
civilization have been subject to the sovereignty
of a foreign State. It may be said that history
endeavours to prove the truth of the saying of
Goethe, who puts men, States and nations on
their guard against the inconstancy of fortune.
If I understand rightly the idea which inspired
the creation of the League of Nations and the
guarantees which the League bas assumed for
the protection of minorities, I should say that
it consists precisely in the desire to relieve the
strain quite naturally produced by new situations, and to effect this by a just treatment
extending to men of another race, religion and
language. The ideal towards which humanity
is tending is the assurance of peace for all time,
even though we may not share the belief that
humanity will ever attain this ideal. We must
do our utmost to create conditions favourable
to such a peace. One of these conditions is a
peace between the various national civilizations.
More effectively than by definite engagements

and undertakings, peace for all time may be
assured by a regime of justice towards all those
who claim the vital and elementary right which
is theirs to speak their own language and to
safeguard their faith and their souls.
The discussion was adjourned to the next
meeting.
2376. Protection of Minorities (continuation
of the discussion).
M. Zaleski.-Mr. President, Gentlemen,Before discussing the proposals of .Mr. Dandurand and of Dr. Stresemann, I wish to make
some prelininary observations.
As you are aware, no provision was made in
the minorities treaties for the application of
the procedure in its present form. It i4 a procedure outside those treaties, established as
an act of grace in the interests of miiorities
by common and voluntary agreement between
the Council and the States which have signed
minorities treaties.
It follows, therefore, that this procedure
has been drawn up by the Council in agreement with the States which have signed mnorities treaties, and that without the apsent of
those States such a procedure could not and
would not have been put into operation.
Is it necessary for me once more to renind
you that the States which have signed minoritirs treaties have, on numerous occasions and
again quite recently, stated that it was impossible for them to agree to any change in
the system at present in force wihicl would
impose fresh obligations solely uîpon those
States?
Since the idea that the minorities treaties
should be a general obligation is at the moment
encountering serious obstacles, and since the
point of view of the States which have signed
minorities treaties is well known, I thinkwithout giving any of the many other reasons
in support of what I have said-that the objeet
of the discussion which is now taking place
inust, if it is not to be purely of academic
interest, be to discover whether the proposals
just made are in the nature of a new procedure, which will modify the existing obligations accepted by the States bound by the
minorities treaties to which I have referred.
In reading the report of the Committee of
Jurists which was submitted to us this morning, I find the statement that the Committee
is of opinion that the proposal (that is to
say, the proposal of Mr. Dandurand) goes, in
certain respects, beyond the present scope of
the minorities treaties and declarations.
Consequently, I have the honour to ask you
to appoint a Rapporteur who, with the aid of
two of our colleagues, shall study this question
and shall submit a report to the Council as
soon as he is in a position to do so.
It is of set purpose that I have confined
myself to niaking these few remarks, abstaining from any long comment upon the question
of minorities in general. We are all deeply
convinced that the defence of the legitimate
interests of minorities is an art of justice.
Despite the numerous difficulties and threatening complications connected with the matter,
the minority States have invariably directed
all their efforts towards conciliation and agreement, and they have given most convincing
proof of this by several times adopting a procedure which made it possible to apply more
easily and more efficiently the minorities
treaties of 1919.

duty of examining each petition, and if those
members thought that it was necessary ta bring
a matter before the Council, they would jointly
call the attention of the Council ta it. By
this mean. the dangers, the difficulties, and the
invidiousness of the individual intervention of
a particular State would be avoided.
It should be noted, however, that, though
the Committee of Three gives to the Council
the satisfaction of knowing that every petition
is carefully examined, that Committee can
neither by its action nor by its inaction deprive any other member of the Council of the
inherent right ta take the initiative if he
thinks fit ta do so. The Committee of Three
may see no ground for action of any kind after
examining a certain petition. Nevertheless, it
is within the right of every member of the
Council. if he feels that he can assume that
responsibility, to bring that same petition ta
the direct notice of the Council, even though
it has been rejected by the Committee. Similarly, in cases where the Committee of Three
bas either noted that satisfaction has been
given to as much of the demand of the petitioners as it thinks reasonable, or where this
result has been obtained by its own negotiations, so that it does net bring the petition ta
the notice of the Council, it is yet the right of
every member of the Council, if he feels it
compatible with the responsibility which he
owes ta that body, ta declare himself ta be
dissatisfied with those private negotiations, and
ta bring the matter before the Council itself.
I think that the very fact that no member
of the Council has thought it necessary ta bring
ta the notice of the Council a petition which
bas net been brought before it by the Committee of Three isý the justification before the
Council and before the world of the care, the
attention and the scrupulous fairness and sense
of justice with which the Committee of Three,
however constituted, has discharged the responsible duties placed upon it. I must say in this
connection that those Committees have been
singularly aided by that Section of the Secretariat which has been specially charged with
the study of these questions. I have heard it
said that the Committees decide upon insufficient information, that they have not the means
of testing the allegations that are made or the
reply which is offered. I do net believe that
such criticisms would bear the test of careful
examination, if indeed it were possible ta

supplemented by the information collected by
the Secretariat, and I at any rate, as a member of the Council, desire ta declare my deep
obligation ta the Minorities Section of the
Secretariat, and ta M. Colban, who for so many
years, and until quite recently, was at its
head.
I believe, therefore, that, in the main, the
work has been well done. I believe that, in the
main, the purpose for which the minority
treaties were signed has been attained. I do
net say that satisfaction has always been given.
A petitioner whose petition is rejected is seldom
satisfied; a Government whose action is criticized is net likely ta be wholly content; but I
believe that any impartial person having access
to our proceedings would be satisfied that they
have not merely been conducted with scrupulous
fairness and with a great desire ta see justice
done, but that we have in fact achieved in

lu0

large measure those purposes for which this
system was initiated.
I should be curions ta know, and perhaps it
may be ascertained in such an inquiry as has
been suggested, what number and what proportion of the petitions have been rejected in
toto by the Committee, what proportion has
been settled before they became the subject of
inquiry by the Committee owing to the fact that
the attention of the Government was called
to a grievance by the presentation of the petition and its communication ta the Committee,
and in what further proportion either in the
Committee or as a resuit of its work some
arrangement has been reached between the
parties concerned. I think that the two last
cases, the petitions to which satisfaction is
actually given by the Government before they
come up for examination by the Committee
and those to which satisfaction is obtained by
the Committee, would cover, in the opinion of
any impartial person, practically every case of
solid grievance.
I do net want to say that the Committees

have never made a mistake.
human nature never to err. But I hope it
will be remembered that the Committees have
tW consider the permanent interests both of
the minorities and of the State, and the most
permanent and the most important interest of
both is that they should learn to live together
in peace and amity, and that the need for recourse to petitions to the Council and for the
intervention of the Council should in time ceas"
because they settle their grievances between
themselves and without the intervention of the
Council.
I repeat, I do not pretend that we have
never made a mistake. Neither do I wish for
a moment to assert that our procedure is necessarily perfect or final. Two difficulties have
been mentioned which I think are of some consequence and for whici I should be glad to see
a remedy found if that were possible.
First of all, there is a complete lack of information at the present time as to what, in
fact, are the results of the examinations by
the Committees of Three. Certainly, there are
some dangers in connection witlh publicity
against which we must be on our guard. There
is the danger lest we should inflame passion
where it is our duty to assuage it. There is
the danger lest, in an excited state of public
opinion in the locality in question, we should
render the position of the petitioners more
difficult and even expose them to danger. Above
all, we muet be on our guard against making
more difficult the settlement of disputes and
the removal of grievances. The secrecy of our
deliberations in the Committee of Three has
at any rate had this advantage: that a Government could make a concession without any
fear that in doing so it was lowering its dignity
or authority in the face of nationals of its
own State. It could make voluntarily, in the
confidence of that confessional, confessions and
undertakings which it could present thereafter
to its own executive or legislative authorities
as acts proceeding from its own volition, not
dictated by any external authority and therefore more easily commended to a national
opinion which was perhaps somewhat excited.
I have mentioned these dangers which surround any effort to make public our proceedings or even the results of our proceedings.
Nevertheless, I hope it may be found possible
ta give a greater publicity in future than has

APRIL 11, 1929
too large a subject and raises too many delicate
questions to be dismissed in a single Council
discussion, however prolonged. I support the
proposal made from more than one quarter that
a Rapporteur shall be appointed and that, with
the aid of colleagues, if such be his wish, he
shall undertake a careful study of the whole
question. I hope that to him and to his
colleagues there may be left the widest latitude.
I am thinking here of what the representative
of Roumania said. This Committee would no
doubt clearly distinguish in any report which it
made between what is comprised in the treaties
and that which is outside the treaties and to
which the minority countries have already
assented or which may require their assent
before it can operate in the future. I hope
that the enquiry which is to be conducted will
be of the widest possible character and will
give to this Council, and through this Council
to the world at large, the fullest information
both as to our obligations and their limits,
as to our procedure and its results in the past
and as to any suggestions for the improvement
of that procedure which can be made for the
future.
That is all that I wish to say at the present
time. On particular issues of one kind or
another I would wish to reserve my opinion
until the Committee bas reported so that I
may have the benefit of the information that
it will supply and of the judgment which it
will make.
M. Procopé. -I wish to make some very short
and modest observations concerning this serions
and important matter.
The fact that the question of minorities in
general, and in particular the procedure applicable to petitions based on the treaties, bas once
more been brought before the Council bas been
welcomed with great satisfaction not only in
the countries interested, but also in those which
have no direct interest in the problem. This
question assuredly affects the League as a whole;
it affects both those Members of the League
who have undertaken engagements towards
minorities and those who, as is the case with
my own country, have no obligations under this
head.
In the admirable speech to which reference
bas been made several times to-day, and by
which the President of the last session, M.
Briand, closed the discussions at Lugano, he
referred to the rights of minorities as "sacred",
and recalled the duties of the League and of
the Council in their respect. Those words have
had a wide echo throughout the world.
The protection of minorities and the corresponding duties which fall upon the Council
undoubtedly
constitute one of the most
important aspects of the work of the League.
Their duties are based directly on one of the
fundamental principles underlying the whole
work of the League, that is, to ensure the maintenance of justice in the relations between
peoples. The question is, on the other hand,
very complex, and cannot be settled rigidly and
according to formula. That which in certain
circumstances might be regarded as a great
step forward may in other circumstances give
rise to an unfortunate situation.
The question must, therefore, be studied while
taking account of the existing possibilities, of
the practical requirements, and, above all, of
the other fundamental principle of the League,
which is to contribute to the good understanding
and co-operation between nations.

111

It is not my intention to begin a detailed
study of this question at the moment. We have
listened to the admirable statements of the
representatives of Germany and Great Britain.
We have also before us the scheme proposed by
Mr. Dandurand, and we have heard a number
of very interesting observations and objections
put forward by our Polish colleague. I think
the Council bas been a little frightened at the
thought of entering upon a discussion on procedure. It bas been said that the treaties
merely lay down certain principles, that we
should not go beyond those principles, and,
above all, that the result of our work must
not be to extend the engagements already
undertaken by the States. I fully understand
this point of view. Once admitted, however,
it must not prevent us from trying to set up
the best possible procedure in existing circumstances. If principles have been laid down by
the treaties, if general lines for our guidance
have been embodied in those treaties, we must
find a procedure capable of putting them into
practice, otherwise the principles will remain a
dead letter.
The scheme of Mr. Dandurand has only been
before us for some days. It would certainly be
rash to give any opinion on the new system
suggested by the representative of Canada until
it bas been studied in greater detail. I think
that our colleague bas not put forward this
system as a definite proposal, but rather as a
basis of discussion.
After having made these reservations, may I
say that, in my view, this scheme contains in
certain respects great advantages and makes
considerable progress possible? The scheme is
based on three fundamental principles. In the
first place, greater publicity must be afforded.
Secondly, the preparatory study of petitions
must be reorganized. Finally, a rule must be
adopted to the effect that any minority petitions nust in the future be forwarded to the
League through the Government concerned,
which will thereby have the opportunity, if it
so desires, to change the situation of which the
petitioners complain, and so prevent the question
from being brought before the organs of the
League.
The proposal to ensure a certarin degree of
publicity, so far as is practical and advisable,
and the proposal to reorganize the present
system for the preparatory study of minorities
petitions, seem to me to deserve furtheir study.
I think that the third proposal, namely, that
the petitions should be forwarded to the
Secretariat through the Government concerned
-a
principle suggested some years ago by
Poland-has advantages in certain respects.
Nevertheless, this muet not be laid down as an
exclusive rule. The representative of Canada
has also taken account of this point of view.
He bas mentioned in his revised proposal cases
of extreme urgency and cases which can constitute ;an exception. In that case, however, we
must determine who is to decide whether a case
is exceptional or of extreme urgency. This is
a rather difficult point to settle.
I think that it is impossible to reach a
definite decision on these various schemes,
suggestions and observations during the present
discussion. I agree with the proposal that a*
Committee of the Council should be appointed
with instructions to study the suggestions made
during this debate and prepare, if it thinks fit,
a more detailed program of action.

lThe proposai lias becu matie that a Rapporteur

APRIL 11, 1929
it will suffic.e to read Article 12 of the Minorities
Treaty with Poland and the corresponding
articles of the other treaties and to recall all
the discussions to whicl those articles have
aiven rise. in order to realise that the governing preoccupation in dealing with such matters
bas been to combine the protectio.n of minorities
with respect for the sovereignty of nations.
This, therefore, is the problem before us. This
is the real difficulty which runs counter to
what 1 may cal] the ideal that we seek.
We have listened to a most interesting debate
between Dr. Streseinann and Sir Austen Chamberlain. Our German colleague described to
us this morning in a very fine philosophical
disquisition, of great interest and distinction,
the full force of bis great ideal.
This afternoon, in another speech, Sir Austen
Chamberlain. wlho bas been associated with the
League of Nations somewhat longer than Dr.
Stresemann, and who has on occasion encountered certain practical difficulties, tried to reconcile his own ideals with certain mîisgivings
aroused by Dr. Stresemann's ideal. It is my
belief that this controversy lias led us slowly
but surely to realise the sad reality of our
normal position which compels us to view matters not fron the point of view of the absolute
but fron that unhappy condition of relativity
to which we are condenned.
In dealing withi minorities, I feel compelled
to take up mîy position in the sphere of reality.
I do not wish to consider whether circumstances
are more or less permanent, whether, indeed.
they are eternal or of short duration. I think
that in dealing with nations it is net a bad
thing to let theni believe in the idea of eternity.
It is an excellent idea; it enables them to
acquire a certain vitality. It is a guarantee of
permanency and at the saine time a stimulus
to activity. Such -eternal dispensations after all
adjust themselves in time, and other eternities
may take the place of the eternities of to-day.
That. however, is not the business of the
League of Nations, which bas many other things
te du.
Jtidging from his speech of this morning, Dr.
Stres amann seems to have an excellent opinion
of men and of the objectivity of their minds,
and I congratulate hics sincerely on his belief.
Thougb the practice of polities rather spoils the
freshes Of our belief in man and makes us drop
some of our illusions at a fairly early stage, a
statesmsan canomt be reproached if he succeeds
in retaining sone of them. Men, however, are
mn, and, even tbough they are dealing with a
text or a treaty embodying noble and generous
aspirations, they nevertheless retain their nature. It is eviclent that Dr. Stresemann and
we ourselves are taking up a position superior
to certain contingencies. It is not less evident
that we are inclined te consider the question of
minorities in all its nobility. and that our minds
turn towards solutions which are purely objective. If the problem depended solely on us, we
should be certain of solving it in a satisfactory
way.
Unfortunately, independently of us life goes
on, and I shall cause no surprise when I say
that. in the majority of countries, theme are a
certain numeber of people-rather too large a
number--- who have what I should call a hateful
inclination towards politics. In order to satisfy
this singular but very common taste, they do
not hesitate to look about them for anything
which may serve their interests. In achieving
political combinations, they certainly know how

of the most
to apply an objective intelligenactive description. When they perceive in certain newly constituted countries which have
absorbed various ethnical elements, signs of
misgiving. 'depression, rancour, or discontent,
anI «nen the idea occurs to then to use these
teelings for the purpose of starting political
activities of interest to theinselves, they do not
lîesitate to do so. These things will happen.
It is only necessary to read certain articles and
pamphlets te be convinced of it. There is only
one step between this and quietly turning to
vour owne use the taste for propaganda whiclh
is so common in political circles, and a keen
le
politician does not hesitate to take it.
takes it with astonishing rapidity and at once
seizes upon these minorities. He is no doubt
animated by the most respectable sentiments,
but, instead of asking these minorities to view
the situation calnly and to do their utmost to
show that they are reasonable, he prefers to use
words of bitterness whicli are liable to trouble
or excite their minds.
We are at present living in an environment
of iinderstanding and peace. Our lives depend
-entirely upon the existence and the permanence
of that state of peace. In all the probliems with
wbich we are dealing we must endeavour to
maintain the peace, and that is not always an

easy
te this end and I may say that we have succeeded; that is one of the achievements which
make the League of Nations seem rather a
iniraculons institution. Nevertheless, the task
mofst not be made too difficult for us, and if
the respectable sentiments of the minorities are
used as a lever-to use the words of Dr. Stresemann, and of myself at the last Asseimbly-in
order to shake the position of the Governments,
disturb their authority and national strength;
if attempts are made, as they have been made,
gradually to associate all these minorities in

grievance; and if these efforts meet with success,

recently examples of them and it is our duty
to the minorities in teruis
to speak frankly
which they must be brougbt to understand.
I have listened with the greatest interest to
the little controversy which bas taken place
on the use of a certain word between Dr.
Stresemann and Sir Austen Chamberlain. The
question at issue was how the racial or other
elements nay tend to be merged or to disappear
within the nation to which they belong or how,
on the contrary, they may preserve their identity. It is in no way to the interest of a
country that any eleinent of its population
which lias its own value and its own characteristies should disappear, and a great country
which realises its own strength does not endeavour to bring about any such disappearance. it
does not try to reduce its population to a uniformi
level. On the contrary, the strength of a country
consists in assimilating various elements of its
population without letting them lose their own
characteristics and qualities. It is in this way

a-

APRIL 11, 1929
glad ta hear the representatives of Poland and
Roumania express a wish that the Council
should clear its mind on the subject by means
of a report, as complete as possible, concerning
the present situation. It has been suggested
that a Rapporteur should be appointed, and
two members of the Council associated with
him. That is a matter of small importance. We
already have a Rapporteur with whom we are
well acquainted and in whom we have every
reason to place the utmost confidence-M.
Adatei. I would suggest that M. Adatci, alone
or with the assistance of other members of the
Council associated with him for the purpose,
should draw up a report which may enable us
to adopt a satisfactory procedure. I cordially
support his proposal. subject ta the reservations
which I have just made.
Clearly it is dangerous for the League to continue to work behind the scenes, since it is suspected of not performing its duty. I think it
would be useful to adopt some means of publicity, as for example, the periodical issue to
the public of a report on its work. All those
precautions would, of course, be taken to which
the representative of Great Britain alluded in
bis speech. I also think that it would be a good
thing, under conditions to be determined, for
the Council to be informed of the situation. It
would thus bc possible for the Council to intervene, if it so desired and in accordance with its
undoubted right, either acting as a whole or
through any one of its Members. Care should
be taken, however, to avoid anything which
might create controversy between what we
describe as minorities and the nations of which
they forni a part. Above ail, nothing should
be done which might be interpreted as a sort of
encouragement to such tendencies. which would
have deplorable consequences for the League of
Nations and for the minorities themselves.
Sueh, gentlemen, are the observations which
J desircd to make on this euestion. I apologize
for having Prhans enlarged upon themn rather
more fuilly than I intended.
Mr. Dandurand.-I have no objection to the
appointment of a committee to assist the
representative of Japan in the investigation of
the questions we have discussed to-day and of
the proposal which I have made ta the Council.
Allow me to point out that that proposal may
have seemed somewhat voluminous to those
who do not know how the present procedure is
applied. Let me say, however, that it is merely
an attempt ta consolidate all the methods used
up to this moment, together with a few amendments.
The point which has struck me in regard to
the manner in which the Committees of Three
work-I was and still am a member of one of
those Committees-is the striking inadequacy
of the information at our disposal. That information takes the form of a request-I must
not use the word complaint, though it means
exactly the same-and such a request must necessarily contain some kind of complaint on the
part of the persons who think their rights have
been infringed. This information, I repeat,
comprises the petition as well as the observations of the government concerned, and that is
absolutely al. Obviously, the Committee of
Three can ask the Government for further information. I have been a member of committees whieh have done so, but what appears quite
extraordinary ta outsiders, as well as to many
78600-1

110

representatives who have sat on these Committees of Three, is that even the person who believes that he possesses rights which have been
infringed completely disappears. He bas laid
before the Council, through the intermediary
of the Secretariat, a complaint or certain information and there the matter ends. He never
knows what has happened.
The Committee of Three has before it nothing
but two documents. I maintain that these
obviously constitute an insufficient amount of
information. Consequently, I thouglit that
there were grounds for improving the procedure
in order to obtain rather more complete information, and to notify those who have made
representations in order that they may be made
aware of what bas happened, and that they
may at least be in a position to know that some
kind of body, be it the Committee of Three or
a larger Committee, has studied their question.
As at present they are not aware that this has
been done. I have been pleased to observe that
some of my colleagues have admitted that, as
regards publicity, there are gaps to be filled in
the present system. We are, therefore, more
or less agreed on the necessity of notifying
briefly the persons submitting petitions of
what has happened.
In the resolution which I have proposed, I
have said that the Committee might decide the
cases and conditions in which publicity miglit
be granted if no report is made to the Council
-for the affair becomes public if a report is
so made--or to make it possible for that Committee to eliminate groundless complaints. or
complaints which are in the nature of propaganda or which are tendentious and thus only
to lay before the world at large those complaints which are well founded. For that reason.
I chose the form of words which is now before
you and which I read this morning.
Se far as the other point is concerned. which
is of a certain degree of importance, and by
which it w-ill be possible for the Conmmittee of
Three to obtain satisfactory information, I have
not ignored the clauses of the treaty. I am wel
aware that we can only act within the narrow
limits of the treaty and of the procedure to
which countries with minorities have consented.
I have not forgotten this fact. I sought the
help of some States possessing minorities
treaties, and I have found elements of very
great interest in the Polish proposai.
Poland has suggested that complaints should
be forwarded through the Government concernet
-that is to say, through the Government complained of-before they reach the League of
Nations, in order that that Government may
have au opportunity of settling on the spot a
number of questions. I considered that to be
the proper procedure, and I have adopted it.
As far as those complaints are concerned
which are not settled on the spot and which
therefore corne before the Council or the Committee of Three or a larger committee as I have
proposed, I have tried ta devise a scheme
whereby they should be accompanied with sufficient information.
In causing a national ta address himself ta bis
Government, the dignity of that Governent
will not be affected, because it will have tried
to convince that national that he is in the
wrong or because it will have agreed that he is
in the right. In those circumstances, whether
the national be convinced that he is wrong or

ourable gentleman asks for the production
of all correspondence with the British Government in connection with the adhesion of
Canada to the reciprocal clause of the protocol of the Permanent Court of International Justice, and I am informed by the
right honourable the Minister for External
Affairs that he could net bring this correspondence before Parliament at present.

that an appeal was made by the provinces
for assistance to create and develop industrial
and technical schools. They claimed that the
preliminary outlay would be considerable and
that a grant would enable them not only to
develop their system, but to obtain a personnel of teachers which they could not otherwise secure at such cost as the various provinces could afford.

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: It
is always up to the Government to bring down
such as public policy will permit. I have
no objection however, under the circumstances, to eliminate the second part.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
modation.

TECHNICAL

EDUCATION
BILL

EXTENSION

THIRD READING

moved the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND
third reading of Bill 34, an Act to amend
the Technical Education Act.
He said: As I move the third reading, I
desire to give the information which was
asked by my honourable friend from St. John
(Hon. Mr. Daniel) as to the amounts that
have been paid to the various provinces, and
what sums remain due or not given to them
under that grant. Prince Edward Island has
received S64,000; Nova Scotia, $280,000; New
Brunswick, $392,000; Quebec, $2,071,000; Ontario, $3,178,000-the full amount that comes
to Ontario; Manitoba, $182,000; Saskatchewan, 8142,000; Alberta, $604,000; and British
Columbia, $479,000.
The amounts that would come under this
Bill to the provinces that have not received
their grants in toto wou'ld be:
Prine" Edward Island.. .....
$133,870 01
381.840 51
Nova Scotia.. .. .. .. ....
New Brunswick.. .. .. .. ..
119.510 07
498,193 15
Onîebec.. ............
Manitoba.. ............
537,402 19
Saskathewan.............705,021 80
Alberta.. ............
73,853 03
British Columbia.. ......
153.420 78
My honouable friend firom Moos Jaw (Hon.
Mr. Willoughby) asked me if I could inform
this House as to the policy of the present
Government towards the continuation for
an indefinite time of grants to the provinces under tha-t head. Of course the Government may find circumstances and conditions
changed, and in the course of years to come
may alter any decision, but the reasons given
now for discontinuing the grant after the
present amount has been expended are fairly
interesting, and will perhaps commend themselves to members of this Chamber.
We all agree as to the importance of industrial and technical education, and the reason
for the Government deciding upon a bounty
or subsidy being voted to the provinces was

And accom-

Accommoda'on. Mr. DANDURAND:
tion, laboratories, and personnel were to be
covered. I do net know what statements
were made when the main grant was brought
before Parliament, but it is held that it never
was the intention of the Dominion to enter
into the educationa: field, and that when this
help was given to the provinces for the
upbuilding and launching of a system of
schools, then the provinces should maintain
that system.
The Government has felt that the conditions that have obtained since the war have
been such as to throw upon the Dominion
finances a formidable load, from which the
provinces are immune. The aftermath of war,
in loans to be pa.id, in pensions to be met,
in hospitals to be maintained, represents such
a formidable outlay that the present Government has felt that the provinces could well
afford to carry that part of a burden which is
mainly, and I would say essentially, theirs.
But somewha.t bound up with the subject
of industrial training and technical education
is a matter which may help the provtices in
that field, and the expense of which has been
accepted by the Dominion. It is the creation
of a research institute and laboratories that it
is net absolutely necessary to duplicate from
province to province, and that may well be
developed with federal funds, and at the seat
of the Federal Government at Ottawa. This
duty has been assumed voluntarily by the
Dominion. It will be a quite costly developnient. Scientific research will still, to a certain
degree, be part of the educational field. For
the reason that I have given, that it would
be very costly to the separate provinces to be
obliged to deveilop those institutes, the Federal
Government has decided to undertake that
part of the work, which is of a higher order.
It dominates the technical and industrial work,
but it will help towards the industrial development of the country.
For these reasons I move the third reading
of the Bill.

The motion was agreed te, and the Bill was
read the third time and passed.

Canadian Pacifie Railway Company.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
Perhaps the honourable gentleman will let us know what the
Bill is, and will explain it.
Hon. Mr. HARMER: I think the Bill is
6elf-explanatory. It makes provision for the
construction of a branch line from a point at

CHIGNECTO ISTHMUS CANAL
INQUIRY AND DISCUSSION

Hon. F. B. BLACK rose in accordance with
the following notice:
That le will call the attention of the Senate
to the desirability of constructing a canal across
the Chignecto Isthnus, thereby connecting the
waters of Northumberland Straits with the Bay
of Fundy, and inquire if it is the intention of
the Government to undertake the construction
of said canal at an early date.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, I put this
inquiry on the Order Paper with a good deal
of pleasure on my own part, and also in
response to requests and suggestions by members of the Senate and members of the otfher
Chamber. As you know, this proposed canal
across the Chignecto Isthmus has been somewhat lengthily and thoroughly discussed in
another place. Nevertheless, J desire to call
the attention of the Senate to some perhaps
important features of this project; and in
doing so I want, first, to give you a brief
outline of its history.
All honourable gentlemen, I assume, know
what the project is. It is proposed to connect the waters of the Gulf of St. Lawrence,
or that portion known as the Northumberland
Straits, with the head waters of the Bay of
Fundy. This is the oldest canal project, not
only in the Dominion of Canada, but on the
whole North American Continent. In passing,
I may say that it relates to the earliest settled
part of Canada-to what is. after all, the
birthplace of this great Dominion of ours.
Some honourable gentlemen may not be
aware that the first white settlement in
Canada was established at the head of the
Bay of Fundy. Three years or more before
there was a white settlement in what is
now the city of Quebec, European settlers
were established at the head of this Bay.
The first road ever constructed in North
America was in this section. Into the head
waters of the Bay of Fundy was launched the
first ship ever built on this continent.
I
might go on to enumerate many other achievements which ultimately have brought Canada
into prominence and which had their inception
or inauguration in this section, but I fhall
restrict my present remarks to a historical
sketch of the canal project.

As far back as 1686 a canal across the
Chignecto Isthmus was recommended in wlat
is known as the "Memoires Generaux,"
written by De Villiers and submitted to the
Government of France.
I have here an
extract from this report, reading as follows:
There are only 4 leagues to be traversed to
go by land from French Bay to Baie VerteFrench Bay is now called Chignecto Bay.
-and a portage of only one league by land and
water. The portage of one league may be
easily cut through by a canal, since all the land
is very low. In this case communication would
be made between French Bay and *the Straits of
St. Lawrence which would shorten the way
from Quebec to Port Royal by at least 200
leagues.
In other words, 600 miles.
That goes a long way back, and, as I said
before, it was the first suggestion of a canal
The Government of
on this continent.
France, during the time it was in control of
this country, recognized the advantage of such
a canal to local commerce, small as it was at
that Lime.
In 1784 a report was made to the British
Covernment by Colonel Morse, a member of
the Royal Engineers, and an engineer of note.
His report, while net quite as general as that
made to the French Government, was in substance the same.
Nothing was done during
the next thirty or forty years, the somewhat
disturbed period following the American War,
but some time after New Brunswick had
been set apart as a separate province from
Nova Scotia the Go-vernment of the newer
I
province hecame active in the matter.
think it was in the years 1825 and 1827 that
partial surveys were made of the proposed
canal, and in 1829 the Government of New
Brunswick sent a delegation to Halifax to intcrview the Nova Scotian Government with
the idea of taking joint action on the exBut all
cavation and building of this canal.
that part of the country was then financially
poor, and neither province felt it had sufficient money at its'command to undertake the
work.
The matter was left in abeyance until the
confederation of the old provinces of Canada
in 1867, and at the first Session of the Federal
Parliament it was taken up by our predecessors
in this House.
I have a copy of a report
made in 1874 by the Chief Engineer of Public
Works on the construction of a canal between
the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the Bay of
Fundy. from which I will read a brief extract:
On a memorandum, dated 8th May, 1873, from
the ion. the Minister of Public Works, reporting that in the Session of Parliament held in
1868. the Senate passed an Address praying

gentlemen by going into the details of that
charter, and matters concerning the partial
construction of that railway. All the money
that was spent by the company came from
English investors; the Dominion of Canada
did not make any expenditure whatever. Docks
were built, the roadbed was completed, the
rails were in part laid, and com.pletion of the
work was within measurable distance when
the British bank that had been financing the
project failed, and no further funds were
available. The company was working on a
time charter, so to speak. They appealed to
Parliament for an extension of time, and,
rightly or wrongly-I am inclined to think
unfairly, at ali events-the then Government
of Canada refused an extension to the charter.
The British investors lost a large amount of
money and the credit of Canada was greatly
endangered in the British market as a result,
and the outcome was that there was neither a
ghip railway nor a canal to show for it all.
Nothing has been done from that time to
the present with regard to the construction of
this canal. Now, it does seem to the people
of Eastern Canada that action should be
taken. I will point out a little later that this
scheme does not affect the Maritime Provinces particularly. It would be of very great
adva-ntage, I think, to Prince Edward Island,
and to the north shore of New Brunswick,
but, after all, it would benefit perhaps more
than anything else in Canada all that traffic
originating on the St. Lawrence and going
through the St. Lawrence ports by water.
Although this canal was placed by the first
Commission among the four or five most
important canals to be built in this Dominion,
yet not one dollar of Canadian money has
been spent on it, whereas $272,000,000 has
been expended up to date on the various
canals of Canada, and towards this sum the
Maritime Provinces have contributed their
proportion. It does seem reasonable that we
should ask that this canal be constructed for
the benefit of aIl Canada, and that we should
have now, at least, what was a part of the
Confederation pact.
When I say this canal was part of the
Confederation pact I want to call your attention to the fact that at the Quebec Conference, held two years before Confederation
was consummated, the construction of this
canal was debated, and the representatives
from both New Brunswick and Nova Scotia
at that Conference stressed the desirability
of such construction and made the canal a
more prominent feature at the time of th3
Confederation agreement than was the Intercolonial Railway, which later became more
prominent. It was insisted that this canal

should be a part of the scheme of Confederation. That it was so considered by those who
met at that Conference is evidenced by the
fact that at the first Session of Parliament
after Confederation it was one of the first
matters discussed in this Chamber.
I have briefly run over the historical points
with regard to this canal. There is a great
deal more that I might mention, but an
honourable gentleman will follow me who
is much better versed than I am on this
subject, and I am quite sure he will take up
a number of points that I have not touched
upon.
I would like now to refer to some of the
advantages to be gained by the construction of this canal-some of the benefits that
would accrue to all Canada. The cutting of
this canal would reduce the distance between
the St. Lawrence waters and the Bay of
Fundy waters by from 480 to 700 miles. It
would bring the city of Montreal and the
port of St. John nearer to each other by water
than they are to-day by 480 or 500 miles.
It would bring the north shore of New Brunswick, with its lumber, potatoes, fish and many
other products that go to the New England
and the West Indian markets, and to the
coast of South America, approximately 400
miles nearer to its markets. The same remark would apply to all products coming
out of Quebec, or any other port on the St.
Lawrence, and destined for Bay of Fundy
or New England ports, or the West Indies
Islands. I am not giving you exact distances,
because they vary from 300 to 700 miles,
but the average distance for freight that goes
out of the St. Lawrence river to any of those
places mentioned would be shortened by
about 400 miles.
What does that mean? To an ordinary
tramp steamer 200 miles is a fair day's
travel. The cost of operating a tramp steamer,
for maintenance, insurance, wear and tear,
interest on investment, etc., runs to $1,000 a
day. Two days sailing would mean $2,000.
Two days saved on the outward voyage and
two on the inward would be equivalent
to $4,000. The $2,000 saved on a cargo of
sugar coming from a West Indian port to
refineries at Montreal, or anywhere on the St.
Lawrence river, is a very considerable saving.
Let us turn now to the trade in potatoes
and in grain from Prince Edward Island to
the West Indies or by water to the New
England markets. These products would be
two days nearer to their destination than they
are to-day, and be carried at much lower
freight and insurance rates. Why? Because
the shipments at present must go all the way
around the coast of Nova Sootia, or else

No person who
examines the records as thcy appear here and
reads the finding of seven eminent engineers
of that tinie, who reported at different periods
on the feasibility of this canal, can question
for a moment thait w'hen those reports were
madle the construction of the canal was casier
than that of most ýcanaîs that have' been built
in Canada, and its feasibility Ivas quite as
great as that of any canal that lias been
constrîicted in this Dominion.
1 do flot know any man, engineer or layman,
who wili say that the canal, with the present
draught of steamships, is not as feasible now
as it was then. 1 believe that engineering skill
to-day is much greater than it was thirty,
forty, or fifty years ago. Difficulties which
werc then insurimtable are now eiiminated.
I do not conceive it possible that there can
be any engineering reason why that canal
Jsioiild flot be constructed at a sufficient deptlî
to carrv the vessels of to-day at any time, and
at ail seamons of the year. I say at ail seamons,
because it is statcd in one report that the
canal would be availabie at ail seasons of the"
vear. On that point 1 have some ýdoubts. I
think there will be a f ew mondhs in the year,
possibly two and a haîf months, wben beoauso
of ice fnrrning in the Str-ait that canal will of
of little benefit; but with presenit engineering
appliances there would be no difficulty whatever in keeping the canal itself open. If the
flow of water itself would not do it, there are
other means that w'ould make it very easy.
But whether or flot the ice in the Northumberland Strait would prevent the canal from
being u'ceful the year round is a question that
the" engineers themscîves will have to decide.
Honourable gentlemen who sat in another
Chamber twenty years ago can very welIl remember the arguments that were employed
agaîmrst the use of a car ferry between Cape
Tormentine and Traverse.
It was thought
it could not get through the ice. But for a
number of years pa.st a steamn ferry bas been
travelling there the yea.r round, missing
scarceiy a day from year to year. Engineering skill and ingenuity have overcome that
difficulty. The same uine of argument that
wvas used in those days might be used to-day
to boîster up the objection that there ýmight

be two mon ths of the year when this canal
couid not ýbe used; but such arguments have
flot proved correct in the past, and I do not
tbink tbey will prove effective in the future.
Even at the very worst, even if that canal
were closed three months of the year, that
,vould ba no serious objection, because, on
account of the shorter route and the cheaper
transportation, great benefit would accrue to
interprovinoial trade and to ail the provinces
of Canada.
Hon. HANCE J. LOGAN:
Honourable
gentlemen, I desire to congratulate the honourable gentleman from Westmoreland (Hon.
Mr. Black) on the splendid speech wbichbch
bas madle on this important subjeet. It is a
very old subject, and it reccived the attention of this Hoîîse and this country many
years ago. It is now over a huindred years
since the first survey was made of t-his canal
route by a gentleman nanaed F. Hall, and it
is nearly a hundred years since tbe Govcrnment of Newv Brunswick paid part of the
expenses of another survey. Still otber surveys were made as the years went on, until in
1864. rvt the Qucbec Conference, the matter
of this rhignecto -Canal, thon known as the
Baie Verte Canal, was brought up. I hold
in my band a quotation from a speech macle
in th;, bonourable House by Senator Dickey,
in which be said:
This last projeet of the canal was the resuit
of an inderstanding at the Que.bec Conference
in 1864, %vbich wvas the fouindation for this
Confederabion.
It was distinctly understood
tiiere that this canal should be constriteted.
q'here bas been no canal in the Maritime Provmnes, e'o.ept a very smaîl one in Cape Breton
of a mile or two in iength, and it avas dlistinctly mnderstood and agreed-and I am speaking in the hearing of members who know w bat
1 state tis correct-in my presence (for J was

one of tise delegates) that this shouid be done.
Hon. Mr. Botsford, in the same discussion
in tbis House, corroborated Senator Dickey's
statemient, as foillows:
My lion. frind from Aimherst bas coiiectly
statcd that orie of the inducements held oit
by the delegates who assembled together to
acconiplish Confederation avas the ,icheme that
liad been under discussion in the different Legisiattires of the country &n long, of getting a
canal betweeni the waters of the Bay of Fundy
and the Straits of Northumberland.
That project avas beld ont by the conference as an inducement to New Brunswick to go for Confederation.
I recolleet distinctly that it had a great effect
on1 many persons when that question came up
for cansideration. There was a wide difference
of opuinion in New Brunswick with respect to
the benefit wýh'icb tbat province would derive
fromn Confederation, and one of the strongest
arguments inade by gentlemen wbo favoured
union was. that if we obtained it, we had the
Plicdge of the delegates that the Baie Verte
canal %wouldbe constructed, and the canal bas
been one of the favourite projects of the people

APRIL 17, 1929
The chief articles of import froin Ontario
to the Maritime Provinces and vice versa, being
bulky. the element of freight forms a large
itemi in their value; hencé any greater facility
for transit tending to eheapen the cost, must
be productive of a greatly increased demand.
This Canal would flot only afford the desired
facility for transit by rendering it unnecessary
to break hulk between the points of sliipment
and destiniation, but would remove a great
barrier to cheap freighits by enabling owaers of
vessels to seeure retura cargoes to Ontario and
Quebec, and thus build up a mutually desiraýble
reciprocal trade, which. m'ay be increased to
almiost any extent.
There were a nuinher of canais placed in the
second, third and fourth classes, Vo 'be dealt
witb in the order named, nearly aIl of which
have beren completed.
Every one of the
works mentioned in the first class, witb the
exception of the Chignecto Canal, bas been
built, :re-built and enlarged, and the River
St. Lawrence bas been deepened noV only
to 22 ýfeet, bu~t Vo, 30 feet.
At the present
time 130 millions of dollars of the money of
the people of Canada, including money of
the people of the Maritime Provinces, are
being spent upon the Welland Canal. We
are noV ob.iecting Vo, that; we believe it is
for the benellt of Canad,%; but we do feel that
we have been forgotten in, the matter of canal
construction.
According Vo a report of the
Department of Railways and CanaIs there bas
been a total expenditure uýpon can-ais in Canada up to March 31, 1928, of 22W3,385,937.72
on canal
construction, $14,335,159.45
on
maintenance, $26,38,046.98 on staff, and $22,î19,608.65 on repaira, or a total expenditure of
M26.828,752.80.
Yet nearly sixty years after
the findings of this very distinguished and well
qualified Commission flot a single sod hias been
turned on the Chignecto or Baie Verte Canal,
and we are now bere to ask that, the Confederation promises ýanid the recommendations in
this report be iînplemented.
During the Mackenzie, administration there
was a sum of one million dollars unanimously
voted by Parliament for the construction of
this canal.
The vote was repeated, and again
it was unanimous, but there came a period of
rather bhard times Vhrougbout the whole world,
and question arose as to the probable cost oi
this work, 'with the result that a Commission
was appointed consisting of Hon. John Young,
Montreal; Hon. W. P. Howland, Toronto; J.
W. Lawrence, Esquire, Saint John, N.B.,
F. Braun, Esquire, Secretary of te Department of Public Works of Canadja-appointed
by the Government as Secretary of the Commission-and Peter Jack, Esquire, of Halifax.
Nnw the peculiar thing about this Commission is that it neyer made a united report.
The only reports filed with the Government

127

were made by Mr. John Young, who disapproved of the building of the canal, and
Mr. J. W. Lawrence, who approved oi it very
strongly.
There is no report irom Mr.
Howland or Mr. Jack. Mftcrwards Hon. Mr.
Mackenzie, speaking in the House of Coinmone, stated that tbe only way Vo, find out
what the canal would cost would be to caîl -for
tenders for the construction of the work, which
bie
proposed to do.
Before tbe tenders were
called, however, the Mackenzie Governrnent
went eut of power.
There then appeared upon the scen-ý Mr.
H. G. C. Ketcbum, a very distinguished engineer, a man oi very forceful character. So
forceful wvas be that bie pcrsuLaded the Govcrament of Sir John A. Macdonald that, instead of constructing the canal it would be
very mucb cheaper and better to build a
ship railway. He proposed Vo lift the ships
by bydraulie power, and to, transport them.
across the isthmus by railway. The Government finally agreed Vo grant bîrn $150,000
a year for twenty-ýfive years. He proceeded
to England te arrange bis finances, but after a
considerable time hie came back with a request
that the Government give bis company $170,000
for twenty years. Tbe Goverament agreedVo do
this, and bie returned Vo England and secured
the backing of tbe bouse of Baring Brothers.
Hie then procecded with the work, but, after
speading about fur millions of dollars, Baring
Brothers geV into linancial difficulties anid lie
had Vo cease work. A few years later lie n'as
able Vo secure the financial assistance accessary, and bie came back Vo Parliament asking
for an extension of time Vo complete the
wvork.
There was a verv serious debalin
the Huse.
1 think I am rigbt in ktating
tbat no seafaring man ad-mitted be would
allow bis sbip Vo be taken out of the water
and conveyed across the isthmus by rail.
Strong opposition arose, led by the late Dr.
R. C. Weldon, M.P., Dean ni Dalhousie
Law Sch*ool, and wben the vote was taken
it was found that the extension had been
relused.
The work was a'baadoned.
Mr.
Ketchum went down Vo Nova Scotia, arid
within a few years died of a broken heart,
and was buried at Tidnish, within sight of one
of the termini of the railway. Thus ended
that, lesson.
In the meantime there had been paid into
te treasury of Canada over $500,000 in
customs duties on very expensive macbinpry
which was placed on the work. The trustees
for the bonditolders afterwards made a request for the return. of this money, but it
bas neyer been returned.

iîy of

APRIL 17, 1929
To carry out this irnprovemenit, in advance
of ail others, would 'be a true National Policy
of the Dominion. Let us first combine the
Confederated Provinces by intercolonial improvement, which will benefit them ail. lnstead
of eînbarking on new projects of colossal
magnitude on one hand, or on the other of
costly enlargement, not irnperatively necessary,
that would prove beyond our means, let us for
the present complete the system of water comnmunication with the St. Lawrence.
The canal, which prob-ably would not cost
more than $8,000,000, would be about eighteen
or nineteen miles long, and would pass througb
practically level country which, except for
a distance of about three-quarters of a mile,
God and nature almost
is soft material.
made a canal. There is a question among
geologists as to whether at one time water
did not flow through from the Northumberland Straits te the Bay of Fundy. Parts of
the country are sunken forest, where evidentiy there were trees in days gone by. There
is, I think, a land rise of oniy about 25 feet
in the whole distance. It wiil be found that
everything is there to enaible the building of
a canal cheaply.
Objections have been raised te the canal
on the greund of fogs in the Bay of Fundy,
but according te evidence given before the
Canal Commission by captains-and there
were many of them-there is less fog and
there is less danger in the Bay of Fundy than
in the route via the Strait of Ganse, where
the f og and the dangers of southern Nova
Scotia and Sable Island must be encountered.
I have ne doubt that when the canal is
built boats suitable fer the trade will be provided. These boats will be able te sail up
the prelent canais of Ontarie, or deeper
ones that may be buiit, and will bring from
Nova Scotia te .the central provinces apples
from. the Annapolis and Cornwallis valieys,
gypsum frem Hants and Albert counties, ceai
from, the County of C.umberland, and se on.

They will deliver their cargees, witheut breaking bulk, into the very heart of Canada.*

There has been considerabie talk about
developing trade between the Maritime Provinces and Ontarie.
We in the Maritime
Provinces are spec'ding a lot of mocýey at the
present time in kceping in Toronto a gentleman whose dibject i-s te increase this trade,
and who has been doin-g very go-od work, but
hie is bandicapped because of the freight rates
between Nova Setia or New Brunswick and
Ontarie. A few years ago I was discussing the

freiglit rates on ceai with the late Alexander
Dick, of the Dominion Ceai Company, and hie
toid me that the rate from Sydney te Montreal was 64.80 a ton by rail, but that they
were shipping by water for 60 cents. In ether
worde, the rate by water was oniy one-eighth

129

of the railway charge. If we can make
direct shipment of our Maritime products by
water as far west as Port Arthur and Fort
William, we shall be able te bring back return
cargoes for censumptien in the Maritime
Provinces.
I have been very much interested in this
matter, acd I believe that if we do justice
the canal will be built. We are net asking
that money be thrown away; we are net

Iooking for charity; but we do ask that the
work, whîch would be for the benefit of not
only the Maritime Provinces but the whole
of Canada, shall be carried on. We feel
justified in makiag this request when we are
con.tributing se mulch. te the enormous
expenditures that are being incurred in ot-her
parts of Canada for works which, I submit,
are ne more necessary than the Chignccte
Canal.
Hon. R. DANDURANDI arn quite sure
that ail the members of this Chamber are
indebted te the honourable gentlemen te
whem we have been listening, for the information which they have furnished us on this
old project of the Chigneoto Canal. After
hearing the history of this projeet, which was
mooted one hundred years before the British
flag wvas raised on the Quebec Citadel, and was
frequently discussed for many years fellowing
that event. one naturaliy wonders why the
men of our generation have heard se littie
of it in and eut of Parliament. My theory
is that up te the time when the ship raiiway
seheme was preposed the canal projeet had
been deiayed because of the high cost of
construction. I believe that the estimates
reached as high a figure as $6,000,000--a very
large sum for those days. We ail know hew
difficult a problc'n it was te finance a number
of important schemes whiefh at the time of
Confederatien seem.ed cecessary. We went
on wit-h the building of the Intercolonial
Railway in order te connect the Maritime
Provinces with Quebec and Ontario. The
proposed Chi2necto Canal was given long
considýeration in both Houses of Parliament.
I believe that the ship raiiway scheme meeted
in the eighties was the cause which flnaliy
prevented the construction of the canal. I
wvill net pass .iudgment upon the House of
Gommons which refused te grant an extension
of time te the company that h-ad been organized te construct the railvay, but I remember that the failure ef the venture dampened
the spirits of ail who had been interested in
it. It was the worst black eye that any public
work could receive.
1 came te, this Chamber in January, 1898,
and for some flfteen yeaxs afterwards I saw

daily at a club across the street the representatives of the English investors. During
every Session up till 1910 they were here
seeking compensation for the loss that had
been en'tailed in the refusal of the House of
Commons to grant an extension of time to
the company to enable it to finish the work.
Fron the time that company failed until
the present, nobody bas raised a voice in
Parliament in support of the Chignecto Canal.
I believe that even the Maritime Provinces,
aUthough they were cndeavouring to obtain
better ternms through the Duncan Commission,
appointed in 1926, made no aldvocacy of this
proposed canal before that Commission. If
the Parliaments of the last twenty-five years
have not examined this proposition, that is
in my opinion due to the check it received irn
the early eighties, and to the fact that the
Maritime Provinces from that time until th,
present have not advocated the building of
the canai.
There apparently must bc some virtue in the
scheme, in view of the reports that engineers
of several generations have made in favour of
it. Al I can add is that the present Government will strrt an investigation-will call for
data on the cos , the feasibility, and the
economic and other advaintages to be derived
from such a canal, and when that investigation bas taken place and a report bas beens
prepared by a Commission-which I hope may
be well sclected-it will be laid before Parliament.
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: Could mv
honourable friend give the House a littie
further information? Apparently he bas devoted some thouglht to this matter aind bas
a plan of action in mind. Is it correct to believe that the construction of this canal is a
pledge which Canada has given to the
Maritime Provinces and which remains unfulfilled, or did the construction of the Intercolonial Railway supplant this project first
sUggested? Were or were not the 60-foot tide
in the Bay of Fundy on the one side, and the
lower tide in the Northumberland Straits on
the other side, regarded as serious impedinents
to the construction and operation of such a
canal? Was or was not a ship railway a
substitute experiment that was tried for the
purpose of overcoming that difficulty? I think
the answer to these questions might be interesting to honourable members.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I imagine tht
the honourable gentlemen who preceded me
and who brought the matter before this Chamber are able to give those details to my
honourable friend. I confess in aill humility
that I had not been aware-or if it came to
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

my notice I had forgotten it-that at the
conference of 1864 the matter was mentioned.
I see that it must have been, since witnesses
who spoke in this very Chamsber testified to
what took place. I do not know the reasons
which decided Parliament to grant a subsidy
to the ship railway scheme, but those reasons
must be on record in Hansard, for, as the
outeome of an important debate which took
place a few years afterwards, the House of
Commons and Parliament felt constrained to
go back upon that policy of giving a bonus,
and decided not to extend the time for the
construction of the railway. As to the question
of the feasibility of the scheme, because of
the difference in the levels of the waters on
both sides, I ans unable to give any information to my honourable friend.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:

A great place

Hon. Mr. BLACK: In order that there
may be no confusion on that particular point,
I may say t'hat the construction of the Intercolonial Railway had nothing to do with the
construction or the lack of construction oif the
Baie Verte Canal. The grant for the building of the canal was made after the Intercolonial Railway was in process of cons ruction.
As a matter of fact, the Intercolonial Railway was begun, so far as that
portion buil; in New Brunswick was concerred, before Confederation; and the construction of the Intercolonial Railway after
that was the linking up of various units already
built or proposed.
Therefore any moneys
expended on the Intercolonial Railway could
in no way have anytbing to do with the construction or lack of construction of the canal.
As to the difference between the high tide
of the Bay of Fundy and the tide of only 9
feet in the Northumberland Strait, according
to the reports of the engineers who investigated the scheme, that was not considered a
serious obstacle.

Hon. Mr. BLACK: The question of power

Hon. Mr. BLACK: That bas not been

The honourable gentleman (Hon.
Mr. Robertson)
asked another question,
whether the attempted building of the ship
railwav did not side-track the canal project.
It did side-track it. I think the Parliament
of Canada at that time was hypnotized by a
very able man who had this Utopian scheme
in his head, and, without the backing of any

shipping people in the world, was able to
convince the Federal Governmnent that the
railway should be buit, and who. sueceeded
in convincing English investors that they
ought to put their money into it. The resuit
was that the English investors lost their
money and the Chignecto Canal has flot been

built.

granted, in lieu of public lands, a subsidy of
$100,000 a year, equal to more than 92 cents
per head of lier population. The discrimination against Prince Edward Island was thus
increased. In 1905 Saskatchewan and Alberta
were formed into provinces. Each received in
lieu of public lands a subsidy of $375,000, or
$1.50 per head on an assumed population of
250,000, but in the case of Alberta the assumed
population was much greater than the actual
This subsidy was to be increased to these
provinces as their population would increase.
Ech of these provinces received also, in lieu
of public lands, the capital sum of $468,750.
Both Manitoba and Prince Edward Island
were now discriminated against, but Prince
Edward Island enormously so.
In 1912 Manitoba demanded to be put on
an equality with Saskatchewan and Alberta,
and ber demand was granted, because it was
manifestly just; and, more than that, her increased subsidies were d'ated back to 1908.
Prince Edward Island still remains where
she was in 1873, receiving six cents per head
of her population. It would be hard to find
in the history of the modern world a more pronounced example of discrimination, and the
results are what might have been expected.
Prince Edward Island has now reached what
might be termed almost a crisis in lier history.
Notwithstanding economy in every department of the Government service, and the levying of all the local taxation the people can
bear, we cannot make ends meet. We are

a serious matter for so small a province, and
if the Dominion were in a similar financial
position it would mean a deficit of over one
hundred millions of dollars.
Our population is dwindling all the time,
while the population of every other province
in the Dominion is increasing, and the worst
feature of this situation is that the percentage of our young people who have not yet
reached the earning period of their lives, and
the percentage of the old people who have
passed the earning period of their lives, are
much greater than in the other provinces.
Additional local taxation is therefore out of

stances, would it be unreasonable for us to ask,
and expect, that we be immediately put upon

in the matter of subsidies? Surely not.

mean. The other provinces are receiving $1.50

sequences of that injustice?
Under the circumstances, I think that in al
fairness our subsidy should be computed on
a population of 100,000; and this would give
us an additional subsidy of $144,000.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: What is the population now?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: About 90,000.
In 1912 Manitoba demanded that she be
put on an equality with Saskatchewan and
Alberta, and, in order that her equality might
be real, that her additional subsidy be dated
back. Her demand was granted and the
principle of dating back to make equality
absolute was then established. It cannot be
denied to Prince Edward Island now.
From 1882 to 1885 Manitoba received 66
cents per head of population more than Prince
Edward Island received. This would mean
for the three years a capital sum of $198,000.
From 1885 to 1905 Manitoba received 86
cents per head of population more than Prince
Edward Island received. This would mean
for these twenty years a capital sum of
$1,720,000. From 1905 to the present year,
Saskatchewan and Alberta have been receiving $1.44 per head of population more
than Prince Edward Island has received. This
would mean for these twenty-four years a
capital sum of $3,456,000, or a total capital sum
of $5,374,000, whicli at 5 per cent interest would
yield an additional subsidy of $268,700. This
$268,700 would be the interest on the arrears,

134

SENATE

and the $150,000 we are entitled to from this
date forward would make our future subsidy,
in lieu of public lands, $418,700 a year.
Furthermore, when the Prairie Provinces get
their natural resources, if they retain the subsidies as well, we shall be entitled to a payment, in proportion to our population, upon
the fair estimated value of these resources.
This may appear large to some, but I submit
that nothing less will put us upon an equality
with the other landless provinces.
In addition to ber claims as one of the landless provinces, Prince Edward Island has claims
which are peculiarly her own, and she has also
claims in common with Nova Scotia and New
Brunswick, which were recognized by the Duncan Commission when it recommended interim
payments of $125,000, $600,000 and $875,000 till
final adjustments would be made. The common claims must of course be pressed in common and adjusted in common, but our own
claims must be kept entirely separate and
apart. It has been suggested that we merge
all our claims with those of Nova Scotia and
New Brunswick and press for a common settlement. I do not think worse advice could be
given, and I hope it will not be followed. To
mix up the claims of Prince Edward Island
that have nothing at all in common with the
claims of the other Maritime Provinces could
not fail to becloud the issue and weaken our
case.
When Manitoba in 1912 demanded the extension of ber boundaries and financial treatment equal to that which Saskatchewan and
Alberta were receiving, did she ask any other
province to assist ber? And if she did not, why
should we? Her claims were so just that they
could not be withheld, and are ours one whit
less just? Or do size and geography determine
the quality of justice? It is true we cannot
get an extension of our boundaries, but that is
all the more reason why we should get equality
of financial treatment.
In November, 1927, there was held at Ottawa a Dominion-Provincial Conference at
which many important subjects were discussed, but nothing was settled as regards subsidies or public lands. Certain of the delegates from some of the provinces seemed to
take a patronizing attitude towards Prince
Edward Island, which, in my opinion, was
altogether unnecessary and very unfortunate.
I wish to emplhasize here and now, as strongly as I can, that Prince Edward Island is not
looking for alms or doles, but is asking for
what she believes to be long over-due justice
-such justice as Manitoba has received since
the early days of lier existence; such justice
as Saskatchewan and Alberta have received
since they were born. And this leads me to
Hon.

Mr.

HUGHES.

the conclusion that interprovincial conferences are not the best occasions to oonsider
and settle all such questions as we are now
discussing. The Parliament of Canada is, of
course, the most representative and authoritative body that can be convened in Canada,
and, in the last analysis, is the only body
which can determine the policy the country
should follow. To the Parliament of Canada
I therefore make my appeal. Moreover, not
the least of the duties of the Senate of Canada is the protection of the rights of minoritics and small provinces. It is fitting, therefore, that I should introduce my appeal in
this honourable House, and I do so with confidence.
I have endeavoured to present my case
briefly and clearly, but in my desire to be
brief I may have sacrificed clarity, and if se,
I shall welcome any question or questions that
honourable members may ask me, calculated
to clear up any points that may need elucidatien. And now I respectfully ask my bonourable leader, the representative of the Government in this Chamber, to give me an
answer, if he can, to-day; if not, then at the
earliest convenient date. Prince Edward Island cannot wait and should not be asked to
wait till even next year.
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: Honourable
gentlemen, wxe have been invited te ask questions.
The address to whieh we have just
listened has been very interesting, but those
who are familiar with Prince Edward Island
know there is perhaps no other part of
Canada where the people are more happy and
prosperous. I believe there are no paupers
on that Island; all the inhabitants are in
comfortable circumstances, and when the
potato crops are good the people do very
well. The province is the home of the silver
fox industry, out of which much money is
being made, and on the whole I think the
people down there are well off now. The
whole country is interested in this matter.
There is in Prince Edward Island a railway
seme 120 miles in length, which I believe is
going to be extended.
I understand that
railway was not built at the expense of the
province.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES:
The honourable
gentleman is quite mistaken in that.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

were credited with our share of the national
deit and debited with our own debt and also
with the cost of the railway.

APRIL 18, 1929
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: How many miles
in length was the railway in Prince Edward
Island at that time?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: The cost was about

$3,250,000.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: How many miles
were there then?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Not as many as there
are now.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It was a narrow
gauge road, about three feet six inches, with
about 40-pound rails. I am not against Prince
Edward Island, but I make these remarks
merely that the House may understand the
situation. I believe that at the time of
Confederation the province was allowed
$250,000 for whatever mileage the railway had.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: It was debited.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Yes. And there is
a very expensive ferry that is kept running
between the mainland and Prince Edward
Island at considerable cost, and I do not think
the Island is called upon to contribute anything to that service. It was understood at
the time of Confederation that there would
be steam communication. There has been
some talk of a tunnel, but that would cost
more than the province itself, because the
area of the province is rather restricted, as
may be seen from the map. My honourable
friend (Hon. MT. Hughes) says the population is 90.000. I thought it was 88,000. But,
whatever the population is, there are remedies
which the province may take to improve its
financial position. The Prime Minister of
Nova Scotia, Hon. Mr. Rhodes, said the other
day that they would have a deficit of some
$800,000 in Nova Scotia this year, if I am
not mistaken, and that they were in financial
straits. He thought if a referendum were
taken as to whether that province should
conform with other provinces in having Government control of the liquor traffic, the
result might benefit the provincial excliequer
to such an extent as to wipe out the deficit.
I have no doubt that if they had some kind
of liqior control in Nova Scotia it would
settle many of their difficulties. The Government of the Province of Ontario last year
received $49,000,000 for the liquor they sold,
and the profits were quite substantial. The
Province of Quebee has made on an average
between $4,000,000 and 65,000,000 a year,
which has helped considerably. Other provinces that have liquor control have done very
well also.
The people of Prince Edward Island want
to enjoy the luxury of prohibition; yet, hon-

135

ourable gentlemen, liquor is not so scarce
there as you might think. If the honourable
gentleman would apply to his own Government to take the control of liquor into their
own hands, they would have a remedy. The
honourable gentleman knows that there are
people in that province who drink. They
drink without paying anything to the province, whether they get it through bootleggersHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Moonshiners.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: -or from moonshiners, as the honourable leader says, or in
any other way. However, there is one remedy.
Then I ask, honourable gentlemen, is it
not an anomaly to have 90,000 people-the
population of a ward or so in Toronto or in
Montreal-governed as they are in Prince
Edward Island? That is something that
really ought to be considered. Notwithstanding their small population they have a governor, and houses of parliament, and all the
other paraphernalia of government. Nova
Scotia also has a comparatively small population, and it is not increasing; and if something is not done with the coal and steel
industries down there the population will
decrease still further. In New Brunswick
the population is increasing somewhat, because some of my own countrymen live
there, and they manufacture their own immigration year in and year out.
Now, in all seriousness, honourable gentlemen, I do not believe that the people of
Prince Edward Island are badly treated. They
have four senators to represent 88,000 people,
and they have an equal number of members
of the House of Commons-in fact, they have
one member of parliament more than tihey
are entitled to according to the last census.
Nevertheless, if they have come to the end
of their tether, is it not time for them to consider joining with Nova Scotia, and perhaps
New Brunswick too, to make one good,
solid province?
The honourable gentleman says the population of Prince Edward Island is not increasing-that the people are leaving.
A good
many of them are leaving because of prohibition; they want to go where they can enjoy full liberty, and the other good things of
this world. I remember when there were
100,000 people in that province. My proposal
to the honourable gentleman would be that he
should suggest to his Government, first, that
they adopt liquor control, which seems to be
the salvation of the revenues of some of the
provinces, and then that they consider the
advisability of annexation with Nova Scotia,
or with New Brunswick and Novia Scotia. In
that way I think they might find a remedy.

of Saskatchewan in presenting its case here
claimed an absolute legal right to its natural
resources. Its representatives argued, I trust,
that under the British North America Act the
Federal Government were trustees of those
resources, but never owners, even at the time
when that part of the country was practically
unsettied, and therefore they could manage,
but could not assign, the resources of the
province. There is a vast difference between
the position of an owner and that of a
trustee, but for a number of years the
Dominion Government acted as if they were
the absolute owners. They granted large
parcels of land for the construction of railways, even outside Saskatchewan, and acted
generally as absolute owners in fee of these
resources. As far as I am concerned, and in
the light in which I construe the law, I should
never be satisfied with any settlement, as
between the two westerly Prairie Provinces
and the Dominion Government with reference
to the natural resources, that did net recognize
the proprietorship of the province. If we
start with that foundation and are to have an
adjustment as to trusteeship, what the provinces have received from the Dominion Govenment by way of subsidy or otherwise in
alleged return for the natural resources is a
matter that can be determined by a Commissien.
I do not want to say more than that now,
because I think that tentative negotiations of
some sort are still in progress between the
Saskatchewan and the Federal Governments.
At any rate, they have had seone communications and meetings. It nay be they are
awaiting the termination of the Manitoba
case. I merely want to make cle'r that when
the proper time comes Saskatchewan and
Alberta will have something te say if the
Federal Government take the position that
they are owners of the natural resources.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: I should like to

Maritime Provinces have any equity in either

West? *
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: None whatever
in law, in my opinion.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Perhaps I did net
make my position as clear as I wished to
make it. I take this ground, net as a legal
argument at all, but on the broad question of
equity, that when Prince Edward Island was
allowed anything in lieu of public lands there
was established the principle that it was
entitled te payment on that account, and it
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

naturally
follows
that
when
Manitoba.
Saskatchewan and Alberta, in lieu of public
lands, were granted subsidies, based on population, Prince Edward Island should have been
treated on similar terms. That appears to me
to be so elementary in equity that it does
not need argument.
With respect to the statement quoted by
the honourable leader froc1 the irport of the
Duncan Commixsion, my reading of that is
that the amount of $125,000 a year that
Prince Edward Island receives was for claims
similar te those advanced by Nova Scotia
and New Brunswick. It is one of the interim
payments for the common claims of the three
Maritime Provinces, though Prince Edward
Island was of course entitled te less than the
others; but that has nothing whatever to do
with the claim I have presented to the House
to-day.
I was not privileged to be at the DominionProvincial Conference, and therefore I know
of what took place there only from what I
have read. I was very much pleased to hear
from my honourable leader in this House that
the atmosphere was so agreeable that the
Government feels it has the consent of the
provinces to proceed with a settlement of all
laims at an early date, and to make equitable as well as legal adjustments that would
appeal to all the provinces. I am more interested in equity than I am in the legal aspects of the case, for "the letter killeth, but
the spirit giveth life."
I wish only to repeat that we in Prince
Edward Island do net desire to create the impression that we are asking for anything to
which we are net entitled in equity and in
justice, as an integral part of this Dominion.
If I may offer a homely illustration, it
seems to me that the Dominion of Canada
is like a family that consists of nine members, all settled on the family estate. If some
of the fanily are located in places where
they are at a great disadvantage as compared
with other members of the family, there must
inevitably be adjustments in order that the
whole family may be contented and may
share equally in the general prosperity.
There is no doubt at all that the central
provinces, Ontario and Quebec, have enermous natural resources; and the same is truc
of British Columbia and, though perhaps to
a lesser extent, of the Prairie Provinces. These
provinces thereby derive an immense advantage over others that are less favourably endowed. It is not charity at all on the part
of the other provinces te allow Prince Edward
Island to share with them, proportionately,
in our common heritage.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I do not want
to create the impression that I am criticizing
the position taken by my honourable friend
(Hon. Mr. Hughes), or necessarily adverse
ta it; but I cannot admit the premises on
which he founds part of his argument, namely,
that the Dominion Government owned the
resources of the Prairie Provinces, and, having
made an allowance in lieu of themIn my view, that
Hon. Mr. HUGIfES:
would not weaken my argument at all.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: It may be that
the Maritime Provinces, including Prince
Edward Island, require further financial aid
from the Dominion. I have no doubt that
for a time, at least, the Maritimes did not
receive as great benefits from Confederation
as did the two great provinces of Ontario and
Quebec. The loss ta the Eastern Provinces
of custom duties and excise revenue must

hopes that the Maritimes may have increased
prosperity; I think this sentiment is reflected,
ta some extent, in the appointment by the
Dominion Government of the Duncan Commission. I believe the people of Canada approved of the findings of that Commission.
No complaint that the Commission was too
generous has come ta my notice; the only
criticism seems ta be that their findings are
not being fully implemented. Throughout the
whole country, I believe, there is a feeling
that the recommendations of the Commission
should be carried out. Certainly the West is
not opposing that view. I ask the honourable gentleman not ta think that I voice any
opposition ta the most generous treatment
that can be given ta Prince Edward Island.

SECOND

COMPANIES BILL
READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill V3, an Act respecting Investment Companies.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, I have
alreauy informed the Senate that the Banking
and Commerce Comnittee is studying the
Companies Act Amendment Bill. Some of
its clauses deal with a new form niof financial
association which is well known in Great
lritain, bearing the nane of the investment
trust company. Suci an organization is not
in reality a trust company as understood and
defined by our laws; it is simply an investimtnt company. It was suggested at the first
meeting of the Banking and Commerce Committec that Lhcre should be prepared a special
Bill to govern companies of this kind.
The Minister of Finance has lad the Bill
drafted by the Superintendent of Insurance,
who will be responsible for the proper administration of the Act if passed b' Parliament.
The greater part of this Bill has been

APRIL 30, 1929
modelled upon the Loan Companies Act, Revised Statutes, 1927, Chapter 28, which is iii
its main, provisions similar to the Trust Cornpanies Act, Revised Statutes, 1927, Chapter
29.
The Sollowing sections*of the Bill are taken
from the Loan Companies Act without verbal
or other change: sections 7 to 12 inclusive,
16 to 26 inclusive, 28 to 53 inclusive, 55 to 59
inclusive, 68, 71 to 75 inclusive, 77 to 80 inclusive, 82, 83, 84, 86 to 94 inclusive, 96 and
97.
The following sections have -been taken from
the same Act with only such verbal changes
as are m-ade necessary by the context: sections
4, 5, 6, 13, 15, 60, 61, 65, 69, 70, 85 and 95.
The Bill may 'he divided for convenience
into a nuinber of groupa of provisions as
fol1loiws:
1. Organization Provisions-Sections 4 to 12
inclusive.
2. Company Clauses.--Sections 14 to 60 inclusive, 77 to 88 inclusive, 90 to 93 inclusive,
and 97.
3. Limïited Investment Powers.-Section 63.
4. Wider Investmnent Powers.-Section
64.*
5. General Powers.-Sections 62, 65 to, 68
inclusive, and 76.
6. Licensing and Inspection Provisions.Sections 13, 61, 69 to, 75 inclusive, 89, 94, 95
and 96.
The Bilil is drawn upon the assumption that
investment companies operati-ng under names
including the word "trust" or "trusts," or
which issue their debentures or other secuerities to 'the public for money borrowed
from 'the public, shahl hereafter he subWet to
dimitations on investments, and shail submit
to s-equiremcnts as to license and supervision
similar to those which now apply to insurance, boan and trust companies under the
general Acta applicabole to those companies
that investment comipanies
respectivehy;
other than those just mentioned shahl be subject to the ordinary orpa.ny clauses contained in the Bill, but shall continue to
exercise practically the same powers as to
investment in securities, as those conferred
heretofore in Lattera Patent incorporating such
companies, and that such companies shall not
be required to submit to licensing and inspection.
To give effect Vo the foregoing the various
groupa of provisions hereinbefore indicated
have been m~ade applicable to companies
according to name, debenture liabilities and
date of incorporation, as follows:
(a) Ta companies hereafte-r incorporated
which have ini their names the word

"trust" or "'trusts," or which issue their
debentures to, the public, the sections indicated in groupa Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6
apply.
(b) To companies hereafter incorporated
other than those mentioned in (a) above,
groupa Nos. 1. 2, 4 and 5 apphy.
(c) To colnpanies heretofore incorporated
which have the word "trust" or "trusts" in
their names, or which issue their debentures to the public, groupa Nos. 2, 3, 5,
and 6 apply, except section 27.
(d) To companies heretofore incorporated
other than those mentioned in (c) above,
groupa Nos. 2, 4 and 5 arpply, exoept sections 27 and 62.
The Bill provides that companies of this
class shaîl hereafter be in.corporated only by
special Act of Parliament, and a model form of
bill, eonsisting of five short clauses, is prescribed which will have the effeet of making the
company subject to the provisions of the Act.
If the cornpanies are subi ect to the licensing
and supervision sections of the Act, business
can be commenced only after a certificate
permitting the company to commence
business bas been obtained fromn the
Minister (Section 13). The Act provides that
the capital stock of companies herea-fter inonporated shall ho not bas than $250,000 and
shalil be divided intýo shares of not less than
$10 nor more than $100 each.
The directors of ai investmcnt companies
are required to senýd to shareholders, with the
notice of the annual general meeting, and at
heast ten days before such meeting, a copy of
the statement of affairs to be laid before the
meeting, and such statement is required to be
in a form presoribed by the achedule to the
Act. This sceedule requires a somewhat detailed classification cf invcstments, -the investments in bonds', debentures and debenture
stocks being classifled according to the nature
of the issuing authority as(a) Governments
(b) Government guaran-tced
(c) Municipalities, and
(d) Mll others.
Investments in stocks are required to be
classified under the headinga(a) Banks
(b) Insurance conipanies
(c) Loan, trust and other financial corporations
(d)l Public utility companies
(e) Railroad companies
(f) Industrial and manufacturing companies
(g) Mining and oid companies
(h) AhI others.

144

SENATE

The total market value of bonds and stocks,
as well as the book values, are required to be
shown.
The Revenue Account requires, under Income, the interest and dividends earned to be
elassified under the headings(a) Bonds and debentures
(b) Collateral loans
(c) Bank deposits
(d) Stocks
(e) Other assets
and there is aiso required a statement of the
gross profit on sale or maturity of assets subdivided according to real estate, bonds and
stocks, the amount by which the ledger values
of the assets have been written up and the
increase in market value of securities and real
estate during the year.
Under Expenditure there is required to be
shown the interest incurred during the year on
the company's debentures and other borrowed
money, the gross loss on sale or maturity of
assets classified under real estate, bonds and
stocks, the amount by which the ledger values
of the assets were written down, the decrease
in market value of securities and real estate
and the expenditure in considerable detail for
taxes, salaries. commission and other expenses
of management.
The profit and loss account requires to be
shown, in addition to the usual items, the
premium on capital stock sold during the
year, and the commission on the sale of stock
and organization expenses.
Section 60 requires the auditors to make a
report to the shareholders on the annual
statement submitted to the company at the
annual general meeting, and if the company is
sutbject to heensing and inspection a similar
report is required to be made by the auditors
to the Minister.
Section 62 defines the company powers which
may be exercised by all comipanies subject to
license and inspection. These are believed to
fairly well embody the principal powers conferred upon companies under Letters Patent
heretofore issued. Certain powers conferred
upon some of those companies, however, have
been omitted, such as the following:
1. To buy, sell, exchange, lease or otherwise
deal in real estate or any interest therein.
2. To purchase, hold, sell and generally deal
in mortgages upon real and personal fproperty.
3. To acquire, purchase, exchange, hold, take
mortgages and securities on, manage, improve,
develop, cultivate, deal in, sell, lease, exchange,
or otherwise dispose of land, timber limits,
mineral claims, water-powers, rights, grants,
franchises, and privileges and real and personal
property of every nature and description and
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

any and all interest therein, choses in action
and negotiable instruments, and to give, take
and make in respect thereof such consideratiens and terms as the company may think
proper.
Section 76 of the Bill limits the investment
of the company in real estate to such as is
necessary for its actual use and occupation, or
such as may be reasonably required for the
natural expansion of its business.
Section 63 oentains the investment powers of
companies which are subject to licensing and
inspection. The provisions contained in subsections 1, 2, 3 and 4 are practically identical
with the investment powers enjoyed by insurance comipanies, loan companies and trust
companies, a>though the section has been
derived partly from the Insurance Act and
partly from the Loan Companies Act. It may
be stated generally that the section combines
the more liberal features of both Acts. Subsections 5 and 6 impose limitations similar to
those contained in some of the charters already
issued. Subsection 8 provides that the section
shall not apply te companies already incorporated until the first of July, 1930, and
assets then on hand net complying with the
provisions of the section wid have to be
disposed of within one year thereafter.
Section 64 applies to companies not subject
to licensing or inspection. It provides that at
least one-half of the investments of such companies shall b of the class prescribed in the
prcceding section. The balance of the assets
shall be such as are authorized by the company's Letters Patent if issued before July 1,
1929, or, if the comipany is incorporated thereafter, the said assets shall consist of bonds,
debentures, debenture stocks, shares in a&l
classes or other securities of any Government,
corporation, or company, public or private, in
the Dominion of Canada or elsewhere, subject
only to the restrictions enumerated in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of subsection
2. These restrictions are similar to those which
have been heretofore imposed by special
clauses inserted in the Letters Patent of companies already incorporated.
Section 65 imposes the same prohibition on
loans to directors or to members of the directors' family as are now imposed upon directors
of insurance companies, loan companies and
trust companies.
Section 66 prohibits the purchase of securities
on margin.
The licensing and inspection sections, 69 to
75 inclusive, apply only to companies which
have the word "trust" or "trusts" in their
names, or which issue their debentures to the
public. These provisions are practically iden-

l'a

APRIL 30, 1929
ticaýl with the presant provisions of the Insurance, Loan and Trust Comupany A.cts. They
provide that no such eompa.ny shaîl transact
business without a license, renewable annually,
from the Minister of Finance. An annual
statem-ent of affairs on a prescribad form is
required to ha filed with the Minister within
two months af Ver the e.nd of the yea.r. The
company must submit to inspection, and produce ail books necessary theref or, and otherwise facilitate such inspection so faýr as it is in

full particulars of aach ýcompa-ny's business
must ha praparad for the Minister by the
Superintendent of Insuranca. In such report
only assets authorized by the Act shaîl be
allowed. If the axamination shows that the
company is unsafe for the public to deal with,
the license may, after hearing,bhawithdrawn hy
the Minister and such withdrawal ha conflrmed
by the Governor in Council. Provision is made
for aippeal by the company against anïy ruling
as to the admissiihility of any asset or as to any
correction or altaration made in the 9tatemant.
Section 81 provides that before paying any
dividend on the common sharas, whather
payable in cash or shares, t*he company shal
set aside as a special dividand reserve a sain
aqual to 121 par cent of tha net earnings for
the year, or equal to 50 par cent of the net
profits realized on the sale of securities during
the year, whichever is the greatar. This raquirement ceasas Vo apply when such special
dividend raserve reaches an amount equal Vo
50 per cent of the par va-lue of the comnmon
shares, or, if the company has shares of fno
par valua, equal Vo 50 p>er cent of the capital
with which it caTrnes on business.

As the Royal Assent is to be given this
afternoon to thie Appropriation Bill whieh was

ask fhat this further amount be voted now
for the purpose of meeting the exigenci.s of
the financial situation of the National Railways and the Merchant Marine. With this explanation, and with the leave of the Senate,
I move the second reading of the Bill.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
gentlemen, until a few moments ago, when
the honourable leader of the Government was
good enouîgh to hand me a copy of this Bill,
I was net aware of its scope.
I maiy be
wrong in mv recollection, but I think this is
a new wa of providing interim advances to
Ie Governnent Railways. For the purposes
of civil government we bave made advances
without question, but if I am right in my
recollection, this is a very striking departure
fron the usual practice.
Another criticism-perhaps it is only a
textual matter-is that I should have thought
that section 2 itself would mention the appropriations provided for in the Schedule,
in order to attach the one to the other.
My attention has been called te remarks
made in another Chamber, as to whether or
not monevs should be appropriated for railway accouct in the same way as ordinary

ELECTRICITY

AND FLUID EXPORTATION BILL

THIRD READING POSTPONED

Hon. Mr. TANNER moved the third reading of Bill 15, an Act to amend the Electricity
and Fluid Exportation Act (Exportation cf
Electrir Power).
Hon. Mr. BUREAU:
Honourable gen-tl
men, with the leave of the Scnate I would
move, before my amendment is submitted,
that this Bill be referred to Committee of th
Whole House. This, to my mind, is a matter
of great importance, and as all members of
this House did not have the opportunity of
listening to the discussion that took place
when the Bill was referred to the Special
Stinding ('ommit tee, it is desirable to send
it to the Committee of the Whole, so
that we may there discuss the question, ask
for the information that we may want, and be
in a position, after getting the information,
to pass intelligently upon the Bill.
J therefore move that the Bill be not now
read the third time, but that it be referred
to Committee of the Whole House.
The motion was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Does the honourable gentlemen move that the House go
into Committee of the Whole now?
Hon. Mr. BUREAU:
Yes, if the honourable leader of the House prefers. I make
the motion that we go into Committee of the

Hon.
Mr. TANNER:
Mr. Chairman,
as this Bill stands in my name, I migh
say a word about it before my honourable
friend goes on. As I am informed, this Bill
was first introduced in the other Chamber by
a private member during the Session of 1928,
and, as I ucderstand. it ncarly got through all
its stages last year, but fell by the way with
a number of other private Bills. This year
again the same honourable member introduced the Bill in the House of Commons, and.
as I am informed, it was referred to Conmittee. The member of the Cabinet w'ho
has charg' of that Dcpartment of the public
ser vice whieb is pîrtiîcularly concerned, the
Mici-stor f teic Interior, was conseIlcd, and
tlie Bill was amdendd to meet his views and
lice views of the Covrernment, as the promoter undcrstood. Thereifoie I appreiend it
rones to this House in fhe fori which met
witlh the approval of the Governient.
The principle in,volved in the Bill, generally
speakiing. is the substitution of Parlianent
for the Governor in Coucil in the malfer of
issuing licenses for the export of electrir
power or electric curreint. Thre are, howcver, e or two exceptions. Under a subclause the Governor in Council retains the
pver either to renew or to cancel licenses,
and to regulate the volume of current which
ma' be exported under theni.
The Bill
also provides that in case of emergency the
Governor in Council may grant permission
to export a lai-ger quantity than is covered
by existing licenses. Otherwise, all matters
affe 'ting the export of electric current after
thc lst of January, 1929, must receive the
approval of Parliament instead of the approvxal of the Governor in Council.
Personally I have no objection whatever to
the Bill being amended if amendment is found
desirablo.
I a.m in faveur of the principle
of control by Parliament of the .export of
electric current.
The only question that
might concern me at the present tirne, as
promoter of the Bill in this House, is whether
the Government will accept any further
amîîendments to the Bill than those which
were inserted in the House of Commons. Of
course that is no reason why honourable members of the Senate should not more amendments if they so desire. The Bill could be

MAY 1, 1929
sent back to the House of Commons with an
amendment which would possibly receive the
concurrence of that House.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Honourable gentlemen, I knew from what I heard from my
honourable friend in the lobby here that there
had been some pourparlers between a Minister and the promoter of the Bill. Outside
of ihat I know absolutely nothing concerning
negotiations, if any. I am taking the Bill on
its merits.
In 1907 Parliament saw fit to give the
Governor in Council the power to ahlow
electric current to be exported from Canada.
The Act vested in the Governor in Council
authority to grant licenses to export, and defined his power to make regulations, which
were to be submitted to Parliament within
fifteen days after the making thereof, if during
the Session, or within fifteen days after the
opening of the next Session. Under the authority thus delegated to the Governor in Council
certain regulations were passed and certain
licenses were issued. To-day we are departing from the stand which Parliament took in
1907: we are withdrawing from the Governor
in Council the power to grant licenses for
the purposes of exportation and are vesting
this power in Parliament. Are we going to
do this without finding out for ourselves the
grounds for the change? If it can be shown
that it is not in the interest of the people
to continue the present system, we are entitled to know it. If it is going to benefit
the country and improve the situation to
place under the control of Parliament the
right lo grant licenses to export, we ought to
know that also. Assuming that the proposed
change is an improvement, why leave any
obstacle in the way? The raison d'être of
this change must be the betterment of conditions, and if the present system is not good
enough, why make exceptions to perpetuate it?
If, on the other hand, the licences which were
granted prior to the lst of January 1929,
were in the interest of the people, why should
this system now be changed and the authority
transferred to Parliament?
But if Parliament is going to control the exportation of
power, let it assume full and entire control.
Honourable gentlemen will observe that in
my notice of motion I mention the year 1935.
I had no particular reason for putting the

want to know w'hy and when the Governor in

powers.
I suggested the year 1935 in this
amendment merely for the purpose of having

exceptions, we are entitled to know what

149

licenses are in existence.
I understand that
they are not necessarily renewable-that each
license is issued for one year, and at the end
of the year it expires.
When a license is
granted for a further year it may be called a
renewal, but it is in fact a new license, good
only for twelve months, at the end of which
time it ceases to exist.
I do not know
whether licenses that were originally granted
before the 1st of January, 1929, have not been
re-granted or renewed since that date.
We
have no information as to what licenses would
fall under the renewal clause. What I should
like to have is a statement of all licenses
issued, containing: (1) the date the license
was first granted; (2) the name of the
original licensee, and if any transfer bas been
made, the name of the actual licensee; (3)
the quan t ity of power allowed to be exported under each license, and whether such
quantity is limited to the surplus power after
the needs of customers using power in Canada have been supplied; (4) from what place
in Canada the power is exported and at what
place on the frontier it is delivered to the
Uni'ted States; (5) the terms and conditions
under which such license is granted, and the
fee charged for each license; (6) what the
licensee receives for the power at the point of
delivery on the frontier.
I think we are
entitled to have this information before we
pass upon the Bill.
The section of the Act which authorizes
the Governor General in Council to grant
licenses is amended by this clause:
No person shall expert any power without
approval of Parliament on any terms or conditions other than those approved by Parliament.
How is Parliament going to be seized of
applications for these licenses? And how is
Parliament going to issue the licenses?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Parliament will not issue the licenses, but merely approve of them.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: In what way will
Parliament be seized of the request for approval? If Parliament is going to approve
of a license it must have something definite
before it. How is the request for a license
to be brought before Parliament? To my
mind, the only way would be by a private
Bill.
Further on the Bill says:
No person shall, without the approval of
Parliament, construct or place in position any
line or wire or other conductor for the
exportation of power, . . . .
Is Parliament going to advise on the location
of towers or on the size of wires? If so,

150

SENATE

you will have 245 plus 96 men who may be
individually interested. The licenses require
the approval of Parliament, but there is no
machinery provided for getting that approval.
In my opinion the question of where any
line or wire is going to be placed should be
referred to the Railway Committee, in the
same way as a Bill for the construction of a
line of railway; and we should require the
Bill to show the location of the transmission
line.
I think the most important thing to consider is whether we are not creating an injustice for the future by providing that those
people who to-day have permission to export power shall be under the same jurisdiction as they are now, while any new individual or concern desiring similar permission will have to come to Parliament and
deal with over 300 men instead of 18 or 19.
May I be allowed to suggest that we
should have more information to enable us
to weigh all the circumstances touching this
power export question.

Of all the power exported froim Canada

to export, the power so developed goes to
waste as dead loss.
Under this Bill the small exporters would
be required to come to Parliament for the
sanction of a private Bill to permit the export
of an estimated surplus in the months of
May, June and July, or the months of
December, January and February-at times
when Parliament may not bo in Session. They
would be put to the expense of getting a
private Bill for an inconsiderable export, and
I am informed it would be a hardship which
would bear heavily upon them to pass this
Bill without amendment.
I agree with the honourable gentleman from
La Salle (Hon. Mr. Bureau) that the matter
should be considered; and I agree with the
honourable gentleman from Pictou (Hon. Mr.
Tanner) that we should not hesitate to amend
the Bill if we find it desirable to do so.

As the honourHon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
able gentliian from La Salle (Hon. Mr.
Bureau) says, this Bill would divide the exporters of power into two classes, one of
which wotld bc a favoured class of people
wbo, because they had a license prior to
January, 1929, could continue under that
license indefinitely; while those who did not
have a license before that date must get a
private Bill passed.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
the class you speak of?

Is that

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
The people of
whom I speak may be in either class. Some
of them have incidental surpluses and are
getting licenses from time to time for the
export of those surpluses. Othcr companies
may have incidental surpluses which they
desire to export, and if they have not yet
applied for permission, they will require a
private Bill.
Hon. J. D. REID: Honourable gentlemen,
I would vote for the Bill as it stands, unless
we could get the Act amended so that no
power could be exported.
Take the case of the Province of Ontario.
Some years ago, when the power companies
first applied for permission to export, they
stated that the exportation would continue

MAY 1, 1929
only until such time as the power should
be required for use in the Province of Ontario. The licenses issued by the Government of that day and by every Government
since were only temporary, covering one year
at a time, and the parties in the United States
who got the power took it on that understanding and quite willingly conceded that
whenever the power should be required in
Ontario--or anywhere else in Canada, for the
samne thinig applied to other provinces--their
supply might .be cut off. But some of the
private corporations made contracts witb their
Amorican customers for a long termi of years.
As time wvent on, the Province of Ontario
not only used ail the power that the private
companies could supply, but it tdok over
those private companies and in addition constructed large stations for the utilization of
water-power, and increased the output of
electricity at different points. Applications
were made by private companies bef are the
Hydro-Electrie Commission took them over,
and later by the Hydro-Electric Commission
itself. to have the expert pormits cancellednot summarily, but gradually, by deducting so
much per year until steamn plants and other
auxiliary plants could be provided to replace
the power being sent to the United States.
But the American companies contended that
they had made a contract for fifty years, notwithstanding that at the tiîne tbey made the
contract they knew~ the permit was granted
only fromi ycar to year and was subject to
cancellation at any time.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBA CH: Will the honoiîrable gentleman explain how they could contend for a definite period of fifty years when,
as hie says, they knew they had a year-to-year
contract?
Hon. Mr. REID: The Ontario Power Company, the private company that owned thes3
com-panies before the Hydro-Electric Comnmission purchased them, gave the American
customers a contract to supply them. for
fif'ty years with a certain quantity of power.
The quantity could easily be ascertained, but
1 think it was about 50,000 or 60,000 horsepower. Then the Ontario Power Company
came to Parliament and got a permit for one
year. They were notified that it was granted
for only one year, and they in turn notified
the companies in the United States that notwithstanding their contracts, the Dominion
Government controlled the situation and
would not gîve a permit for more than a year,
and could cancel the permit in whole or in
part at any time, as power was required in
Ontario.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: What is to prevent the Government of Canada at the end
of any year simply refusing to give a permit?
Hon. Mr. REID: Nothing wbatever. The
Dominin Government did notify the private
companies, and it took every step ilt could
to cancel the contracts. By looking at the
files in the Department one can sre where
the priva)te companies took up the question
with some Board in New York State-I forget the name of the Board at the momentand that Board served notice that cancellation would be considrrd an unfriendly act.
They rontended that large industries hiad bren
built and were using this powrr.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU:
Was not that a
matter of contract between individual and
individual, or between company and comnpany? Would that not be a matter for the
courts, if there wrre any damages resulting
from cancrîlation of the contracts?
Hon. Mr. REID: There might bie a qucstion of damages between the American company and the company in Canada.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: What bas the Government to do with it?
Hon. Mr. REID: Nothing whatever,
except to caneel the permits. But th'.n United
States Government authorities took up the
question at once and said that tbey would
look upon canrellation of -the permîts *by the
Dominion Government as an unfrirndly aot.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will the honourable gentleman inform the Senate what
American authority said it would be an unfriendly act? Was it a New York State or
a Washington authority?
Hon. Mr. REID: It was seime public commission, or the New York State Government.
I have read it dozens of times.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It makes aIl
the <lifference in the world who said it.
Hon. Mr. REID: If I had known this
question was coming up, I should have bren
able to gîve the information. I think it was
the Publie Utilities Oommissdon of New
York State. At ahl events, thry took such a
strong position that if action had bren taken
by -the Dominion Government there would
have been retaliation of some kind. The timc
we wanted the power over here was duritig
the war, and very strong pressure was put on

Peninsula; but the United States Government

all. The Hydro-Electric Commission wanted
the 145,000 horse-power-I think that is the
quantity; at least, pretty nearly that amount.
We wanted to use it in Ontario, and could
use it to-day.
The Hydro-Electric Power Commission
took over those plants, and they are selling
power to this private corporation in New York
State, which las only a transmission line, and
which is selling the power at high ptices. This
company bas a fifty-year contract at $9 per
horse-power, and we are paying $15 per horsepower to the Gatineau Power Company for
145,000 horse-power. That is the position in
Ontario. According to this Bill, as I understand it, the Governor in Council has power
to renew that license to export. I take it
for granted that the Minister bas looked into
this matter, and that if the license were cancelled there might be some retaliation, or
some trouble between the United States and
Canada. We are paying $6 per horse-power
more than we are getting for 145,000 horsepowe. ail of whiuh is within the Province of
Ontario. I should like to see that export rut
off, because the power is ours. It was agreed
and understood that it might be eut off.
As to the other clause with respect to cases
of emergencyHon. Mr. BUREAU:
gency.

Temporary

omer-

lon. Mr. REID: This expert to Buffalo
was only for a temporary emergency. Once
they get the power over there you will never
get it back. The samie is true of the Cedar
Rapids power. We tried to get more of that
for Eastern Ontario, and they refused point
blank to let us have it, and we had to threaten
to eut off all the power, and finally out of
60.000 horse-power we got 10,000. Remember,
that power is being exported at $10 per horsepower. Because of the price of $15 which
we are charged by the Gatineau Power Company, plus the cost of transmission, and because of the price of $9 at which we are exporting power, the people of the province of
Ontario must pay, for all tirne to come, a tax
of $6 per horse-power on 145,000. We are losing a million dollars a year, while this private corporation in Buffalo, that bas nothing
but a transmission line, is getting a million
dollars a year out of Ontario, and will continue to do so in perpetuity.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Why does my
honourable friend say in perpetuity?
Hon. Mr. REID: Because there is a contract for fifty years, and the same question
will arise again. Do you think we shall ever
get that power back? We shall never get it
back as long as we live. Furthermore, acHon. Mr. REID.

cording to the Treaty they are to get a certain quantity of the power produced at the
Niagara river. It is most unfair. It is unfair of the United States Government not
to insist that an agreement made with Canada should be carried out.

H'on. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Is it not
a fact that when licenses are granted-timber
liecnses, for instance, and licenses for the use
of public land or property-it is the practice
Io renew them unless some extraordinary condition arises? And is it not a fact that there
was nothing in this license given by the
Dominion Government to alter that practice?
Wa it anything more than an ordinary license

Why should that power be tiken away from

I wouild not tvf o te throw this Bill out; it
is a siepl in the riglit direction; but I do not
think it goes far enough. A clause stating

are told thtat the Quebec Legislature lias protected that, and what Quebec has donc will

I have always feared is that, although the
Beauharnois Company is not permitted te
export the power, it may sell it to some other
Canadian company which would get permission to export. Therefore, in the interest of
Eastern Ontario and in the interest of the
Province of Quebec, I think it should be
clearly stated that where there is a large
quantity of power to be disposed of Parlia-

ment shall determine whether or not it may
be exported, because once it has gone we
shall never get it back. The Province of
Quebec should guard against getting into
a position like that of the Province of Ontario, a position in which the people of Ontario will have to pay a tax for fifty yearsI siy in perpetuity-because power that we
should have in Ontario is sold to this American syndicate at a million dollars a year less
than we have to pay for the same quantity
of power. Furthermore, the company that was
taking this power from the Ontario Power
Company has been merged in a billion dollar
corporation which controls all the power in
New York State. Do you think such a corporation would not be influential enough to
secure the backing of the Government of the
United States and the carrying on of its policy
of the past ten or fifteen years of insisting
that we should not cancel the license, or that
if we did it would be an unfriendly act?
While I am willing to let this Bill go
through, I hope the day will come when Canada will secure the power to which it is
entitled, and that power will not go to subsidize a private corporation in the United
States. If Parliament has the settling of this
matter there will not be so many applications
for the export of power. I venture to say
that even under this clause pressure will be
brought to bear on the Government to allow
the export of an additional quantity of power,
and it will be stated that an emergency exists.
Parliament is the only proper body to protect
the rights of the people.

way as a timber lease. So we cannot possibly
help ourselves. Supposing we were supplying
power for lighting a town, or pumping its
water, or driving its street cars, and had been
doing so for years, how could that be stopped?
It would be an unfriendly act. The moral is
that wha.t is gone is gone, and that you should
not export any more.

The second proviso

that the proposed amendment will in no way

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Reid),
the power that is gone now has gone forever.
I think everybody agrees with him in that.
The honourable gentleman from Hamilton
(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) is right also, because when there is a lease from year to year,
it is understood that it goes on in the same

Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Does the honourable
gentleman take it for granted that if you have
no proviso regarding those licenses which have
been granted before the lst of January, 1929,
Parliament will turn down any application
for renewal?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I understand that
everything that has been done before this
year remains as it is.
Do you take it for

No.

Then why argue that

Parliament has

to leave what is already in existence. It
may have been unwise; it may have been a
mistake; and we may have to pay through
the nose; but it is done. The moral is: in
the future do not export any more.
Hon. Mr. REID: But the honourable
gentleman understands that the permit was
given only from year to year.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Up to 1935. The
Governor in Council may continue to renew
those licenses at his discretion. But new
licenses applied for would have to secure the
approval of Parliament. Now, the amendment of my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Bureau) proposes to eut off absolutely in
1935 the granting of temporary licenses, as
well as what may be termed permanent ones,
so that every license to dispose of a surplus
of power, no matter if it were only for thirty
days, would have to be approved by Parliament even though Parliament were not in
session and might not meet for another six
months. I think that the Bill as it stands is
about as satisfactory as we can make it.

154

SENATE

I agree with the honourable gentleman from
Grenville (Hon. Mr. Reid) that if it were
possible it would be very desirable to rectify
the error of the past and save the enormous
power bill the Province of Ontario is now
paying; but we are not able to remedy that
situation at this time without creating friction with our friends and neighbours across
the line. It is now proposed in the Bill that
new licenses must secure the approval of Parliament, except in cases of emergency. I submit, honourable gentlemen, that is as far as we
can reasonably go. The amendment now before us would prevent the expert of power that,
temporarily, might not be required here at
all. and revenue would be lost to the owners
without any good being done to anybody. I
cannot sce how that would be in the public
interest; therefore I would suggest that the
amendment of the honourable gentleman
(Hon. Mr. Bureau) might bo withdrawn for
the time being. and that in a year's time, if
ie does not think the Act functions properly,
he should again bring forward bis amendment.
I do not think Parliament should take the
position that nobody is to have authority to
givec consent when Parliament is not in session.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Objection is raised to
this amendment because there is one company
that bas a contract and a license. That is one
of the reasons why I proposed the amendment.
As I have said, in order to pass intelligently
upon this matter it is absolutely necessary
that we hould know what companies have
licenses and under wbat terms they are allowed
to export. I do not see why Parliament should
net assume the responsibility, and, if it secs
fit, continue these licenses. The amendment
says that licenses, for whatever period they are
given, shall be granted on terms and conditions
approved by Parliament. There is nothing
to prevent Parliament from saying that when
there is a freshet, and a consequent excess of
pow-er, a license may be granted. Parliament
can authorize the Minister of the Interior te
act. I do not think the argument advanced
by my bonourable friend can stand, because
Parliament must have more wisdom than even
the Governor in Council, and the regulations
which it made would provide for such a case.
I think it would be wiser to define "temporary
emergency" than to leave it as it now is. The
occurrence of a freshet, or of an accident to
the power machinery of a neighbouring town,
would bo regarded as a temporary emergency.
Either it

late the same thing? I say it is unifair, and
ihat those who export power ought all to
come under the same regulations.
My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Reid)
says the existing condition will continue forever.
Let the people of Canada decide
whether it shall or not.
Let them say
whether they are to be intimidated by the
president of some commission or power company in the United States who says that the
cutting off of the power will be regarded as an
unfriendly act.
After all, the Governor in
Council cannot declare war.
It is for us
to say whether we are committing an unfriendly act or net, and the discussion that
would take place in Parliament would show
these people that we are net animated by bad
feeling, and the citizens of the United States
who incorporate themselves to buy power in
Canada would see a statement of our views
in black and white, and would realize that if
they wanted te get licenses or renewals for
the export of power they would have to submit to the regulations of the Parliament of
Canada.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Do I understand the
position of the honourable member from La
Salle (Hon. Mr. Bureau) to be that he would
prefer that further consideration of the Bill
be deferred until after the information that
he mentions could be put before the Committee?
Hon. Mr. BUREAU:

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Honourable gentlemen, I have listened attentively to the discussion.
I knew nothing about this Bill
before, but I rise to point out my reaction to
the argument, which bas been used very profusely during the discussion, that possibly
we are creating cause for friction, or taking
an unfriendly attitude towards the United
States.
I cannot see that. It seems to me
there is not much difference between the
constant control by Canada of the exportation of power, whether through its Cabinet
or through Parliament, and the adoption of
a tariff which will make trading between
Canada and the United States prohibitive in
some very important respects.
In the past we have felt disposed to let the
exportation of power to the United States go
on, but to-morrow we may have to change our
attitude entirely.
Why should we give our
friends on the other side the idea or hope
that those who have a license te export
that power may keep it forever?

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Honourable gentlemen, I cannot see any use for this
information.
In this Bill I think we have
a very, very valuable concession fro-m the
Govern-ment, which is that aithougli at

the interests which are comprised in the
licenses granted before the Ist of January,

1929.

1 want information, and, as I say,

the information will enlighten this Huse, and
it may hring forward some other amendment
which mnay be for the benefit of the country.
Hon. Mr. BEAjUBIEN: H1onourable gentle-

men, I hope that the motion of the honourable leader of the House will ha adopted.
Everyhody admits that the system of exportation of aur electrie power up till now has been
a vcry disastrous one. I fear also, notwithstanding what has been said, týat the sacrifice
we have made in the past, because the system
was a bad one, is likely to continue. I do
not think that the electrical energy exported
will ever be reclaimed. Evidently the guardýians we have had in the past for ithat part
of aur patzimony-anc of the most precious
-have not been very faithful to their trust,
and now the people want ta change those
guardians, ta withdraw the trust and exercise
it themselves, through Parliament.
The honourable gentleman from La Salle

prescrit, as I apprehend the law, the Government may at its wvill allow the export of
power from Canada under any condition, yet
the Governmeot has now concedeýd to Parliament the right to say in future that no export of power shall be made except under
present licenses, or only for tcmporary purposes.
I am much su'rprised that this concession was granted, and 1 think that if we
go on postponing the consideration of this
Bill for the purpose of getting information,
which in mny humble judgment can do us no goes anc step farther. Under the Bill the withgoo*d in the end, we may imperil its passing. drawal of control irom the Governor in Council

that the principle of the Bill will then be
adopted; and we shall have the opportunity of
extending that principle as suggested by the
proposed amendment.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: The Bill
provides that no new licenses for export of
power shall be granted by the Government,
excepting in emergencies. It also provides
that from the provisions of the Bill shall be
excluded the renewal or cancellation of licenses
heretofore granted.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:

What are they?

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: The point
I want to make is that it does not make
the least difference what they are. We are
considering the question in two aspects. Do
we approve of withdrawing from the Government thie right to grant original licenses?
That is all we have before us. No person
has asked that we go any farther, and this
Bill does not go farther.
Hon.

Mr.

DANDURAND:

Except

the

amiendment.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: This Bill
does not in effect deal with existing licenses,
b(cause it excepts them from its ambit. Does
anybody dream that the bringing down of
information showing the number of these
licenses is going to increase the probability
that the Government will accede to my honourable friend's request to have the control
over existing licenses taken away from themsOIlvOs?

Hon. Mr. BUREAU:

What do the licenses

I do not
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
care what they contain. The Government
knows what they contain, and the Governmuent knew that when the Minister saidas I understood he did-that he would approve
of this Bill with the provisos that are in it.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Wil'l my honourable
friend allow me to ask a question? Does he
advance the argument that we are to be bound
by the statement of the Minister?
There is
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
no use in trying to evade the point. This Bill
wouild never have reached us, the Government
would nover have allowed it to reach us, if
this exception had not been made. There
is no use in beating around the bush. I
understand that before the private member
who promoted this Bill could get it through
the House he had an interview with the
Minister. and they reached a compromise.
The Minister, speaking for the Government,
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

said, "We wili allow the passage of this Bill
through the Chamber provided you insert
certain conditions that I now suggest." The
Bill, an amendnient to a public Act, was
passed by the House at the instance of a
private member only after he had made that
concession at the suggestion of the Minister.
In my humble opinion, we have got all we
The Government have made an
can get.
enormously valuable concession of authority.
If we send the Bill back with an amendment,
the whole thing may go up in the air. Let us
take what we can get, and later on if any honourable member thinks he can obtain a
better concession, let him bring in a Bill. In
my opinion the question of exporting or not
exporting power is one in which Canada is
vitally interested. It entails a great responsibility, and Parliament can congratulate itself that it is to have that responsibility in
its own hands. I think we should let the
Bill stand as it is.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
gentleman must realize in what position I
am. I have been asked to furnish some information before this Bill is considered further. In the seven or eight years that I have
been in this place I have never refused to
comply with such a request, and I cannot
ignore this one.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Thelhonourable leader is quite right. I know he is
generally very courteous in complying with
requests, but I suggest that this Chamber
should not allow him to comply with the
present one.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I understand the
position of the honourable gentleman (Hon.
Mr. Lynch-Staunton) to be that we in this
House should be careful and be good boys.
The Minister in the other House has allowed
us to have certain things, and if we are not
good we shall not get them. But we are
simply asking for information. We are not
undertaking to amend the Bill, and after
getting the information we may be perfectly
satisfied to accept the Bill as it is, or may
wish to make it go a little farther. It may
1) that if the Bill is amended here it
will not be accepted by the other House. But
surely what we have to do here is the best
we can. If an amendment made in this House
improves the Bill, so much the worse for
the other House, and especially for the Minister, if they refuse to accept it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
This Chamber
is not obliged to insist on its own amendment. If we make an amendment that does
not meet with the approval of the other
House, we may not insist on it.

MAY 1, 1929
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Certainly. All we
ask is that further information be given to
this House before we deal finally with the
Bill.
Progress was reported.

CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS ACT
AMENDMENT BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM moved the second reading of Bill 130, an Act to amend the
Canadian National Railways Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, in moving the second reading of this Bil, before
asking that it be sent to the Railway Committee, I might explain that ius provisions
are very simple. The first one is to clarify
the
definition of the term
"Canadian
National Railways." The second is to make
uniform the law as regards expropriation of
property. It transpires that at present. in
accordance with the Canadian
National
Railways Act, expropriation takes place under
the authority of the Exchequer Court, but
the compensation is decided by the local
court. This Bill is intended to put expropriation proceedings. not only as to the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

taking of land, but aNo as to compensation,
under the Exchequer Court. An exception is
made in any case where the compensation
offered is under 82,500; this can be decided
by the local court, as the amount invodved
is not very great.
Another section of the
Bill corrects some merely clerical errors in
the refcrence made to other statutes in the
Act of 1919. The last clause substitutes the
name of the Company for the name of the
Crown as the party who will pay whatever
compensation is decided by the Court.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
CRIMINAL CODE (ESCAPES BY

FLIGHT) BILL
MOTION

FOR SECOND READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON moved the
second reading of Bill D, an Act to amend
the Criminal Code as regards the use of force
to prevent escapes by flight.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the Bill
which I have introduced is inended te amend
rc.tion 41 of the Criminal Code. I think it
cece-sary that I should explain what that
scetion

is. It says:
peace officer proceeding law-fully to
irrest.

for any offence for whiclh the offender niay bc

lecessary to prevent his escape by such flighît,
unless such escape can be prevented by reason-

able ineans in a less violent manner.
I wish honourable gentlemen to remember
particularly that the proposed amendmeent
applies only te persons who are not under
but are fleeing from arrest. My reason
for introducing the Biill is that within the iast
year or two police officers have shot several
persons, perhaps ten, who had not been charged
with any except trivial offences.
In one ase an officer shot and killed a man
against whomi there was no charge whatever,
because ho and his companion, who was a
vagrant, and simply avoiding arrest as a
vagrant, ran out 'of a building. Several officers
were there, and they fired at the two fleeing
men, and the man against whom there was no
charge was shot dead. The man who did the
shooting was brought to trial on a charge of
manslaughter. The judge held that because
the officer believed that he hLd a right to
shoot the man, he must be discharged, Rnd ho
was discharged. That, I think, is the most
extraordinary decision on record. The belief
of the accused that he has a right to shoot a

arrest,

MAY 2,1929
man who is not assau'iting him, and against
whom there is no charge, is a defence which
I think no lawyer woul'd ever dream of
pleading.
Now, another case. Two ladies in a motorcar in the city of Toronto were ordered to
stop by a man in plain clothes. Imagining that
he was a highwayman, and being guil'ty of
no offenoe, they went on. The officer, believing that he had a right to shoot a person who
did not stop when he put up his hand, fired at
them and wounded one of them.
Another case occurred in the city of
Montreal. A charge was laid against a man;
an 'officer proceeded in search of him; a person
with the officer pointed out a man on the
street. I do not know the exact facts, and wilil
not profess to tell them. At all events, the
officer shot a man who was not the wanted
man at all. Nothing was 'done to the officer:
he believed that he hald a right to shoot that
man.
A case in which the boot was on the other
foot has just been decided by the Court of
Appeal in Toronto. A chief constable wanted
to see a certain man regarding a theft of
chickens-I am taking the facts from the
judgment of the Court of Appeal-and he went
to the house of this man, who was not at home.
He then deputed a constable to watch the
house. The constable waited outside for a time.
He saw this man corne out of the house and
go to his motor car with the evident intention
of getting inbao it and ideparting. The constable
thon went up to him, produced a revolver, and
said that if he did not stop he would shoot
him in his tracks. I wi'll give you the text of
the judgment, honourable gentlemen; it willl
be brief:

away and was only recently brought to trial.
No crown witness saw the actual shooting.
Now, here is what the appellant said at his
trial for murder:
At the hearing, the appellant gave evidence
on his own behalf. He admitted the interview
with the high constable and the fact that he
gave him the slip. He returned to the bouse
and changed his clothes. He said that he had
decided to go and see the high constable. He

armed himself with an automatic revolver-he
says, with the intention of throwing it away.
He went out by the back door for the purpose
of entering the Ford car and calling upon the
high constable. He was then confronted by
Waddell, who, the appellant testified, shouted
at him, "Do not move or I will shoot you in
your tracks." Waddell, he said, had his "gun"
drawn. The appellant stepped back a pace or
two and asked Waddell if he had a warrant
for his arrest, to which Waddell replied, "No,
I don't need any but this," pointing his revolver

shot. He then, be says, took his revolver from

intending to knock the weapon out of his hand,
because he had heard that the constable was
"dangerous and treacherous with a gun,"
and killed him.

will, if he is armed, shoot the policeman; and

with proper and able counsel. defending him
such a man would be acquitted as shooting
in self-defence.
In my humble judgment noý
jury would be justified in convicting him. It
is a very serious matter to put a policeman
in such a position.
If that is the law of
Canada-which I do not believe-it is
absolutely barbarous.
There is no such law
in England, and nobody ever dreamed that
Canada had such a law until some judge in
Manitoba held that the police might shoot.
The old common law of England was that
no man had a right to slay another except in
self-defence.
Self-defence covers a great
number of cases, with which I will not detain
you. Self-defence is the only ground on
which a man may take the law into his own
hands and slay another.
I think a common-sense reading of the law
is that if a man is escaping from justice, an
officer may pursue him and use such violence

SENATE

every man for whom he 'has a wairrant, or who
may bc arrested without a warrant, if he starts
to run away.
Let me give you what I think is a typical case of the awfulness of it-for the taking of human life is a dreadful thing. A
motor boat came into Toronto harbour one
night, loaded with liquor of some description; at least that was the assumption, and
I think t was correct, though nobody ever
found out whether it was or not. This motor
boat came to the shore. The police were on
the lookout, and the motor boat put off from
the shore. The police came down to the
water's edge-thcre was no chance of arresting the men in the boat, for they were out
in the decp waiters of the bay by this time
-and opened a fusillade and killed a young
boy who was the engineer of the boat. Is
there any justification or excuse for that kind
of thing? The man who was responsible for
if knew that le could not make an arrest;
he knew the force he was about to use would
not in any way help him; yet he shot and
killed this young boy, and he was never
even prosecuted for it.
In English-speaking countries there is a
great horror of putting men to death, even
when they are convicted of a capital offence,
and there has been a very serions movement
towards the abolition of capital punishment.
I have brought this Bill before you, honourable gentlemen, because I think it is our
special duty to look into and consider the
criminal law. We have all heard about judicial murders. I say that if this Parliament
were to pass a law allowing any man to shoot
another, who might be innocent, that would
be a parliamentary murder and we as a legislative body would be as responsible for that
inurder as if we stood on the street and told
the one man to shoot down the other. Each
one of us would be responsible for making it
a capital crime to endeavour to escape from
arrest.
The cases which would arise under such a
law are ridiculous. Take the case of a man
who is about to commit suicide. An officer
comnes along, the man runs away, and the
officer may shoot him. Think of that! The
man may be, and probably is, demented.
Yet that is one of the specific cases in which
the statute is said to justify the shooting.
I have read through cases, and they are innumerable, where a person who may have
committed no crime at all may be shot if he
attempts to run away.
I have discussed this matter with able and
eminent counsel who have had a large experience in the administration of the law. One
of them, Mr. Peter White, who prosecuted
one of the men I have told you about, has
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON.

had perhaps as great an experience as Crown
Pro'scutor as any man in the Province of
Ontario, and he thinks this situation is shocking and unnecessary. I am told by him that
the Crown Attorney of Toronto entirely
agrees with him. Furthermore, we know that
in England, where there is perhaps as fine a
police system as in any country in the world,
and where men are brought to justice more
quickly than anywhere else, no police officer
is allowed to be armed. In the Irish Free
State, where they have a great constabulary
and where, if in any country in recent years,
there bas been good reason for arming the
police, no policeman goes armed.
In my
humble opinion it is mnch better to follow
lie English system of having peace officers
unarmed than the American system of equipping them with revolvers.
Chief Justice Moredith denounced from the
Benc the law as it stands, and if time permoitted I would read what li said. A memorandum was circulated, and puerhaps sene
lonour:iblu centlemen have read it, in which
Ie spoke about the horrible brutality and
of the present iaw.
There are two points which honourable
gentlemen should eriousl' considIr. Authorities like Chief Justiee Meredith and Mr.
Peter White say thbere is no necessity for such
a law, and I could muention numerous other
persons whc say the samie thing. Secondly,
there is a principle of British justice which, I
contend. should not be violated. Even if a
macîn is guilty of sone small crime it is better
that he should escape bhan be shot. It is
better that 99 minor criminals should escape
than that one innocent man should be slainand nearly all the victims of policemen's revolvers liave been innocent men. I am told
that in Toronto for years there bas not been
an arrest made where it was necessary for the
officer to use or to be in possession of firearms. I will venture to say that there has
been no case at a-Il where a policeman bas
needed firearuis when making an arrest. They
are not needed in England, where there are
40 millions of people, and only recontly have
they been considered necessary in Canada.
I wish honourable gentlemen to understand
clearly that this Bill would not prevent the
arming of policemen if the authorities considered they should be armed. It does not aim
to prevent that at all. The sole purpose is to
prevent a policeman froim shooting a fleeing
man froin whom he has no reason te expect
violence and from whom he stands in no
danger of harm.
Chief Justice Meredith says conditions now
are such that offenders cannot escape, and
there is no necessity to shoot thern down.

shockingness

MAY 2, 1929
Certainly it is not necessary to do so for the
protection of the police. To my mind it is
a very grievous thing that in this enlightened
time we depute to a police officer what we
will not depute to a judge or to a jury, the
right to slay a fellow man. Honourable gentlemen will notice that the law gives this right
of shooting criminals only to a police officer.
It is not given to you or to me in a case where
we have the right to arrest a man. If we
see some real crime committed, we are not
justified nor excused by this law or by any
other law in slaying a person, except in our
own defence. Why should we give to a police
officer what we will not give to a private
citizen?
Every private person proceeding lawfully to
arrest without warrant any person for any
offence for which the offender may be arrested
without warrant is justified, if the person to
be arrested takes to flight to avoid arrest, lu
using such force as may be necessary to prevent
his escape by flight, unless such escape can be
prevented by reasonable means in a less violent
manner,Now, here comes the important clause:
-if such force is neither intended nor likely
to cause death or grievous bodily harm.
I say that everyone, whether an official
or not, who is attempting to arrest a fleeing
criminal, should be permitted to use all necessary force short of maiming or killing him.
That is what I want the law to be in regard
to officers, as it is with regard to everyone
else. In the opinion of men far better able
to construe the Statutes than I am, it was
never intended to give to a policeman the
power to take human life.
One judge has said that police officers have
come to the conclusion that they need not
run very hard in chasing a criminal; that all
they have to do is to shoot. There are many
people who, when in possession of a firearm, have no conscience and no appreciation
of the terrible responsibility before God and
man which is taken in sending a man unprepared to meet his Creator.
This is no small matter, honourable gentlemen, and I for one feel that I dhould not be
doing my duty as a member of the Parliament
of Canada if I accepted the responsibility of
allowing to stand on our Statute Book-if
it is there, or if it has been by judicial
decision construed into the 'Statutes-a law
which gives such great power to police officers,
without raising a protest against it and endeavouring to have the law changed and made
worthy of a civilized community.
I therefore move the second reading of this
Bill.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I agree with my
honourable and learned friend that this is

16

a very important Bill. As he pointed out in
conclusion, the effect is to alter section 41
of the Criminal Code, which deals with the
immunity that a police officer enjoys in pursuing a person fleeing from arrest, and to give
it the sarne termination as section 42, which
states the immunity that a private citizen
has in the sarne circumstances. A police
officer who is pursuing, for the purpose of
arresting, a suspected person who is fleeing,
may use "such force as may be necessary to
prevent his escape by such flight, unless such
escape can be prevented by reasonable means
in a less violent manner." A citizen who is
pursuing a person fleeing from arrest may also
use force, "if such force is neither intended
nor likely to cause death or grievous bodily
harm."
The Bill, in short, proposes to put the police
officer in precisely the same position as the
private citizen in sim.ilar circumstances. My
honourable friend asks why the police officer
should have a different immunity from that
of the private citizen. The answer seems to
me fairly obvious. Because lie is a police
officer, charged with the maintenance of the
peace, for that reason he ought to have, in
my judginent, a different immunity from that
of an-v citizen who happens to corne along.
What is the evil which my honourable
friend seeks to remedy? He alleges that
there have been a number of cases of promiscuous shooting by the police in Canada; that
in seeking to prevent the escape of persons
who were sublyequently found to be
criminals, police officers had used firearms and
that in some cases persons who were not
criminals were fired upon, and even persons
who had nothing to do with the affair were
accidentally shotNot
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
accidentally; deliberately.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: No, I do not
think my honourable friend can say that. In
such a case the policeman believed he wedischarging his duty when lie fired.
He deHon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
liberately shot the person, though.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: He may have
fired deliberately, but the person who was
killed had nothing to do with the affair at
all. I know of a case which happened many
years ago where a policeman fired at a fleeing
criminal and wounded a person nearby.
The evil which it is sought to cure by this
legislation is that of the police using their
weapons in preventing the flight of criminals,
and in some cases firing upon a person who,
it may subsequently be proved, was not a
criminal at all, but an innocent bystander. I

and in knowledge of tbe Criminal Code, particularly of these clauses, and as to wben to
shoot and wben not to shoot.
My honourable friend said that in bis
opinion-and I arn certain ho is wrong-all
the arrests that have been made in Canada
migbt bave been made by unarmed constables.
I do not believe that at all. In the old days
of the Mounted Police arrests were frequently
made without the drawing of a weapon, but
no Mounted Policeman ever left the banracks
without being armed, and without knowing
wben, bow, wbere, and under what circumstances ho sbould use his weapon.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: But tbie
Mounted Police is a trained force, and tbe
greatest in the world. Did a Mounited Policeman ever shoot a fleeing man?
Yes, a fleeing

man, and a standing man.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I sbould
like the bonourable gentleman to give me one
case wbere one shot a fleeing man.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: My own leader
defended a Mounted Policeman for sbooting
a fleeing man. I would give my honourable
friend the case of Detective Egan, of the
Mounted Police; I happen to remember bim.
I could give my honourable friend a dozen
cases. I do not recaîl the names and incidents
at the moment, but it would bo a strange
thing if I could not, because I know the fact
to ho as I have stated.
Hon. Mr. LYNCII-STAUNTON: You might
give me on'e.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The Mounted
Police have a training sehool in wbicb. tbey
train a man for six montbs bef ore ho is allowed
out at all, but in the other police forces in
Canada the man is taken on because of bis size
and appearance, and, let us hope, because of
bis character; and within a week or less ho
is on the street in uniforin, carrying arms,
and discbarging the duties of a police officer.
That is wholly wrong, and it is obvious to
anybody that it is 'wrong. The situation in
Ontaria is being met by the establisbment of
a training school for police officers.
Hon. Mr. LYNCHýSTAUNTON: It is not
established yet.

New Brunswick Railway Company.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Explain.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Explain the
Bill.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Honourable gentlemen, as I uniderstand it, this Bill simply
ratifies the Att passed by the New Brunswick
Legislature, and re-enatts it here in so far
as this Parliament has jurisdiction. The
subject-matter of the Bill is, I think, purely
for the Legislature of New Brunswick. The
New Brunswick Railway Company a great
many years ago built a road about 160 or 170
miles in length, from Fredericton, up the St.
John river, through Woodstock and Edmundston, to a place called Connor. At the time
it was built there was given a grant per mile
of railway, of 10,000 acres of Crown lands in
the province of New Brunswick, totalling
about 1,647,000 acres, instead of the usual
subsidy. Subsidies cane in later. The owner-

lion. Mr. CASO-RAIN:
Fer a very gond
roason. This heneurabýle lieuse knews that

MAY 7,1929
railways are very expensive to build, and it is
very difficult to get the necessary money. The
other day Sir Henry Thornton said that no
more charters should be given, but that the
C.P.R. and the Canadian National Railways
should build all the roads in the country. I
really believe that would be a very good thing.
But different people have kept saying, "We
wil build this line." They have had surveys
made and incurred considerable expense,
thinking that perhaps they could get the
Government to help, and could then secure
the capital. Personally I doubt very much if
they can get the capital, as it is a very expensive road to build. The country is partially
settled, and the road would have been built
long ago if those people lhad had justice, and
had representatives in this House and the
other to ask for it. Instead of that, they
compete about getting charters, and nothing
cornes of it.
Ever since I have been in this senatorial
division I have heard about this road. I said
to the people: "Why don't you go straight to
the Government and ask them to build your
road? They are building roads all over
creation; there will be over 2,400 miles of new
road built in the Northwest, and that territory
has now four times as much railway per head
of population as we have in Quebec. They
have a mile of railroad in the Northwest for
every 120 persons, which means a mile of railroad for 30 or 40 families, but it takes 500
persons in Quebec to have a mile of railroad." We shoul-d let those people have
their oharter, and when they start the work
the Government might take hold and finish
the road for them.
Hon. Mr. ROBER'ISON: Lest my honourable friend should think I am not in sympathy
with this charter being granted, or this road
being built, I wish to say I intended only to
express the idea that he, being interested in
this particular locality, which he represents,
would desire to see the railway built and not
have a charter given to people who, after
contending and competing for it, and promising that they would proceed at once to construct the road, have not constructed it. I
was only trying to help my honourable friend
to get the railroad.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I might suggest
that my honourable friend could do what is
being done with regard to the building of
branches throughout the West. I remember
three or four years ago presenting Bills for
the construction of twenty-eight branches, and
with each Bill there was submitted a state-

173

ment by the railway authorities giving the
area which the branch would serve, the population in the ¶ocality, the crops to be carried
from that region, the products which would
enter that part of the country, and an expression of the belief that the branch would pay
for itself. My honourable friend, having a
paternal interest in this district, might prepare such a memorandum, and introduce a
delegation who would assure this House that
the branch would pay.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is for the
Committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

On the Order:

Fluid Exportation Act (Exportation of Electric

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Honourable gentlemen, with the consent of my honourable
friend whose name is attached to this Bill,
and with the leave of the House, I move
that this Order be discharged and placed on
the Order Paper for to-morrow. This motion
is not made with the assurance that the
Senate will be able to discuss this Bill intelligen'tly to-morrow, but the delay will give
me an opportunity to lay before the House,
when the Order is called, a rather voluminous
return that I have in answer to the questions
of the honourable gentleman from La Salle
(Hon. Mr. Bureau). These documents will
have to be spread on Hansard, and then another day may be taken next week for the
continuation of the discussion on this bill in
a more intelligent way.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: I understand that the
Bill will not be gone on with to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. DANDURANID: No; if it lies
in my power to have it postponed, it will
be postponed until the following week.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I understand the
idea is to put on record the replies to the
honourable gentleman, so that we aIl may
read them.

Hon. Mr'. ROBERTSON: May I ask the
privilege of reverting for a moment te section
2 cf thse 1i11, rclating te thse protection, safety
a.nd convenience of thse public at highxvay
crossings, to inquire cf my honcurable friend
who is sponsoring the Bill wýhother in fixing
the amount cf $200,000 ecri year foir tee yeaî's
aoy stiolis coosideration was givon te proteoting highxvay ci'ossings and oliminating gr'ade
cîeossinigs as fai' as possible?
I fisink that is
one of tise most un.efîi serx'ices the Goverement and the railxvays ran gix'e te our country
in f hese modce'n days. I helieve that more
lives were lest last year by highway accidents
af railroad crossings than fromt arv other oe
cause in fhe country. The aggrogate toîl cf
hutmait liff as a resit cf such accidents is
appailing. Whiie I iseartily commnil tise

tdicre xvas cli'cussed tise possibilitv cf iincreasîîng. or ex'cn doubling, flie amnount te, be
gi'anfed for this vory ssful and laudable purpose.
iiht Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
Honourable
geilermen, tise hi'.toi'v cf this proposai te aid
in eliminating or protectieg lex'el cossiegs is
soiewhat intoresting. I think it n'as away
back in 1909 that fisc thon Minister cf Railways concoived tise idea cf liaving an Art
passed by xxhieh the raiiway, the municipalitios
and tisis ccxv fuod tisat xvas hoiniz ci'eated
slictld contrihete
in certain propor'tions,
limifed f0 fixed amounts f0 be docided by tise
Board of Raiiway Commissioners.
A great
matny level cro'ssiegs have boen eliminated by
this moans. Tise roasen that Bill vas introduced and passod xvas fhis. No railway comnpaov, could undenfake toeoliminate all tise
grade cros'sings. As xve ail knoxv, in years gone
by. many municipalitios not onlv allexvoed
iailwavs to ceme in on level crossingp, but
gave thin part of tise town. It was thougist
ad~,botiat if those levrul cros-iu.z were te
ho oliminated the municipahity should bear a
share of the ccst. A certain amount xvas sot
aside for a torm cf yoatrs. I think tisat amount
xvas increased inter. Tise fund was net ail iised
for the cimination of grade crossings, but was
accumulating. I thiok thse reason for thaf,
largely, was that when tise mînnicipalifies found
tisat tise applicaticon te hav'e a grade crossing
oiminatcd implied that thoy paîd part of tise
ccst, tisere xvone probabiy not se many appliraflons foi' stuci eliminaitions. As a matfar cf
fact, 11np 1928, I think-tsere is a roture np
te
f0 1929, but it rcally did net include a pay-

MAY 7, 1929
ment of somne 860,000 in 1928 and 1929-there
was accumulated in that fund $1,900,000. If
my memory serves me, an Act has been passed,
or provision made, for the use of that money
to a large extent in the elimination of grade
crossings. In order that the fund miglit not
bie unduly depleted, the Governinent and Parliament thought if wise to continue the contribution of $200,000 a year. 1 arn informed
that more active steps will be taken towards
the elimination of level crossings, and larger
amount s wilI be granted for that purpose.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOISTER:
Is there any legisdation to conspel a municipality to pay a certain port-ion of the cost,
when a dangerous crossing is seif-evident?
I arn not

speýaking legally, but there is no legislation
that I know of.
Hon. -Mr. WILLOUGHBY: It is a provincial matter anyway.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Yes. You are
liable to run into conflict with the provinces
there, because the municipa!lities are under
the control of the provinces. So it is a rather
difficult matter to handle. I think the Board
of Rai'lway Commissioners is very rnuch alive
to the situation to which my honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Robertson) was referring,
and I expeet to see more nef ivity in the
elimination of level crossings. It strikes me
that a large nuniher of level crossing accidents
are -due more to the driverýs of automobiles
than to the rai!lways. Anything that tends to
prevent loss of lif e and property should be

Qaxebec is considering an Act-I arn not sure
whether it is passeed-to corpe4 every automobile driver to 'corne to a dead stop some

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If is passed.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: And the same
hags been d-one in Saskatchewan.
And it is a

good law.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: There is now
a similar law in m.osf oities, requiring

Hon. Mr. STANFIELD: They do flot al

crossing would be one of the most effective
steps that could be taken tow.ards the prevention of lewel crossing accidents. This is of
vitaýl importance, and I beilieve no great success can *be attained in the direction of addif ionai safety unfil the Fecleral authorifies, the
provinces and the mu.nicipalities alI combine
in legizl.atiýon to compel people to be more
careful.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: As I undersfand
it, the Board of Railway Commissioners bas
jurisdiction whicb would be ample to meet
Under
cases deserving urgent attention.
the Railway Act an application may be made
to the Board for a protective device at any
level crossing. The Board's consulting engineer
is then sent out to examine the locality and
to make a report. If is within the power of
the Board to adopf the report of the engineer
and order that certain measures be taken,
nofwithistanding the possible confliet between
Federal and provincial jurisdictions. It is
well known that, according to nurnerous decisions of the Privy Council, wben we are legislating on a matter thaf is clearly witbin
Federal .Iurisdiction we have power to regulate by law the incidences of that subjeet, and
if does flot appear f0 me that there is any
reason why the Board should not act on the
application of any individual. It is not necessary that a municipality sh'ould make an
application, as any individual in a community
may apply to the Board for an order to have
steps taken f0 prevent railway crossing accidents; and I think the Board has acted on
many such applications. I suppose that in
most cases a municipality, knowing that if
may have to contribute to the cost of providing protection at a level crossing, is not very
eager f0 make application to the Board. But,
as I say, any individual in the rnunicipality
can make an application to the Ra;ilway
Board.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I think anyone
can make an application te the Board, but
perhaps the legal position might not be
exactly as if bas been put by the honourable
gentleman; thaf is, thaf the municipalities
would be obligated to pay because the protecfing of a crossing was an incident f0 the
building of a railway, which is undýer Dominion control. I think fhe Acf empowers
fhe railway companies f0 construef the protective devices, contingent on the municipality in question confributing the proportion
to be fixed by the Railway Board. The condition is sirnilar to thaf in cases where the

SENATE

I should have been pleased to see the
anount here increased, as the construction of
railways in the West, and to some extent all
over Canada, is going on apace, although the
honourable gentleman from De Lanaudiere
(Hon. Mr. Casgrain) says it is not going that
way in Quebec. It has corne to my attention
that there is an increasing tendency in the
Wesr to provide protrective devicesý at level
crossings, and with the increase in railway
mileage the demands on this fund will grow
proportianatelv. Therefore I should have been
glad if the Government had seen fit to provide a much larger sum.
When application is made to the Raiiway
Board, I hiik a good deal depends upon who
las priority-wheter the making of the
road preceded the construction of the railway.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That is a bone
of contention.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend should rest satisfied with the knowledge
that for the time being there is plenty of
money available for the work. A fund of
$2,000,000 or thercabouts is being contributed.
Wlhen it begins to be depleted Parliament can
c.onsider inircasing the amount.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I do not want
to bore the House in pursuing this inatter
further, but I should liike to point out that,
if I remember correctly-I have not looked
up the Act-the vote that rny right honourable friand (Right Hon. Mr. Graham) says
has accumulated was for a little different purpose, namely, for grade separation-putting
subways under raihvay tracks. These undertakings are rather expensive, and a municipality will hesitate before asoming its share
of the cost of such works.
But this Bill, as I read it, goes considerably
fartlher than the right honourable gentleman
stated. It says that this vote "shali be appropriated anad set aipart from the Consolidated Fund of Canada to aid actual construetion work for the protection, safety and
convenience of the public." That is much
broader in its scope than grade separations.
It seems to me that the Government have
appre.ciated the growing necessity of taking
some action to remedy this emergency situation that is becoming more serious every year.
I have no cri-ticism to offer on what the Government have done, except to repeat that I
should have been glad if they had found it
possible to go farther. However, no doubt
my honouraible friend the leader of the Govermenit will keep in mind what he has
intimated. that if the demand is insistent and
the conditions warrant, we may hope for
something furtheT in another Session.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: Has my tigiht honourable friend who has this Bill in charge (Right
Hon. Mr. Graham) information as to the
number of crossings throughout Canada which
will have to be dealt with under legislation
of this kind?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I imagine that
would depend on the reports of the Board of
Railway Commissioners.
I presume they
have a list of crossings where further protection is urgently needed, but I have nothing
of that kind before me. I have a lot of statistics as to the money that has been expended, and comparisons with United States
figures, and so on, but they are very lengthy
and, I imagine, would not be of any great
interest. For example, there is a statement
that in 1927-28 there was an expenditure
from this fund of $678,787.63, and in 1928-29,
$672,661.16. I think those large outlays were
due in some measure to the elimination of
grade crossings in some large centres, because, while the municipalities made payments, a large amount of money was drawn
out of the fond for this purpose.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Has my honourable friend any information as to the amount
spent in 1923-24 as compared with 1927-28?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I have not,
but I might be able to get that for my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: What is the policy,
or is there any policy, in regard to level crossings when new railways are being built? For
instance, in the last two years we have
authorized the construction of a number of
new lines of railway. Is this question of grade
crossings taken into consideration in any way
with respect to these new railway lines, or
is the same policy being pursued as in years
past, of creating difficult situations and then
dealing with them as we are now proposing?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Under present
conditions, where branches are being opened
up in new country, I imagine care will be
exercised, but the question of level crossings
is not so acute in newer districts as in older
sections. It would be necessary to have the
consent of the Board of Railway Commissioners if any protests were made with respect to certain municipalities, but in new
country where branch lines are badly needed
in order to get goods to market, they are
not making much comment about level crossings. My own opinion is that the greatest
good could be accomplished by legislation
passed, without further delay, by those provinces that have not already enacted it, to

MAY 7, 1929
compel automobile drivers to do their share
in preventing accidents, and by having the
law administered by an authority that can
control the drivers.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I thoroughly
agree with my right honourable friend, and
I would point out just one fact. There are
roughly 30,000 men in Canada who are charged
with the responsibility of operating railway
trains, and I have personal knowledge of the
fact that a number of these men, especially
those in, charge of engines, are becoming prematurely old because of the nervous strain
resulting from running fast trains through
thickly settled districts. Some of these men
scarcely make a trip without their hair standing on end because of the narrowness of the
escape of an automobile. So that not only for
the safety of the public, but also for the sake
of that army of men whlo are doing their best
to carry on transportation service without
accidents, I think the Stte should do its
utmost in helping to make crossings safe,
either, as my right honourable friend suggests,
by enacting legislation putting on automobile
drivers the responsibility for taking care, or
in some other way. The man in charge of a
locomotive cannot get out of the way; and
honourable gentlemen may imagine what an
engineer's feelings must be when he is
approaching a crossing and, seeing stafled
there an automobile containing human beings,
perhaps women and, children, realizes that he
is unable to prevent an accident.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I might mention
an amusing- experience I had some time ago.
I had motored through a village and as I
passed it I saw a signal indicating that I was
approaching a railway crossing. About 100
feet from the crossing the road became very
rough, and I asked a bystander why it was
in that condition. He said: "We have purposely made it so. That is the best signal we
can give to motor car drivers that they are
approaching the scrôssing."
Section 2 was agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed to.
The Bill was reported.
THIRD READING

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM moved the third
reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time and passed.

Hon. Mr. DANDUIRAND: No.
Tbe Senate again went into Committee on
the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Copp in the Chair.
The last time
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
we took up this Bill I wa.s asked for some
information, which I have obtained from tbe
Department of Trade and Commerce. As there
are several columns of figures, whicb will appear in flansard, I should like to preface
tbem with a short explanation of the situation
of Canada in the matter of the exportation cdf
elecLric power to the south.
Thezre are four large plants on the Canadian side of the Niagara River, three of
wbich are under the Hydro-Electric Power
The three under the HydroCommission.
Electric Powe-r Commnission are the following:
1. The one built by the Ontario Power
Company with American money and under
American control. Wben the Hydro-Electric
Power Commission purchased th-at plant it
assumed a contract by wbich 60,000 h.p. were
delivered to the American aide.
2. The Ele-ctrical Development Company
(for generating power distributed by the
Toronto Power Compa'ny), which generates
some 100,000 h.p. That company, taken over
by the Hydro-Electric Power Commission, bas
no expert contract.
3. The Hydro-Electric Power Commission's
own plant at Queenston. Tbe Hydro-Electric
Power Commission exported last year under
liýcense, out of the off-peak or surplus, 62.298
Its license allows it to export 107,000
h.p.
h.p.
The feurth large company on the Niagara
River is the Canadian Niagara Power Comnpany, a subsidiary of the American company
operating on the New York side, wbich oper&tes independently ýof the Hydro-Electric
It is the pioncer comPoweýr Commission.
pany and was built by Ameri-can money at
a time wben there was no market on the
Canadian side. 'It has an Ontario charter,
which it dlaims gives it the right teo export.
It generates some 100,000 h.p., and has a
license to exper't 60,300 h.p. under its contract,
but it actually exported 50,300l h.p. last year.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Is the date of its
charter given?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am not quite
sure that the date of the charter is given,
but 1 can procure that information quite
easily. It is an Ontario charter. 0f course
it is anterior to 1907, when the Parliament
of Canada passed an Act requiring licenses.
It has also a license to export 26,800 h.p.
off-peak or surplus power, but it exported
78600-12à

179

only 27 h.p. The surplus licensed for export
Î.3 also calird power returnable on demand, if
there is any need in Canada.
There is also a fifth smail plant, whieh has
a license to expert 268 h.p. for the operation
of electric rail'way cars to and fromr the American side, over the international bridge at
Niagara Falls. The export is intermittent,
as the cars are going and coming across the
border.
The other large exporting plant is the Cedars
Rapids Manufacturing and Power Company,
controlled by the Montreal Liglit, Heat and
Power Corporation. It bas a license to export 100,500 h.p., and actually exported during the past year 67,881 h.p.
The Canadian Niagara Power Company,
tbe Electrical Developinent Company, and
the Ontario Power Company, obtained their
licenses for export on the same day, the 9th
of November, 1907, after the Federal Act
requiring a license was passed.
The licenses of the Electrical Development
Company and the Ontario Power Company
were, in 1924, obtained in the name of the
Hydro-Electric Power Commission, wbich controlled them; and the Hydro-Electric Power
Commission at the same time obtained another license, to expert off-pcak or surplus
power.
The Cedars Rapids Manufacturing Power
Company obtaincd a license on the 9th of
October, 1912, for the expert of 60,300 h.p.
(45,000 k.w.), and in 1915 this license was increased to cover 100,500 h.p. (75,000 k.w.).
I am alluding only to the large expert
companies, for there are others appearing on
the statement which 1 now table.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:
amount exported?

What is the total

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: By these companies I have just mentioned, or by these
and the others?
Hlon. Mr. BEIQUE: By aIl.
Hlon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not know
that there is an addition made of the amount
exported.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That is copied
in the blue book, any-way.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU» My bonourable friend
MHon. Mr. Dandurand) bas said that two
licenses were taken out by tbe Hydro-Electrie
last year, or the year before last, but he has
not given us the amount of power it was
allowed to expert under those licenses.

180

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
What I stated
was that in 1924, some years after the HydroElectric Power Commission had obtained
control of the Electrical Development Company and the Ontario Power Company, the
Commission asked for one license to replace
the two that had been granted to those two
companies which it absorbed, and which had
continued to export under separate licenses
for some years after the purchase. It was
not until 1924 that the Hydro-Electric asked
for that license in its own name, and at the
same time it asked for another license, for
surplus or off-peak power.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU:
How much power
was it allowed to export under the two
licenses?

Hlon.

Mr. BUREAU.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My honourable
friend will find that in the table. I am giving information regarding exportation of electrical energy for the year 1928-29. I am
placing on Hansard another statement, showing the amount of electrical energy generated
for use in Canada and for export in the year
ending March 31, 1929; whieh statement appears, I think, in a blue book that has been
distributed. I give also a third table, showing
the narnes of the companies to whom lcenses
have been granted for the export of electrical
energy since the Electricity and Fluid Exportation Act came into force, and the
amounts of such licenses; that is, all the
licenses issued since 1907, including those
issued to companies which do not hold any
at the present time.

MAY 8, 1929
I table also a certified copy of a Minute
of a meeting of the Committee of the Privy
Coundil, approved by His Excellency the
Governor General on the 16th of March,
1925:
The Committee of the Privy Council, on the
recommendation of the Acting Minister of
Finance, advise that a Proclamation be issued
and published in the Canada Gazette under the
authority of Section 10 of the Electricity and
Fluid Exportation Act, Chapter 16 of the
Statutes of 1907, imposing an export duty of

45,000 kilowatts of "off-peak" or "interruptible"
power, please note in making this application it
is understood on the part of the Commission
that this is to be "interruptible" power which
may be recalled for use in Canada at any time
by twenty-four hours' notice when required;
and it is also understood that the Commission
will not enter into any contract for any definite
period for the sale of additional "firm" power
to be exported under this permit.
The above I believe practically reiterates the

Yours truly,

Major J. G. Parmalee,
Acting Deputy Minister.
I an submitting for consideration a further
application from the Hydro Electric Power
Commission of Ontario for a license to export
"off-peak" or "interruptible" power.
This application is in addition to the regular
license to export, which they have enjoyed for
many years past, and relates solely to "offThere are "off-peak" periods
peak" power.
during the twenty4our hours when a large quantity of power is not being used by Canadian
customers, and remains 4dle.
From inquiries made, I find that the Lockport Transmission Company in the State of
New York, the principal customers for Canadian Hydro-Electric Power, have frequently
to use steam plants to generate power, in order
to cover their peak periods. To avoid this
necessity, they 'are willing to purchase the "offpeak" power from the Hydro Electrie Power
Commission without any contractual arrangement, and permitting the discontinuance of the
supply whenever the power is needed in
Canada.
Inasmuch as the cost of developing power at
Niagara Falls and Chippewa bas been very
high, and still remains a serious charge on the
Commission and Province, I see no reason why
this idle power should not be sold to customers
across the line, subject, of course, to immediate
discontinuance if needed in Canada.
Under the circumstances, therefore, I would
recommend that a license, in terms outlined,
be granted for the export of this "off-peak"
or "interruptible" power.

Director.

Dated at Ottawa this l5th day of May, 1924.
I think my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Bureau) will find in these docurlents, under
different headings, all the information he has
asked for.
There is a letter, which I desire to read,
from the present Chairman of the HydroEleotric Power Commission of Ontario, Mr.
Magrath. I had a long discussion with him
laat week over the activities of the Com-

188

SENATE

mission on the Niagara border, and he writes
to me as follows:
Hydýro-Eleetric Power Commission of Ontario
Office of the Chairman
190 University Avenue,
Toronto 2, May 6, 1929.
Honourable Raoul Dandurand, P.C.,
The Senate,
Ottawa.
Re: Discussion of export of power in Senate
on May 1, 1929
Dear Senator Dandurand:
The Commission has three plants operating
on the Niagara River with a total capacity of
about 850,000 h.p. Ourr load is of such a character in this Province that we bave been
having from those plants considerable surplus
off-peak power. We are endeavouring to dispose
of as much of that power as possible in this
Province, and are meeting with a fair amount
of success, especially in so far as the firms offpeak power is concerned.
In the arrangement that we have been operating under, with respect to the export of same,
I want to repeat what I said to you when
discussing this matter on Friday last. namely
that no interests in the United States have the
right to demnand a particle of that class of
power from this Commission. The situation is
that any of such power that we may wish to
offer for sale across the border in the State
of New York, the interests that we have been
dealing with, liaving had to build certain transmission lines, naturally asked to be given the
first right to take such power, and in view of
our being willing to agree to that there was
a time limit fixed, which runs for a few years
longer.
The question of exporting power from this
Province is more or less academic, because, as
you know, we have been buying power in the
Province of Quebec.
I am aware that some concern bas been
expressed -as to the Commission indirectly
making use of power from the Province of
Quebec for export purposes. I believe the Government of the Province of Quebec is satisfied
that that is net being done.
Let ume, however, say that neither directly
nor indirectly are we in any way attempting
to take advantage of the power that we buy
from the Province of Quebec for expert purposes. Furthernore may J say that our records
and works are available for inspection at any
time by the officials of the Government of that
Province, which I believe is already well understood by its Government.
In respect to the expert from Niagara Falls
of firn power, as I told you, the Ontario
Power Company controlled by American interests made a contract for the export of
60.000 h.p. a few years before Parliament
passed an Act in 1907 bearing upon the exportation of electricity. When this Commission
was negoti.ating for the purchase of the Ontario
Power Company it endeavoured to have the contract expiring in 2010 cancelled. It, however
succeeded in baving the date brought back te
1950. In other words that contract will expire
in a little over twenty years' time.
Yours very truly,
C. A. Magrath,
Chairman.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Who signs that?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Mr. Charles A.
Magrath, Chairman of the Hydro-Electric
Power Commission of Ontario.
I do not know whether honourable gentlemen will require further information after they
have perused these documents. If it appears
that the situation should be made clearer, perhaps it would not be out of the way to suggest that next Session we might well appoint
a Committee of this Chamber to examine into
the business of these various companies and
procure definite information on the working
of the contracts under which power is exported.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
My honourable
friend may remember that I asked him if he
could give me an explanation of the words
"temporary emergency." It makes a lot of
difference whether that temporary emergency
is defined as the result of having too much
power on this side of the line, or the result of
a great necd on the other side.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I confess that
I did net know exactly what the word implied,
and in what direction its meaning could be
extended. I put the question to the promoter
of this Bill, and his view was that it meant
a temporary breakdcown on the other side of
the line, or a flood preventing the operation
of the power plants at some point on the
border where we distribute that power. But
this is only the opinion of one person, and
his neighbour may have another conception
of the neaning. Perhaps it would b well to
define the expression. As te how that could
be done, and whether it should be defined in
detail in the Bill, I am ready to ask the
opinion of the Department of Justice. I confess that I had forgotten the question which
my honourable friend bas just renewed. I
will try to find out from wbat authority w«e
can secure an expression of opinion satisfactory to this Chamber.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: In the interpretation of statutes, as I have recently heard,
officials of the Government are inclined to
arrogate to theuselves the right, which belongs to the courts, to construe a document
as to the intent and meaning thereof. I have
always understood that the duty of Governnient officials was to construe a statute in the
light of such explanations as officials of the
Government might have offered on such
statute when it was in Parliament. After all,
it is the Government's policy that is being
carried out.
This Bill was introduced by a private member, but I understand it has been accepted,
at all events to some extent, by the Minister,
md if that is correct, the explanation that my

MAY 8, 1929
hionourable friend might make as to the meaning of this clause should have a profound
eet on the interpretation of the clause subsequentiy, when officiais of the Government
are calied upon to administer it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I admit that
any stateiment that would 'be made by the
present Government as to the construction to
be pla'ced ulpon these words wouid bind that
Government in its action.

a third pa.rty stepped in to colileet toli. Not
at ail. An option was given to that gentleman. This, I might say, is in aceordance with
the way in which our American friende usu-ally
do things. IIsually in suých large transactions
you have to deal with a representative, who
is generally a broker, as brokers are the men
who naturally have such business matters in
hand. Sa an option is not at ail an unicommon
thing. When that gentleman approached the
Canadi-an National Railways their president
imsnediately wrote to the president of the
Dela-ware and Hudson asking if they must
deal with this third man, and the reply was
that he had the option.
My honourable friend says, "Let us wait
until the option expires." Probably that option will not expire, and possibly some persain
else may step in and buy the railroad, which
the 'Canadian National very mucli needs, as
there
the president told us this morning. M3
were any hiding of anytlhdng I rwould say yes,
refer the question back to the Comrmittee;
but it is only an hour or two since the Comnmittee sat and heard this whole niatter at
length. There is no doubt as ta the Committee :being con'viniced that the -Canadian
National Rai]ways had acted properly. There
was no question or even suspicion off wrongdoing. So I think that we had better not
run the risk, by delay, of loeing tihis railway
which is so much needed by the Canadian
National systemn and 'by the people ai that
viciniity. As you know, there are two ways
ai opposing a thing: one way is ta say no ;
the other is ta say, "Let us delay and se
if soxnethi'ng wil'l not turn up." I think that
now is the time to put this transaction
through. It 'las been tharoughly diseussed
and is fresh in the miinid ai eveoey persan, and
there is net even a suspicion that the railiway
is not being purchased as cheaiply as it osau be.
It costs, apacrt filoa the equipment, I think,
a little aver 82W,000 a mile. Well, it takes
a very. poor ra'ilway to be worth less than
$20,000 a mile. Then there is the goad-erill ai
the railway; and there is alsa the fact thet the
peoiple along this line want the service frazn
a Ganadian campany that will develop Canadfian trade, tihe American compe>ny nat being
in a position ta develop that trade and give
adequate service to the people.
I am strongly -of the view that the Cornmittee should not -accept thîs motion ta refer
back, but shauld adopt the repart.

or penurious; but that we have been generous in the past is no reason why we should
accept everything that comes before us and
not warn those in charge of the railroad that
such matters require careful scrutiny and
should be handled with discretion.
I object very strongly to a third party, a
gentleman who is not known to the Canadian
National Railways or to the members of this
House, coming up in the dark and saying, "I
have it fixed that you must deal with me
and no one else." Who wants a railroad that
bas no terminal accommodation in cither
Montreal or Quebec? Who on earth would
buy such a railroad, considering the whole
circumstances?
I spoke this morning in regard to the general financial situation, and I do not intend
to deal with that here. But we have to raise
$352,000,000 in twelve months, 8227,000,000 of
which is for Canadian National projects, and
considering the condition of the financial
world, and viewing the whole situation, 1
think it is about time that we slackened our
pace.
What
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
reason has the right honourable gentleman
to think this elephant would escape?
That might
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
be giving some information my honourable
friend would not want as he wants the other.
Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: The Committee has
passed some twenity odd Bilils reilating to the
West, and for some sessions Parliament, quite
properly, I think, has been providing money
very freely for the construction of railways
for the accommodation of the people of the
West. The territory served by this railway,
with which several members of this House
are familiar, is a very rioh agricuttural area
in the Province of Quebec extending along
the St. Lawrence river from St. Lambert,
opposite Montreal, to some twenty miles from
the Quebec bridge. I think I am in a position to say that this railway is earning more
than its expenditures. From the outset it
has been starved because of not having access
to either the city of Montreal or the city of
Quebec; and the people at Sorel, Nicolet,
and all the other village municipalities along
the line have been elamouring for the improvement of the railway. It cannot be made
to serve that territory adequately without
passing into the hands of the Canadian National.
It seems to me that there would be nothing to be gained by delay. Is it reasonable
to suppose that the Delaware and Hudson,
knowing that $6,000,000 had been spoken of
Hon. Sir EDWARD KEMP.

as a fair price, would lower that price even
if the middleman were to disappear? Evidently the option mentioned has been in
existence for a considerable time, and we do
not know when it will expire. For my part,
I hope that this Bill, which is to enable the
Canadian National Railways to serve that
territory properly, will not be delayed.
Hon. J. D. REID: Honourable gentlemen,
I was at the Committee meeting this morning, but had to leave before this Bill came up
for consideration. I have no objection whatever to the taking over of this railway by the
Canadian National or the Canadian Pacifie,
but we must not disregard the question of the
price to be paid. It seems from the statement made by the right honourable gentle(Right Hon. Mr.
man from Eganville
Graham) that $28,000 a mile is not very much
to pay for a railroad with its equipment, but
I remember that when we took over all the
railways in the provinces of. New Brunswick
and Nova Scotia we set a price of $2,000 per
mile, because none of them were paying.
We werc simply relieving the owners of the
responsibility of carrying on those railways.
Under the Railway Act they could not abandon them, but must either carry them on or
sell them. One line in the county of Gloucester, which was about the same length
as this road, was owned by a company of
which Sir John Gibson was president. We
dealt directly with the company and made
an offer of $2,000 a mile. This offer was
not accepted while I was minister, but I think
it was afterwards, and I believe the road
now belongs to the Canadian National Railways. That line was in about the same condition as the one under consideration.

Hon. Mr. REID: At ail events the offer

so little was that the railway was losing

presen-t price would seem to be high; but if
it is fair and reasonable I have no objection.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
Two thousand
dollars a mile? Would there be no bonds?
Hon. Mr. REID: Two thousand dollars a
mile paid for everything. They had to release the bonds. We got it free and clear of
encumbrance.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hon. Mr. REID: No, it was a line just
like this one, with steam engines and rails
and aIl that sort of thing, and in just about
the condition that has been described by the
honourable member.
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: Honourable
gentlemen, as chairman of the Committee I
do not desire to enter into a discussion of
the merits or demerits of the motion that bas
been made, but in addition to what my right
honourable friend opposite (Right Hon. Mr.
Graham) has said, I think it only proper
to point out that the president of the Canadian National Railways represented that this
line had some potentiai value to the Canadian National as affording a better grade,
and, with the addition of something like
twenty miles which would have to be built
to complete the scheme, would lower the cost
of operation to Quebec. It was also represented that the prospective development of
the port of Montreal might lead to the
establishment of industrial sections
which
would justify action of this sort.
While I agree that it is unusual for a government or for tiwo big railways to deal
through a third party, thus perhaps allowing
of suspicion that things have not been ail
that they ought to have been or might have
been, I would point to this further fact. So
far as I am aware, no member of the Committee had any knowledge of the existence
of such an arrangement, but the president of
the Canadian National Railways volunteered
the information to the Committee. This
rather indicated that he was not attempting
to hide anything at ail.
However, I have been wondering, as a
result of the discussion here, whether it would
be altogether desirable for the House to adopt
or to reject the report by a vote taken this
afternoon. It seems to me that enough information bas been brought out in this discussion to just-ify us, net in acting hastily,
but in referring the Bill back to the Com78600-13J

mittee for the purpose of securing further
information from the officiais, so that the
proposai, when brought back to the Senate,
may be dealt with on a business basis and
decided on its merits. If we should now deoide not to refer the Bill back, it might be
felt in some quarters that there was something irregular and secret about the whole
deal. I therefore hold that in the interests of
the officials of the Canadian National Railway, who have been negotiating this deal on
behalif of the people of Canada, it would be
wise under all the circumstances to let the
Cormmittee discuss the Bill further.
Hon. JACQUES BUREAU: I am not a
meomber of the Railway Commidttee, and I
understand tha.t some of the members of that
Connittee are now taking exception to the
report presented by the chairman. I have
listened to the arguments adduced, and the
only reason against concurring in the report
seems to be the fact that there is a third
party interested in the transaction, or that the
transaction, instead of having been made
direct between the Canadian National Railways and the Delaware and Hudson, was
made through a third party. I was wondering why that had not come out while the
Committee was sitting.
Hon. Mr. ROBEIRTSON: It did come out.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Exactly. My honourable friend has said that tihe president of the
National Railways volunteered thp information, and that therefore he does not think
that there is anything crooked.
The statement has been made that this
railway runs from nowhere te nowhere. If
I understand the matter rightly, this railway
is to be connected with the Canadian National and is to have terminals in Montreal
and in Quebec. As far as the territory
traversed is concerned, my honourable friend
(Hon. Mr. Reid) said it was just as poor
as that of some Nova Scotia or New Brunswick railway that was taken over.
Hon. Mr. REID: I referred to the condition of the railway.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: This line traverses
the finest country on the southern shore of
the St. Lawrence, in the Province of Quebee,
and there is perhape no better country to
compare it with than the Niagara Peninsula.
The country has been settled for over two
hundred years andi its peoplie are entitled to
transportation accommodation.
If I were a member of the Railway Committee I would not consent to the Bill being
referred back, for I would regard it as a

censure tîpon the Committee. The Committee met this morning, they had the officiais
of the railway present, and were at liberty
to examine them as much as they chose.
The Comimittee made a unanimc>us report in
faveur of the lice being taken over, and then
honourable gentlemen get up in the House
and say, "Wc have heard that this transaction
w-as made through a third party." At first
that may look suspicious; but when the chairman explains that the third party was mentioned in a statemnent volunteered by the
chairman of the Camadian National Railways,
and that this statemenit washed away any
suspicion of the transaction, I do nlot sce why
we should refer the Bill lack to the Cernmittee.
Naturallv, if tlic members of the
Committee are willing to admit that they did
flot performa their duty or that they should
investigate further, then I vote that it be
referrcd hack with instructions to the mcembers of the Committee te do their duty this
time.
lion. GEORGE GORDON: As a member
of that Committee I feel there is a certain
responsibility resticg upon me for the bringing in cf that report. 1 do not think that
thre is anything in the contention that it
was not the proper thing for the Canadian
National Railways to agree te buy this road
or te treat with the Delaware and Hudson
througb a commission man. As a business
man I have often bougbt and sold property
tbrough a commission man to better advantage than 1 could have done directly. 1
thini, tbere is only one question, and that is
wbether or nlot the railway company would
get value for the $6,000,00O. 1 arn of the
opinion, based on statements that were piesented te the Committee, that they w-ouid be
getting a gond bargain. 1 understand that
the ccst cf $6,OOO,OOO includes the price cf
eleven hundred cars. Allow-ance hieing madle
foir this and some other equipment, the cost
of the road cornes down to arounci $4,000,000,
or about $20,000 a mile.
\Ve must be fair witb cureselves as weil as
with the raiiway companies. I imagine that
the riglit of w-ay alone, even if no ra:ilroad
were there at ail, would be valuable. 1 can
hardly conceive that the value cf the road
would be less than the agreed purchase price.
\Ve have to depend upon the President cf

CRIMINAL CODE (FINES AND FORFEITURES) AMENDMENT BILL
FIRST READING

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN introduced Bill P7,
an Act to amend the Criminal Code (Fines
and Forfeitures).
He said: 1 have the honour to introduce a
Bill whos;e purpose is to arnend section 1035 of
of the Ciiminal Code.
The Bill was read the flrst time.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Explain.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The purpose of
this Bill, bonourarbie gentlemen, is to permit
the court to give to anybody sentenced for an
offence punishable by i.mprisonmient flot exceeding five years the option of paying bis
The article as amended
fine by instalments.
comprises the old section entirely, and the
three following lines are added as the amendment:
The sentence may further direct that the
fine shall li paifi by instalments, or within a
c,,rtain per.iod, or thait the pecson s0 convicted sqhah, until payrnent of the fine, be adimnitted to bail.
The objeet of the amendmnent is to place
)n the saine footing ail convicted persons,
±.ose wbo are fortunate and those wbo are
aot. The vital statistics show that in the
vear 1927, the last year for which. we have
sucli statistics, there were 220,000 convictions.
0f this nuniber 16,000 were without the option
of paying a fine, and 206,000 witb such option;
but of the 206,000 the fines were paid in only
about 40.000 cases. In other words, out of
over 200,000 condemnations only one4ffth of
the number sentenced paid their fine, kept
out of prison, and were not afterwards branded as jail-birds. The others, flot heing fortunate enougli, bad to go to jail. Over 166,000 went to lait, came out as jail-birds, and
were branded and degraded as sucb, and the
cbildren of a great many of themn were degraded as being children of men who had
been sent to j ail.
I need not elaborate the subject. Everybody knows bow difficuit it is for *a main wbo
bas been in jail to re-establish bimself in the
esteem of bis fel1ow men, and how difficult àt
is for him to earn bis livelhood. I know of

ELFCTRICITY AND FLUID EXPORTATION BILL
EURTHER

CONSIDERATION IN
POSTPONED

COMMrTTEE

On the Order:
The House again in Committee of the Whole
on Bill 15, an Act to, amend the Eleetricity and
Fiuid Exportation Act (Exporitation of Electr.ie Power)=.Hon. Mr. Tanner.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Hýonourable gentlemen,
I have taken communication of the information which was placed on record the other day,
and as I 'think it is somewbat difficuit to
obtain from that a proper idea of the whole
matter, I would ask the honourable leader of
the ýGovernment if hie would not think it proper
te have the information given in this form:
The naine of each company which 'as agreed
te lease a part of its hydraulic or eleetric
power for export; the date of each contract;
the term of the lease, and the amounit f.
power agreed upon and -actually exported.
That information could be given iii ten lines,
it could (be understood by everybody, and it
would cover everyt'hing necessary to give an
adequate idea, of the situation.
I desire te add this. We have been told, and
I think the statement is correct, that already
in one or two cases when attempts have been
made te cancel exportation, the expenditure
incurred by the lessee has been urged as a
reason for non-cancellation. I am a-fraid that
there is danger that claims of that kind may
be urged hereafter-of course, without any
absolute right-and may create international
friction, which should be avoided, if possible.
I would therefore suggest to the honourable
leader of the Government the advisahility of
a letter being sent by the proper Department
c.f the Government te ail lessees of Ruch
power, putting them on their guard as to the
expenditures they may make, and asking them
te bear in minci that the policy cf allowing the
export of power may be rescindeil at any
moment. Then, five or ten years later, it
would be with bail grace that they would urge
as a reason why there should be no cancellation or discontinuance of the license, the
expenditure upon which they had entered.
I think we -are interesteil in a-voiding friction
between the Government on the other side of
the line and this Government, but I must say
that if the tariff on the other sie is raised as
it is threatened te raise it, we must be prepared to try to reduce as much as -possible our
imports from the United States and te encourage trade with other countries with which we
have treaties.

SENATE

Ilon. Mr. BUREAU: Do I iînderstand that
the question put is for the sake of getting information, or is if for the purpose of giving
notice to the lessees?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: First I ask the Govcroiment to give the information which I have
mientioned; then I suggest the adi isability of
sending a letter to each le.-tee of power asking
him te bear in mind that; the peiicy of permitling power to be exported miy be changed lit
any time.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: I did net catch exact1y
w'hat iny honourabie friend said when lie was

include the conditions of the lease between
the exporter and his lessee?

MAY 15, 1929
States Government was drawn to these things
so that they would have plenty of time to
notify the companies and make arrangements
for the future if we did out off the power.
Hon. Mr. HAYDON: The honourable
gentleman has said that the withdrawal by
Canada would ba looked upon by the United
States as an unfriendly act. Is that referred
to in that correspondence?
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: They use the word
" calamity."
Hion. Mr. REID: That shows the opinion
of New York State and the Government at
Washington.

Hon. Mr. CURRY: They say it indirectly
if not directly.
Hon. Mr. HAYDON: Was it so stated?
Hon. Mr. REID: I think there is another
declaration, but even in this one they take
the position 'that it would ba an unfriendly
act, though that is only indirectly stated.
In my opinion the amendment proposed by
the honourable member from LaSalle (Hon.
Mr. Bureau) is not unfair, because it gives
the companies six years to make arrangements
for some other supply of power.
I think I stated when this question was
being considered before that there was a loss
of about $1,000,000 per annum to the Province of Ontario because of this export of
power. If we could eut off the export of the
145,000 horse-power when we needed it during the war years we could have delayed for
a few years the building of the Chippawa
plant and avoided the high construction costs
prevailing at that time. The Chippawa plant,
which was built by the Ontario Government,
is now operated by the Hydro-Electric Commission of the Province of Ontario. The three
electrical companies purchased by the Ontario
Government, aside from the Chippawa, are
producing at Niagara Falls about 300,000
horse-power a year, nearly half of which
is sold to the United States. My information
is that that power was sold to the United States
corporation at about $9 or $10 per horsepower. Since that contract was made the
demand for power in Ontario has increased
by leape and bounds and I believe that last
year there was, roughly speaking, some 800,000 horse-power used in Ontario. Of course
when we could not arrange to discontinue
the export of the 145,000 or 125,000 horsepower, whatever the quantity was-I have
the figures here-the Province had to arrange
elsewhere for the supply of that power, and
the present situation is that some 125,000
horse-power is being manufactured by the

23

Hydro-Electric Commission, or by a company
owned by the people of the Province of Ontario, and sold to companies in the United
States for at least $5 or $6 less per horsepower than has to be paid for power in Ontario to replace this large quantity exported.
Hon. Mr. CURRY: Can the Hydro not
raise that price?
Hon. Mr. REID: No.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Could not the price
of the exported power be increased frcom year
to year?
Hon. Mr. REID: I will answer it this way.
These private companies that I am speaking
of, knowing that the power could not be exported without the authority of this Government, made a contract first in the Province
of Ontario for 100 years, with that private
corporation, at a certain price. When Sir
Adam Beck was the head of the HydroElectric Commission he took up the matter
with the companies, and I think they became
afraid of trouble and reduced the term to 50
years. These contracts expire in 1950; so for
the next 20 years, at least, as well as for the
time that has gone by since the contracts
were made, the loss to the Province of Ontario on account pf the exportation of power
can be figured at probably 800,000 or $1,000,000 per annum.
In the Province of Quebec the Cedars
Rapids Company are in a similar position.
They made a contract for 85 years and the
contract has 70 years yet to run. I think the
Aluminum Company get their power at
Cedars Rapids for $10 per horsepower.
Honourable gentlemen cn see how the power
question has increased in importance in the
vicinity of Montreal and in the Prov.ince of
Ontario, and I think it is likely that the demand for power in both Ontario and Quebec will continue to grow in the future as in
the past.
Surely if these companies made such longtern contracts-one for 85 years and another
for 50 years-though without the consent or
knowledge of the Dominion Government, we
should be fair with them and give thea
several years' notice of our intention to discontinue the licenses to export, so that those
concerned may have time to rearrange their
business and the power may be procured from
seme other source.
There is a Treaty between the two countries
that a certain amount of power at Niagara
m'ay be manufactured on both the American
and the Canadien sides, and the Treaty says
what proportion each country shall have.
The United States are now producing all the

204

SENATE

power to whieh they are enjtitled unaier the
Treaty, and in addition thËy are getting
125,000 horse-power from. Ontario.
1 su'bmit that aIl our power will be required
for local consumption, both in the Province of
Ontario and the Province of Quebec, and
therefore no export licanses should be granted
in the future without the consent osf Parliamont.
This electrical .power is one of the
most valuable natural assets csf this country.
1 agree with the honourable gentleman who
has proposed this amendment (Hon. Mr.
Bureau) that, we should give the licensees
notice that at a certain time their li-censes will
terminate and if they require any renewals
after that date Parliament should be the
authority to say whether any extension shall
ho granted or not. If there are good reasons
in 1935 why Canada should renew in whole
or in part the licenses to export, I have
no doubt that Pýarliýament will seýe that the
United Stateq are deait with fairly. I should
like to see the aniendment carried, but if the
majority of honourable inembers will not support the amendment, than I arn in favour of
the Bill, because it provides certain conditions
that are preferable to those that exist at the
presenit time.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

The honourable

member for De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Beique)
suggested that before we deal further with this

Bill the Gov ernment should furnish soe additional information. I amn ready to apply to
the Dopartment of Trade and Commerce for
iL, and if any honourable

menaber has ot-her

questions hie would like to have answered b>'
the Departmont with a viow to throwing more
light upon this matter, I would suggest that
ho state týheni now, so that when we deal with
the Bill again we may have befora us ahi the
information required.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Is thare a method
of differentiating- between the plants astablished for the pýurpose of exporting power and
the plants established for tise production of
power within Canada, hut having a surplus to
export froru time to time?
It is possible
to differentiate between those two types of
plants and bring down a return which, leaving
out for the moment plants designed to export,
wjlh show us wxhat the srmaller plants ara exporting incidentally?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
0f course my
honourable frjend will have noticed that in
the documents I brought down there are reportcd a certain numbor of liconses for firra
expert, anci separate licences obtained by
soine of the samne coinpanios for surplus export.
Hon. Mr. REID.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:

The figures are

not separated in the report that was brought
down, nor are they saparated in the blue

book.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The>' are separated in the report which I brought down.
My honourable friand will find thora what is
oxported under surplus licenses or off-paak
lirensoýs, and, what is exported under ordinar>'
lice'nses.

Hon. Mr. BUREAU:

May' I ask the hon-

ourable leader of the Govarnmant if it is un-

derstood that this Ordar of the Day will ba
adj ourned?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Nobody has

askcd that it ha adjourned, but the honour-

able gen'lonan from. De Salaberry (Hon. Mr.
Béiqua) has asked for further information. I
suppose that means ha doas not wîsh that the
Bill be proceaded with now.
Hon. Mr. REID: I ma>' say for the information of the honourabla gentleman froru De
Salaberry that ever>' licensa that is granted
con-tains this clause:
Every contract muade under this licenise shall
contain a clause or clauses exprossly sattiog
forth that it is ruade by virtue of this license,
which is subject to the Elactric'ity and Fluid
Exportation Act and any amendients that may
ho ruade to it, an(l alse is subject to the Regula.
tions muade or whichi ray ho muade hy the G;overnor General in Council regarding the saine;
andl every contract ruade undor this license shall
have .attached týhereto a copy of this license and
of the Electricity and Fluid Exportation Act,
nnd of the Regulations approved by the Gsovorner General in Council on the 4th day of
November, 1907.
This license, if re!newed, shail be subject te
,the ternis and conditions of such Regulatior.s
as, m ay ho rna(le froru timne to tirne, either by
Statute or the Governor General in Ceunci!.
I wish te mention that onl>' te show the
honourable gentleman that any.contract made
in confection wvith the export of power mnust
have a copy of the license attached t0 it
and that tihis serves notice on the companies
thsit the license is- granýted for oni>' one year
and can ho cancolled at any timo.
Hon. Mr. BEI1QUE: The information that
I suglIested should ho furrnisbed docs n;ot îrefer to that at ail. I asked for tho narno of
cacl company wvhich. has agreed to bease part
of its hydraulie or electiric power for expert,
the date of each contract, the ternis of the
lease-that is the nunibor of yoarS and the
l)rice-and the amotint of power agreed upon
and actually exported. That xxould gix o the
whole thing in ton linos; and the documents
iliaf have heon furnished do not givo us that
information.

MAY 15, 1929
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Under the circumstances the adjourriment must be proposed by
some honourable member bef ore we can get
the information.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I move that the Ordcr
stand.
Hon. Mr. TANNEJR: As the Bill stands in
my name, I amn a little interested in it. I
am wondering under what process we are
proeeeding, as I understand tihere is no motion
before the House.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There is one
jtist made by the honoura'ble member from
De Salaberry (Hon. MT. Beique).
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I was wondering
whether we were having a round table conference, or what it was. However, in view of
the request for in;formation, I move that the
Order be discharged and placed on the Order
Paper for Tuiesday next.
Hon. Mgr. BUREAU: Before this motion is
put, 1 would like to inake a statement. Since
I have presen'ted this amendiment. I have been
asked on whose behalf I was preseting it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That was sornewhat indiscreet.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: I thought it was; so
I desire to make my posittion a.bsolutely clear,
and I state that I arn not acting for or on
behaid of any person or corporation, nor amn
I in any way interested in or influen-ced by
any individual or corporation. 1 am not
acting on hehaîf cif any political organization
or trying to carry out suggestions made by
any government or meimber thereof, or by any
individual whomsoever. As 1 stated at the
beginning of my remarks, I was taking the
Bill and analysing it as it camne before this
flouse. So for the rest and the peace of the
souls of those who were suspici.ous, I make
this staternent.
The motion was agreed to.
The ýSenate adjourned until to-morrow at

PENNY BANK BILL
FIRST READING

B!on. M r. DAkýýDUR.AND introduced Bill
A8, an Act to amend the Penny Bank Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, as it is
somewhat late in the session, I may give a
short explanation of the Bill at this stage.
The Penny Bank of Ontario serves a school
population of 170,000 children in 360 schools
in 85 municipalities throughout the country,
ail the chartered ban-ks acting as local agents
of the Penny Bank. Except for the necessary
balances kept with these chartered banks, the
funds of the Penny Bank, up to the total
amount of the deposits, must be invested in
securities issued by the Government of
Canada. There are -no shareholders. The
Board of Directors and its officers serve
without remuneration of any kind, but the
expense of operation cannot be met at present
out of the difference between the interest
received from Dominion Government bonds
and the three per -cent paid to the depositors.
The Bank has been operating for twenty-four
years and is still growing rapidly. The
de'posits of the sehool children are now
$1,250,000. This work cannot be extended or
even maintained unless the income from mnvestments can be increased, and the object
of this Bill is to enlarge the right of investment.
The Bill was read the first time.

CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
AND QIJFBEC, MONTREAL AND
ýSOUTHERN RAIL WAY BILL
MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
WITHDRAWN

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Donnelly witis respect to the report of the
Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs
and Harbours on Bill 72, an Act respecting
Canadian National Railways and to authorize
the acquisition of the Quebec, Montreal and
Soutisern Railway.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Honourable gentlemen, 1 moved the adjournment of the debate
yesterlday because thse Houtse appeared to
have .reached an impasse, and it seemed desîraible ta have the matter leift over until today. I have nothing furtiser ta say on tise
question.
Honourable
Hon. J. J. DONNELLY:
gentlemen, at the close of the discussion on
this subjeet yesterday it was suggested by
the honourable leader on this side of the
House (Hon. Mr. Willoughby) that thse
matter stand until to-day, and the honourable gentleman from DeLanaudière (Hon. Mr.
Casgrain) was good enougis te act on that
suggestion and move the adjournment of the
debate. I think it was the intention that
the mover and the seconder of yesterday's
motion should give some further consideration to the matter.
I wisis now merely to clear up a misapprehension which appears to be in the mincis of
some honourable senators. I gathered yesterday from thse remarks of an honourable
member on the other side of the House, thse
honourable gentleman from DeSalaberry (Hon.
Mr. Beique), that he was under thse impression that there was a disposition to block

208

SENATE

any railway legislation which was in the interest of the Province of Quebec. When I
rose yesterday I had a fixed intention net
to say anything that could be taken to mean
that I was in favour of finally blocking
legislation for the purpose of taking over the
Quebec, Montreal and Southern Railway; and
I think the report of the debate in Hansard
shows that I followed my intention. I had
a 'fixed intention, also, not to say anything
that could be taken as a reflection on any
of the officials of the Canadian National Railways, and I think honourable members who
have read Hansard will agree that I did not
step outside of my intention there. The main
purpose of my remarks yesterday was to
object to the inclusion of a middleman in
the sale of the Quebec, Montreal and Southern
Railway to the Canadian National Railways.
I felt yesterday that I was justified in
stressing my objection to the Bill on that
ground, and nothing that was brought out in
the discussion has caused me to change my
mind. However, I have since talked over the
matter with some honourable senators and
they have pointed out to me that the discussion will have a good effect, that it brought
the objection to the attention of the Government, that the honourable member of the
Government who occupies a seat in this
Chamber (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) has taken
the responsibility of telling us that the transaction is a good and proper one. Therefore
I feel that I have fulfilled my duty and I
am satisfied to leave the responsibility with
the Government in power. With the consent
of the seconder, I wish to witidraw the
amendment which I moved yesterday.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I should like to say
that I had no thought of casting any reflection
at all on the amendment moved by the honourable gentleman from South Bruce (Hon.
Mr. Donnelly). I realized yesterday, as I do
now, that lie was perfectly within his rights
in proposing the amendment, and I wanted
merely to emphasize my strong opinion that
in the interest of the territory through which
the Quebec, Montreal and Southern Railway
rues it is essential that that railway should
be taken over by the Canadian National
Railways. It has come to my knowledge
that for some years repeated applications have
been made to the Railway Board for an order
on the Canadian National Railways or the
Grand Trunk Railway permitting the cars of
the Quebec, Montreal and Southern Railway
to enter the city of Montreal; and, if I am
not mistaken, there is now an application that
has been pending before the Railway Board
for several months. But no such order could
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY.

ever be obtained, and the consequence was
that the operations of the Quebec, Montreal
and Southern Railway were paralyzed, to the
great detriment of that section of the country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Passengers from
points as far distant as one hundred miles
are dumped on the platform at St. Lambert.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Yes, they are dumped,
as the honourable gentleman says, at St.
Lambert, and they sometimes have to wait
for one or two hours before they can get a
train into Montreal; and passengers who leave
Montreal are sometimes dumped at St. Lambert, across the river, and are forced Lo wait
there for an hour or two before being taken
farther on their journey.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Why do you not
provide airplanes for them?
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: Perhaps I should
say that the reason I thought the honourable
member from DeSalaberry (Hon. Mr. Beique)
was under a misapprehension as to my stand
yesterday was that at the opening of his
remarks lie stressed the fact that a large
number of Bills had been freely voted for
the expenditure of money in the West, and
then remarlçed that the Bill in question was
for the benefit of part of the Province of
Quebec.
Hon. Mr. REID: I should like to ask tha
honourable leader of the Government a question. I take it for granted that the price we
are paying for this railway gives us the railway free of any encumbrance; that is, as to
bonds or anything of that kind.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I had asked
the Deputy Minister of Railways for seme
information, which I have now received, and
I think the answer to my honourable friend
probably will be found in that. In order not

The Quebec, Montreal and Southern Railway
extends from the junction of the Canadian National Railway at St. Lambert, opposite the
city of Montreal, easterly along the shore of the
St. Lawrence River, running in a general northeasterly direction parallel to the St. Lawrence
River, passing through Boucherville, Varennes,
Vercheres, Contrecoeur, to the city of Sorel, a
distance

of

44.5

miles,

thence

continuing

parallel to Lake St. Peter and the St. Lawrence
River through Yamaska, Nicolet and Becancour
to Fortierville, where it makes connection with
the Canadian National Railway, a further distance of 65.5 miles. There is also a branch
extending in a seoutherly direction from Belle-

of Sorel-passing through St. Aimé, St. Judes,
St. Hyacinthe, Iberville and Henryville to a
junction wjth the Canadian National Railway
at Noyan, a distance of 81 miles. The total
mileage of the railway la 191 miles.
The railway througbout its entire distance
passes through a very good agricultural coulatry.
The population served exclusively by this
railway is 85,000, and the total population ot
the 'territory served is 217,000, of wbich 135i,000 is served jointly by the Quebee, Montre.-l
and Southern and other railways.
The freight tonnage handled by this railway

The reasons which actuated the Canadian
National Railway in acquir:ing this property
are as follows:1. To enable it to consolidate its position in
the territory south of the St. Lawrence River
between Montreal a.nd Quebec. It -is estimated
that through the purchase of this line the Canadian National Railways will ha able to effect
economies in the operation of the lines in the
Levis Division to the extent of $150,000 per
year on the basis of exi"ting business.
2. For some time the management has heen
giving consideratio.n to the improvement of the
existing lines between Montreal and Quebec.
both by way of possible grade reductions and
by way of double tracking to -relieve congestion.
The controlling gr.ades ait the present time are
1 per -cent. The acquisition of the Quebee,
Montreal and Southern Railway will make it
posslible to obtain praetically a 'water grade,
namely, 4/10 of 1 per cent, between Montreal
and Levis, through the construction of a 20-mule
conneetion with -the existing line from Fortierville. This wjll obviate the necessity of oarrying on costly grade reduction on the existing
line, and also the neeessity of double tracking.
3. The consolidation of the positiob of the
Canadian National in the iterritory south of the
St. Lawrence, in an area where the industrial
growth of Canada in the past bas been great
aud the prospects of future growth promising.
4. The value of the line to, the National Railway system rthrough the control of 650,000 tons
of freight per year, which is a very important
factor.
The purchase price of this railway is $6,000,000, and is based upon approxirnate coat of reproduction less depreciation. The cost o! reproduction of the ýrailway, exclusive o! equipment, is estimated at $4,200,000. Amongst the
equipment to be acquàred are 1,1K1 box cars of
modern type. The co8t of reproduction less depreciation of aIl the equipment to be acquired
is $1,900,000. This equipmeut is much more
than is necessary for the operation of a line

price of the railway. exclusive of the equi,,meut, is ther efore àpproximately $21,500 per

that the available ineome for fixed charges
during 1925, 1926 and 1927 bas been as follows:
1925.............$174,000
1926.............255,000
1927.............142,000
I might add that the rails over a large proportion of this railroad's mileage are 80pounds, the balance beiýng 56-pounds.
Hon. Mr. REID: I did not ask that question
for the purpose of continuing discussion on the
Bill. As a rule many railways have bonds

against them, and their cars and other equipment are encumbered by aquipment bonds. If
honourable members wiil look ait the annual
report o! the Delaware -and Hudson Railway
they will see that tbere are bonds issued
against nearly every one of its branches. There
may be a general bond over the whola Delaware and Hudson system. As long as we have
it thoroughly understood that we are not
taking on any additional encumýbrance, I arn

satlafied.

I amn not asking that the progress

of the Bill be delayed. I tske it that the
sponsor of the Bill, the right honourable gentleman from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr.
Graham), is aible to give the necessary a.ssur111

Mr. GRAHAM.

us all the facts: the territory is good, the
people there are deserving of better railvay
facilties. and the Canadian National Railways
require this addition to the system.
All that
was said yesterday and agreed to.
The discussion resulted from the objection
of certain honourable gentlemen on this side
of the House to the method of carrying on
the transaction so far.
We were told yesterday, in addition to other information, that a
gentleman in New York has procured an
option on this railway and he in turn is selling
the railway to the Canadian National System.
That is what we do not like.
I am putting
it in plain English.
Some of us on this side
of the House think it smells of graft.
The
right honourable gentleman from Eganville
(Right Hon. Mr. Graham) said yesterday that
dealing through a third party was the American way of doing business. Well, then, let us
say at once that we do not like the American
way of doing business and we do not want
this sort of transaction in connection with the
acquisition of railways on this side of the line.
We do not think it is necessary.
Here is a railvay company -in the United
States that cwns a piece of raihlway in Canada
and vants to sell it, and the only two pos,ible purchasers in Canada are the Canadian
Pacifie Railway and the Canadian National
Railways.
If the Delaware and Hudson
wanted to sell its property in Canada, all it
had to do-especially in v.iew of the close
friendship betveen the President of that line
and the President of the Canadian National
Rlailways--ws to circularize both the railways in Canada and say: "Ve have a piece of
railway to sell. What willl you give us for
it?" But we are told that -that hos not
been done; that what hos happened is that a
gentleman in New York--and he miav be
acting for undisclosed principals-has acquired
an option on the railway and is going to sell
it to the Canadian National. That is wha.t
we did net like, and I am bouned to say, as
a member of the Committee, that I was taken
by surprise.
Some honouable gentlemen
opposite may not have been taken by surprise;
tlev may have heard of it before; but I was
taken by surprise and it was net until I discussed the matter with some other honourable
menibers that the.re'al objection became clear
to me.

When the honourable gentleman from Bruce
(Hon. Mr. Donnelly) moved his amendmeent
yesterday it was open to the objection that
we had not made any complaint at the timie.
I an willing to let it go at that. I agrece that
the honourable gentleman from Bruce should

work and receomendations of the Expert Committee. It is clear therefore that no urgency
exists and that it would be prernature as well
as inexpedient for His Majesty's Government
to pronounce upon particular aspects, however
inportant they may be at present juncture.
However, in order to prevent misconception
abroad and alarm at home, it is perhaps desirable that I should say that the kind of proposals
foreshadowed in newspapers yesterday would
in our opinion be inacceptable and that His
Majesty's Governnent would in no circumstances
entertain them.
With reference to press reports that plans
have been submitted to the Conference which
would reduce payments to the Dominion to
zero, it may be stated that these reports rest
upon a misunderstanding and that so far as
can be ascertained, no proposals of that
character have been made. In any case it is
hardly necessary to state that they would net
bc accepted when the time comes for consideration of the report of the Experts Conmittee by the governments concerned, including the governments of the Dominions.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
I would ask
the honourable leader of the Governrment if he
is aware whether any speedy action is likely to
be taken in the settlement of our private
reparations in Canada out of that fund. We
have more money now than it will be necessary te disburse under the Friel and the
Pugsley Reports, but no money has been paid.
Hon. Mr. DANIDURAND:
A resolution
proposed by the Secretary of State is beforo
the other House and may be taken up today. My honourable friend will be able to
ascertain what that resolution is, and what
progress is made with it there.

Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: I should like to
ask the honourable leader of the Governnient whetlier any decision has been reached
with respect te the adjournment of the

Will there be an adjournment
merely over the week-end or for a longer
period? We who live at some distance from
Ottawa are net able to take advantage of
the ordinary week-end adjournments to proceed to our homes, and I thought that for
next week, on account of the holiday, there
might be a change. I should like to have
some information on this matter.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am net aware
at the present moment that there will be
any special adjournment during the course
of next week in the House of Commons.
There seems to be a desire to press the work
forward rapidly in order that prorogation may

circurnstances, and in view of the number of
Bills that are coming before us from the
other House, my intention was to move that

adjourned till Monday evening next. We shall
not know until the end of next week how
the wark is developing in the other Chamber,
and until we do know that we cannot decide
whether it is prudent for the Senate to
adjourn for any length of time. I feel that
if we are to prorogue within two or three
weeks we shall have plenty of work te do
from day to day until the end of the
Session.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: We are overworked
already; so do not press us further.
I quite underHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
stand the remark of my honourable friend.
Owing to his position on the Divorce Conmittee he works longer hours than some other

the hearing of divorce petitions.

CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS AND
QUEBEC, MONTREAL AND SOUTHERN RAILWAY BILL
THIRD READING

Hlon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third
reading of Bill 72, an Act respecting Canadiian
National Railways and ta autharîze the acquisition of the Quebec, Mantreai and Sauthero
Railway.
Han. Mr. McMEANS: While I have no
objection ta the third reading of this Bill, I
think it is a matter of regret that this House
bas not had a little more information in connection with the expenditure of $6,000,000 for
the purchase of the raiiway. This sumn is
voted away and we apparently have no idea
of the value of the road that is being baught.
Some remarks have been niade in this Hause
ta the effect that the Canadian National Railways desire ta make the purchase in order ta
have a piece of double track, and for other
such reasans. I think the honourable gentleman fram DeSalaberry (Hon. Mr. Beique)
said that the fact that there was sa much
money spent on railways in the West was a
justification for buying this one in Quebec.
Hon. Mr. DANDIJRAND:- Oh, I do nat
think that was what hie said.
Hlon. Mr. MeMEANS9: I shauld like te state
that the building of a railway in any of the
prairie provinces, Manitoba, Saskatchewan or
Alberta, where rails may be laid at a coinparatively small cost, and where the purpose
is ta open up and serve new districts, is na
justification for the purchase of a railway
that has been for sale at the bargain counter
for *many years. I am not objecting ta the
purchase of the Québec, Montreal and Southern Railway, but I do think that this Hanse
should bave had mare information in regard
ta it. It is well known that this railway has
been for sale at, the bargain caunter for the
hast twenty years, and yet there seemed ta
be a determination ta put this Bili through
quickly. We were told the other day that
if we did nat hurry, somebody else might
grab the chance ta purchase the road. That
sort of thing does not appeal ta me, and I
have no hesitation in saying that it is a
matter of personal regret that the huge sum
of $6,000,000 should be voted in this way. 0f
course, in view of the way that the Parliamnent
of Canada is vorting money now, it is nlot worth
talking about 86,000,000; but I would point
out ta the honourable leader of the Government that a day of reckoning wili came unless
there is a stop put ta the practice of making
such tremendous expenditures unnecessarihy.
Some day the people of Canada wiil wake

215

up and become aware of the huge sums of
money that are being spent by the present
Governnient-sums nlot merely of thousands
and of millions of dollars, but of hundreds
of millions. The people are being taxed to
death; we ail know that. Income taxes are
imposed by the Government of each provinice
and by the Federal Government, and the
result is that property is practically taken
away from its owner nowadays in taxation.
And stili this huge expenditure goes on.
The other day I asked the right honourable gentleman who sponsored this Bill (Right
Hon. Mr. Graham) whether the Que'bec,
Montreal and Southern Railway would pay
the interest, an the $6,000,000 invested in it,
but I couid get no information. I think that
further and more particular information
should bie given ta this Evuse before the
Canadian National Railways spend such a
large sum. as $6,000,000 for the acquisition of
more mileage and equipment. I do not know
how much money has been disbursed by the
Governnient of Canada this year; the sum is
se great that I cannot think about it. The
only satisfaction I can draw from the situation is that my great grandchildren, if I have
any, wiil bear the burden of taxation. I
know that everything I had has been taken
from me already.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I desire simply
to point out that there are expenses that
justify tbemselves even 'when it is felit th-at
the country is in a difficuît financial position.
I would remind honourable menmbers of what
took place in this Ohamiber with regard to
a project which I introduced here for the
building of 1,000 miles of rail-way in different
parts of Canada. The lines were mostly in
the West, I know, 'but that is flot the important point. The Senate manifested a
strong sense of ,misgiving and indignation bocause at a ti-me -%vben the country seemed ta
be weg,hted down with an excess of railways
the Governmenýt dared to propose to Parliament the building of an additional 1,000 miles.
I will make a confession to my honourable
friends. It Sa ba.ppen-ed that I was not present
in Council wvhen those branch line Bills were
examined. I could not attend, because all my
time was taken up here with the sittings of
the iSenate and with committee meetings in
the mornings. I was mueh alarmed when
the Bi1 .respecting the construction of 1,000
miles more of railwa-ys was placed in my
hands, for there existed a feeling that the
country was surfeited with railjways and that
we hiad one transcontinental line toa many.
The Bill was rejected iby this Chamber. The
following yeýar 1 brought down the samne
proposition in a different f orm, comprising

216

SENATE

28 Bills. I well remember the stern attitude
taken by our late lamented friend, Sir James
Lougheed, when he said: "You will have to
prove the necessity for every mile of railway
before this House consents to the building
of another mile." We went to the meeting
of the Committee, where there were present
the officials of the Canadian National Railways and the Canadian Pacifie Railway, and
on their merits we passed some 24 or 25 of
the Bills-and that at a tiýme of great depression-because it was felt that it was the
thing to be donc according to reason and
the needs of the country.
Undoubtedly the situation to-day is changed.
Five years ago doubt and fear ,prevailed in
the souls of many men of no mean standing
in this country. To-day there is a complete
transformation: those sentiments have given
This
place to confidence and optimism.
would net excuse us for entering upon unwarranted expenditures, but if five years ago,
even under the conditions that I have described, we acted wisely in authorizing the
building of another thousand miles of railway, it is apparent that the situation to-day
is far more favourable for the discussion of
such projects. Besides the state-owned railway we have the Canadian Pacifie, which is
doing likewise, and whose management must
turn to the shareholders and justify the expenditures.
My honourable friend speaks of one railway, the Bill for the purchase of which is
now before us for third read'ing, and says
he would like to have more information. It
is the fault of my honourable friend if he does
not possess it.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
in the Committee.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
member.

Why?
Because he was
No, I am not a

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Well, he should
have attended the Committee, and I am very
sorry my honourable friend did not take advantage of that field-day we hads when all
those branches were discussed, with maps on
the wall, and with officials present.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: But I cannot be in
two places at the same time.
I understand
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
that. I withdraw the accusation I was leveliing at my honourable friend. So much the
more reason why we should get rid of the
divorce work and have my honourable friend
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

in the Senate, doing the real work of this
House. However, I am sure my honour.ble
friend could rely upon the good sense and
judgment of a number of his colleagues who
are thoroughly familiar with the ground, who
know the situation and its possibilities, and
feel that this proposal is a thing that ought
to be carried out.
Now, nobody has said that there is danger
in adljourning the passing of this Bill for a
week or so; and if my honourable friend has
anv particular question to put, or desires any
data which he thinks will be enlightening, and
with which he can vote more conscientiously
on this Bill, I will ask that the third reading
be postponed. But he will have to ask me
a fexw questions in order that I may procurr
the answers and give him the desired information, for I have no further information at
hand.
My honourable friend knows that this railway runs along the south shore of the St.
Lawrence, practically
from the Victoria
Bridge to the Quebec Bridge, which it will
reach if twenty miles more are built. He
knows that it is in an old settled country,
with towns and villages dotting the shores of
the St. Lawrence. He has been told that the
acquisition of this line will save the doubling
of the Canadian National track.
le has
simply to look at the map of the Canadian
National line from Montreal through St. Hyacinthe, Ste. Rosalie and Drummondville, to
Levis. That is the Montreal-Quebec line; it
is in fact the Intercolonial that has been
gradually extended from Levis to Montreal.
But there is the question of building a double
track. The purchase of this railway will save
the expense of building that double track, and
will also give a much better grade. Those who
know the conditions as the people living in
Montreal know them, are therefore absolutely
convinced that the logical thing to do is to
have this railway added to the Canadian National Railway System.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I presume that my
honourable friend will permit me to ask him
a question. I suppose that as soon as this
railroad is acquired there will be another $40,000,000 granted to build alongside of it a good
road, which will take the traffic away from it.
That is the rule now: an immense amounit of
money is spent on the building of good roads
for automobiles, which take traffic from the
railways.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may answer
my honourable friend by saying there are already two great roads along the shores of the
St. Lawrence.

MAY 17, 1929
Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: No wonder, then,
that the Delaware and Hudson want to, get
rid of this road b>- turning it overt4o, the Canadian Nationa.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I thouglit my
honourable friend was asking if we would not
bui'ld another railway. Should we do that,
there would be plenty of .9pace between that
and the old one, if we went hy the standard
of Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. McMIEANS: When I heard the
honourable gentleman portray in sucli graphic
language the beauties of that country, and the
wonderfui service that road was going to
render to the people, I could flot understand
why the Delaware and Hudson should offer
their railway for sale at the bargain counter.
I arn very curious &bout that; I should like
to get some information as to how the transaction took place. Did the Canadian National
go to the Delaware people and say, "We
want to buy your road," or did the Delaware
and Hudson go to, the Canadian National
and say, "We want to seli the road, but the
price is fixed-it is an absolutely arbitrary
price"? We do not know what negotiations
led up to this purchase. Did the Canadian
National make an offer of $6,000,000, and did
the Delaware and Hudson company say, "We
will seli it for $6,000,000," or did the owners
Say, "We have a road there, but it is not a
paying road, and it is on the bargain counter"?
How did these negotiations proceed? I want
to know the whole of the circumstances, for
1 do not hesitate to say that to-morrow that
road might be bought for a great deal les
money.
I may in.form my
Mr. DANDUIRAND:
honourable friend that the first offer was from
the Canadian National Railways direct to the
Delaware and Hudson. The Canadian National
told them that this line of railway did not
seem to fit in with their own American
system, and asked if they would be disposed
to seIl. The answer came that some months
previously they had given an option to a
certain gentleman, and that they had to refer
the Canadian National to him. A letter was
written to that gentleman and a great deal
of discussion took place as to ternis, and while
the discussion was going on and seemed to be
leading to something, Sir Henry Thornton
again wrote to the President of the Delaare
and Hudson, saying: "Why could we not
settle this bebween ourselvee? It would be
far more desirable from all points of view,
and especially from mine, if we could do sn"'
Again hie was answered that a certain gentleman had been given an option, and that Lhey
had to deal with him, as they did. After their

217

experts had valued -the roadbed, the construction, the railway conditions, and the whole of
the rolling stock, and after valuing the system
and the roqling stock separately, they reached
a conclusion and made an offer of $6,OOO,OOO.
This being agreeable to that gentleman, hie
reiferred the Canadian National te the Delaware and Hudson Company for the drafting
cf the contract. So to-day the purchase la
arranged with the Delaware and Hudson
directly, net with the gentleman who held the
option, though the negotiatiens were with
him. The only query is as to what the Delaware and Hudson is to pay its broker-if lie
is a broker-for the work that lie did. That
is a question which I cannot answcr, and
which can be answered by the Delaware and
Hudson alone.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Doca the honourable
gentleman seriously contend that the broker
in New York who got that option on the
road ever had any intention of buying it?
Hoýn. Mr. BUREAU: He had the intention of selling it, or lie would not have got
the option.
H-'on. Mr. MeMEANS: There is only one
customer when the Canadian Pacifie is out
of it. A bmoker in New York holds an
option. Now, does any man seriously contend that that broker in New York was ever
going to exercise that option?
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: He bas done so.
How did lie do
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
it?
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: By finding a purchaser.
By fading the
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
purchaser in the Canadian National. Now,
where is the rake-off, and wliat is the position of it?
The Delaware
Hon. Mr. DANI>URAND:
and Hudson are the only people who can
say what they will have to pay.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Would the honourable
gentleman have any objection to bringing
down the correspondence to which lie lias
referred-that which wa.s read by Sir Henry
Thornton before the Railway Committee,
and further correspondence which, I understand, has passed between Sir Henry Thoraton
and the Delaware and Hudson Company?
There is no
Hon. Mr. DANDIYRAND:
objection whatever to 'bringing down every
piere of correspondence that passed between
the -Canadian National Railways and the
Delaware and Hudson, or the broker who liad
that option.

SENATE
IHon. Mr. LAIRD: I would ask that there
be brought down at the same time a copy
of any appraisal on the part of the Canadian National officials, or any report by the
operating officials of the Canadian National
executive, if such be in existence.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I know nothing about it, but I fancy that there have been
such.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: As a member of the
Committee I should not care to have an
appraisal of the road at all. It might be all
right if made now, but I should not like to
have it if made at a time when different
conditions prevailed. It may be imagined
what an appraisal of a road like that would
be, with regard to the right of way, the
roadbed, the stations, the fencing, and all
that kind of thing. The appraisal value could
not very much exceed the price that is being
paid for it. I am not a railroad man, but I
travel over railways a good deal, and I fancy
that the building of a road in that vicinity
to-day would cost at least between $60,000
and $70,000 a mile.

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:

What

sort of

country is it?
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I understand it is
very good country, but those roads are being
built now with 80 and 90 pound rails. I
think that part of this road is already built
with 90 pound rails.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

It was 80.

Hon. Mr. GORDON: I thought it was 90;
but knowing nothing more about the road
than I do, and judging merely from the
evidence we had at the Committee, I do
not think it possible to buy any kind of road
to-day at anything less than the price that is
being paid for this.
Some speaker has conpared this railway
with roads which start nowbere and go nowhere; but here we have a road with a large
population at each end, and a great nany
people all along the line, and we were faced
with the condition of having to double the
track of a road which is already owned by

the Canadian National Railways.

Taking all

these things into consideration, I imagine that
no other road could have been bought at the
price to he paid for this one; so L think we
may be sure that we are getting a fair bargain.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time and passed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

CRIMINAL CODE (ESCAPES BY
FLIGHT) BILL
DEBATE CONCLUDED-BILL WITHDRAWN

The Senate resumed from May 2 the debate
on the second reading of Bill D, an Act to
amend the Criminal Code as regards the use
of force to prevent escapes by flight.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Honourable

gentlemen, I asked that the consideration of
this matter be adjourned in order that I
might obtain some further information to
which my honourable friend from Hamilton
(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) had drawn my
attention, and which he thought should be
examined before a decision was taken on the
Bill. I confess that I have not yet received
that information. It bore on the number of
offences for which individuals could be arrested without warrant. My honourable friend
said there were a number of trivial offences
of this class, and that if the person aceused
of any of these took to flight he could be
shot. I do not admit the conclusion. I admit
the first part, the assertion that there are
dozens of petty offences for which an individual may be arrested on sight, but I do not
for a moment admit that the right to arrest
without warrant for any kind of petty offence
would justify an officer of the peace in shooting a person whom the officer had seen committing such an offence and who took to his
liees. Suppose an offender refused to move
from a street corner when ordered te do so,
and a peace officer attempted to arrest him
for disobeying orders, and he took to fliglt.
I believe that if he were shot and killed by
that offiecr, the officer could be placed on trial
ior murder. So, although net admitting the
right of the peace officer to use force to the
exient of shooting in order to arrest a persewho bas comirtted a petty offence, I think
thit I -hould comply with my honourable
friend's requost by obtaining frim the Department of Justice a list of all the offences as to
which a.rests may be made without warrant
and pace officers may use force in pursuing

offenders.
The only question is the degree of force
in the case of many petty offences, some of
which have been mentioned by my honourable friend. He will say that there have been
cases in which pursuit for petty offences has
ended in the death of the offender. This is
a very regrettable situation, but the question
to be determined is whether it is possible
te draw a line between offences as to which
the police officer may use force to the extent
of shooting, and offences as to which he is
net justified in doing so. It would perhaps
he very difficult to draft legislation to curb

1219

MAY 17, 1929
the activities of peace officers with respect to
a certain range of petty offences, and I weuld
suggest to my honourable friend that he allow
the attorneys-general. of the various provinces, and the Department of Justice, to think
over the situation described by him, ýto see
if something ýcannot be done which. would
to a certain extent allay his fear of the general exercise of the right of a peacc officer
to use force in ail cases in which. an arrest
may be made without a warrant.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Some time ago the
honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Belcourt) introduced a Bill by which he proposed to prohibit the use of ail kinds of firearros in Canada. That Bill, I think, hais been
killed in the other House. If it had been
passed there would be no necessity for ýthis
one.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
peace officers.

It

emcepted

Hon. Mr. GORDON: Oh! Then we had
better have the law of the honourable gentleman from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton).
Hon. MT,. MeMEANS: Honourable gentlemen, I dise simply to place on record a
long telegramn which I have received from the
Attorney-General of Manitoba. It is as follows:
Manitoba Govenoiment subroits that legisla-

tion introduced by honourable seuator LymnchStaunton ïo amend Criminal Code as regards
the use of foree te, prevent escape by fliglit
should flot be ýenacted. Manitoba G-overnment
submits that, such legislaticsn if enacted would
seriously interefere ivith proper law enforoement and proper law observance.
Manitoba
Goverument subroits that law at present ïo
force lias been found satisfactory for proper law
enlforenreont. ririday's inewspapers refer to discusesion in Senate on this proposed law and
ive understaind saine we int;roduced in Senate
by Honourable Lyncli-Staumton.
I have received aise a message from the
Employers' Association of Manitoba, as fol-

lows:
Having notice(l a pýress despatch that Senator
George Lynch-Stauntoo bas ;introdueed Bill
to amend the Crimninal Code havi.ng -in effeet the
takisîg away froro police officiai-s the rigbt to,
protect themselves atod the public, 1 arn instructed on bebiaif of this Association to vigorously protest against this Bill that will surely
tend to increage crime and protect law-breakers.
The public must ýdepend on police protection
throughoirt Canada th-at borders a lawless elemenit across thle bounclary. T-inkering with the
mailntenance of law and ord-er in Canada should
not bc considered.
I have here also a letter from a police
magistrate in Winnipeg, but I think I

ougit flot to read it, because hie afterwards
wrote that he had some sympathy with the
Bill.

Altliough I have some isympathy with the
Bill, I could not support it in its presenit
state. I think it probable that in the case
of miner offences there has been a little teo
mucli sbooting by police officers, but if this
Bill were passed it would sometimes deprive
the police and the public of the protection
they should have. For instance, a man went
into a Winnipee drug store at night, held
up the druggist, and shot him dead. The
police get hold of the man who drove the
car, and finally located the man who did the
sbooting. He had a rooro in a bouse. They
were afraid to arrest him. in the bouse because
there were several children there, and they
knew that hie was a desperate man. Tliey
sent him. a message to come down, that they
wanted te see him. H1e came down witli
two guns in his pockets, and as sean as the
policemen approaclied hiro be drew the two
guns and shot one policeman, and pessibly
would have shot the ether five 'lad net the
driver of the police car drawn his gun and
shot him. If the law were amended te such
an extent that the police would net be armed,
that man could bave shot the whole outflt
of them; and while, as I say, I have some
sympathy with the Bill, I think it goes tee
far.
Hon. Mr. LYNiCH-ýSTAUNTO-N:
There
seems to bie a very deep ignorance in the public mind as to tlie meaning of this Bull. Unfortunately,

during

the

de!bate

I expressed

my opinion about the arming of police; but
that wvas, if one may say so, a parenthesis--it
had nothing te do with the oase. It just
shows the rnischief that may be done by
wandering away to collateral affai.rs when one
is arguing a sp.ecific point.
The Bill is limited te preventing tlie justification of police officers wlio shoot at a man
fleeing from them. Thei Winnipeg police
magistrate sent a letter te the honourable
gentleman wlio lias just sat down (Hon. Mr.
McMceans), .prote.sting against the Bill. H1e
later sent a letter to me saying that he had
misunderstood the Bill-ie had thouglit it
was a Bill te dis-arm the police, 'but when lie
eSaw that it was only to clarify the larw, hie
approved of it.
The Criminal Code us a monument te one
of the greatest lawyers who ever took part

in the

administration of pu'blic

affairs in

tlic great principle of English common law

rliat ne man sliould be deprived cd life or
liberty except by due process of law, and that

220

SENATE

no man's life should be taken from him except by a person who was justified in doing
so on the ground of self-defence. As I said
the other day, self-defence covers a great
number of cases: it covers the protection of
yourself, protection of your property, protection of your family-in fact, the great
wisdom of the law has crystallized that principle to cover all cases in which it is desirable
that a man should be slain without being
tried. But within the last year or so it
has been decided that the section allows
assassination by the police. Sir John Thompson, the framer of this law, would, I should
think, turn in his grave if he thought that
anything emanating from him was being construed with such barbarous intent.
My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) said that he wished to find in what
cases the law justified the taking of human
life by a police officer. They are set ont in
four or five pages of the Code. They begin
with treuson and murder, and end with the
injuring of a grape-vine. Any boy who goes
into a vin'eyard stealing grapes and who injures a grape-vine may be shot as he climbs
over the fence when he sees the constable
coming, and the officer will be justified. I
rmake no statement, in this debate, at least,
which I have not carefully considered, and for
which I cannot give the reference. I refer to
section 646 of the Code, and the section dealing with mischief.
Mischief ineludes the
blowing up of a house, and runs all the way
down to injuring a grape-vine. One of the
clauses provides that if a man is in custody
illegally, and attempts to escape, he may be
shot. I say "illegally'' because it is provided
that he may be shot while escaping from either.
legal or illegal custody. Has any man such
a fruitful mind that he can find any excuse,
either on the ground of public policy or of
protecting the people, for taking the life of a
boy who is escaping when he is stealing
grapes? It would be tedious to go through
the large volume of cases and enumerate
them; so I give you these, not because they
are particularly ridiculous, but only as examples.
The honourable gentleman from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. M-eMeans) said a moment ago that
though he was in sympathy with the Bill, he
thought it went too far, and he instanced the
case of a police officer who shot a desperado
coming from a house. This Bill does not
apply to such a case. I am not trying to
confute anything my honourable friend said,
but he .must know that the police are entitled
to be armed, notwithstanding this Bill; and
he must know, and I am sure he does know,
that by the common law, even without this
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON.

statute, that officer was justified in shooting
a man who was resisting arrest. This is an
admirable Code, and I think there is none
like it in the world. Section 39 provides:
Every one executing any sentence, warrant or
process, or in making any arrest, and everyone lawfully assisting him, is justifi'ed, or protected froin crimiinal responsibility, as the case
nay be, in using such force as may be necessary
to overcom,e any force used in resisting such
execu-tion or arrest, unless the sentence, process
or warrant can be executed or the arrest
effected by reasonaible means in .a less violent
ina.nn-er.
What that means is that any police officer
who goes out to arrest a man may use any
force, even to the extent of inflicting death, to
hold that man or to overcome his resistance.
Surely that is enough. That ought to demonstrate to reasonable men that the author of
tbis Code had in mind the fact that numerous
cases of resisting arrest would arise, in some
of which the resistance might be overcome by
ordinary force, while in others extreme force
wxould be required.
Then the next section, as to the construction
of which I am now complaining, goes on te
provide for the case of a flecing man. I submit,
honourable gentlemen, that the pOlice have
aill the power and authority they require, or
that they can desire, for using lethal weapons,
and I think that any intelligent police officer
will admit that he cannot conjure up any case
in which the protection of society or his own
protection is net covered by section 39.
Section 41, then, is solely concerned with
men running away. I appreciate that the
nuinerous hold-ups, and the war on society
which is being made by bandits in this country,
have so excited the indignation of the people
that they have become obsessed with a fear of
these bank robbers and highwaymen and view
with alarm any legislation which may be
construed as limiting the powers of police
officers. But this is a matter which should be
considered impersonally, if I may say so, without regard to existing local conditions. There
always have been conditions of terrorization,
yet England bas survived through them. The
English common law is, I believe, the greatest
in the world, but all the time the process of
development and crystallization of that law
was going on in the Mother Country the
highwayman was in evidence on every common
and by-path, and there existed just such conditions as those under which we now are suffering. The wisdom of our ancestors, of the able
jurists who built up that system of law, should
net be lightly regarded; on the contrary no
departure from \their
principles should be
made before it is given very careful consideration.

221

MAY 17, 1929
I was impelled to bring in 'this Bill because
of the profound conviction that the present
law, which I souglit to have amended, implies
a reversion to barbarismn, and that such law
is absolutely unnecessary for -the protection of
anyone.
As I have said, so far it does not seemn to
have been possible for officiais to get a clear
idea of the real purposes of the Bill. The
Attorney-General of Manitoba rushed in witli
a telegram opposing the Bill before he saw it.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: A police niagistrate, wvas it not?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: No. There
ivas a police magistrate, but he found that
lie had made a false step, and he retraced it
and approved of tlie Bill. But there lias not
corne under my observation a single newspaper that lias not approved of the Bill. An
article expressing entire approval of it appeared in the leading newspaper out in the
Province of British Columbia. The Globe, the
Mail, and the Star in Toronto have supported
it. I arn told by a prominent honourable
member of this House, for whose ability as a
lawyer I have the higliest respect, that the
princiîpal judge in the crimrinal courts in the
Province of Quebec is wliolly in favour of the
Bill; and my honourable friend lias told me
that lie himself is of the sarne opinion. Every
lawyer I have met who has understood the Bill
lias expressed agreement witli it.
The honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) says týhat lie would like to have further consideration of this Bill deferred until
tlie Department of Justice and the AttorneysGeneral of the various Provinces have had
time to consider it. I know that if the Government opposes the measure it will neyer receive the Royal Assent, and I fear that in the
meantirne unfortunate persons may be sent
unshriven to their last judgment. With great
regret for the delay, and in the hope that the
honourable leader of the Government may
make it 'bis business to see that the Bill is
properly brouglit to 'the attention of the
Attorneys-General, and that tliey may give it
careful and thorougli consideration, I reluetantly consent to the Bill standing over.
The Bill was witlidrawn.
CRIMINAL CODE (FINES AND FORFEITURES) AMENDMENT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. E. D. SMITH moved, for Hon. Mr.
Beaubien, the second reading of Bill P7, an
Act to amend Ilhe Criminal Code (Fines and
Forfeitures).

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: There are certain suggestions that I should like to make in
connection witli the Bill, but I do not want
to do so in the absence of the lionourable gentleman who is sponsoring it (Hon. Mr. Beaubien). I could bring theco up in Cornmittee.
I arn quite content that the Bill be given a
second readîng and go to Committee, if it is
understood that we are not consenting to the
princîple of the Bill.
It is underHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
stood that the second reading will not prevent any criticismn of the Bill, even of its
principle. I have not yet obtained a report
which I arn expecting fromn the Departrnent
of Justice.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second tirne.
PACIFIC CABLE AND) WEST INDIAN
ISLANDS (TELEGRAPH) BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDUPLAND moved the second reading of Bill 213, an Act ta, authorize
consent to the sale of certain cable and wireless telegrapli undertakings establislied under
the Pacifie Cable Acts, 1901 to 1924 (Imp.),
and the West Indian Islande (Telegrapli) Act,
1924 (Imp.).
He said: Honourable gentlemen are aware
of the negotiations that have taken place for
the disposal of Canada's interests in the
Pacifie Caible. Copies of tihe present Bill, ta
whicli are appended copies of relevant documents, including legislation passed by the
Britisli House of Commons to ratify the sale
agreement, have been distributed ta honourable members.
I should like to put on Hansard the history
of the Pacifie Cahie.
Following long discussion, in whicli Sir
Sandford Fleming took a lèading part, a
Pacifie C9ble Cnrnmittee, eonsisting of representatives of Great Britain, Canada, New
Southi Wales and Victoria, in 1896 reeomnmended the construction of a submarine cable
fromn Canada to Australia and New Zealand,
owned by the governments interested, and
operated by a saal board on whicli the
associated governments would be represented.
Agreement was subsequently reaclied wliereby
the capital sum required was to be advanced
by the British Governrnent, and principal and
interest were to be guaranteed by Great
Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand
in the proportions of 5, 5, 6 and 2. The cable
wvas laid in 1902. The main business donc
was between Australia and New Zealand and

222

SENATE

Great Britain, which were also connected by
the cables of the Eastern Telegraph Company.
The operation of the cable resulted in losses
every year down to 1916. Later a profit was
obtained, and a substantial reserve accumulated. In 1924-25 the majority of the members of the Pacific Cable Board decided to
utilize this reserve in duplicating the cabie
from Fiji to British Columbia. The Canadian Postmaster
General,
Hon. Charles
Murphy, and the Canadian members on the
Board, Sir Campbell Stuart and Mr. Lucien
Pacaud, objected strongly to this proposal.
The Postmaster Gencral insisted that it was
most unwise to embark on a costly scheme of
cable duplication without making full enquiry
into the possibilities of wireless, and that in
any case the proposed cable contract price
was excessive. In spite of vigorous opposition from Canada, the majority of the Board
awarded a contract for the duplicate cable.
As a resilt of further discussion during the
Imperial Conference of 1926, the Pacific Cablc
Act was pas.sed by the British Parliament in
1927, making it clear beyond dispute that in
futur. no new extensions could be made withont the consent of all the partner governments, and providing for distribution of profits
and disposition of reserves.
As had been forecast, the competition of
wireless soon brought the cables into financial
difficulty. So far as the Pacifie Cable was
concerned, the chief competition came from
the Beam Wireless between Great Britain and
Australia, operated by the Post Office in Great
Britain and by Amalgamated Wireless, in
which the Australian Government had a half
interest in Australia. The Australian Government raised the question of cable and wireless
competition in 1927. The Canadian Government pointed out that the difficulty which
existed, and particularly the further deficits
which faced the Pacific Cable, were due to
disregard of the Canadian views advanced in
1925. It suggested a conference to consider
the Pacific Cable situation, with a view te
effecting economies and securing abolition or
reduction of the terminal charge which Australia collected from the Pacific Cable, and
to consider the possibility of working traffic
arrangements between the cable and wireless
systems. The British Governnent agreed,
but suggested that in view of the serionus
financial conscquences of wireless competition
in the eastern route to Aitstralia, India and
South Africa, the enquir' shouild cover these
phases and not be restrictted to the Pacifie
Cable.
A Wireless and Cable Conference was
accordingly set up early in 192S "te examine
the situation which has arisen as a result of
lon. Mr. DANDURAND.

the competition of the Beam Wireless witL
the Cable services, to report thereon and to
make recommendations with a view to a
common policy being adopted by the varions
governments concerned."
Sir John Gilmour
and A. M. Samuel represented Great Britain,
and Sir Campbell Stuart, one of the Canadian members of the Pacific Cable Board,
and L. J. Gaboury, Deputy Postmaster
General, and Commander Edwards, Director
of Radio Telegraphy, represented Canada.
All the other Dominions and India were
represented.
Sir John Gilmour acted as
Chairman.
After hearing voluminous evidence, much of
it of a confidential strategic or financial character, the Conference presented a comprehensive report. They summarized the situation as follows:
The main featuîres of the situation referred
to us for examination and report miay therefore
be siniîiînarised as follows:
(a) The Cable undertakings operating between the constituent parts of the British Emupire wouild be unable to continue on a payiing
basis in face of unrestricted competition on the
part of Be-an Wireless Services.

(b)

'lie

Eastern and Associated Telegraph

Conipanies w ould

be in a positioin to go int

volunta'y liqueidation andci dispose of their assets
to thelcigiest bidder.
(c) Theie are indications that foreign enterprise niglit be ready' to seize an opportinity of
PCequiring scili pairt of the Eastern and Asseeiated Coipanies' system as couild be transferred
to a foiecugn purchaser.
(d) Owing to the lack of complete secrecy and
eertainty, "Wireless" is not yet in a position
entirely to siipe.rsele cables. Cables. therefore.
still possess great value for the miaintenanee of
necessnary communicat-ions between flic constiil bnt parits of the Eipire for commercial and
strategical puîrposes.
They then proceeded to consider five ways
in which the situation might be dealt with:
non-intervention; government subsidy to the
varions cables: government guarantee of a
minimum revenue to the cables; pooling of
revenue; and amalgamation of all the cable
and wireless interests conducting communications between the various parts of the Empire. Of these the fifth was recommended.
Before the Conference met, the Eastern
Telegraph Company and the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company had been considering the possibility of a merger, and while
the Conference was in session a definite
agreement to this effect was reached. The
Conference accordingly instituted negotiatiens with the companies concerned for the
purpose
of formulating recommendations,
through Sir William McLintock and Sir
Otto Niemeyer of the Bank of England. The
Conference finally proposed to take as the
starting point the proposed merger between

MAY 17, 1929
the Eastern Telegraph and the Marconi Wireless, and to recomimend the transfer to this
new company of the Imiperial Atlantic câbles
owned by the British Gavernment, the Pacifie
Câble Board câibles, the West Indian câble,
and a lease -of the Post Office Beam System.
The cc>mpany was ta undertake ta meet the
outstanding capital debt of the Pacifie Gable
Board, and in addition ta pay a su~m of
£517,000 for the Pacifie Gable. A standard net
revenue for the new company was proposed,
-and of ail surns earned. abave that, haif was
ta be applied ta reduction of rates or such
other purposes -as an Imperial Advisory Committee, ta be composed of representatives of
the governments participating, should approve.
Na increases of rates could be made without
the approval of the A.dvisary Committee,
which wauld have consultative powers in questions of rates, as for example, ensuring that
a reasonable proportion of the total cable
traffic between Great Britain and Australasia
should continue to pass through Canada. British contrai of the company was ta be guaranteed.
An Act enabling the Pacifie Gable Board
ta dispose of its assets, subject ta the approval of the governments concerned, has
been passed 'by the British Parliament.
The proposed agreement as ta the Pacifie
Cable is very advantageous ta Canada. Wireless competition had already eut profits down
te the va-nishing point, and, as the competition grew, the partner goveraments were faced
with deficits on current account, and with the
obligation of meeting the capital obligations
outstanding. The proposai provides for the
assumpition by the company of the whoie
capital obligation and for payment of £517,000 ta the partner governîmenta. Canada wiIl
thus avoid further liabiiity and will receive
a capital sum of $700,000. The total of the
deficits met by Canada between 1903 and
1916 xas sligbtly over $900,000. T'hus we shahl
recover practieallv ail aur early losses, in
addition ta avoiding future ioss.
Further, contrai of rates is assured through
the Advisory Committee.
I do naot know whether I have given a
sufficientiv cle-ar explanation of the reasens
that actuated the Canadian Government in
deciding ta adhere ta that scheme, 'but I believe we were justified in joining with the
other Governments in disposing of these holdings and recovering the money paid out durrng the lean years when deficits were accruing.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes. The î900 000 was not what it cost us, but the arnount
we.paid out ta caver deficits.
Hon. Mr.

WILLOUGHBY:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

To

caver

Yes.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: What provisioiý
is made for the repayment of the capital we
invested?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
That disappears. Some advances were made by the
varions Governrnents, as I reolleet, and
bands were issued. These obligations are
taken over by the company.
We estabiished at the time direct communication with
Australia, New Zealand and Great Britain,
and we withdraw with the satisfaction tihat
there is now a complete chain of communications connecting those parts of the Empire.
We reeover what we paid to meet the deticit
from 1903 ta 1916, and we are freed from any
further liabilities asý to capital, administration
and operation.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY. I presume that
the service -offered now is equal ta what we
were getting before. I had occasion, as one
of the delegates, ta South Africa, ta came homne
by Australia and New Zeallnnd, travelling fram
there to Vancouver by the Australian uine.
If there was one thing more noticeable ta us
than another in the daily bulletins issued on
shiphoard, with which everyone is familiar,
telling what is going on in the world, it was
the fact that news as ta what was occurring
in Canada was almost entireiy negligible,
there being freqiiently no information at ail.
On a long voyage of that kind it struck, me
that the radio service, which I supposed wauld
be through the beam. was ini any event nlot
furnishing Canadians with very much news.
This was so astonishing to me that I intended
ta take it up in a more public way afterwards
and comment on it. It cornes back ta my
recalioction at the present time.
If I arn not in error, I think we invested a
rather considerahie sum. I arn nat blaming
the Government for the investment made at
that time; it was perhaps a very wise one;
but it was unfortunate that the competition
of Marconi, which we knoýw the ýcabie companlies cannot meet except in a very limited
way, with the mare confidential messages hatween governments, changed the aspect of
business in cannection with the cable comnHon. Mr. WILLOUGHB3Y: That is, the panies and inade the operation of them
8700,000 which Canada will reeeive is set off financially difficuit, whereas up ta that time
against the $900,000 which it cost us?
they had 'been reasonaýbly profitable.

SENATE
I amrn ft
opposing this motion at ail, and
I make these statements ooiy for the information of the Huse. I arn much pleased to know
that xwhat we have actuaily expended in connection with the building of the Pacific cable,
and the rest of the capital expenditure. apart
from the annual ioss, to which. reference was
made to-day, will be offset hy the sum whirh
"'e are going to receive, and which I suppose
will practically ho capital.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I inay say thiat
i haven very often seen the statement that
in th( ýinterest of the British Empire, for the
iinking together of jts varions parts, Canada
bas hbeen earrying a hurden in the most disinterested way, for this country stood to gain
very little in the transaction. 0f course Canada was a medium for the transmission of
news from London to Australia and New
Zealand, but it derived very littie direct
benefit except týhat of the general interest of
the Empire.
I arm quite -sire that the service whieh w'e
-'hall now get, through the wireless stations
%vhich have heen put up in Canada for the
diffusion of Canadian newvs towards Australia,
will he far more satisfactory than ever we
hiad under the cable system.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: It could not be
less, I think.

TRIBUTE

TO BIS

MEMORY

Hon.
Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, it is my sad duty to annouiee te
this Chambýer the dieparture of one of our
oldest colleagueýs, Hon. Mr. Watson. H1e had
heen with, us for the past twenty-nine ye-ars,
and although we had noticed of recent years
that bis strength was fýailing, when I saw him
this session I thougýht that since last session
ho had gained ground. The word we recsived
last w'eek, that bis life was ýebbing, wvas a
fororunner of the teIegramn announcing bis
de ath.
Hon. Mr. Watson was horn in Ontario. At
twenty-throe yeurs of age he decided te go
te tbe West and try bis fortune there. Manittoha at that time xvas but a new~ province, and
thîcie xvas no railway connection iaetwcon the
East andi the West on Canadian sou. I liave
miiwamî iad a grumit admîiration for the ývou:îe

MAY 20, 1929
friends and tiheir surroumdings, to go into that
vast and sparsely settled country. When the
late Senator Watson decided ta leave the East
the West was not producing thbe large crops
which it has si.noe brought forth. He Teached
hie destinMtion in 1876, wbereas the Os«nadian
P-acilfic Railway wiae not buit and inaugurated
until 1885 or 1886. He erected a fleur mil at
Portage la Prairie, and aiso operated a machine
shap und planing miii in partnership with his

brother. Within a few years of his arrival he
began ta inteTest himsellf in public affaire, and

in 1882 he returned te the East with a mandate
ta represent in the House of Commons the
people e1 the eounmty of M2xquette. He
continued ta represent that tonst4tuency titi
1891, when he resigned ta becomne Minieter of
Public Works of Manitoba, a position which
he occupied until 1899.
Mr. Watson was as energetic and successful
in public affairs as he had been in private
life. When the Province of Manitoba decided ta build a railway southward, which
would cross the Canadian Pacifie Railway
Company's line, he waged war with that company, and at one stage there was even some
question of mobilizîng traaps in order ta
maintain peace at the diamond where the
roads intersected. Senator Watson was bound
ta see that Manitoba won the day. Since
then many roads have been built, some from
north ta suth, others paralleling the Canadian
Pacifie Railway, and lie was nat at ail surprised at the large volume of immigration ta
those western plains.
As I have said, we had the late Senator
Watson with us for twenty-nine years. Those
who have recently came ta this Chamber did
flot sec humn in his prime or at his best. He
came ta the Senate at about the same time
as Senator Findlay Young, who had been a
colleague of his in the Manitoba Legislature.
It was a pleasure ta see thein, inseparable as
brothers, in and out off Parliament. There
was at one turne a littie resentment, even
among the members sitting on their own side
off the Huse, against what they called the
cipower house," inasmuch as Senator Watson
and Senator Young and two or three others
had a very large roomn ta theinselves and
were thought by saine members ta be monopolizing the direction of this Chamber.
I have had Senator Wqtson very near me
for a number of years. I have enjoyed bis
friendship and admired his constant loyalty
and devotion ta the work off this bouse. For
fifty years he occupied a place ini the public
eye, and in his province, as well as within
the precinets off Parliament, lie enjoyed the
full esteein and confidence of inen who camne

225

in contact with hum. bis life was well filled
with good deeds. In the naine of the Senate
I desire ta tender ta bis widow and his
children the sympatby off this Chamber.
bon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
gentlemen, the saddest duty which, I have
heen called upon ta perforin since accupying
my new position has been ta rise in my place
and refer ta death. This I have had ta do
three times-twice on the death of members
of this bouse, and once on the death off the
distinguished General Foch.
Caming froin the West, I knew the late
Senator Watson betiter, perhaýpe, than niost
members on this side off the bouse, though
nlot better than saine mnembera opposite. I
knew a great deal about hima before I knew
hum personally. lie was known everywhere
as a inan off very great fixity of principle and
deterinination in carrying out hie purposes;
yet lie was kindly in this bouse, as lie always
was ta everybody.
The incident ta which the honouratile leader
of the bouse has referred, in canneection with
the construction off the Canadian Pacifie Railway in the West, is merely an illustration off
the late senatar's strong character. There
were doubtless inany in the East who thought7
that the West clamoured se much for the
Canadian Pacifie Railway that they would
undergo any conditions imposed upon thein
in order ta secure it. Undoubtedly they were
in the highest degree desirous off getting saine
railway into that country at the turne; but,
as bas been indicated by the honourable
leader, other railways froin the Ainerican aide
were ready ta build in there, and the late
senator found a very willing constituency
following his leadership in opposition ta the
laims of the Canadian Pacifie Railway,
whieh at that turne were more or less monopolistie, as we know. 1 need nat discuss thern
now, and of course I am not criticizing them.
It was quite natural, then, that a man af
Senator Watson's sturd'y temperamnent, bath
morally and physically, should assume the
local leadership of bis paaty in that part af
Manitoba in which lie lived, and this he did
very successfully. Later in lîfe it waa my

opportunity of knowing Senator Watson. We
were so long together that we began to take
very kindly to one another. A long trip of
that kind, both on land and sea, is a good
means of trying out your fellow, to see how
you can get along together.* He wore well
-adnirably well.
He was a sturdy fighter, and he had in his
bag all the political tricks of a member of
the other House. While be was administering
a Department for the Government of Manitoba they had a man who was, I think, very
singularly adapted by training and temperament for the office which he filled.
We
knoiv that as a member of the special Committee in connection with the construction of
this parliament building he was always most
attentive and took great interest in the work.
His mind was eminently practical; his training had been such, and I can quite understand that he made a very efficient Minister
when he was a member of the Greenway Government.
As has been said by the honourable leader,
to the younger members of this House he
was to a certain extent a stranger, so far as
the period of his prime was concerned. To
refer again to the time of the trip to South
Africa, whieh was not so long ago-only 1924
-one
other of the members of this House,
the right honourable the junior member for
Ottawa (Rt. Hon. Sir Geo. E. Foster) accompanied us, and we climbed up to the battlefield mountains and viewed all the reservoirs,
viaducts, and apparently everything else that
could be seen in South Africa.
I mention
that only to show that at that time no one
was more able physically to undertake such
heavy tasks, although they were optional,
than was Senator Watson.
It is only in the
last couple of years that he showed any
marked sign of decline and of old age.
We shall miss him in this House, and I miss
him as much as anybody.
PENNY BANK BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill A8, an Act to amend the
Penny Bank Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen will remember that when I introduced this Bill I
explained its purport. The Penny Banks are
purely philanthropie in purpose. The directors
represent that a large proportion of the fund
of the bank is at present invested in Victory
bonds whieh are soon to mature, and they
would like to have greater latitude as to
future investments, in order to insure as high
a yield as possible, which is necessary for the
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

successful continuance of the operations of
the bank. Under the Act as it now stands, it
would not be possible te invest these moneys
so as to be able to continue the rate now
paid to depositors. The proposed additions
to the list of investments are all within the
field of trustee investments.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Have you anything to show what they actually do pay?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
per cent.

They pay three

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I have no criticism of the Bill. It is merely widening the
power of investment to include inrvestments
earning higher interest, so as to enable the
directors to pay depositors the three per cent
that is spoken about.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

bas, is not an easy matter, and it did not present a very hopeful outlook. When Premier
Greenfield was at the head of the Government
of the Province of Alberta, and I happened to
be Minister of Railways, he came to Ottawa
on several occasions and sought -to have some
new arrangement made when the lease held by
the Canadian Pacifie Railway expired. After
a good deal of negotiation by the present
Government the Canadian Pacifie investigated
the matter, as also did the Canadian National
Railways. Rather large amounts of mortgage
bonds are outstanding on these properties,
and the Canadian Pacifie eventually purchased
then for the sun of $26,000,000, not including amounts to be expended for the extension
of certain branch lines within the territories

in the next few years. That purchase by the
Canadian Pacifie carried the understanding
that the Canadian National would be allowed
the privilege of entering into a joint ownership by paying half the purchase price. It
bas been agreed that the Canadian National
shall do this.
This Bill seeks to incorporate a new company coiposed of representatives of the
Canadian National and the Canadian Pacifie,
who will be directors, in order to carry on
this undertaking jointly. The amount of
money that the Canadian National will have
to contribute will be half the total amount
of $26,000,000, plus the amount to 'be expended in the extension of a few smaller
lines.
The mileage of this undertaking is considerable. The railways themselves have a mileage of 820 miles, and with sidings and spurs
about 915 miles. There is no doubt in the
world that the proper opening up of that
part of Canada not only presents a problem,
but also offers a great future if the problem
is properly handled. Railways will have to
be extended to the north in a very few years,
because, among other reasons, that territory
is rich in minerals-richer, I think, than we
suspect. Another prospect before the railways or the Government is a new line of
access from the Peace River district out to
the ocean. That presents a rather large
problem, and the estimates made have been
up in the millions. I think the solution of
the problem possibly lies in the amalgamation of the forces of the Canadian National
Railways and the Canadian Pacifie Railway,
with both roads working in harmony, each
paying hall the costs, each having not merely
running rights over the other's railway, but
joint ownership, and each having the power,
under legislation, to construct branch ines so
that it can bring traffic to the main line. The
problem of providing access from the Peace
River to the Pacifie ocean is a very large
one, and before many years have passed these
railways will be asking permission to meet
the demands of new and old settlers alike
for a solution of that problem.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
gentlemen, I should like to make a suggestion
to the right honourable gentleman who is
sponsoring the seven Railway Bills that are
down for second reading to-night (Right Hon.
Mr. Graham). I do not think any honourable member on this side of the House will
object to the second readings of these Bills,
provided it is understood that we are not
committing ourselves to the principle of them.
The Bills will go before the Railway Com-

SENATE
mittee, where we shall have the advantage
of hearing the experts of the companies interested, and the Committee will report back
to this House. By reversing the ordinary
procedure and having it understood that honourable gentlemen may criticize the principle
of the Bills when they come up for third
reading, we should save time and get along
more satisfactorily. The situation would be
different if there were only one such Bill,
but in view of the fact that there are seven
I think it would be to the advantage of all
honourable members to give the Bills second
reading now, without explanations, on the
understanding I have mentioned.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I am agreeable to the suggestion of my honourable
friend.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

INSURANCE BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 42, an Act ta amend the Insîlrance .Act.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, one of the
purposes of this Bill is to correct defeets
which have corne to light in the administration of the Jnsurance Act, with the growth
of the casualty insurance business. Another
object is to clarify the Act in respect to those
companies which transact exciusively marine
and inland marine insurance. It is intended
t bat such companies shahl be exempt from the
Insurance Act.
The Bill gives fraternal societies the right
enjoyed by ordinary insurance companies to
issue endowment policies for twenty years or
a longer term, and aiso, under certain conditions, to increase the maximum policy to
$10,000.
It also permits any Canadian fraternal society, on the recommendation of its
actuary, to make provision in its by-laws for
granting policy loans. paid up policies, or
surrender. values in connection with its insurance policies. This enactment merely extends to the Canadian fraternai societies generaiiy the same power that bas been obtained
by a number of these societies by amendments
to their special Acts, and makes more uniform
than beretofore the insuring powers of ail
fraternal societies.
Hon. Mr. REID: Has this Bill been approved of by the Insurance Departmcnt?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It bas been prepared by the Insurance Department.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My honourabie

reading, 1 shahl have it sent to tbe Banking
and Commerce Committee, where my bonourabie friend (Mon. Mr. Robertson) may
inquire as to its full scope.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: There is no restriction of tbat kind in the Bill; tbe termn "fraternal society" is generai.

VANCOUVER HARBOUR LOAN BILL
SECOND READYING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moveýd tbe second
reaýding of Bill i6, an Act to provide for a further loan to the Vancouver Harbour Commissioners.

H1e said: Honourab'le gentlemen, this Bill
provides for a boan being negotiated by the
Vancouver Harbour Commission, up to the
amount of $10,000,000, for terminal facilities.
The proposed expenditore of that sumn is, first,
for the redemption of the Commissioners'
maturing mortgage
notes issued for the
balance of the purchase price of the Hastings
Mill site and incident-ai exp enses thereof;
second, for developments on the bastings Miil
property, as foiiows: (a) wharf for vessels in
coastal trade and grain .ietty, for commissioners' operation, $350,000; (b) wbarf for veqsels in coastal tr-ade, fisb wharf and fisb starage, aiso cold. storage, for operation by lessees,
$1,150,000; (c) for deveiopment of a ncw ocriin
pier as warranted by increased business, $3,500,000. Those sums makze a total of $5,000,000
for item number 2.

Thirci, for an addition to grain handling
facilities, as follows: at elevator No. 1, to increase its capacity 4ay approximately 3,000,000
bushels; at élevator No. 2, to increase its
capacity by approximately 2,000,000 busheis;
at cievator No. 3, to increase its capacity by
approximateiy 2,500,000 busbels. These addi-

tions ta the grain handiing facihities invoive
an expenditure of $3,000,000.
These items represent a grand total of $9,950,000.
Last year grain delivery at Vancouver
amounteýd to 97,250,548 bushels. For tbe year
1924 the figure wças oniy 55,000.000 bushels.
The receipýts last year amounted ta $2,057,739.02, *and the expenditures totaiied only
$1,682,470.87. Aftcr operating expenses, interest
due to the Government, and sinking fond had
been taken care *of a substantial balance wai
ieft.
The number of deep ses, ships coming into
the harbour in 1927 was 1,100, wbereas in 1928
there were 1,300, an inerease of 200.
Tbe total elevaitor capacity at Vancouver at
tbe present time is 5,325,000 busheis. It wi!l
be brought up to 7,500,000 bushels by the
proposed deveilopment.
bon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I do not think the
bonourabie gentleman bas read that quite

231

oorreotly, because one elevator has three million bushels, one has two and a 'haif million
bushels, and another hbas two million bushels,
making a total of 7,500,000 bushels. That will
give, wMt the five million bushels of storage
now in use, a total storage of 12,500,000
bushels, and this additione.l storage should
c ost much more than the three million dollars
mentioned 'by the leader of the Government.
That is the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
stat-ement I have. It will add 7,500 ,000
bushels.
Hon. Mr. CAiSGRAIN: That is right. Then
they will have 12,500,000.
The motion was agreed. to, and the Bill was

-in addition to the moneys heretofore authorizedDoes that mean that any of the moneys
formerly authorized have not yet been expended? Otherwise, why the references to
any f ormer loans ?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 cannot at the
moment give an answer to my honourable
friend as to the expenditure of the loans that
were authorized. The Bill simply authorizes,
ini addition to what has already been authorized, the sum of $10,000,000.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Why should that be
put in unless some of the authorized money
bas not been expended?
I know there
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

THREE RIVERS HARBOUR LOAN BILL
SECOND

READING

moved the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND
second reading of Bill 67, an Act to provide
for a loan to the Three Rivers Harbour
Commissioners.
Re said: Honourakile gentlemen, this Bill
will allow the Harbour Commission of Three
Rivers to finance its development by boan,
up to the sum of $2,000,000, according to the
ordinary procedure which. governs the relations between the Harbour Commissions and
the Government. Seven additional berths
will be provided ini the harbour, and this
amount is necessary for the construction of
wharves, which provide open storage. The
new development in the harbour ;vill naturally
increase the facilities avails>ble, and will result in a very material increase in the traffic
handled. The Dominion Coal Company bas
given its guarantee that this year it will
unload 200,000 tons of coal in the harbour of
Three Hivers. It is impossible at present for
the Harbour Commissioncrs to meet the demands for space which are made upon them.
Three Rivers is a very important industrial
city. Its population is now over 35,000, and
its industries are numerous. As far as port
facilities are concerned, it serves a very imI refer to Shawinigan
portant territory.
Falls and the town of GrandlMère, where
there is a large development of water-power,
and where important industries are constantly
expanding. These conditions justify the proposaIs of the Harbour Commissioners.
The revenue for the year 1928 was $72,142,000, while in 1924, four years ago, it was
only $39,468. We find that they closed their
operations this year with a considerable surplus.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: After paying the
interest on the money to the Government?
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: They do not owe
the Government anything.
Hon. Mr. DANDURANID: It is expected
that this amount will produce sufficient income
týo meet the inýterest.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: How was it
in the case of that harbour before? We made
an advance before, did we not?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
gentleman from Three Rivers (Hon. Mr.

232

SENATE

Bureau) can perha-ps tell us wheni the Harbour
Commission was appointed. For a number
of years it, was under the dire-et control of
the Department of Publie Works.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: The Harbour Comnmission of Three Rivera was first incorporated
in 1882, and the first improvements were
started with money provided by the Public
Works Department.
The Commissionrers,
after they were incorporated, were authorized
to borrow a certain amount of money to do
the flrst work, and they did not have enough.
The Governm'ent then advanced $82,000, for
which they took over the debentures of the
Commissioners. 1 arn sorry that, the right
honourarbie the junior member for Ottjawa
(Rigbt Hon. Sir George E. Foster) is flot bere,
so that I might refresh my memory by putting a question to him. An agreement w-as
made between the Finance Department of
that time and the Harbour Commission of
Three Rivers, that if the latter paid $15,000
for intercst, the $82,000 would be wiped out,
and the debentures of the Harbour Commission would be returned. Somnehow or other
this was not done.
A fire occurred at Three Rivera in 1908,
and ail the documents were burned, but on
going through the files of the Public Works
Department 1 was able to trace a letteýr from
Sir John Abbott, stating that the Minister
of Finance, Hon. (J. E. Foster, was at the
time of his writi-ng in the Maritime Provinces,
and that he was unable Vo sec him to determine on what conditions a settiement could
be madle in regard to the $82,000; but that
he understood that upon the payment of the
$15,000 interc4t the $82,000 worth of Haýrbour
debentures would be returned, and the debt
wiped out.
The 815,000 interest was paid
as agrced.
Yet the $82,000 item ýisstill there,
an'd every time the -Harbour Commissioners
have cffected a boan, lcgislation haoý had to be
passcd to give precedence to such loan.
Between the improx ements that have been
madle bv the Harbour Commissioners and
those madle by the Public Works Department,
a consiclerable amnount of money has been
expendcd to mneet tho needs of the traffie on
the St. Lawrence at Three Rivers. These needs
ha-ve greatly increased on account of the development of the northern country, as stated
by the honourable leader of the House. Development has been going on at Grand'Mère,
Shawinigan Falls and La Gabelle.
The
nUmeroIus pabper milîs erected at Three Hivers,
which 'bas hecome the largest paper-producing
centre in Amerien, necessitate însporting coal
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

fromn Nova Scotia and other plaies to kecp
the mills running, and also, the importation of
sulphur and other materials, so that space is
unavailable to nope with the situation as it
nýow exisas.
The requests made by Vhe Harbour Commissioners of Three Rivera for boans are
always submitted for approval to the Minister
and the officers of the Department of Marine.

The Commission since 1922 bas been administered by three of the best business men we
have in Three Rivers: Mr. Roberit F. Grant,

resident agent of the Canadian International
Paper Com~pany; Mr. J. L. Fortin, owner of a
large d'epartment store; and Mr. Norman La-

belle, hardware merchant, and for a long period
chaircoan of the Board of Trade. They draw
no salaries. They meet every day, and they
devote their time and attention Vo the work
of development of the harbour.
The icoprovements now being carried on with the
Jean authorized by the Governor in Council
are intended to increase the' facilities and
allow the Dominion Coal Conmpany to fulfl
its conytracts with the various industries of
Thrce Hivers and the St. Maurice Valley by
delivering coal and other material to therm.

So far the Harbour Commission of Three

Rivers bas always met ail its interest, and
also dpitda

maturity the debentures that are outstanding.
The, revemnu. hqs more than dou!bled in rccent
vc ars. and! the new iîmprovements that are con1
.enplated wvili not onlv be icapable of meeting
the' wants and requirements of the various interesta, and industries which are now operatiag along the shores of the St. Maurice and
St. Laivrence rivers. lbut will also secure additional revenue to me-et the interýest and the
sinking fund on the baan which is now being
advanced by the' Government.

Hon. Mr. WJ LLOUGHJ3Y:
Honourabie
gentlemen,
wvhen 1 asked the honourable
leader of the Hos for some informacion it
was not neceýsarilv to oppos,-e this at ail; I
mercly wantecl Vo know Vo what extent subvention had been granted hv the' Government
hefore-I mean, by the Government here
guaranteeing the loans Vo the Harbbour Board
et Three 1-ivers, ancl to what extent, if aîiv,
they had received money from the' Public
M7orks
Department for the purpose of their
harbour development froco time to time. I
take it that they had a boan at Ieinst guaranteecl by the Dominion Government, for harbour purposes. This is the flrst boan, is it?
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Yes.

233

MAY 20, 1929
Then ail the
Hon. Mr. WILLOUJGHBY:
expenditures that were flot made with moneys
raised by the Harbour Commissioners themselves were mnade by the Public Works Department on that harbour?
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Absolutely. I do not
want my honourable f riend to misunderstand
me. There was $82,000 advanced in 1884 or
1885, which the then Harlbour Goimmissioners
of Three Rivers elwimed had been remitted, by
the Finance Department. Now, outside of
that amounit, ail the xnoneys that have been
borrowed by the Harbour Commissioners of
Three Rivers have been borrowed on the
credit of the Commission without any endorsation by the Government, and the interest
and siiking fund, as 1 amn infonmed, have
always been properly looked aïfter.
The Public Works Department did contribute to the building of a part of the
wharves. We have over a mnile, 1 think, of waterfront in Three Rivers, and that wharfage is
fully occupied ail the time. The development
of the northern country has created conditions which require additional docks. The
Governrnent, after investigating the proposed
enlargements of the factories which are now in
operation, and the establishment of new ones,
has recognized the necessity of the additions
contemplated. The new loan is to meet the
demnand for those new docks, which will hring
in enough money 'to pay the interest and
sinking fund.
The motion was agreed ta.

CHICOUTIMI HARBOUIR LOAN BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 68, an Act t<o provide for a
further boan to the Chicoutimi Harbour Commi ssioners.
H1e said: Honourable gentlemen, this provides for the right of the Chicoutimi Harbour

Commissioners to issue $2,000,000 of débentures for the development of a new port. I
might say that this is practically a new creation. The Harbour Commission ohtained
350,000 Borne two years ago for wharf extension. Further extension of 2,400 feet is now

proposed.

Practically a new wharf is

bein)g

created to cope with the business which is in
sight, owing to a large development of electrical power in that area. About 700,000 horsepower has already been harnessed, and in process of development there is an additional
300 ,000, of which it is expected that 250,000
will he in operation in 1930.
The receipts last year at that port
amounted to $18,587.63, but the experiditure
was only $5,497.13. The Commission were
able ta use only the old section of the wharf;
they did not have the use of the facilities
which are being constructed. The total expenditure for salaries, maintenance and sundry
disbursements on revenue -account amounted

to $5,497.14. The Commission report as f oilows as to the expected revenues:

HALIFAX HARBOUR LOAN BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 69, an Act to provide for a
further loan to the Halifax Harbour Commissioners.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the purpose
of this Bill is to authorize the Halifax Harbour
Commission to borrow a surn of $5,000,000.
The Commission has already a borrowing
power of $500,000, which power is practically
intact, as only some thirty odd thousand
dollars have been expended. Owing to the fact
that the Commissioners have not been in control a full year, no report of their operations
bas been made.
The Department of Trade and Commerce
reports the following quantities of grain
shipped through the elevator: 1927-1,047,670
bushels; 1928-1,991,659 bushels.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Can my honourable friend inform the House as to the
capacity of the elevator at Halifax at the
present time?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I fear I have not
that information in the papers I have here,
but I think it is about 2,000,000 bushels.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I presume it is
not less than 2,000,000 bushels, and I was
wondering if .my honourable friend could tell
the House what necessity there is for further
elevator capacity in Halifax. The present
capacity was not taxed to its limit last year
nor the year before. My honourable friend has
informed us just now that the present capacity
at Vancouver is a little over 5,000,000 bushels,
and 97,000,000 bushels of grain went through
that port last year. But at Halifax they have
not needed in the last two years the capacity
they have there, and I think it is in order to
inquire the reason for adding to the present
storage capacity.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am unable to
find among the papers that have been sent
to me a detailed statement showing the present
capacity of the Halifax elevator. Perhaps we
can postpone the third reading of the Bill
until to-morrow, and in the meantime I shall
endeavour to get the information for my
honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I do not desire to
hold up the passage of the Bill, but it occurred
to me that there is nothing like the same
necessity for inereasing the capacity at Halifax that there is at Vancouver.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am now told
that the capacity of the Halifax elevator is
2,000,000 bushels.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The total quantity that passed through the port of Halifax
last year was not suflicient to fill the elevator
once, yet my honourable friend reconmends
increasing the elevator capacity by another
million bushels. I cannot understand why
that is necessary under the circumstances.
Hon. Mr. DANDURANJD: All our ocean
ports are developing and needing more elevator
capacity. I am quite sure that with the increase whieh has taken placeHon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: The ledger accounts are increasing anyway.

235

MAY 20, 1929
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -at Halifax, the
additional capacity will be necessary. In 1927
there were 1,047,670 bushels shipped through
the elevator, and in 1928 the quantity increased to 1,991,659.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Still it was not
enough to fill the elevator once.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I feel sure that
the Canadian National Railways believe the
additional space is required.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

YUKON TERRITORY ADMINISTRATION
OF JUSTICE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 131, an Act respecting the administration of justice in the Yukon Territory.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the Department of Justice feels that it should obtain authority to have persons who are arrested
for offences committed in the northern part
of the Yukon Territory tried -in another part
of the country, in the Northwest Territories.
The northern part of the Yukon Territory, on
account of its geographical location, is difficult
to control from Dawson. It is impossible for
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to bring
accused persons from that district to Dawson
for trial and almost an impossiblity for a judge
of the Yukon Territorial Court to make the
trip overland. It is therefore considered advisable to provide that persons charged with
indictable offences within this territory may
be tried by the Stipendiary Magistrate of the
Northwest Territories.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Do you know
where that Stilpendiary resides? Speaking
from memory, I think that he moves from
place to place.

Hon. Mr. BE4LCOURT: There are several
of them. This refera to the whole of the
Northwest Ternitories.
Hon: Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I know there
are severai in the whole Northwest Territories, because it is an immense district. I
am not opposing the Bili.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I understand that
there are several Stipendiaries in the northern
district.
I my honHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ourable friend will allow me to read clause 1
of the Bill, he will perhaps find there the explanation he requires.
Clause 1 reads:
1. Whenever it appears to the satisfaction of
the Minister of Justice that it is expedient to
the ends of justice that the trial of any person
heretofore or hereafter charged with an indictable offence alleged to have been committed
north of the 65th parallel of latitude, in the
Yukon Territory, should he held in some district or place other than that in which the
offence is alleged to have been comnitted or
would otherwise be triable, the Minister of
Justice may order that the trial shall be proceeded with in the Northwest Territories before
the court or judge named in suth order, and
thereupon the court or judge so named shall
have juriediction Vo try such person.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third
reading of the Bih.
He said: Owing to the explanations that
have been given of the purpose of this Bill,
I would suggest that we dispense with the

a third time now.

Bill 15, an Act to amend the Electricity and
Fluid Exportation Act (Exportation of Elctrie Power) .Hon. Mr. Tanner.
Hon. Mr. Robinson in the Chair.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, I have been asked by the honourable member for DeSalaberry (Hon. Mr.
Beique) for information respecting contracts
for the export of electric power made by cornpanies to whom licenses were granted in the
fiscal year ending Marci 31, 1930. The ho 'nourable gentleman suggested that this inform•ation could *be given in ten lines.
Mr. J.
L. Stiver, Director of Electricity and Gas
Inspection Services, lias compiled a table,
which contains more than ten lines, but does
not go beyond twenty, giving the facts requested. I do not know whether there would
be any use in reading the statement, but I
shaîl do so if the Bill is to lie examined
finally in Committee now, although I doubt
that members will ha able to give proper consideration to the figures until they are p1aced
on Hansard. 0f course it was proper that we
should go into Committea in order that I
miglit present this statement. I arn in the
hands of the Senate.

H
1on. Mr. BEIQUE: If the honourable
memïber for Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner) bas
,no objection, I woulid suggest that the matter
stand until to-rnorrow, so that we may al
have an opportunity to read the statement
that. i.s put in.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend frosu Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach)
asked me to try to. give him a definition of
the term "temporary emergency." So far I
have found no one who would bind h.imself
to a clear and precise definition, and my inquiries have generally resulted in my being
referred to Webster's Dictio-nary and other
authorities of that kind.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: It was an explanation, not a definition, that I wanted. A definition rnay be f ound in the dictionary, but an
explanation is a different matter.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. ýGRAEAM: You want the
interpretation?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Off course, before giving the interpretation, one would have
to examine into the definition of the word.
It would be difficuit to give in, the aibstaot
an interpretati*on which would apply to any
and every definiite situation.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
There are some things which had better be
left undefined, and I a.m off the opinion that
this is one of them. You cannot sit down
and in black and white make provision for
every species or variety of emergency. It
muest be lef t to the authorities to deal with
each special case as it cornes up, and we muet
rely upon their judgment as to whether an
emergeney exista or not.
As I understand it, the main contention
with reference to this Bill is as to whether or
flot the s.mendmnent of my honouralble friend
from LaSalle (Hon. Mr. Bureau) is to be
adopted. 1 arn not sure that I quite understand the position, and rny honourable friend
will correct me if I missatate, it. My understanding, chiefly from mem.ory, is that a long
while ago the proper authority constituted a
company to produce po'wer and gave that
cornpany the right to make contracts for exporta tion of that power. The company then
made a contract for exportation extending
over a long period of years, and it seems to
have been within its right in doing so. A
long while afterwards the Dominion of Canada came to the conclusion that it was necessary for the Federal authority to regulate the
exportation of power from Canada, and that
power should not be exported without a
license obtained frorn the Federal jurisdiction.
That came, I think, a numýber of years--

239

Hon. Mr. GRIEISBAYR: I should like to
ask the right honourable gentleman a question.
My understanding was, when we discussed this,
matter before, that at the time of this agreement for exportation of power the law required these people to obtain a license from
the Government of Canada every year, and
that in spite of this fact, they entered into an
agreemnent to deliver power for fifty years.
1 think my
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable friend is in error with regard to

one instance.
Some were made under provincial authority
before 1907, in which year the Federai Parliament required the companies to comply with
the Federal Iaw and obtain a yearly Iicense.
Riglit Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Then apparently I arn correct thus far, tihat
after authority to export had been gîven and
exercised and contracte made for a long period
of years, there was enacted the law requiring
licenses to be obtained. year iby year frorn
the Dominion authorities, and such licenses
have not been refused to those companies
authorized to export, but have been continued
from year to year since 1907, and the companies have made arrangements accordingly.
We all can be mighýty wise ten or twenty
Some of us become

wise in a very few moments after an action
has been perforaned, and are sorry that it was
p erf ormed.
At the time being it was considered by that company to, be good business
to maire a sale in United States territory of
power for which there was not then sufficient
markret in Canada. The assumption is that
when a cornpany buys power, under a license
or without a lîýcense, it has a right to deinand
tàe fulfillment of its contract, provided it

company, having procured the necessary equipinent, makes use of the power; then communities large and smaîl are affected and from.
year to, year become more and more dependent
upon that power. It is ve-ry easy to compare
the price at which fluid is purchased to-day
with the leaser price which was agreed upon
in contracte made some years ago, and to
catculate that we are somewhat at a disadvantage as compared with our neighbours
on the other aide, because they are getting
power at a cheaper rate than we can buy it
here; but even though the price which was:
set at the timne when the contract was made is
much lower than that -at which fluid is now
selling, it is hsrdly permissible for the supplying company to dernand that from year to
year the price shal corne up to a level with
the genieral market price.

240

SENATE

As I understand the position taken by my
honourable friend <Hon. Mr. Bureau) in his
amendment, it is that at a certain date
licenses should no longer be granted for the
supply of power under the contracte that the
companies have made. Arn I right in that?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I thouglit the
amendment read that after 19,35 those licenses
shoulit corne under the control of Parliament.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
les, after 1935.
Hon. Mr. DJANDURAND: I have not the
amendment under rny hand.
Rt. Hon. Sir GEO. E. FOSTER: The supply, then, would depend on whether a license
is granted or not. There would be in the
background an autliorîty which rnight either
refuse a license or renew it, and that authorîty,
I uinderstand, is Parliament. Now, if my
idea on that point is correct, we are sirnply
transferring a parliamentary decision on that
question from 1929 to 1935. When that year
cornes Parliament rnust take up and decide
the question whether or not those licenses
shall be granted any longer. It -would have
the power to grant or refuse, and miglit consequently decide to refuse.
If that be the meaning of the amendrnent,
I arn opposed to it. I do not think we can
take liack a contract which has been running
for a long series of years and lias a series of
years yet to, run. We have to consider the
expenses that have heen incurred hy the purcliaser for equipment in order to utilize wliat
lie lias purchascd. We mnust remem-ber that
these contracts affect very large interests in
large and small communities. If a purchaser
on the other side od the line fulfilis lis contract, and does not break bis agreernent, I
do not think that Parliarnent lias a moral
riglit, though it may have a legal right, to,
disrupt that whole series of services by refusing renewal of the license on the plea that
the purcliaser is getting power at a lower
rate than it costs hiere, and tliat this works
to our disadvantage in competition between
this side and the other.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Honourable gentlernen, I understand tliat the actual position is
this, tliat leases of power that have been
rnade hy different companies covering exports
to the United States are subject, in several
cases at least, to, licenses being granted liy
Order in Council for the export to be continued, and those licenses are supposed to lie
granted frorn year to, year.
I understand that the cobject of the arnendment is to substitute for the power of the
Governor in Council that of Parliarnent it.
Hon. Sir GEORGE POSTER.

self. In order to be able to render a judgrnent on the question raised by the axnendment I think it necessary, so far at least as
I amn concerned, to be properly inforrned as
to, tlie terrns and conditions of ecd contract.
For that reason I have asked for information in this respect. It is only after liaving
acquired tliat knowledge that we shall be
able individually to forrn a proper judgrnent
as to -Whletlier it is fair or not to substitute
the power of Parliarnent for that of the Governor in Council. It was with that view that
I suggcsted that the rnatter rest umtil we
could take full cognizance of tlie inforrnation
which. the lionourable leader of the Government lias placed on Hansard to-day. For my
part I feel that I have not proper in-formation
on whicli to base a judgment on the arncndment of the honourable gentleman frorn La
Salýle (Hon. Mr. Bureau).
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: Honourable gentlemen, perhaps tlie lionourable leader of the
Government could inform, us whether there
is flot a distinct difference between one lease
and the others that are dealt witli in this
legiation. I was given to understand, from
wliat 1 believe to be a reliable source, that
before 1907, when there was no legislation on
tlie subI oct, a certain company in Ontario
made a contract for a hundred years with an
American concern, and wlien that company
wvas bought by the Hydro Commission of
Ontario a concession was rnade whcreby tlie
term. of a hundred years was reduccd to fifty,
sorne of those fty having now expired. Tliat
15 a striking example of how improvident very
long terma contracts are ia a country that is
developing as Canadýa is; but the position of
that cornpany is very different from that of
corporations that liad contracts from year to
year to send a certain quantity of current to
the United States. I think the discussion
would be clarified if we knew dpfinitely
wliether these other contracts are on ail fours
withi that one.
Hon. Mr. DÂNDURAND:
I believe the
honourable gentleman would get ail the information lie desires in the statement wbicli
I have just produceýd, and which will go on
Hansard.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: That would lead
one to support the suggestion just made,
that we risc and report progress, so that we
inay have an opportunity of looking over that
informatinn.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Does the honourable gentleman move that?

MAY 21, 1929
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN: I move that the
Conrniittee ýrise, report progress, and ask leave
to sit again.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Honourable gentlemen, I do flot knaw whether or flot I misunderstoad the right honourable the junior
member for Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George
E. Foster) when, he made his statement. I
do flot believe he intended to misrepresent
me, and he did not exactly do so, but the
impression that I got was that he thought
the object of my ametidment was to put an
end to certain contracts which ought to be
respected because they were entered into before the legislation of 1907 was passed, requiring the taking out of licenses for -the export
of power.
The objeet of my amendment was not that
at ail. There is a Bill befoee Parliament
stating that the law wh.ich was passed in 1907
shahl be partly ineffective. In 1907 we entrusted to the Governor in Council the authority to issue licenses for the export of fluide
or eleetrie power. That authorityr has been
exercised ever sin-ce 1907. Last year, 1928,
the first Bill that was presented before the
House of Commue provided that hereafter
ail licenses should be granted by Parliament,
and that all regulations under wihich those
licenises would be issued shouki be made by
Parliament, excepting licenses ia9ued before
the lst of April, 1928.
That first Bill was modified. In it there
was a clause providing that nothing in the
Bill should affect the righta of the provinces,
or the rights of those holding licenses under
the Act. When the Bill was read the second
time the only explanation given was that
Power had become such an important and
valuable natural asset that it wa.s time to
take away from the (lovernor in Council and
give to Parliarnent the authority to issue
licenses, and regulate the export.
Here is the whole theory, the whole priaciple involved; nothing el8e. Are we to take
from the Governor in Council the authority
to regulate thie exportation of power, of
electricity, and give it to Parliament, or are
we not? That is the only ground on which
I want the discussion to proceed in this
Chamber. If it is in the initerest of the
country to take this authority away from the
Governor in Council, I arn in favour of that;
but I want to know whether it is or flot. If
it is ag-ainst the interest of the country that
the Governor in Council should exercise that
authority, I d'o not want to be a party to
continuing such an evil. If, on the other hand,
it is good for one part and flot for another,
I want to be able to justify my actions and

241

vote in this matter, and to, know the reasons
that have actuated the promoter of this Bill.
1 arn not going to discuss the question now,
because 1 wan.t to get more information. I
may change my views, as I have said right
along. 1 do not object to this situation for
any specific purpose, but onl-y as a matter of
duty and justice. If it is wrong now that
the Governor in Council should continue to
administer that Act, I arn going to vote to
see that the authority is taken away from
him and given to Parliament. On the other
hand, is there any reason why we should have
two separate and independent authorities
exercising control and aclministering the one
law? I want to know, because I çrant to
be just and fair to ail on this suibjeet. That
is ail I have to say for the present.
I have no idea, and neyer had any, of
trying to repudia-te any contract, and the
ametidment does not say that any contraet
shahl be repudiated. Parliament ought to be
as wise as the Governor in Council; but if it
is the wish of Parliament that the Governor
in Council continue- to issue certain licenses,
let us have the courage to say so.
Progress waa reported.

Hon. Mr. BUREAU: I have spoken to the
Minister of Justice about the amendments,
and they have met with bis approval.

Sections 3, 4 and 5 were agreed to.
On section 6-speeýdy trials of indictable

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I would ask the

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My honourable friend will flnýd it in the marginal explanatory note.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Jurisdiction is given
to the .iudges cf the sessions of the peace, or
to any district magisteate.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGIIBY:

Who is the

district magisteate?

Heu. Me. BUREAU:

In cur province we

have maiistrates who administer criminal
jîustice, aud civ il justice also, within the
jiidicial district as creatcd by the statute. They
are provincial appointees.
Section 6 was ag-recd te.
On section 7-Removal of feeble minded or
mentally deficient prisoner:
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: 1 had occasion Vo explain this the other day. At the present
time the Governor in Council may exeecise
his power to transfer a prisoner from a penal
institution ouly if that prisener is found insane. The purpose of this provision is to take
care of juvenile offenders who may be in a
penal institution, and wlao, without beîng insane, are found te be mentally deficient.
Upon sufficient cvidence that the convictcd
person is net in bis right mmnd, it gives tbe
Governor in Council power te issue lais warrant for the prisener to be taken eut of the
penal institution and put into a mental hospital. WNehave sucb an institution in the
Province of Quebec.

Hon. NMr.BUREAU.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My honourable friend will find that only the underlined
words are new.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: The object of the
section is Vo give concurrent jurisdiction to
justices of tbe peace. Suppose that in a
rural municipality there are none of the
judicial officers enumerated except a mayor
and a justice of tbe peace, and some police
officer wants te lay a charge tbat some one is
keeping a gaming bouse, or a disorderly bouse.
Under the Act as it stands, be cannot go Vo
a justice of the peace te make complaint
if tbe mayor is in the municipality. The
difficulty is tbat for political or otber reasons

the mayor will sometimes refuse Vo take the
complaint, and the police officer bas to go Vo
a neigbbouring municipality te get a stipendiary magistrate or some other magistrate Vo,
authorize a searcb. While the police officer
is away the offenders are warned and take
means te cover their tracks, and therehy avoid
arrest and punishament. This section is te
allow the police officer Vo lay bis complaint

before a justice of the peace altbougb the
mayor may be present in the municipality.

Hon. Mr. McMEANS:

IV scems to me

that this is an extremely radical change fromn
the presenV criminal law. I do net know oif

THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. BUREAU moved the third reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.
INTERNAL ECONOMY AND CONTINGENT ACCOUNTS
SECOND REPORT

Hon. Mr. DANIEL moved concurrece in
the Second Report of the Standing Committee on Internal Economy and Contingent
Accounts.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this Report
is laid before you simply that you may adopt
the recommendations made by the Civil Service Commissioners. For two or three years
the Senate has asked the Civil Service Commission to adjust the salary of the chief of
the Stationery Division. This year, while they
have not acceded to our request in so far
as the amount is concerned, they have recommended that his salary be increased to the
extent of $120 a year.
The purpose of the second recommendation is to re-establish the position of Clerk
of English Minutes of Proceedings and Journals. Honourable gentlemen will remember
that a few years ago we had a Clerk of English Minutes of Proceedings, who resigned,
and that after his resignation this work was
amalgamated with that of the Clerk of the
Committees. The latter official, with the
growth of the work in the past few years,
especially in connection with the Divorce
Committee, has been unable to attend to the
work of the English Minutes, and the Civil
Service Commissioners, who through error disestablished the position of Clerk of English
Minutes, now recommend that it be reestablished, with the consent of the Senate.
The motion was agreed to.
THIRD REPORT

Hon. Mr. DANIEL moved concurrence in
the Third Report of the Standing Committee
on Internal Economy and Contingent Accounts.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this Report contains four items. The first has to
78600-18j

243

do with the compensation of the Chief Clerk
of Committees, and increases from $4,140 to
$4,440, in two instalments, the amount which
he can be paid. There is also a recommendation that the compensation of the Postmaster and the Assistant Postmaster of the
Senate be adjusted in order to place them
on the same basis as similar officials of the
House of Commons. In fact, the same reason applies to the recommendation regarding
the salary of the Chief Clerk of Committees.
The third recommendation has reference
to the Speaker's steward, and gives him a
slight increase in pay. The Speaker's steward
has been at his maximum for some years.
His services have been satisfactory, and it is
recommended that the maximum be increased
to $1,620, by means of three yearly increases
of $60. I may say that His Honour the
Speaker has recommended this item.
The fourth item in the Report has to do
with Miss O'Brien, a stenographer who has
been in the service for, I think, about seventeen years. The purpose of it is to raise her
from Grade 3 to Grade 4.
The motion was agreed to.
FOURTH REPORT

Hon. Mr. DANIEL moved concurrence in
the Fourth Report of the Standing Committee on Internal Economy and Contingent
Accounts.
He said: This Report simply approves of
the officials mentioned receiving their regular
statutory allowance. They cannot do so without the approval of the Senate.
The motion was agreed to.
CRIMINAL CODE (FINES AND FORFEITURES) AMENDMENT BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. MeMeans, for Hon.
Mr. Beaubien, the Senate went into Committee on Bill P7, an Act to amend the
Criminal Code (Fines and Forfeitures).
Hon. Mr. Gordon in the chair.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Mr. Chairman, I
think the form of this amendment is rather
uncertain. It says:
The sentence may further direct that the fine
shall be paid by instalments. or within a certain
period. or that the person so -convicted shall,
until payment of the fine, be admitted to bail.
I think it would be better to strike out
the words, "or that the person so convicted
shall, until payment of the fine, be admitted
to bail." If this amendment were agreed to,

244

SENATE

it would mean that a :man would pay bis
fine either within a certain flxed period or by
instalments, and that hie would flot be imaprisoned unless the fine was not paid.
I move tbat those words 'be struek eut.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Arn I to understand that hie would be subjeet to a fine which
lie need pay only by instalments, and that
hie would nt ho field to bail?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Hie ivould flot be
imprisoned in the meantime, because hie would
have a certain time within which to pay Up.
Hon. Mr. GRJEISBACH: He is subject to
a fine payable in instalments. W'hat security
lias hie given for this period of li'berty?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Hie bias flot given
any; but if hie dýoes not pýay his fine hie iwill
be re-arrestcd and imprisoned.
Hon. Mr. GRIE.SBACH: I do flot think
we should proceed in the absence of the
honourable gentleman fromn Montarville (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien). I want ta ask, some furtber
questions.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Il too have seme
questions to ask.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: My understanding
was that the convicted person would be
sentenced to the payment of a fine, i11 default
of which bie would serve a certain imprisonment; that bie would be given, a certain time
within wbicb to pay the fine, in instalments.
I underistand also tbat in the meantime bie
would be on 'bail, 'but my bonourable friend
(Hon. Mr. MoMeans) says this is not so.
Then I do not understand tbe meaning of the
clause. If this were se, I was going te a.sk
the promoter of the Bill what would happen
if a 'man paid haîf bis fine and could. lot or
did not psy any more. Would he 'be required
to pay the remaining portion of bis fine? If
bie paid baîf the fine and absconded bais bail,
what would bis security bave to pay? Without that information I cannot vote for this
amendment at ail.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: It seems to me to
be very simple.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: It is not sO
simple to me as it is to the bonourable gentleman from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. McMeans).
It was the objection wbich bias just been
urged by my honourable friend from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbacb) that made me ask
the promoter of tbe Bill, wben it came up
flrst, to lot it stand I do not think tbe
phraseology of the aumend.runt is sufficiently
clear. It reads:
Hoii. Mr. McMEANS.

The sentence may further direct

thiat the

fine shall be paid 'by ins-talmnents. or -%itl)ii

a certain period, or that the persan se convicted gshall, uintil paymient of thse fine, be
admitted to bail.
I understand that part of it, but it seems
te me that tbe objectionable featuro of tbe
Bill is týhat tbere is ne provision i0 case of
default in instalments. What will be (100e to
the convicted person if hie pays three or four
nstalments and fails on the flfth or sixth?
I am flot eppesing the spirit of the Bill. I
amn sorry tba.t the honourable gentleman w'ho
pre'posed it (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) is net bere;
I did flot know until nîow that hoe had Îone to
England. I amn in faveur of the spirit of the
amendmenýt, because it is a bardship thal a
man sbould be put inýto jail, 'to ho kormt there
fer a per.iod up to five years, until the expiry
of bis sentence, when if hoe had been able te
procure the necessary money te psy the fine
hoe would bave been at liberty. And I do
net think thaýt keep.ing haim in jail under those
circumstances would tend te reforma him.
Perhaps it would ho a case wbere the punishment would net meet the crime, becau;e tliore
would exist in the popular mind the knowledge
of the fact that hoe could have been at liberty
if bie could have paid the fine. Wben the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Beau-bien) was
introducing tbis Bill hie gave statisties of the
number of convictions in Canada during 1927,
and eut of the total of those who were given
the option of paying a fine instead of geing
te prison a very large percentage were mrprisoned because cf inability to psy the fine.
1 think the Bill shouki stand and ho redrafted.
Perhaps it should stand over for
another year, unless somne honourahle mensber has been left in charge cf it and bas power

In my opinion, bhe phraseology
more piractical.
of the amendrnent is euch that the Bill could
not bo made te ýwork properly in cases of continued defaults. There could net ho- mucb
harni done if tho Bill were all'ôwed te stand.
0f course, if the Government assumes the
responsibihity of puttimg the amendaient
through, and festers iýt in the absence of the
real father, 1 arn willing te accept the explana tiens cf the godfather.
Hon. Mr. M.cMEANS: I do not se-e that
tbe amendment would result in any great
difficulty in actual practice.
It
would
autherize the trial judge te order a convicted
person te psy a fine in instalments inste-ad cf
ini cash.
If the judge flned the accused $500,
he ceuld order that the fine be paid in
montbly instalments of $100, say, if in bis

245

MAY 21, 1929
opinion the circumstances of the accused warranted that. 1 do net agree wjth the contention of my honourablýe leader on this side
that it would be difficuit to give effeet to the
spirit of the amendment.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: What would
happen if the accused defaulted on the second
or third instalment?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: He would be put
into jail again, whether he defaulted on the
second, the thýird, or any other instalment,
If you buy a piano on
even the last one.
the instalment plan you do nlot become the
owner uintil you have paid the very last instalment; the instrument can be taken away
from the purchaser if the last instalment is
not paid when due.
So, in the case of an
unfortunate person who had paid some instalments on lis fine, hie would have to go
back to jail again if hie defaulted on any
payment.
Hon. Mr. LEWI.S: Might it nlot be left
to the discretion of the magistrate what
arrangement should be made in such cases?
If the magistrate is given discretion to allow
the accused to pay a fine by instalments, why
sh-ould hie not be given complete discretion?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: If the language
of the Bill is wide enough for that.
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: I think the Bill is
improýperly drawn. I agree with the honourable leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Willoughby) that perhaps it would be as welI to
have the Bill stand over until next year. After
ail, the proposed change ie to a considerable
extent a matter for the attorneys-general of
the different provinces, and I think they
should be consulted before the Bill becomes
law.
Many difficulties migbt arise in the
working out of this amendment.
Suppose a
man had paid four instalments of a fine and
defaulted on the fiftb. Would the Crown refun'd him t.he four payments he had made and
have him committed to jail for the full term
of his sentence?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:

Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
gentlemen, I asked the Department of Justice
for its views on this Bill. Like honourable

members who have spoken on the subjeet,
the Department felt that there was something
to be said in favour of the point of view sO
eioquently expressed a few days ago by the
honourable gentleman who promoted the
Bill (Hon. Mr. Beaubien), but befure finally
giving an opinion it desired to know the
I
criticism, if any, that might be offered.
was told that if there ivas any hesitancy in
supporting the measure the Department of
Justice would have the Bill forwarded to the
various provincial attorneys-general, along
with the Bill that was proposed by the hionourable gentleman from Hamilton (Hon. Mr.
Lynch-Staunf on), which has been withdrawn
If the consensus of
for the time being.
opinion is that this Bill shouid go to the other
House, the Department will, of course, have
to examine it.
I should like to
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
say to the honourable gentleman that if I
wanted to bring about any reform in the law,
or any change that would be conducive to
the welfare of the people, the last place 1
would go to would be the Department of
Justice, and the iast people I would consuit
would be the judges of the courts. That is
the result of my experience.
When I had before this House the Bill for
the revision of sentences and the Bill providing for appeals in criminal cases these measures were sent to the Department of Justice
and the judges, and three-quarters of the
latter reported against them; but the legislation was passed and to-day these laws are
receiving the commendation of the people,
and even of judges who formerly opposed
them.
Progress was reported.
OPIUM AND NARCOTTO DRUG BILL
1kZECOND READING.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 4, an Act to amend and consolidate the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, during
the last Session of Parliament Canada ratified
the International Opium Convention, and, a
sufficiently large number of other nations
having also ratified, the convention came into
effect in September last. Under article 2 of
that convention, Canada undertakes to review
periodically, and to strengthen, as required,
the laws relating to the control of narcoties.
Consequently the present would appear to be

246

SENATE

an appropriate time to bring the Canadian
Act up to date. A great many copies of the
Act are required for distribution to physicians,
druggists and others in the ordinary course
of administration, and it is felt that as the
amendments proposed are somewhat numerous, it would be ipreferable to re-enact the Act
as a whole, so that there can be no confusion
in the minds of the public as to what the law
on the subject really is.
The Bill was considered carefully in the
other House and it comes to us after having
been examined by a special committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

The following statement shows the consistent and regular increase which the revenues
of the Harbour Commissioners have maintained
over a period of years:
1921. .

The business of the port is constantly

acoordingly. I need only cite the number of
ocean-going vessels, which has gradually
ircreased since 1923, as follows:

MONTREAL HARBOUR LOAN BILL
SECOND READING

He said: Honourable gentlemen, we passed
yesterday several Bills to empower various
Harbour Commissions to borrow funds for the
development of their respective ports. The
present Bill, which contains the standard
clauses ordinarily found in such measures,

to the Haibour Commissioners of Montreal
to borrow $10,000,000 for the construction of

Hon. Mr. McDOUGALD:

They have no

right to borrow privately.

Hon.

Mr.

WILLOUGHBY:

Honourable

gentlemen, not many advances to the Montreal Harbour Board have come up in my
time. I have never found any disposition to
oppose them. We are all proud af the devel-

MAY 21, 1929
apment of the haxrbour. I have no doubt we
ahl think it is properly managed at ail times,
and perhaps particularly at the present period.
It is a national harbour from many points of
view. It is doing what some other harbours,
unfortunately, have not, been able to do; it is
paying its way-not only paying the interest,
but providing for a sinking fund. We have
had less fortunate experiences elsewhere, as we
ahl know; and I hope that we did not yesterday lay the ground for any other unfortunate
experience such as we have had with some
other harbours.
I have no objection whatever to this grant,
for I want to see the harbour of Montreal
made the most efficient possible. We want it
to be not merely equal, but superior, to anything in the United States, able ta hanidle not
only the merchandise that goes through it today, but ever increasing quantities. We want
it to become a great outhet for the grain and
other agricultural produets of the West. We
hear a great deal to-day about congestion, and,
as we know, there is congestion thùis year, but
I do nlot think that Montreal is as mnuch
affected by it as some other ports.
I do not know how the gentlemen of Montreal connected with this Commission, and the
citizens of Montreal generally, are speculating
as to what may be the effect an their future
of the development of the harbour at
Churchill. They already know, as we a'll do,
the extent to which the shipment ai prairie
products via Vancouver has grown. That port
was scouted almoet as indignantly-I might
say, as fiippantly-in some of the objections
by honourable menibers of this House, as was
the harbour of Nelson, but it has made good,
and we of the West are proud that Vancouver
Harbour is growing steadily. We an this side
ai the House readily assented yesterday to
the granting of any further moneys necessary
to complete the facilities ait Vancouver and
bring themn up ta date, se that they may be
adequate ta the trade which that port is
doing.
I have no objection ta this grant ta the
Montreal Harbour. There being no other
way ai raising the maney, as I thaught there
might be, the Commissioners have corne back
ta the comman banker ai Canada ta get
money ta enable them ta, carry on.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
gentleman will realize tha>t, under the system
ai financing which is in operatian, the money
can be obtained at a much 'lawer rate.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: That was perhaps the -reasan a solvent borrower had for
coming here.

CON8IDERED IN COMMrrTEE

Senate weiit into Committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Robinson in the Chair.
Sections 1 and 2 were agreed to.
On section 3-interest on debentures during
construction may be charged to capital account:
Hon. Mr. MaCORMIGK: What period of
time would 'be considered necessary for the
expenditure of this money?
Hou. Mr. DANDURAND: Three years.
Hon. Mr. MeC ORMICK: During that
period there would be no interest at ail paid.
The Bill says:
3. During the period of construction of the
works referred to in the preceding section, the
inýterest payable on the debentures deposited
with the Minister of Finance and Receiver
General under the provisions of this Act in
respect of the construction of such works shail
he deemed te be money required to enable the
Corporation ta construet the said works and to
be a part of the cost of construction thereof,
and the said interest may be paid out of the
said sum of ten million dollars; the period of
construction herein referred to shaîl begin on
the day when the first boan is made on account
of the said construction, and shaîl terminate on
such date as the Governor in Council shahl fix
and determine.
Hon. M.r. M-cDOUGALD: Perhaps I can
explain that if I just outlîne the procedure.
This Bill prov.iding $10,000,000 is only an
enabling measure. When we require money
for sheds at Montreal, for example, the plans
are prepared. Suppose it is a M50,000 shed.
Tlhe plans are sent ta the Department, whose
engineer.s must pass on the plans and on the
cost of that shed. Then we are authorized
by Order -in Council to proceed with the con-

SENATE

Hon. Mr. GORDON: Wouid it not be
wise also to think of the littie chidren in
Winnipeg who were deprived of even their
milk at that tirne? These men had no sympathy for them.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourabie
friend will remember that that was a passing
event; that it iasted but a few days. I arn
quite sure that if he were to corne into, contact with any of the particular cases that are
now bcing revicwed his heart would be
softened. I arn quite sure that if rny honourable friend went among these men and learned
what they have passed through during the
last ten years, it would make ail the difference
in the world to, his opinion.
I desire to draw the attention of rny honourable friend to the fact that, frorn a social
point of view, our nation is in a very healthy
condition. 1 believe that in vcry few countries in the world is there so littie class consciousness as in Canada. The relationship
arnong the varinus classes in this country
is rnost agrecable and satisfactory. Ail this
is due to the hurnan sentiment and the spirit
of fair deaiing that permeate the nation.
Under these conditions I wonder whether it
does not behoove this Charnber, which in the
mmnd of the public represents espeeiaily the
upper classes, to join with the representatives
of the people in the Commons and say, after
ten years, that we will establish the principle
that those rnen who were paid a srnaller
saiary than they were entitled to receive for
the services which they rendered should be
given what they earned. I arn quite sure
that after the strike the employers in the
city of Winnipeg paid to the very rnen who
ha.d loft thern the sarne salaries that they
had paid them before. Unskilled labour fails
into a general category, and the question has
been raised arnong the iabouring elernent
throughout Canada whether we should nlot
foiiow suit. Men who have studied the situation have corne to the conclusion that an injustice has been done and that it is the duty

ploy,ýers of labour, and 1 doubt very much
whether any employer in the land, upon taking 'back empioyees to do the same ciass of
work that they had been doing before, wouid
delay ten years before giving thcrn proper
compensation.
Hlon. F. L. BEIQUE: Would the honourable gentleman allow me to put a question or
two? It ;s possible that the first part of his
rernarks covered what 1 arn about to askc, but
I wan't to understand the facts. I txnderstand
that there were two Orders in Council rernoving certain employees of the Post Office Departonent, the first order being passed in July
of 1919, and the second in Novernber of 1919.
Hon.

Mr.

DANDURAND.

That is not
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
exacetly right. My honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) who was in the Cabinet at
the tirne cou]d probably give the explanation.
I believe the first order rernoved the men
and the second allowed thern to coane back
under certain conditions.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I arn rea ding frorn the
Bill. It refers to:
-former ennployees of the postal or railway
mnail service of Canada who were removed froin
suich service hy Orders in Council P.C. 89/1474,
dated the fifteenth day of July, 1919, and P.C.
2224, dated the third day of November, 1919....

Hon. G. D. ROBERTSýON: I can g-*ve xny
honourable friend the facts surrounding those
Orders. About the 22nd of May, about ten
days after the strike commenced, the Goveroment was irnportuned by the nitizens -of
Winnipeg for the restoration, of postal service,
whielh had been interrupted frorn the beginrning of the strike. Two of the Ministers of the
Government of that day visited Winnipeg,
examined into the situation, and carne to the
conclusion that the service rnust be speedýily
restored. Urgent requests were made for the
summrary dismissal of ail postal ernployees
who had participated in the syrnpathetic
strike. That rcquest wvas not cornplied with,
but everyibody was notified-the ernployees
dfirectlv by the Pnstmaster, and the public
throughi the n.ewspapers -that the Governrnent
would undertake to restore the service on the
26th of May, if my nernory is correct, to reinstate without question every postal employec
who had participated in the strike but who
returned for service 'by noon of that day,
and to, forget the incident. Sorne 8ý2 of the
three hundred odd employees-not 416, as
stated in the explanatory notes attached to
the Bill returned. The others did not. In
order to continue giving postal service in
Winnipeg, the Governent proceeded to f11l
the' vacan-cies by emplnoying some of the
numcrous applicants. almost ail of whorn were
returned soldiers. *Subsequently, in July, 1919,
nearlv two months afterwards, the Treasury
Board brought in a recommendation containin', the narnes of those who had left the service and wh'o, the Government had said, could
flot return. In the folloýwing November the
then Postrnaster General, an honourable gentlemnan who now sits in this flous-e (Mon. Mr.
Blondin), brought in a amaîl supplernentary
list of about nine narnes that had been
omitted fromn the original. That is the explanation of the two Orders in Couneil named
in this Bill. Then, on June 4, 1920, after
months of consideration and some inquiry, an
Order in Counci], which is not mentioned in

MAY 21, 1929
the Bill, was issued giving the Civil Service
Commission authority to re-employ striking
postal workers who made application for reinstatement and who complied with Civil
Service regulations.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The facts are, as I
surmised, that by two Orders in Council
passed on different dates, one in July, 1919,
and the other in November of the saie year,
a certain number of employees were removed
from the service.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I understand from my
honourable friend that in the year 1920 a
certain number of employees-presumably
those who are dealt with in this Bill-were
reinstated.
Hon. Mr. ROBERSTON: No; re-employed.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I desire ta know
whether they were re-employed as members
of the classes to which they belonged formerly.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: They were employed
ta do work of an inferior class?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Yes.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: And it is on account
of that they were paid a salary inferior to
the salary which they would have been given
had they been reinstated in their former
classes?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: And now the abject
of the Bill is to treat them as if they had
been re-employed as members of the classes
ta which they formerly belonged.
I am
afraid that the Bill does net make that clear,
because it says:
-and who were subsequently re-employed and
are now in the said postal or railway mail service, shall be paid for services actually performed as from the date of their re-employment at the rates of remuneration paid to other
employees for similar services.
My reading of the Bill as drafted is that
these men are to be paid the salaries for the
classes of services which they have been
rendering, and I am afraid that the object of
the Government, as I understand it, is not
carried out by this Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It seems te me
that the intention is fairly clearly expressed
in the words which my honourable friend has
read. Theyshall be paid for services actually performed
as froin the date of their re-employment at the
rates Of remuneration paid to other employees
for similar services.

251

Hon. Mr. BEEQUE: I would draw the attention of the honourable gentleman to the
fact that "similar services" means the services
whiah they have been rendering and which
may not be services of the classes to which
they belonged.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No; I believe
my honourable friend is in error. The remuneration is to be the same as that "paid
to other employees for similar services."
The work of the committee of inquiry, composed of the Assistant Deputy of the Postmaster General and the appointee of the Civil
Service Commission, will be to take the list
kept in the Winnipeg Post Office, for instance,
and find with whom the men in question have
been working during the last ten years and
the work which they have been doing from
day to day. The Committee's task will be
easy. If the men were working as letter
carriers they will be paid the same rate as
their brother letter carriers were paid for
the same time, while those who have been
postal helpers will be paid the salary of
that class. Whatever positions they occupied,
they were working in a certain class with
certain men whose names will appear in the
list, and it will be easy to determine the proper
classification. If it happened that any of these
men were receiving the proper salary for the
class of work they were doing, they would be
entitled to no extra remuneration; but if,
for instance, they were doing the work of
letter carriers and were being .paid as postal
helpers, then they would be entitled to the
difference in salary.
This is the explanation which was given
in the other House by the Prime Minister,
and it was accepted by the other side of that
House as a very clear explanation of the
purpont and effect of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Does that mean that
these men are really going to be reinstated
and that they will be paid at the rate they
were formerly receiving, notwithstanding that
they are working in a lower class?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
If a man was
put into a class lower than the one in which
he formerly was, and if he worked in that
lower class, he will be paid the salary appertaining te the liower class; but if he was doing the work in a higher class than that for
which he was being paid, then he was not
receiving what he was entitled to, and that
is what has happened in very many cases.
Many of these men were put at the bottom
of the lowest class, because their places had
been filled by returned soldiers and others.

SENATE

252

The men provided for in this Bill took
whatever positions were assigned to them and
were paid a salary lower than that which was
proper for the work they were doing. The
reason for their being given the higher classes
of work is quite natural. Here were 96 men
-I sav 96 because that is the number stated
in the explanation atýtached to the Bil-who
probablv had Leen in the service for periods
of from three to fifteen years. They were
experien.ced, and they were taken back as new
employees, while in many cases the mon above
them, who had been engaged to fill the positions that the strikers had left, were without
experience. It is not to be wondered at that,
although the se experienced men were placed
at the very bottom of their classifications,
they promptly were given higher positions
which their experience enabled them to fill.
That is where the grievances began, because
they were paid as postal helpers while they
werc doing work which would entitIe them
to 100 or S200 more a year. Those who remained as postal helpers and did that work
and hav-e been paid on that basis, are not
cntitled to any further remuneration, but those
who were paid on that basis while they were
doing work of a higher class are ent.itled to
compensation.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: May I ask another
question of the honourable leader of this
House? As I understand it, these men came
back as employees at the lowest grade, postal
helpers?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: Am I right in understanding further that some of them were put
to work as letter carriers and some as sorters?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. TANNER:
Which
higher grades in the service?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

would

be

Yes.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: I should like to know
how they get into those higher grades. Does
the Civil Service Act provide for the grading
of officials? Are they required to pass examinations? Is there any course through which
an employee must go in order to pass from
the position of postal helper to those of sorter
and of letter carrier, or can the Postmaster in
any district, of his own will, promote an employee? If the men are required to pass certain civil service requirements before being
promoted, were those requirements complied
with in the cases of these men, or was the law
wholly disregarded? I do not know these
things and I am simply asking for information.
Hon.

Mr.

DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I stand to be
corrected, but the information I have is that
they were realppointed under an Order in
Council. It was at first thought that since the
Civil Service Act had been disregarded or had
not been complied with, the Order in Council
had been passed under the War Measures Act;
and this was the information expressed elsewhere, although with some hesitancy, I will
admit. But there was an Order in Council.
A question has ariscn as to the legil
justification for that Order in Coincil. but tho
present Bill does not deal with that situation.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: The Order in Council, as I understand it, simply provided that
the men might come back into the service as
postal helpers. The Order in Council did not
say that they would be promoted, did it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend the ex-Minister of Labour (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) might read us the Order in Council. As a matter of fact, though these men
were paid as postal helpers, in very many
instances they were called upon by the officials immediately over them to do the very
work that they had been doing formerly.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I understand that,
but had those superior officials the right to do
that?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the facts.

We are facing

But had they the
Hon. Mr. TANNER:
right to do that? In doing that, were they
not .disregarding the Civil Service Act?
I have not
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
gone into the question deeply enough to
express an opinion on that.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Were not these men
promoted ahead of other men-including those
who were taken on at the time of the strike
-who were entitled to the promotion?
Hon. Mr. BUREAU:

Of course my
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable friend will realize that hundreds
of war veterans were employed. The situation proved again the truth of the old
dictum that "necessity knows no law." It
ocompelling
was probably because of that
necessity that the Postmaster at Winnipeg
did draw on those men to serve him in
positions in which they had served before.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I do not want my
honourable friend to form the opinion that
I am opposed to paying these men. I have

253

an open mmnd on the subject, and my purpose
in making these inquiries la merely ta get
information. As 1 understand it, these nien,
who lef t the service af their own free will,
]ater came back of their own free will and
were re-employed as postal helpers; and then
somebody, without lawful authority, niaved
them up into higher grades, where they continued ta work; and because they warked in
those higher grades we are now asked ta
pay theni the wages that are ordinarily paid
f or the work they did.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: From the opinion
advanced by the honourable gentleman froni
De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique), I would take
it that the intention was ta raise the pay af
these men so that they would be getting the
saine wages as others, who had flot left the
service, and by whose aide they worked. But
after having listened ta the explanatian of
the honourable leader of the House (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand), I was given the impresalan that these men were really being reinstated.

treatment from any person, they could have
had recourse to this Parliament to obtain redress. They wene absolutely dilerent, therefore,
from any other employees. When the general
strike was called in England we saw that the
Post Office employees did not respond. That
service is one of the necessary cogs or parts
of the modern machinery of civilization, and
I should say if any class in the world should
not go on strike, a sympathetic strike, it
would be the Post Office employees.
Knowing all that, they went out with their eyes
open.
They were participants, or in any
event were overt sympathizers.
I am told
that the plans in Winnipeg were absolutely
revolutionary-plans to prevent the children
of Winnipeg from getting milk and other
food necessary for their sustenance; plans to
prevent them from getting water and ether
necessarirs, which I will not detail, for the
reason which I have just stated.
I therefore say that these men stand in a
peculiar relation to the public.
If some revolutionary strike were in progress -in the city
of Ottawa and the permanent staff of the
Houses of Parliament all joined hands with
those strikers and said, "We will net function
or carry on here," and did this without any
cause except to show sympathy with the
strikers, we know what would follow.
That
strike in Winnipeg was not an ordinary strike
at all; thcy did not profess that it was an
ordinary strike; they professed to revolutionize
our modern society, te revolutionize absolutely the relations of employer to employee,
and capital to labour. They were te set up a
new heaven and a new earth, and this old
heaven and this old earth that seemed to be
good enough for us were to disappear.
Now, what didithese gentlemen do? Notification was given them, after they had gone out,
to come back and serve again. A small percentage of them came back after some tcn
days or more, and they re-ngaged for public
service. I subnit that in any event they should
haxve becn ce-engagedin the lowest chi'ssification. in which tlire are many positions in the
postal service. Tliey carne on, and they took
a iw contract with their eves opcn, with no
compulsien on them from anyboiv in the
Government, or anybedy reprcsenting the
Government, but simply the option of coming
back. Without knowing the facts I venture to
say that those positions could have been
filled-perhaps not all at once, or not by
experts or highly trained people, bu: by green
hands, in a very short time-once ià was known,
as it was pretty well known at that time, Iliat
the strike was going to peter out and would
net accomplish the ends which the strikers had
in view. There would have been no difficulty
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

in filling those jobs ait the end of ten days
with men who would come on to the staff
urnder the ordinary requirements.
Those men re-engaged under no misrepresentation or compulsion, but of their own free
agency, and now we are asked te take
approximately $:125,000 and hand it over te
those gentlemen who banded themselves together to throw society in Winnipeg into
disorder. When they came back they were
re-engaged on the condition that they should
begin at the minimum af their classification,
but, with the same obligations towards the
public and the Post Office. Now, after ten
years, they ask 'to be compensated with a large
amount of money because time, the healer,
has intervened, and we are expected to be
generous. We are asked to be sympathetic

Io not remember exaetly how the honourable
leadier of the House stated it, but it devolved
upon us to show the proper synpathy for
another stratun of society-I think that is the
way he put it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
outside.

As it appears

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: From their point
of view. Well, I think that this House, and
many other upper houses, are usually found
to be more democratic than the lower houses,
although differently constituted. I am sure
that in this louse there are many who have
been employers of labour all their lifetime,
some of them large and generous employers,
and I nam
sure that we have just us kindly a
feeling towards labour in this count'ry as is
found in the other louse, or in any oter
Chamnber in the world. I am sure we niay say
that in deference to the generous sentiments
towards iabour thiit actuate everybody in this
House. WeNwant to be just.
If those employees had belonged te a much
higher order of eniploymtent in setn department of the Civil Service here in Ottawa, requiring a better education, and perhaps having
more important duties, and they had gone out,
I very much doubt that this House would entertain for a moment a proposal to recompceise
themn after they had come back froni their
foolish escapade that had ended in futility because it could not succeed. Do honourable
gentlemen think we should have thought of
recompensing them retroactively?
Take the
employees of any Department here in Ottawa
-I will not say the Department of Justice:
if the strike had been here, they would have
been just as much warranted in going out
as employees were in Winnipeg. Would they
have got the opportunity to go back again,

MAY 21, 1929
and after ten years to come here and say,
"Forget the fact that we abandoned our jobs
in the day of peril, when you needed us to
carry on the service of the country-4orget
all that, and pay us just the -same as if we
had been doing our duty all the time"?
I am against that principle absolutely. I
do not think that this Parliament should pass
retroactive legislation of that kind. It is setting up a bad precedent. I do not think this
is a harsh attitude to take. There is no injustice when a man who is brought before
the judge and found guilty receives the punishment prescribed by the law; he deserves
it, or he would not receive it. In the present
instance there is no question of punishment;
but the employees are asking for an act of
grace on our part. We are going to reason
with them ten years after the strike is over,
and they are applying to ask us for $125,000
because, forsooth, they say, "We earned that
by the kind of work we did." If they did
earn it to some extent, they interfered with
the prospects of advancement of other clerks
in the Post Office Department.
The honourable leader of the Government
shakes his head, but if my information be
correct, I think I am warranted in that statement. In each classification there are a number of employees. For the purpose of illustration we will take the classes 3, 4, 5 and 6.
They a:l rise in grades according to the classification. Grade 4 is higher than 3, and 5 is
higher than 4. I am not following the Act
at all. Very well; men who stayed in their
employ have a right to look for promotion.
They have passed the examination for promotion from 3 into 4, from 4 into 5, and so
on. You bring back those radical strikers
to the number of 80 or 90, and put them into
the jobs. That interferes with the line of
promotion of those who remained faithful
to their duty. If my information is correct,
the salary paid to the striker who was reengaged was not the salary of a person coming into the service for the first time, or the
lowest emolument payable under the provisions of the Civil Service Act: the men reengaged were given, not the lowest salaries of
any eiployees in the Post Offce, but the lowest in their classification, which was a vastly
different thing.
I venture to say a number of them are not
entitled to very much at all. I shall not
attempt to discuss particular cases. I base
my remarks on the broader principle that this
Parliament, whose duty it is to see that the
laws of Canada are observed, should be the
last to interfere in a matter of this kind and
reward employees who abandoned the service

255

of Canada at a time of peril to this country.
Those men struck, not because of any complaints or grievances they themselves had, but
in sympathy with the Red element of
Winnipeg, whose avowed object in all that
commotion was the overturn of Canada and
the bringing in of a new system of government in this country. That is what we are
rewarding. In the end that is what will be
said in Winnipeg by that element, if you vote
this money-that they have won out in the
end. That will be said by the Reds all over
Canada, and they are numerous.
I cannot speak for organized labour at all,
but I am perfectly satisfied that all organized
labour throughout this country, or perhaps any
great proportion of organized labour, is not
Sporadic smaller
behind those people.

associaitions and bodies may be sympathetically moved now, after ten years' time, to say,
"Let this all pass." I think the organization
called the Amalgamated Civil Servants does
not represent all the postal employees of this
country.
I do net intend to make any motion at the
present time, but I am appealing to the stable

element in this House, and I am discussing
the question irrespective of politics altogether.
I hope honourable gentlemen have found, and
I think they will in the future find, that I
mix as little political element as possible,
though, like the rest of them, I have my own
political prepossessions. We in this House, I
think, are immune, se that whatever decision

we reach, it can be said that we have acted
independently of political controversy. Therefore, so far as I am personally concerned. I
think it would be setting up a wrong principle, which could be invoked against us at
all times afterwards, to reward the men who
committed a publie tragedy in the hour of
need and trial.
At 6 o'clock the Senate took recess.
The Senate resumed at 8 o'clock.
Hon. J. LEWIS: Honourable gentlemen,
it seems to me that there is some misunderstanding as to the purpose of this Bill. If
some honourable gentlemen opposite interpreted it rightly, I have interpreted it wrongly.
Some of those on the other side have spoken
with an indignation which, perhaps, would
have been justified if the Bill meant what they
saýid it meant, a Bill for rewarding certain men
for a wrong done in 1919. It seems to me that
it is not that, but a Bill for fairly paying men
for something they did long after 1919.
It might clarify the matter a little if I
were to read the first resolution that was in-

SENATE
troduced in another place, and afterwards the
amended resolution. The first was as follows:
Resoived, that it .is expedient to provide for
the readjustment of the salaries of certain
postal employees in Western Canada who were
dismissed in 1919 and subsequently re-employed,
to give then the benefit of salary they would
have received had they re-entered the service
in the class equivalent to the one they were in
when dismissed, and of subsequent salary revisions, 'and to make provision whereby certain
former employees not now in tie said service
shal'l be el'igible for re-appointment as vacanci'es oceur.
Then the amended resolution upon which
the Bill was founded is in these words:
Resolved that it is expedient to provide for
the re-adjustment of the salaries of certain
postal employees in Western Canada who were
dismissed in 1919 ;and subsequently re-employed,
to give them payment as from the date of their
re-employmoent for services actually performed
,at the rates of remuneratio-n paid to other employees for similar services.
Now, te show that that is not a mere verbal
amendment, I may refer to the attitude of
the Manitoba Free Press, which was very
strongly opposed to the original proposition,
in fact, so much so that it sent to me, and I
suppose to others, a copy of an editorial in
which the proposition was very severely denounced. But after this amended resolution
was passed, the same newspaper published an
article entitled "A Settlement on Riglit Lines."
It begins as follows:
The adoption by the Commons, without opposition or question, of the resolution dealing
wiith the case of the Winnipeg postal workers
is pretty ftair
evidence that this question has
now been put upon a basis on which it can be
dealt with on the merits of individual claims
for consider'ation. Enquiry and investigation
may show th-at in individual cases there has
heen, owing to the conditions under which the
striking employees were tak'en back into the
service, a divergency between work done and
the money paid, constituting a grievance; and
wherever such deficiency in remu'neration is
established before a competent and impartial
board of enquiry, there can be no objection
taken to additional payment.
I do not think one can charge the Manitoba
Free Press with being in alliance with the
Reds. I imagine that itwas one of the institutions which actually suffered from the actions
of the strikers in 1919. My position is simply
this: that while if is quite right to say that
we should not reward those men for something undoubtedly wrong which they did in
1919, it is a very different proposition to say
that "because you did something wrong in
1919, we are going to deprive you of the
wages which you fairly earned afterwards."
The wrong was committed, if at all, when
those men were taken back. But, they having
Hon. Mr. LEWIS.

been taken back nominally, as I understand, as
postal workers in an inferior position, and
then performing work entitled to superior pay,
if seens to me that it would be very unfair
for Parliament to make the offence of
1919 an excuse for paying men less than they
were entitled to for work done some time
aftenvards.
I am not going into allthe questions arising
at the time of the strike. I think perhaps
there is something te bc said for the fact
that at that time everybody was in the war
mood, and that all kinds of wild ideas were
in circulation. I can remember that in Toronto
there were meetings in which alil
sorts of
Bolshev'ik ideas were publicly advocated. Since
that time there have been only very sporadic
evidences of that feeling, and my impression
is that the danger is now very much less
than it was.
These men undoubtedly did wrong under
the influence of a sort of wave which was
passing over the country at the time; and
while I am not in favour of condoning what
they did, I do not know that any of us is
entitled to say that we are going to visit
upon them the full punishment for their
offences. I doubt whether there is any one of
us-certainily I am net one-who would
be willing to be judged exactly according to
what liehas donc, and to be punished for all
the offences liehas conmitted.
For these reasons I propose to vote for the
Bill.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: The article which the
honourable gentleman quotes is based on the
assumption that the whole matter would be
adjudicated by some fair and impartial tribunal. What is the fair and impartial tribunal
by whicl this matter will be adjudicated?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think I saw
a summary of that article which appeared in
the eastern press. It was subsequent te the
statement made by the Prime Minister as
to his desire to bring in a resolution and a
Bill on the lines of the one now before the
Senate. I felt that that article was an approval of the statement made by the Prime
Minister, which has been implemented by
this Bill.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD:
Yes, but the article
specifically states its approval of the legislation now before the House, providing that
it is adjudicated upon by some fair and impartial tribunal.
I ask the honourable gentleman if liecan inform me what the fair
and impartial tribunal is going to be.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The Department.

257

MAY 21, 1929
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: A representative of the Civil Service Commission and a
representative of the Department.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If my honourable friend will listen to this he will have a
complete answer:
Enquiry and investigation may show that in
individual cases there has been, owing to the
conditions under which the striking employees
were taken back into the service, -a divergency
between work done and.the money paid, constituting a grievance; and wherever such deficiency
in remuneration is established before a conpetent and impartial board of enquiry, there
ean be no objection taken to additional payment.
That board of inquiry will be composed of
the Deputy Assistant Postmaster General and
a nominee of the Civil Service Commission,
who will work in conjunction with the Postmaster of Winnipeg.
I do not think the
Hon. Mr. LAIRD:
country would view the Postmaster General's
Department as a very fair and impartial
tribunal.
Hon. Mr. CORDON: My honourable friend
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Lewis) referred to
the members on this side of the House. I
want te say that the opinions I express on
this side of the House are just the same as if
I were sitting on the other side. I should
like to understand a little more clearly the
viewpoint of my honourable friend with regard to the main question at issue. I know
he is sympathetic, but would he like to sec
all these men who are now employed by the
Department reinstated in such a way that
they would receive payment from the time
when they were taken back up to the present
time, on the same basis as if they had been
there all the time and had not been on
strike? That is what the honourable gentleman means?
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: No, not at all. I understood that the original proposition did refer
to reinstatement; but that was talken out.
That first resolution was intended to:
-- make provision whereby certain former ernployees not now in the said service shall be
eligiblie for reappointment as vacancies occur.
In the amended resolution those words do
not occur at all. It says only that those who
were taken back should be paid for the work
they actually did.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Yeu want to see it
retroaotive, and the Act calls for that.
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: The Act says nothing
about placing employees back.

Hon. Mr. GORDON:
I understand that
since 1919 some 96 em'ployees have bee taken
back.
The question that I should like to
ask, and for no other reason than to get the
honourable gentleman's opinion, is this: If
that were done, would not these men be in
the very same position and have the same
payment as if they had not gone on strike?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Hon. Mr. GORDON:

Oh, yes.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Hon. Mr. GORDON:

did the work of those grades or classes no
compensation is due them; but if they were
appointed to lower grades and given work in
other classes, every man of them is worthy of
his hire. The Bill seeks to give payment for
the work they actually did, but no more.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Exactly; while the
employee who did not strike is in just the
same position as that in which you would put
these men. You are reward-ing the striker.
What are you doing for the loyal men who did
not go out? Do you not think they should
have some reward?

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
I should like to
ask the honourable leader of the Government
one question. Can he guarantee that the
construction he is now putting upon this clause
will be the construction that will be adhered
to in the carrying out of the Act? I have
read the Bill over and I am not sure that the
explanation given by the honourable gentleman is correct, nor that he can guarantee us
that the construction he has put upon the
clause will be binding upon the Government.
All that I can
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
answer is that I have as nearly as possible
given-I will not say word for word, but very
nearly so-the statement of the Prime Minister
of Canada, who has explained the contents
of the Bill and how it would be carried out.
I doubt very much that there is anyone who
can more solemnly bind the present Government.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I do not know about
that. The Act itself is very indefinite. It is
a well known fact that the Prime Minister
and the Postmaster General are ai variance
in regard to this matter, for the Postmaster
General introduced a resolution which he was
compelled to change, and, if any credence can
be given to rumour, he was obliged to take
the construction that was put upon it by the
Prime Minister and withdraw his own resolution entirely in favour of a new one.
The interHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
pretation I have given and the construction
I have put upon this Bill are those of the
Prime Minister, who announced that ha intended to modify the resolution in accordance
with the views he was expressing; and when
he addressed the other House in connection
with it he made an explanation which the
honourable Leader of the Opposition in that
House said was a very clarifying and illuminating exposition of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: It goes without saying
that under this Bill some money is to b paid
to certain employees in the Postal Department in Winnipeg. I think we niay start out
with that, because although no money is
mentioned in the Bill we are aware that a
sum of $100,000 is to b placed in the estimates for the purpose of carrying out the
objects of this Bill. Now, I am not a lawyer,
but with regard to who are to be paid, and
how they are to be paid, the clause appears
simple and plain to me. It states that these
men,
the former emiployees of the postal or railway
miail service of Canada who were removed froin
such service
-on account of their having gone on strikeand who were subsequently re-enployed and
are now in the said postal or railway mail s.rvice, shall be paid for services actually performied as from' the date of their re-employnent
at the rates of remuneration paid to otiser en-

ployees for similar services.
It seems to me clear that these men were all
employed on a certain contract, that they
were to be taken on again, but not given the
seniority they had at the time they struck;
they were to commence at the bottom of the
laýdder as postal helpers, and they made their
contract with the Government to that effect.
Now after ten years have elapsed they and
their friends come before this Government and
say, "Although we made that contract, we
want you to give us more money than we
agreed to work for." They ask for this on the
ostensible ground that while they accepted reemployment as postal helpers many of them
were put on work such as letter carrying,
which commanded a higher rate of pay.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

I think that if we accede to their request
we abolish every vestige of a penalty for their
deed of striking suddenly and without cause.
They acknowledged that they had no cause
and left the Government service merely out
of sympathy with a revolutionary strike that
was ealeulated to break down the government of this country. Now, I cannot encourage that sort of thing. I would support this
Bill if it were amended to give these men full
wages from, say, the present date, or the 1st
of June, for the class of work they are doing
now. If that were done, they would be placed
in their proper classification, in the regular
category. I am not ýdisposed to pay them for
striking at a time when they had no reason.
for so doing.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I suggest to the honourable leader of the Government that ha have
this Bill withdrawn and these men paid at the
regular rate for the employment they are now
on, and use this $125,000 as bonus to be distributed amongst the employees who remained patriotic and loyal at the time of the
strike.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Has my honourable friend heard what the employees who remained loyal at that time think of the Bill?
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Will you make my
suggestion to them?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: They would not
take it; they would rather that the money be
paid to those who have suffered for the last
ten years.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I doubt it.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: In view c:
what I am going to say, I know I shall b
charged with being sympathetic, and I pleaid
guilty. I have had a strike among my employees, ýbut I did not punish any of then
very seriously at all.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: But not within your
Department of the Government.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: A lot bas been
said about the impropriety of men in Goverument employment going out on strike. I do
not approve of their striking-I think it is all
wrong-but a good many people have been
punished in connection with the Winnipeg
strike. The honourable gentleman from St.
John (Hon. Mr. Daniel) condemns these

and so on-and for some 35 years bas been
making representatians in an arganized and
orderly way ta the variaus departinente of bhe
Gavernment, and ta the Government itself,
looking for adjustimente and improvemente in
conditions, compensation, etc., as changing
times and circum2t&nces seemed ta warrant.
I arn sure that nâoady ýcan take any exception
ta that sort of procedure.
On the 4tb, 5tb and Oth of Sep.tember, 1918
the Federated Association of Letter Carriers
beld a. convention in the city of Hamilton.
There were certain gentlemen at tbat convention who represented that the present and
previaus method af carrying on their work in
bebaif af civil servants wvas whally wronýg and
wbolly inadequate, and that tbey would neyer
make pragress until they indulged in a public
movement then announced in Western Canada
as tbe One Big Union. Tbe plan was for the
civil service of all departments througbout
Canada ta be centred in one organization, and
'become a unit in the larger one that was
being fostered and pramated in Canada at
that time.
The delegates af the Letter Carriers' Convention at Hamilton at that time did not
approve of that procedure; so a minarity of
tbe delegates at that convention seceded from
the main body; and one of the gentlemen
wbo composed the seceding element, or
brancb, wss Mr. Knowles, who now addresses
us as representing the Postal Set vice of
Canada. The week following that convention
at Hamilton, Mr. Knowles and some other
gentlemen proeeeded ta the Trades and
Labour Congress convention in the city af
Quebec and there joined with the proponents
of the One Big Union propaganda that were
there from industrial organisations, and, as
1 remember, some 64 resolutions of a radical,
communistie nature were proposed at that
session of the Trades and Labour Congress,
and eacb and ail of them were declined and
denied adoption by the Congress in session.
Following that, aur friends from the West,'
wba largely composed the delegates who were
bebind those resolutions, in which the seceding postal workers' representatives j.oined,
returned ta Western Canada. In the fallawing February they held a convention in
Calgary and there proposed ta take a referendum vote af ah] organized labour in Western Canada, urging the members af ahl organizations of ahl sorts ta drap their affiliations
wîth their trades unions, because, according
ta their statement, the trade union idea was
obsoiete, and join the One Big Union maovement. That referendumn vote was ta be
counted in May, 1919, and a further convention was ta lie held on June 5, 1919, in
Calgary, for the purpose of definitely haunch-

261

ing the One Big Union movement in response
to what they anticipated would be the resuit
of the referendum vote.
Before that vote was caunted, and before
the second convention referred to was held,
this strike broke out in Winnipeg. The details
and immediate causes of it need not be
alluded to here. Those postal workers had
strcngth enough in the city of Winnipeg, and
though ail the postal workers in Winnipeg
werc not members of this seceding organization, bonourable gentlemen can quite
appreciate the fact that wben the general
strike in the city of Winnipeg occurred a
letter car'rier had no more chance of performing bis duty of delivering mail on the
streets of Winnipeg, even if hie desired to
do so, because of the feeling that existed in
that city at that time. Indeed on some days
bis if e would not have been saf e on the
streets there. Therefore, either tbrough inclination or intimidation, the mail service
was absolutely disrupted, and the letter
carriers absolutely driven off the streets.
Now, in October, 1918-1 should have followed tbis up-thje, postal organization seceding
from the Hamilton convention made application for admission to and affiliation with the
Trades and Labour Congress of Canada, after
they bad first propoaed an amalgamation of
their organization with the other federations
of civil servants in their department; and if
bonourable gentlemen will look at the records
pu-bhished by the Labour Department itself
in the last few years they will find that those
federations of civil servants in the Customns
Department, Agriculture Department, and so
on, declined ta affiliate tbemselves or have
anytbing to do with this seceding organlisation.
They then attempted ta obtain affiliation
with the Trades and Labour Congress of
Canada, and were denied that privilege. Then,
and only then, in 1921, did tbey change their
namne from "Federated Letter Carriers" ta
"Amalgamated Civil Service Organisatian," the
idea being ta, adopt a naine that would. enable
them ta spread out ta aill branches of the
civil service with their One Big Union propaganda in their hearts ahl the time, just as
the One Big Union bas been endeavouring ta
permeate and finally control the trades union
movement in the industrial and commercial
field. Sa banourable gentlemen, when tbey
receive the circular -communication from Mr.
Knowles, need nat be unduly convinced that
bis circular and bis representatians express the
wiIl and the wish of the civil servants of
Canada.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But it is in very
moderate terms.

262

SENATE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Very; I quite
appreciate that, and hie well knows that by
making his representations in that way tbey
will bie more effective than in any other style.
I want te add this. My right bonourable
friend from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr.
Graham) bas pointed out that ne seniority
rights are interfered with; that there is ne
retroaceti-ve pay asked f or except for the time
sinco the men were re-empleyed. Ail that
is quite true, but the reasen is ebvious-that
the civil servants Whbo would be affected, other
than the 96, would net for a moment stand
for those tbings being put into the proposai;
s0 it has been boiled down to what we have
in the Bill.
New I come to my honourable friend from
De SaIaberry (Hon. Mr. Beique), who in my
opinion has put bis linger on the very meat
of this whole proposition before us to-day.
The Bill as il stands does nlot, in my opinion,
provide for retroactive pay for any postal
werkers except those wbo are net emplîoyed
in the samne capacity that they were employed
in prier te their retirement from the service.
Righlt Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Say that again.
Hon MVr. ROBERTSON:

now past the age limit fixed for new employees
entering the service, it will be permissible for
the commission to appoint them notwithsbanding the age requirements.
In every case before being re-appointed satisfactory assurance must be obtained that a
repetition of the offence will not occur.
That Order in Council was passed on the
4th of June, 1920, and during the year 1920,
as a result of the opening of the door to that
extent-which I noticed the Prime Minister in
another place said was the only mistake the
Government made, for they should not have
been allowed to come back at all-but in
1920Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think my
honourable friend is not citing exactly the
statement of the Prime Minister.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I am quoting
admost the words he said, as I remember them.
In the year 1920 applications were received
from 42 men, who were returned to service;
in 1921, 12 more; in 1922, 11 more; and in
1923, 16 more. A total of 81 made application
to be restored to the service, passed the necassary Civil Service examination requirements,
and were employed. The remainder of the 95
or 96, that is, 14 or 15, have returned to service
or have been re-employed since 1923. I bring
that to the attention of honourable gentlemen
because of the fact that there was a re-classi
fication of rates of wages for postal employees,
first in 1919 and again in 1924; and it is well
to remember that 81 out of the alleged 96
were re-employed during that period from
1920 to 1923.
Now I come to another point that is somewhat detailed, but et the same time I think
will perhaps give us an understanding of what
we are trying to do. I do not think there is
much difference between honourable gentlemen
opposite and those on this side of the House
as to what we desire to do. I think everybody
desires that men should be paid on the basis
of equal pay for equal service rendered. I do not
think there is any difference of opinion in the
House about that at all. But the method of
computing and paying the wages to postal
employees or civil servants in general varies
so much by reason of classes, and annual
increases within those classes, that it is very
easy for us to become confused as to what this
really does mean.
It might be initeresting to mention also that
at least 72 of those 96 men, when re-employed,
were put at exactly the same occupation that
they were working at when they retired from
the service. The Post Office Department has
conpiled and prepared a comîplete statement
which shows the mans date of birth, his name,
the date he was first employed, the date of

263

his re-employment, the salary under which he
was re-employed, the salary when he was
dismissed, the salary as of May, 1929, his
occupation at the time he left the service, and
his occupation when re-employed; and I findL
according to the Postal Department's own
statement maide out in detail on those 96 men,
that 72 of them, when re-employed, were put
back into exactly the same work that they
were doing when they left the service, and
that they have been paidHon. Mr. TANNER: And got the same
salary?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Oh, no-and that
they have been paid for that service the stated
sala.ry for the position and class in which they
were placed.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: May I ask the
honourable gentleman to make it qui-te clear
that they were not at a disadvantage.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Net as new
employees. I will come to that point in a
moment. Take the case of a letter carrier.
There are now in 'the service thirty-five letter
carriers who went out on strike and who were
re-employed at subsequent dates. Every one
>f those thirty-five men was taken back into
the service at the classification fer latter carriers, which was $780 in 1919, and iemained
et that figure until 1924. That is the minimum
mte. As they advaned in Jength of service,
like everybordy else, they aeceived an advance
in salary. So I submit, .f my calculation is
correct, that 72 of the 96 men have been paid
every dollar they earned as new employees
entering the service, and in the olaas of work
they were doing. The rest of them, about 24
in number, are not to-day employed in the
same class of work as they were engaged in
when t'hey left the service. To that extent
I think the Bill is operative, and quite properly so; and in view of the fact that in
another place all concerned seem to have
adopted that view, them is -much to be said
for it, and I do not take exception to it. But
this must be clear: that 24 men who are
undoubtedly entitled to financial consideration and the adjustm'ent of their cases, cannot possibly involve $125,000. Se it is abundantly clear that the original proposal of the
Postmaster General was to compensate those
96 men on the bais of the rate they would
have received had they never gone on strike,
,nd I think that this House and the other
House aie practically unanilmous in the
opinion that that is not a tenable position.

course, bas to decide according to his own
understanding how he will cast the vote which
he may be called upon to give. Notwithstanding the great respect that I have for the
opinions which have been expressed by gentlemen on both sides of the House, I can hardly
follow some of them. To my mind the Bill
is extremely clear, and I do not ser any necessity of changing a word of it. The Bill
does not deal with anybody except the
employees who were re-employed, I think, in
1920, and were assigned to duty. I do not
think we have to inquire whether it was a duty
of one kind or of another. Whatever duties
were assigned to them, the Bill provides for
their being paid at the same rate as other
employees rendering the sane kind of service,
and who had remained in the employ of the
Government. I do not have to inquire as to
the intention of the Government or of the
Department or of the Postmaster General. It
will be thé duty of the Auditor General to
see that the principle of the Bill is applied,
and I do not think that we need fear that
any money will be paid except as authorized
by the Bill. The money authorized to be
paid to the employees in question is merely
the amount that they should be paid for services which they have actually rendered, on
the basis of the amount paid to other
employees.
Some hon. SENATORS:

Question.

Before the
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
second reading is taken, may I inquire if my
honourable friend will undertake, before we
go into committee, to give some thought and
consideration to the suggestion I have made?
I propose that
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
we take the second reading of the Bill. 1
will carry the suggestion of my honourable
friend to the Prime Minister and to the Postmaster General, and I think I shall lie able to
bring back a positive statement that will
satisfy my honourable friend as to the policy
that will be followed.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

All right.

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

EXCISE BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second

reading of Bil 279, an Act to amend the
Excise Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this Bill
repeals subsection (a) of section 219 of the
Excise Act, and replaces it with the following
section, which I will read now, so that I may
dispense with the reading of it in Committee:
On every pound of malt manufactured in
Canada, subject to excise regulations with
respect to coomings and absorption of moisture
in warehouse as provided by the Order in Council of the seventh day of February, one thousand eight hundred and ninety-one, three cents:

That is the duty.
Provided that malt may be removed from a
malt-house to a d-istillery 'in bond, and the duty
on such malt may be remitted upon proof satisfaetory to the Depar-tment that such malt has
been used solely for the production of spirits,
in which production no other material than malt
is used; and provided further that malt used,
in any licensed bonded manufactory, in the
manufacture of malt extract or other similar
medicinal preparation approved by the DepartmentAnd here is the new part:
-- or in the preparation of any malt food produet approved by the Governor in Council may
have duty thereon remitted under such regulations as the Department establishes.
It is proposed to prepare malted milk in
Canada, and it is represented that on part
of the ingredients, whole malt, there is an
excise tax of three cents a pound, and on
crushed malt, of five cents a pound. The conpany that is about -to manufacture the malted
milk represents that it will employ about
seventy-five persons. Should the company
carry out its plans, the proposed proviso would
authorize the Governor in Council to remit
the excise tax on such malt. The estimated
loss of revenue will not be large.
I move the second reading of this Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

in item 437 is the addition of "n.o.p.," which
is made necesSary by the amendment of a later
item, 448. I will turn now to 448. It is
proposed to amend present item 448 to cover
apparatus for sterilizing bulbs and apparatus
for determining the maturity of fruit, in
accordance with applications made by the
Canadian Horticultural Council. Bulb sterilizing apparatus assists in the removing of fungus
diseaes from bulbs and is used largely by

made in Canada and is imported chiefly from
the United Kingdom under item 454.
Fruit Pressure Testing Apparatus is a device
used by Fruit Inspectors; it is iniported from
the United States and, according to evidence
at the public hearing, is not manufactured in
Canada. It enters at present under item 437.
Inclusion of Fruit Pressure Testing Apparatus
in the amended item 448 necessitates the addition of "n.o.p.," in the item under which
it has been entering, namely, 437.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: In item 448 is there

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

list a very considerable nunîber of items that
are free absolutely under the British Preferential Tariff, the Intermediate Tariff and the
General Tariff.

MAY 21, 1929
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not, believe
that the changes are very considerable in importance, although, of course, they would lie
important to those who are importing the
.articles.
Hon. Mr. WILLiOUGHBY: 'I do not profess to have studied the Bill sufficiently to
lie able to make any suggestion concerning
it that wouid lie of value to this House at aIl.
It would lie
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
-very difflcult for this Charsber to undertake to
amend the Bill.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: But there is a great
deail in it that interests me very much, wvheth cr
we can do anything to it or not; for instance,
in item 363:
Platinum. wire and platinum bars, strips,
ýsheets or plates; platinum, palladium, iridium,
esmiurn, ruthenium and rhodium, in lumps,
ingots, powder, sponge or sorapare ail on the free list.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have the explanation here. There was an application
made by Goldsmith Brothers Smelting and
Refining Company of Toronto, whicb, according to its reprasentative, employa about thirty
people.
The metals which comprise the piatinum
group are: platinum, palladium, iridium,
esmium, nutheniuma and rhodium. Crude
platinum contains from 70 to 90 par cent of
the matai and is raally an alloy of the platinum with onýe or more of the alliad matais,
the chief impurities consisting principally of
iron and coppar. The platinum ore is obtainad in considerable quantitias in the Ural
Mountains of Russia and in the rivars of
Columbia, South America. Dr. Wilson of the
Departmant of Mines reportad that thare ara
probably not more than five firms in the world
which. are recovering the matai from the
original ore.
Pure platinuma is usuaily too soft for commercial demanils, se iridium, palladium or the
othar metals of the group are added in suitable
proportions and then malted and rolled into
plate or drawn into wire, in which latiter forms
they are used by the jewelry trade, dental
and chemical professions.
Import duties ara leviad on "sponga, meaning palladium, iridium, esmium, ruthenium and
rhodium under item No. 711, while the finishad
article undar 363 comas in frae. The word
"s9ponga" is a trada terma and refers to the
powdered matals ûotainad by refining.
I hope my honourable friand is satisfied.

Hon. Mr. GORDON: Yes, 1 arn satisfied.
with that information as far as it goes. The
quantity of platinum and the other metais
referred to that are used in Canada caninot be
very greait. Every one of the items is produced in Canada by the International Nickel
Company and 'by the old Mond Company.
Thec absence of duty on these produets certainly does flot give any inducement for the
starting of a small pliant in order that more
manuf-acturing rnay -be done in Canada.
We are hearing every day of the necessity
for more immigration and we are spending
millions of dollars to bring more people to
this country. But the trouble is that the
people do flot stay after we get themn here,
and the reason is that there is not enougli
work for them. There would be opportunity
for a small plant to manufacture these things
covered by item 363, but this tariff eliminates
all inducemant.
Hon. Mr. LOGAN: What is the demand
for the articles in Canada?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
the demand?

How big is

Hon. Mr. GORDON: I do flot know how
big the demand is, but there are flot many
honourable gentlemen present who are not
wearing some article of jewelry containing
platinum, and it is probable that if any honourable gentleman is not wcaring such things
bis wif e is. There is a considerable quantity
of the metal used in Canada, but I do not
know whether we use more than we produce.
The point I arn trying to make is that if
thcse things were not on the free list I balieve they would be refincd in Canada.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If my honourable friend had the rasponsibility of making
a tariff, lie would find that there are very
many things which, for various reasons, it is
not opportune for Canada to endeavour to
manufacture. In some cases the demand may
lie sa small that to venture on manufacturing
the article would lie to risk almost certain
failure. I have been in public life a number
of years and my experience bas been that
generally when people seriousiy protested
against the coming in free cd duty of an
article which, if it were protected by a tariff,
could lie produoed here to the advantaga of
the consumer, they hava bean listened to.
But this may not ie a serious proposition.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I do not suppose the
business in these mataIs would run into a
very large figure and it is not likely that a
big plant would lie required te refine tham.

b)2heve the Canadian National should take over
these two roads and incorporate thein in the
Governinent system.
This report, as I have just said, was made
in 1920. In 1924, four years later, the Board
of Railway Comrmissioners was instructed by
the Minister of Railways to make a thorough
enquiry into the condition of these roads and
of the moneys that had been expended thereon. The figures supplied to the Railway
Board show the following expenditures:
Biy the Québec Oriental Railway,
Matapedia to New Carliole. . $ 2,096,776 64
BFl the Atlantic, Quehec and
Western Ry., New Carlisle to
91
Gaspe.............8,040,254
$10,137,031 55
The question of acquiring these railways
was evidently being considered at the time
the Railway Board was making its enquiry,
and in connection therewith the following extract frorn the Chairman's report is interesting:
Considering the whole line from Matapedia
to Gacpe is 202-4 miles in length, 1 think the
offer of Mr. L. B. Read, Managing Director of
both uines, made to Sir Henry Thornton in
April, 1924, in whieh hie suggested a sale to the
Governnieit; for the suma of $4,223,675, could
not hc consi(lered extravagant, based upon the
actual amount of money whichi the present
ow-uerus put loto the road. Taking the estimate
of the Department's engineer as a hasie oif
mneasuirement of the cost over the full length
of the road, the figure thereby reached is
$6,266,898.80.
I think these figures correspond with those
given by Mr. Ruel before the Committec today.
The &bject which the inhabitants of the
localities concerned are desirous of attaining is
that the benefits of the Canadian National
Railway service be secured to them, not
neccssarily l)y the purchase of the road, but
by auy arrangement which will accomplish that
end.The suecessf ul operation of the important
is much
these railways
industries along
hampered by the fact that they are inable
to get the service, either in freig'ht or passenger
traffic, whieh unity of operation and control by
the C-anadian National Railways would secure.
Through freiglit rates to consuming centres,
such as Montreal and Boston, would resuit in
an awakening of industrial interest and enterprise in the Gaspé Peninstula.
This report tells the whole story, and rny
rernarks rnight well end here. But I arn
bound to add in justice to the English investor, that had it not been for the money he
invested in these railways, the people of
Canada would have been calIed upon to spend
for the building of a railway on the Gaspé
coast a much larger amount than they are
now paying.

Before taking my seat, rnay I suggest to
the Governrnent, now that these roads are
being acquired by the Canadian National,
that due consideration be given to the section men, the brakemen, engineers, firemen,
conductors and general cmployees who have
apent many years in the employ of these
railways. Many of them, I hope, will be
retained in the service of the Canadian National. Others, no doubt, wvill be superaýnnuated. When retirement takes place, would
it nlot be possible to allow the years spent
in the employ of the old companies to count
towards their pensions? This is a question
which, I submit, deserves the very best consideration of the Government and of the
Canadian National Raîlway executive.
My last words will bo to congratulate the
Government, and more especially Monseigneur Ross, Bishop of Gaspé, to whose untiring
efforts the people of Gaspé are indeibted for
the successful ending of this transaction.
The motion was agreed to.

MAY 22, 1929
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Weil, there is
no agreement for the employmen't of force,
save the provision in certain clauses of the
Covenant that the Council may caUl upon
some nations for help against any signatory
nation that violates the Covenant. The
Covenant provides for the meeting of the
Council in sucli circumstancee, and their ealling upon the nations to take the necessary
action. The Council may a.sk for eeonomic
sanction against t.he cuiprit nation and prodlaim that nation as under the ban of ail the
other signatories. This instrument is fairiy
strong and should force a nation to refleet
deepiy before At wouid launch out into a
war at the ri.sk of being isolated, commercîaiiy
and otherwise, by the other nations. The
rnost potent force of the League for the prevention of wqr is the threat of ostracising any
nation that disregards the Covenant and endeavours to settie a dispute Iby force of arms.
My honourabie friend is familýiar with the
t'crms of the Covenanit and knows the power
of the Council to eall upon the nations for
miiitary intervention.
Hon. Mr. GRIEISBACH: That is provided
for in clauses 10 and 16. My lionourabie
fxiend used the expression "economie sanction." That, in plain Eniglîsh, is a blockade,
id it not? Tha.t means refusai to trade and,
1 take it, a refusai to aiiow any<body else to
trade. Yes or no?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It ail depends
unon the conditions which arise.
Bon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Ve'ry weil. Assuming it is a refusai to trade and a refusai to
allow anyone else to trade with the offending
nation, how does my honourabie friend propose to deal with the United States, which,
by its deciared public poiicy, refuses to recognize the right of biockade an'd is building a
navy at the present momen~t for the purpose
of enforcing, if necessary, its peculiar views
on this subject?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The United
States lias signed the Paris Pact, the KelloggBriand Pact which renounces war and suggests that other means be found for settiing
international differences, and there is a very
strong implication that that country would
have to stand by the side of other nations
which refused to deal with any League member that violated the pledge it signed at the
rpqiuest of the United States Government

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That is flot the
interpretation which the members of the
United States Senate piaced upon the Kellogg
Pact, when considerîng the question of protecting, in the event of biockade, what 4they
dlaim to be their trade relationships with the
other nations of the worid. The discussion
upon the Cruiser Bill disclosed the fact that
that body, in particuiar, does not hold the
view that the Kellogg Treaty predtudes the
United States Government from taking necessary military action in the protection of what
they ciaim to be an internai situation, that
la 80 say, the rights of their nationals to
trade freely with the world, regardless of any
blockade imposed by any other nation.
I am raising these questions mereiy for the
purpose of pu.tting a few thouglits into the
mind of the honourabie gentleman (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) before lie proceeds to Geneva,
where he represents us with great distinction.
I shouid iike him, to keep his feet on the
ground wlien dealing with matters of this
sort there.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
0f course
everyone knows that in the report of the
Committee which was studying the Kellogg
Pact the United States Government made
certain deciarations; and I think that Mr.
Kellogg himseif, as well as Senator Èorah
and a number of other public men in and
outside Congress, is very strongIy of the
opinion that the United States could not,
without tlie risk of impairing its honour, align
itself actively, or indirectly by suppiying instruments of war, with any nation that might
vioiate the Pact.
I sbouid iike to inform my honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) tliat I am now
informed tliat an order was given on the
l6th of May for the printing of 500 copies of
the Protocoi for distribution to the members
of Parliament.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved:
That the Senate doth unite with the Bouse

of Coinmonis in the approvai of the Protocol
for the Prohibition of the Use in War of
Asphyxiating, Poisonouns or Other Gases, and of
Bacteriological Methods of Warfare, which w.as

POSTAL OR RAILWAY MAIL SERVICE
EMPLOYEES BILL
CONrSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion oif Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Cornniittee on Bill 252, an
Act respecting certain ernployees of the Postal
or Railway Mail Service of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Robinson in the chair.
On section 1-Salaries of certain post office
ornployees:
Hon. Mr. I)ANDURAND: Honourable gentlemen, it will be recallod that the honourable
member from Welland (Hon. Mr. Robertson)
stated that hie did not sec clearly who were
the "other employees" with wbom a comparison would be established under the Bill
for the determination of the rernuneration t0
whi"h the re-empýloyed would be entitlod. As
the Order in Couincil, passed on the recornmendation of the honourable gentleman hirnself (Hon. Mi. Robertson), mode if clear that
the strikers who had refused f0 return wben
sumrnoed to do so could only corne into
the service as niew men, thoir status as newcorners is thereby cstablishied, and fhey mnust
necessarily be treated as such.
The coinparison indicated in the Bill will necossarily
be wvith mon having the saine status, and the
sole question t0 bo dctermined by the investigating Commission is the quality of the
services they hiave rendered.
The appointment of a norinciie frorn the Civil Service
Commrission has for its special objeet the carirying out of the letter and the spirit which
govorli the Civil Serviee Comrnission.
I move the adoption of this clause.
Hon. Mr. RIOBERTSON: The explanation
wvhich my honouiable friend bas just given
meefs quite fîil] v th(, objection which I had

urge upon the Hoîise is th-at these mn
vho
unfort uiatel:v made a inistake, wvhiclh they
hav e long sinco recognized, should bc treated
in exactly the samie way as other mcen who
enfercd the service at the samne tirne. Such
is the practice thaf bas been in vogue in
other activities in Canada for many years,
especially in our greaf transportation systerns.
If an emplove bas been djsmissed for what
f0 bis employer semed to be good cause, if
vcry often happons that throughi the representations of an organization of which hoe is
a noînher, and a roquet for reconsideration
of the discipline imposed, hoe secures re-ernployient. If the rostorafion of the man to,
service carnecs reinstatornont, hoe undoubtedly

cupieýd and îrccoives the sanie rate of conmpensation that ho reccived before ho was dismissed. In many cases a mon must be dismisscd outright; particularly the employee
who gets bis nîonev rnixed witb that of bis
employer. If may bo that ho bas had long
years of service and that, even though bis
offence was a serions one, thore svas no intention of being dishonesf.
If thon off on
happons that six months or a year later a
plea is made f0 his employer f0 gis o hini
anothor chance, and that hoe is permitted f0
return as a new ernployee. When ho re-entors
the soirvice ho receivos the minimum compensation for the work in wbich hoe is ongaged, which, at first is of an inferior nature;
but as tii
passes ho gradually makes bis
way upward ýtill ho reaches the position which
ho formerly occupied. There is a very iniportant principle involved in this practico,
nnd if you ignore that principle and say f0
the mon, "You are going f0 bo rewardod wvhen
you arc takon hacký," the consequence will ho,
thaf omployers will refuse f0 re-ernploy mon,
who thereby ma-v loso ontiroly tbe chance of
ernployrnont, and the situation created will

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May 1 conclude
what I liad in mind? 1 have neyer wilfully
done any individual an injustice. Last night
the riglit honourable gentleman from Eganville (Right Hon-. Mr. Graham) read a certain
communication, signed by a gentleman named
Knowles, which had been circulated among
honourable members, and 1 macle some re-;
marks in reply, pointing out the enigin and
growth of -the organizatien that Mr. Knowles
representoti. During my remarks 1 said that
there was a secession movement at the Hamilton convention of Septeminber 4, 5, and 6, 1918,
in which Mn. Knowles .partioipated, and that
lie later went to the Trades and Labour Congness meeting at Quebec, whiere lie joineti with
others in the promotion of certain radical
nesohitions. I am iniformeti that Mr. Knowles
was flot at Quebec in 1918 or at any other
time, and I wish to explain that while I was
niglit as to the incident at Hamilton, I was
mistaken as to the situation at Quebec.
I do flot know how other honourable gentlemen on thýis side of the flouse may feel,' but
se fan as I am concerned, I am satisfieti with
the explanation of the hionoura,,ble leader of
the Government.
Section 1 was agreeti to.
The preamble andi the titie wene agreed to.
The Bill was reported without aîmenidment.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moveti the third
reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: May I indulge in
the hope that this is the last we shall hear of
the Winnipeg strike of 1919?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Amen!
Hon. Mn. DANDtIRAND:
The honourable gentleman from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
MeMeansQ) expresses the hope that this is the
clesing chapter of the very grave disturbance
that f ook place in Winnipeg in 1919. 1 join
witli him in that hope, andi in so doing I may
be permitted to say that I believe Parliament will have contnibuted its share towards
the healing of the wounds that reimain after
ten yeans. The men who participated in the
stnike have heen given a stern lesson, whicli
wiIl be a guide niot only to themselves, but to
people generally thnougliout the country.
There is one other remark that I shoulti like
to make. Wlien the Prime Mînister was at
Geneva hast year lie macle a statement which
hati consideraible effect throughout Europe,
78600-18J

and beyond.
Hie said that Canada was a
land of reconciliation and peace-a land where
two races who once fouglit each. other on the
battle-field are now uniteti and working hand
tIn hand for the development of their country.
Canada is a landi of reconciliation, andi in this
Bill we have done a littie towards reconciliation and social peace.
Hoa. Mr. W'I'LLOUGH'Y: They expected
an orange, andi they have ýbeen given a lemon,
1 thin.k.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER:
Honounable
gentlemen, the honourable memb1er fnom Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. MoMeans) sa.ys that lie
hopes this will be the last we shall hear of
the 1919 stnike.
I hope se too.
But the
lionourable gentleman fnom, Welland (Hon.
Mr. Robertson), if I understood his remarks
Conrectly, macle a oomparison between the
persons to wliom this Bill may, 1 hope, be of
some benefit, andi the employees of ordinary
industries.
I do not think that com.parison
should be macle. I believe that the men wlio
struck in Winnipeg, their work being of the
utmost importance to the law and entier of
this countny, are in an enýtinely different position frem those who strike whule engageti in
any ondinany industry.
This Bill is about te be passecl, and while
it may be the last that we hear of the Winnipcg strike, I amn afraid-anti some of the mcSt
influential papens in Western Canada express
the same fear-that it may be the cause at
some future Lime of these postmen striking
again.
Hon. Mn. ROBERTSON: The honourable
gentleman's interpretation of my remarks is
quite correct, but I ask him wie-then lie dees
net agnee that Parliament ouglit to go not
me.rely to a reasonable length, but te a
generous length, in gnanting to these postal
wonkers the saine sort of tneatment that for
the past thirty years private employers have
been in the habit of gnanting anti labour organizations have acoepted as fair and just.
The offence of these postal workens is probabhy
more senious than it woulti have been if they
had been empleyees in private industries. I
thinik that in coing what it lias clone Parliament lias been fair andi generous.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: I do net agree
w1th that at ah.
There is no companison
between a strike in an inclustry anti a strike in
the Post Office.
The motion was agreeti te, and the Bill was

been produced to obtain cancellation of bonds
given for foreigu ex5pert of cargoes go cleared.
The Committee further finds that a strong
prestimption is raised that somne proportion of
the liquor s0 shipped and eleared fi.nds its way
back into Canada for consumption. The Coinmittee, therefore, recommends that excise and
sales tax be levied on ail Canadian made.intoxicating liquors released from bond, no matter
where they are carried or consumed, and that
duty and sales tax be lcvied. on a-Il ailcoholie
liquors entering Canada, whether in bond or
otlaerwise, irrespective of their ultimate destinatin.
The part of that report which is pertinent
to the question now before us is contained
in the following paragraph:
Doubts have been cast upon the sufficiency
of existing legisiation to proliibit or nuthorize
reguldtions prohibitiog the illegal export of
intoxicating liquors to the United States. To
the exteot to which sueh legisiation may be
.nsufficient the Committee recommeods that it
be amended. The Committee further recommends that, as seen as possible, regulations be
made to prohibit clearances heing granited to
vessels carryiog liquor as cargo, sailing from a
euh
Canadian port to a United States prt,
regulations to make an exception in favour of
-liquor being imported into the United State
in apeordance witb the laws of that count r.
The report, which I believe was agreed to
by the Committee withou't division, was debated in the House of Commons and on the
2ûth of June it was passed there al.so-if my
memory serves me-without division. That final
paragraiph thus 'becaine an imperaýtive utterance and instruction of the flouse of Commons
upon the matter now under our consideration.
Parliament was shortly afterwards dissolved,
and an election took place on the l4th of
September. On the llth of September the
Leader of the present Goveroment, then in
opposition, made a statement which was published in the Toronto Globe. Before qunting
that statement I wish to say that both in
the appoiotment of the special Committee
and in the support of the investigation, the
Prime Minister of the present day was ontR-is statement
spoken, sincere and cordial.
wbieh appeared in the Globe seven days before the polling was this:
ffhen returned te power I pledge myself to
continue relentlessly the investigation of the
C'ustoms Service end to carry out without fear
or favour the needed requirements.
The election resulted in the return of the
present Govemnment to power, and almost
immediately thereafter the Prime Minister
fulfilled bis promise of a thorough investigation by appointing a Royal Commission, consisting of Chief Justice Brown of the Court
of King's Bench of Saskatchewan, Mr. Justice
Wright of the Supremne Court of Ontario, and
Mr. Justice Roy, of the Superior Court of the

277

Province of Quebec. These gentlemen undertook their mission on the l7th of November
of that year, travelled this country from one
end of it to the other, were assisted by most
able counsel, and made, I belýieve, one of
the most thorough and fearlesa investigations
ever made in the pazliamentary history of
Canada. After eleven months of survey and
examination of sworn evidence, the Commission, on the l5th of October, 1927, submitted
its report, which. 1 think should also be placed
upon record. Its chief reconamendaticos read
as folloyws:
At the tiine of the Trea-ty and since considerable quantities of liquor, upon whicb excise duties had. not been paid, were exported
in bond for alleged destinations other th-an the
Un ited States.
The Customs Act and the
regulations thereunder ýrequire that in such
cases a bond shuuld be given requiriog liquors
to be exported ont of Canada to the port named
in the Customs -entry, and requiring a landing
certificate from the proper officers of the port
of destination, and that in default of the ohtaining of sucb lao.ding certificate and comnpliance wvith the other conditions thc bond
should become due and payable.
The evidence adduced before us disclosed that
a great majori-ty of sncb shipments neyer
reached the named destination, and the inference was strong that the liquor comprised in
siich sh-ipinents had been smuggled into the
United States. In mnany cases lan-ding certificates were produced to Custois that our investigation showed to be forged an*d fraudulent.
Jo somne cases the bonds were released. but in
utiier cases the Department was nt satisfied,
aond the bonds are still outstandiog. We bave
dealt with this aspect of the enatter in our
Interim Report No. 10.
For some time past an addition-al method bas
been adopted, which is to export duty-paid
liquor. Tfhe practice is to eoter at Customs the
liquer as being for export to certain ports in
the United States, but the liquor is neyer Ianded
nt a port recognized by the United States authorities, and is smuggled ioto that country in
varions places where there are ne recognized
ports or cnstnms bouses.

Many regulations bave heeo framed aoc!
enaeted for the Purpose of meeting tbis metbed
cf smuggling, but tbey bave proved ineffective.
And here follows the paragraph whicb. is
more pertinent to the question that we are
now discussing:
We are convin.ced that tbe expert bouses are
established in practiceally every case for the isole
purpose of selling liquor te be smuggled into
the Ujnited States and that tbey exist for o
legitimate purpose wbatever. Some of tl4eie export bouses have Customs bonds, and we would
recommend that all these bonds he cancelled.
As ail of the Provinces of Canada have eithei
assumed contre! over the sale Of liquor or bave
prohibited it altogether, the principle of the
Doberty Act shoui-d in ou-r opinion be extended te probibit the expert f romn any of these
provinces by anyone other than the Provincial
Governments or tbe manufacturer.
We also express our entire concurrence in the
reconimen-dation of the Special Committee ot
the flousie of Commons as contained in para-

been aver lax, haz practically donc littie, or
has been entirely negligent in the enforcement of its law-of this amendment. I hold
a contrary opinion, and I thinik that an unbia.sed valuation of the difficulties which
were encoun'tered and the results which have
been achieved will aibsolve the United States
from that general accusation. Rum Row has
practically disappearcd. Along the Maritime
Provinces border of cur cwn ûountry the, illicit
t.raffic ha.s been to a large exteilt scotchcd or
killcd. Somne progress has been made on the
Pacifie coast, and 110W thoýe law-breaking
forces at work te defeat the abject of
the amendment in the United States and
thrust liquor into that territory are chicfly
deployed along the lakes, particularly Ontario
and Erie, and the narrow straits and rivers
which separate Canada fromn the Uniitcd
States.
On the whele, I think 1 am fairly well bascd
in stating that a gigantie effort has been
made by the United States in good faith te
carry out the purposes of 'the amendment and
perfect the organization whicb shall ultimately
make this as successful as similar laws can
be made.
If we look for another indication, it is
founýd in the evenits of last year, at the Riepublican convention at Kansas City and the
Democratie convention at Hoeuston, beth
representative of týwo immense parties with
tremendous electoral constituencies bchind
thcm. They passed resolutions in both conventions which favoureid the retention of the
l8th Amendment and pledgcd both parties'ie
the eniforcement of the laws which wcrc necessary for its support. In the Republican convention the Republican -candidate himself, a
man net given te fads or fancies or overcnthusiasms, I should judge, plcd-ged himse-lf
both as a personal believer in and a political
supporter cf ithe 18th Amnendiment, and l'he
enforcement cf such laws as were necessary in
order te carry out its purpeses.
To-day in both the Senate and the flouse
cf Representatives at Waqhington there is a
larger proportion cf Drys te Wets than at
any period of the histery cf Congress from

1919 Up.
If one more fact is necessary I adduce this
ene.
When enforcement is taking place,
and suspected persons are 'brought within the
toills cf the law, you have net only the individual violatýor of the law, but largely in tihe
United States and also here in Canada you

have the organized violators of the lawshrewd, skilful,
illimitable fonds
very bcst cf
got te support

daring, conscienceless, with
at their back, and with the
legal advice that can be
them in the courts. A fine

279

which would be cifectual for an individual
violator has ne effeet at ahi upon your comnmercialized bands and their violations. Your

bands and your bandits and ycur associations
of men are flrmly linked, and skilfully and
shirewdýly oi'ganîzcd. A fine whi.ch. is sufficient
in the case cf an individual is te thcm a mere
fly upon a wheel, and bas no effeet upon
the organiznd violator. Whcn that weakncss
was brought befere both flouses cf Congress
at its hast Session the Joncs Bill was passed,
which has been muchi criticizcd, but which bas
its defenders. The purpose cf the Jones Bill
wàs te impose a penalty which wouidb ef
cfective on the organizcd, ýcomibined vioilators cd the
18th Amendment and the Volstcad Act; and

iso the penalty was set at $10,000, or five years'
imiprison'ment, or bath. That is a dirastic penalty. It was admittcd te be drastic, but it
carri-ed in bath flouses; in the loweir flouse
by a vote cf 283 te 90, and in the Senate by a
vote of 65 to 18. Now, men in the legislatures
vote eithcr from personal conviction or because cf the conv iction cf the electorate
behind them; and for myscîf I flnd it difficuit
te draw the conclusion from that legislation
thaï the sentiment cf the United State8 is net
for the enforcement cf the Volstead Act and
the streýngthcning cf the 18th Amcndmcnt. Se
much then for thiat.
Ncw, the very moment that the Unitcd
States cf America came te deal with that vast
coast hine, with depredators upon almost
evcry leaguie cf it, bath by land and by watcr,
thcy began te look around te sec whcthcr or
net there was any sympathetic good-will
amengst the nations cf the earth, particularly
near neighbours, which could be enListed in
their aid. But not focr the enforeement cf their
law. That is neot the angle frcm which to
look at it. The United States of America,
te my knowlcdge, ncvcr asked any country
in the world te help thcm enforce their law,
but what they dîd was this. The people of
the United States, in the most democratic
fashion possible, came to the conviction that
the way to treat the traffie in intuxicating
liquors in the United States ivas te prehibit
their import, thcir manufacture, their transport
and their sale. Thcy have cmbodicýd that
in their highest legislation, sae cmbodied
it and embedded it in the constitution
that no man cf sound common sense teday believes that the United States cf
America are anywhere within measurable
distance cf the repeal cf the l8th Amendment and the consequent abrogation cf prohibition in that country. Te accomplish repeal the reverse cf the enaction proccss bas
to be followed, and there must be net only
the enactments cf two-thirds cf the Seniate

SENATE
and the House of Representatives, but also
the approbation of tbree-quarters of the States
of the Union.
Wbat did the nations say 10 the United
States of America? They met tbem, I think,
in a very reasonable way. They paid some
respect to the fact that a great nation of
120,000,000 people, working against a-n agelong evil of admitted intensity, had corne to
the conclusion according to its conscience and
conviction as embodied in the constitution.
So from varions countries the United States
of America received sympathetie help. First,
ail the nations g-ave adbesion to a system of
port regulations necessary 10 prevent srnuggling by foreign ships visiting the Unit-ed
States.
Then came the wider sphere of
sympathetie assistance, which was in the
line of getting countries to pass legfislation or
make regulations, not 10 eniorce tbe probibitory law of the Unitcd States, which tbe
people of thc United States proposed to do
and ought to do themselvcs, but 10 make it
a litîle more difficuit for law-breakers and
rumi-runineri frein these countries t0 violate
the legally embodied conscience and conviclion of the people of the Unitedl States. Great
Bribain held conferences witb the Unitcd
States. Wbile sbe did flot go as far as the
United -States would bave likced lier' t go, she
ivent a long distance and placed tlifficultics
in tbe way of thlose wh o proposed to v ol-ate
tbe law of the United States, by extendiîng
tbe area fromltbe tbree-rnilc limait to tbe twelvcmile or the fifteen-milo limit-to bo exact,
one bour's steamning distance froin the shore.
Within that extended linjit, wbateveor it May
be. t1he United States xvas empowcred, so far
as British vessels were concerned, to hold
thora if they wore suspected, 10 examine tbem
if that xvas tbougbt nccessary, and 10 seize
tbcmi and take tbem into port. That was as
far as Britain xvent, but it was a great distance
10 go, and proved a great help) to the enforcement, squadrons and autborities of the
Unitcd States.
Canada adopted tbe saine principle, whicb
xvas embodied in the Trcaty of 1924. Cuba,
a near neighbour, did exactly what tbe United
States asked bier t0 do, and made a convention
or treaty under whicha clearance xvas refused
10 any vessel baving a cargo of liquor destined
to tbe United States, or wbicb, even tbougb
purporting 10 1)0 for other countries, was
tbougbt 10 be for rum-running
purposes.
Mexico, on tbe southern border of the United
States, concluded a treaty of exactly tbe same
import. Norway flot only refuses clearances,
but punishes navigators ur carriers wbo engage in Ibis illicit traffie. Eleven states bordering on tbe Baltie have passed legislation
Riglht Hon. Sir GEORGE FOSTEJI.

wbicb is favourable 10 the prevention of tbese
raids from outside, and lately Japan bas made
à convention along tbe same lines.
And now the United States cornes 10 Canada and says, "You are our nearest neigbbour."
-I tbînk I may well translate that by anotber
adjective.-"You are our dearest neigbbour,
our most intimate neigbbour, with wbom we
bave most of our dealings, and witb wbom our
relations are most agreeable." Tbey ask us,
xvhetber or not we cannot do the same tbing
tbat Mexico and Cuba bave done-not to go
over mbt tbe United States 10 belp tbem enforce tbe law, but simply 10 make it iess easy
for tbose wlio in our country band tbemselves
togetbor to defeat the purpose of American
legislation by smuggling liquors int
10 Iat
country. I tbink, honourable gentlemen, tbat
there is a vast difforence, according te, the
angle fromn wbicb you view tbe question. How
easy. it is to tell tbe man on the street: "That
is their owvn kettle of fisb; lot tbem stew it
thenisclxes. Tbcy passcd tbe legisîntion. It isý
their problem, let rbem solve it." But I tbink
they are *Justified in asking us out of good-wvill
and mut ual intere-.t to assist tbem 10 the
extent
aIf refiiie woffld-hc lawbreakers,
whetber their owni cii izens or ours, biarbourige,
and sustcnane, and aniniinit ian, and arnis,
in tbeir assaulf upon the legislation of a
neigb'bouring cotînîiivThere is a difference in tIse point of view,
but I tbink my point of viewv is n reasonable
one. So mucb tben with reference o thIe bistorical background of the United States.
Negotiations were commenccd bctwveen the
two governments in 1925, andl continuied for a
period of nearly two years, dnring wbich tirno
the United States was trying to gel its proposai before tbe Canadian Government and
t0 bave il, embodied in a convention or agreement. One tbing after another stood in the
way, and tIse final delay was cansed by the
faet tbat the Royal Commission xvas at work.
It was vcry good poiicy for botb our Governnient and tbe Goveroment of tbe United
States to wait until that investigation xvas
completed. So tbere was an interregnum until tbe report was finally issueýd and digested,
and thon tbere came tbe conference of last
January.
Now, it wonld be interesting 10 revîew and
comment upon what took place in tbat conference between tbe officiais of Canada and
the officiaIs of tbe United States, ail of wbom
xvere practical, clever men. I cannot read over
the report of what was said pro and con at tlîc
conference witbout feeling, bowever, tbat the
Canadian representatives were more fruitful
in finding objections 10 co-operation than ini

MAY 23, 1929
devising means by which both sides rnight
corne together to a satisfactory conclusion.
However, I ar n ot going to make any further criticism with reference to that. The report of the conference is open to ail members of the Senate who wish to read it, and I
think that Mie ten or twenty minutes required
to, do so would flot he badly gpent.
After these delegates had hield their conference and corne to no conclusion, the matter
carne before the Canadian Governrnent for
action, and the action that was taken is outlined in the letter of the Prime Minister of
the l5th of Mardi last. Just here may 1
rernark that it has been stated in nurnerous
headlines in the newspapers that the Govverrnent bad corne to a final decision, and
that that was the end of the matter. But
the Governrnent has not finally decided, and
it is to the credit of the Government that it
bas flot done so, and it is the hope, if not of
a]l the people of Canada, of a very large proportion of its reputable citizens that a better
conclusion rnay be reached. The Government
xvas wise enough not to close the door, and
if you read the Prime Minister's letter to
Mr. Pbillips you will find that hie expressly
states in the opening paxaigraphs thnt the Governrnent bas not corne to a final decision on
this rnatter. Then certain suggestions are
made that officers from the United States
force should be placed in certain Canadian
ports in order that they might despatch information to officials on tic otier aide. Tint
proposition bas heen as courteously declined
as it was courteously offcred, and the United
States Minister says tint in the opinion of his
Governrnent it would be of no particuler use.
For rny part 1 am ratier glad that tic United
States Governrnent bas corne te that decision,
for after all, the information which is provided by tic custorns officers as to the clearance and despatci of vessels carrying cargoes
of rurn, ostensibly for the United States, is
of very little practical use, because it is very
largely flctitious and the distances arc so short
tint tic boat arrives often at its rendezvous
before the information can ha acted upon. The
Canadian oficer takes tic information tiat
the captain of the vesal gives hirn, tihe naine
of the siip, its description, whitier it is bound,
and anytiing like tbat. Tbe loading of tbe
cargo is now aupervised by Canadian customns
officers-an improvement possibly on the old
systern. Inasmuci, iowever, as vessels carring suci cargoes do not dare to go into
United States ports, nor can tbey enter ticir
cargoes, because tiey are illegal, tiey seek an
advantageous place, of wbich there are thonsands along the lakes and rivers, for the disposal of tic cargo, the 'bour for wbici, witb

281

tbe appropriate cover, tbey are skilled in seeking. Tiat is the position at tic present
tirne.
Ifonourable gentlemen will, 1 tbink, agree
witi me that this is no 'ligit rnatter. It i' not
se simple as it sornetimes secans to be to tie
mnan on the street. This is an international
question. Wien one neigbhour nation prefers
a request, a request wiich it tbinks is not
unreasonable, and asks for consideration thereof, it hecernes necessary for the nation wich
is approacied to study the question in aIl its
bearings, and if it possibly can, to sympathetically and practically co-operate. 1 think it
is an international duty to do so, -and it is
generalIly considered in that ligit newadays.
We are passing into a sornewhat different
a trospiere frorn tiat wih prevailed before
the war. The býonourable gentleman to my
riglit (Hon. Mr. ýGriesbach) yesterday mnade an
amniable allusion to tic entiiusiasts wio gatier
annually at Geneva. Well, I take tbat in goýod
part. I arn bappy tiat there are seme enthusiasts wbo gatier at Geneva and elsewbere in
tic intercsts of pence. Tbe enthusiasts for war
bave iad tbings their ewn way during ail tbe
aýges, and a sorry rness tbey bave made of it.
If there is any possibility of the enthusiastie
forces of public sentiment in fifty-4our or sixty
nations of tbe world rnitigýating thc horrors of
war end rnaking more secure the hlessings of
pence, for Heaven's sake let us get down on
our knees and pray for týheir success. Caîl thern
en-thusiasts. Blessed he the enthusiasts. Wiat
a drah world we sho.uld. bave if there had been
none of thern in tbe past ages and were none
now.
There is a growing feeling that ne nation's
life is separated, as in a water-tight cernpartrnent, frorn the life of other nations, but
that tiare are obligations, benefits and interests whîch can be best effected hy international co-operation, good-will and underst-anding. To a large extent, tien, this is an international question, an.d on that ground 1 arn
sinceredy glad that the Prime Minister bas
not closed the door on t-he negotiations. Let
us hope tiat a solution may ultirnately be
found.
This is also *anation-al question, for it affects
Canada in rnnny vital particulars. Morally.
socially. and from an administrative and
governrnentnl point cf view we are deep'.v
concerned. No one can read tbe bistory uofolded in the reports of tic Royal Commissioi,
witbout getting a poignant and burniliatirug
sense'of tic position in which matters -tood
tbree years ago and tiereabouts. I siould like
to say that the attitude of G'ovcrnrnent in
Canada bas undergone a great change, andl 1

entry of liquor into the counitry of our neighbour to the south-and I can see no moral
distinction between any of 'them.
It is sometimes argued that we have no
right to interfere with an industry which is
legal in this country, and that consequently
we should not refuse clearances for the exports of brewers and distillers. But what is
legal is changeable. A thing which is lawful
to-day may, for reasons of public policy, be
declared unlawful to-morrow. We need to get
down to the truth that underlies the situation.
Let us briefly attempt to do so.
I do not know the number of distilleries
and breweries in this Dominion, but there
are many and they are increasing in number
and output. They get their product upon the
market in such ways as are open to them,
but they can get their liquor te the United
States only by corrupting officials, by breaking the laws of a neighbour country, and,
what is worse still, by active collusion, alliance
and co-operation with rum runners and
smugglers. Not a single cask of whiskey can
go out of a Canadian distillery and find its
way into the United States market unless
there is resort to corruption, subterfuge and
even violence. It is only by the connivance
and active effort of such a combination that it
is possible for this industry of brewing or
distilling to sell its goods in the United
States market. Every brewer or distiller
knows that. And every child of observant
nature and quick intellect, who is starting
out on the way of life with its ears and eyes
wide open, and who has an inquisitive mind,
knows just as well as we do what is going on.
It learns that a traffic is considered all right
so long as the desired price and profits are
obtained, even though the laws of another
country are broken. The inference is that
the same thing is allowable even though it
involves the breaking of laws in our own
country. My theory is that the man, who
does not respect the aggregate conscience and
conviction, as these have been framed into
law by democratie and constitutional methods,
of another country of equal civilization with
his own, is not very likely to honour the laws
of his own country, if as a result of violating
them he can make financial profits.
So I say we should give careful thoughtI shall put it no more strongly than that-as
to whether or not we are prepared to face international complications which are certain to
arise if this thing goes on; and whether we
are ready to risk the corrupting influence and
the schooling in actual lawbreaking which are
Do we think
offshoots of these operations.
we can afford to pay so high a price in order
that brewers and distillers may make bigger

profits? They have all the rest of the world
open to them to prey and fatten upon. They
should not be allowed to conspire with bandits
to break the laws of a neighbour country and
thwart the will of a friendly neighbour. We
are bound to seriously consider this question,
and some day or other we shall have to reach
a conclusion.
Let me make one other observation bcfore
I close the remarks to which honourable gentlemen have listened so carefully and so
sweetly. This is not a temporary emergency
question, nor a small one. The United States
is our near neighbour, a country of 120
millions of people, with probably as high an
average of intelligence, character and culture
By
as any peopile in the world possess.
immense majorities persisting over a series
of years, they have registered their will
and their conviction as to the treatment
which should be given to one particular
commodity within their own country. Should
we incur their ill-will, and, if so, can we
afford to do so, for refusing what seems to
them to be a reasonable sympathy and practical help. by providing place and opportunity
for this traffic to continue? Depend upon it,
the United States of America is bound to
enforce its law. President Hoover is pledged
to the enforcement of the law. Congress
passed a vote of $43,000,000 last Session in
order to carry out its enforcement. A body
of very able men were appointed just a
day or two ago by President Hoover to look
into the very bases and foundations of the
lack of respect for law and enforcement of
law, whieh is becoming so impressive a feature
of United States civilization to-day. All these
things look towards a determination to uphold
this law, to enforce it, and to continue it. It
lies before us, and it becomes us to think
whether or not there is not some means, other
than that which has already been adopted, by
which we may co-operate with each other to
promote amity or prevent the spirit of illfeeling which is likely to arise.
We have a young External Affairs Department. Take my word for it that if that
Department continues its existence, as it
seems likely to do, it will have plenty of
work which will be of such complexity and
such spirit and quality as will try the very
best of relations which exist between our two
countries. The "I'n Alone " case is an instance. Suppose, just for example, that
Belize had been in the same position of cooperation with the United States as Cuba,
and had concluded a convention with the
United States that it would not give clearance to prohibited cargoes which were bound
for the United States, though they might

SENATE
ostensibly be going elsewhere. As the Belize
authorities knew quite well when the "I'm
Alone " took its second cargo fromn Belize, its
first cargo was for Nassau, but neyer went to
Nassau; it was disposed of by a known rumrunner of hardened conscience and of long experience. The captain went back to Belize and
asked for clearance for another cargo. If the
proper conditions, such as I have stated, had
been arranged with the United States, Belize
would have said to the captain of the " I'm
Alone," when hie came back: " Did you go to
Nassau?" Being an honest man, hie would
say, " No, I went away up along the co-ast of
Florida and Louisiana, and got pointed of
there, and I arn back for another load." Then
the Belize authorities would say, " No other
load for you," and that troublesome international incident would not have oceurred in
the way it did, and Canada would have been
saved the humiliation of setting a fresh young
embassy to fight for a disreputable case.
Along the crowded border of thousands of
miles betw'een ourselves and the United
States, how many possibilities arc there for

equipped xith swift gunîboatýs, corning in constant contact with bands of crnm runners,
armed with sawed-off shot gens, carrying the
orders of Canadian hrewers and distillers,
suisething is sure to happen; and 1 ask the
Governm ent to, give its mcst serious attention to this phase of the question.
I thank you very kindly for listening to my
speech-the last I will give you at this Session. It may be that very fcw are to corne
after; things which happen here day after
day remind us of the shortness of human
if e. 1 love this old Chamber in one way;
I like it because of its associations, and my
associates on bothi sides. Altog-ether, I have
fouind no rabid partizanýship; I have found
the heartiest of good-feeling by members on
hoth sides, and a keen desire te, do the right
thing.
Let this Sonate take up just such questions
as this in its calm, deliherate and non-partizan way. Let it thoroughly sift them and
examine them, removed from the political
atmosphere, the fluctuations of which bother
the members of another Chamber, and perhaps the very best service that ninety men
could give to their country can be given in
this Chamber itself.
I commend what I have stated. I have
tried to keep myseif fromn heing voluntarily
partizan. I believe that the liquor traffic is
evil, and that continually. I believe it is the
biggest curse that ever plagued humanity;
Rigit Hon. Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

but I believe the problemn is being solved by
experimentation and by teaching, and the
time will corne in the history of the human
race when it will triumph over this, as over
ail other of its great human ilis.
To that end let us dedicate what years we
have rernaining, with our best efforts and
with unwearied purpose.

About two weeks ago I had, the priviiego
of bein-g one of -a party whýo went on a weelk-enîd motior trip through parts of New York

Whi-le ever th-ere I was interested
enough to ask some questionts of persoaa with

in his rmmd, but I feel thrnt a groît dcal of the
discussion on thiis side *of tise lime wouldl convey to the uninforsned thse ver'\
rne impresson in regard to. thse quantiîv of liquer
consumed in the Un:iteýd Staites and the pro'portion of it thiat is exported teo that countryfrorn Ca.nada.
I should thesreforo like the
riglit honourable, leader to clear up flic qui,,
tico xvhethcr or flot the stateinent, is truc, tbat
of aIl the imporicd liquor consumed in flhc
Unitod Staites only 5 per cent goos in fromn
Canadn. That statcm-ent ha.s been made on
what seern to bc good authority. 1 amrnnot
justifying- tise 5 per cent, but I undecstand
tha't tha-t is the rel.iti, e quantity for which
the Dominion of Canada is responsible, and
that 95 per cent of tihe 'liquios- corssumed in
the United States cornes from south-er ports,
and from manufactures in that country itself.
I happened ta be in thse southern part: of
tise United Sta-tes last suimmer xvhen the Democratie convention was being held ait
Houston, and I naturally teck oly'ervations,
and, also read a greait deal about the proceedings of that convention. Honourable mcmbers of thits House whýo cobserveýd events will

MAY 23. 1929
ramember 1,hât the Demooratic convention insisted. upon havi.ng a dry pls.nk in its plat.form, wbereas Mr. Smnith, the Democratic
candidate, icsisted on hav'ing a free band to
~wipe out the 18t Amendmenît and the Vol.atead Act, and t.he party went to the country
with thoee two policies. My reading and
-observation cd conditions ini Houston dSuing
the canrying on of that coniventtion oxyvineed
-me, beyond a sha>dow of doubt, that nover
was a convention theýt t2àked tem!pean.ne and
prohibition held in any city -in wbîch
intoxicating liquors were flowing more profusely. The Baltimore Sun, a very reputalle
-and dependable newspaper, which is disposed
to be Demoeratic, had a speci&l writer from
M'-hgo at the convention, and his dleseniptions of the dri.nking, and of the
-quantitiee of liquor that were being consumed by the very people who were carrying
-on this oonvention, wene ap.pailing. That was
-ona avent which rather oonvîuca-d me that on
the other side of the linie t4here la just as large
a parentage of hypocriey on thie subjeot,
-among political -parties and in other quar.ters,
-as thero is in this counitry.
I have had reason to ha in the United
'States, partieula4ly in the souithern parts,
juring the sununer, for the last four or five
yaars, and I -have tonfarred with business
men and other promiinent ciitizens there. The
information I have received, from thosa men
-was that they neyer had any difficulty ini
getting liqutor when they wanted it; that
ai.rnwt unlimited quasntitiais came in, and that
i-t was manufaoured in the country in ailmost
unlimited quantities. 1 have been in houses
down there where very fine qualities of aie,
of wine, and of brandy liqueurs, made on the
promnises, were served to the guests in the
hcyuse. I have sean that.
I have been ini departmental stores down
thero in which as you went about you could
see the varions parts which. make up stilîs.
You do net find thern ail in one place; you
Se onc part on one counter, another part on
another counter, and a third part somnewhera

parts, take thern home and assemble them,
and you have a stili for making liquor. My
information from reputable citizens is that
large departmental stores in New York,
Chicago, Baltimnore and othor cities carry on
the same kind of business that I have j'ust
mentioned.
Now, if it is truc that 95 per cent of the
liquor consumed in that country is made
there, or importad from other countries than
Canada, it seerna to me that the first duty of
the Government of the United States is to

285

tackle the 95 per cent, and not, to make so
much fuss about the 5 per cent. In any event
I should like it spread abroad in this country
that Canada is nlot responsible for the consumaption of the huge quantity, but that the
people of the United States are responsible
f or 95 per cent, as against 5 per cent which
-possibly goes fromn Canada.
Right Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM: Honourable gentlemen, I arn sure we were ail very
much interested in the eloquent, earnest and
interesting speech of our right honourable
friend from Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George
E. Foster). He always has something to say
when he talks, and thus he sets a good. example
to the rest of us. But there is one thing he
said with which none of us will agree-that
he is getting anywhere near the time when he
wili cease to balk to us in the Senate, and be
with us. We honour him, we admire him as
a Canadian, we look with pride -on the work
ho has done for the Dominion of Canada, and
we are ail of one mind in the hope that he and
his good wif e wili have a pleasant trip, and
that he will meet us next year and the year
after, and be here among us, giving us such
addresses as we have listened to to-day.
Now, I do flot see why I arn the leader of
the Government. I did not know anything
about it tili I got here, and I arn not yet sure
-of the reason.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: In
the fitness of things.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Thank you. 1
surely expected the honourable senator from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) to be in his place
this afternoon, and I made no preparation in
any way for taking charge of the business of
the House.
This is a big question, and a se'rious question. It has an international as-pect, no
douiyt; and I submit "iht we are gaining
ground and improving otir position. even
internationally, on this oubject as well as
others. I do oontend that our friends across
the line are more eager to co-eperate when
they want something then they are when we
want soimething. I think that is truc in
respect to nearly everything, even including
the humble ispud which my right honourable
friend described. They are lying in wait
wit'h a batchiet at the present time, until theïr
legislaition is passed, and 1 arn not sure that
the Canadian qpud wil1 not ho even more unpopudar in some parts of the United States
than a bottle of Scotch whisky. But, as my
right honourabla friand has îeiid. we are advancing. Short-circuiting was one of the
things invest.igated by the Commission. By

SENATE
short-circuiting I mean that a boat would be
cleared fron some Canadian port, would go
out two or three miles and then turn in to
some cove a few miles farther down the shore.
I presume that 'the end of short-circuiting is
due to the Liquor Control Act of the Provinice of Ontario.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: And the colection of excise befoire shipmnent.
Right Hon. 'Mr. GRAHAM: And the collection of exicise. Then the Canadian Government have ceased to give clearance to any
vessel that is not comipetent to make the port
for which it clears. For i.n-tance. they do not
give clearance for Cuba to a boat that cann1ot
make the trip. Then there were false
certificates. I am told they have practically
disappeared. Many of the things to which
my right honourable friend referred, in reading the report of the Royal Commission and
thô report of the Comm!ittce of the House of
Commons, do not now exist; and I think
we can saifely say that the Minister of
Customs bas been prett.y energetic in carrying
out the laws that we have. What the Minister
meant by that reference te potatoes was that
under the existing iaw the export of liquor
was like the export of potatoes, or any other
comtmodity, so long as it comýplied with the
law. I do net think he was saying that the
law might not be changed. Under the existing
law his statement was absolutely correct.
I do net want to cast anv dissension over
our friendship with the United States, whieh
was so ably delineated bv nv right honourable
friend (Right Hon. Sir George E. Fostcr), but
J think that before asking us to pass legislatien which will assist in the enforcement of
its laws a friendly nation should first see to
their enforcement in its own country. Ilt is
a hard task and a heavy one. but I submit
that so long as the United States continues to
select men ito carry out the provisions of such
measures as the Volstead Act from a party
and political standpoint, it cannot hope to
succeed thoroughly in their enfoncement.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
is now under the Civil Service.

It

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: But it has not
been in the past. Several years ago, being
a representative of the county of Essex, I
was moving in and -out along the border for
some years, and what I saw led me to the
conclusion tha't the attempted enforcement
of its own laws by the United States was
xvorse than a joke. The customs authorities
on the other side of the line, not very far
fron a big city, would watch certain fellows
start out with a boatload of liquor, and when
Piglt Hon. Mr. GRAHAI.

thev thought the boat was sufficiently close
to the American side they would find it convenient to disappear. What would be the
use of notifying those officers, except to tell
then when to get away from their posts? I
am not exaggerating at ail. Any person who
knows the conditions on the border wilil
thoroughly agree with me.
I am net so sure that my right honourable
friend is correct in his judgment about the
refusal of the United States to phice officials
in Canadian territory, and for this reason.
I aim told that a very large percentage of the
tonnage used in this run-running trade is
American 'tonnage and American registration.
The American officers could follow that tonnage right to shore. I am told also that a
very large percentage of the men engaged in
rutm-running are Amuerican citizens. American
officials coutld locate those men and could
take them in charge as soon as they roached
American territory, if they really wanted to
enforce the Act.
My right honourable friend says that
Norway
makes it an offence for any
Norwegian ship to carry an illegal cargo te
the ports of another nation, and that the
sailors are aise liable to punishment. Why
cannot the United States do the same with
regard to its own tonnage and its own sailors?
They corne into our territory, and the
Amierica
Government knows that they are
coming into our territory to violate the law
of the United States. Why does it net take
charge of that tonnage and confiscate it, and
punish its own citizens?
As I have said. this is a big question, but I
believe we are making progress. I do net
know what will be the answer of the honourable leader of the Government to this interrogation, because I am net the Government.
However, I will call it to his attention. But
this I do say, and J say it boldly, tiat in my
humble judgment the United States ought to
be more in earnest, more practical and less
political in its enforcement of the Volsted
Act before calling on any sister nation to do
much more than we have done. We must
net forget that Canada has done exactly what
Great Britain bas done, and that there may
be some very potent reasons why Great Britain
bas seen fit to refuse to acced:e to the request
of the United States to cease granting clearance to vessecls carrying liquor cargoes. Canada has folloed in the footstcps of Great
Britain, J think, in everything she has done
in regard to the twelve-mile limit, and one
hour's sailing from shore, and all that sort of
thing, but Great Britain bas net scen her way
clear te refuse clearances, even though that

MAY 23, 1929
bas been done by Mexico--which in many
bhings is flot a very good example-and by
Cuba.
Having said so mucli to show that the question is flot easily solved, and that there are
a great rnany things that we do flot see
clearly, nevertbeless I think we are rnaking
progress, and that the two Governrnents will
continue to keep closeIy in touch, and perhaps
will be able to devise some means to assist
in limiting the traffic in liquor frorn Canada
to the United States.
Having taken the bold stand that the United
States has not done hier best in this matter,
1 want to cali attention to another fact,
namely that our negotiations with our friends
across the line are not, always responded to
as quickly as tbey miglit be. For a time, you
will rernember, we were very dry, particularly
in Ontario. During that time we neyer had
any aid or sympathy from the United States
in stopping the flow of liquor from the other
side. I arn rnentioning this just to show the
attitude of rnany of our people.
Then there is the well known fact-it was
referred to before the Commission of investigation-that even since we have had liquor controt alcohol in large quantities has corne in
from the United States. Many of our druggists to-day buy alcohol at a very low price
because it has been smuggled in from the

discussed that question. Another matter of
pararnounit importance is the fact that every
smuggler who took a cargo of tiquor across
the imaginary line smuggled back just as fuil
a cargo of silk and things of that kind. Our
friends across the line did not assist us very
strenuousily in stoipping th'at sort of thing.
But our Customs Department, following the
investigation, put on more rnen, spent more
money, and put more boats into service in

impress on honourable gentlemen is that the
United States, in wishing us to go furtber tbaû
we have gone, to go further than Great Britain
lias gone, should at least do lier very best to
enforce lier own law. If she wants us to do
something, she should reciprocate, and reciprocate very heartily.
As I have said, I will eall the attention of
the honourable leader of the Government,
whcn hie is here, to the very cloquent rernarks
of My riglit honourabte friend.
Riglit Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: Will
the honourabte gentleman permit a question?
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: -Certainly.
Riglit Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: In
looking over the correspondence 1 find the
statement that Great Britain does not issue

clearances for liquor cargoes to any United
States port. That statement was denied by
memfbers of the Canadian del-egation, but I
find it was made by the British Embassy in
Washington and forwarded to the United States
1 wish my riglit honourable
Governrnent.
friend, who is now the leader of the Government-and a very agreeable teader-would
flnd out for me which statement is correct.
As 1 read it I corne to this conclusion: that
ewhile the Britisb ýGovernment does not issue
any clearances for liquor cargoes to the United
States, yet it is possible for liquor cargoes to
be cleared. I do not know whether the British
Government feels that if those cargoes are
intercbanged on the ocean, it bas nothing to
do with tbemn at ahl, and no authority. It may
be t bat between those two tbings there is a
tittie misunderstanding, and I think it woutd
be an advantage to get that matter cleared
up and know exactly how it stands.
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I certainly
will ask the leader of the Government to
look into that matter. My own view was
that to ail intents and purposes Great Britain
issued clearancetq for liquor that was assuredly
going to the United States, thougli it might
be short-circuited en route. From an article
that I read in one of tast night's papers,
purporting to originate with a Minister of
the Crown, 1 understood that Great Britain
still granted clearances for liquor cargoes.
Honourable
Hon. GEORGE GORDON:
gentlemen, in view of the fact that we have
a new leader-one whorn we aIl respect and
likp very much-perhaps, witb bis consent
and that of the House, it may not be inappropriate for me to add a few words with referencc to the speech of the riglit bonourable
gentleman from Ottawa (Riglit Hon. Sir
George E. Foster), to wbich I have listened
with great pleasure. Would it be in order?
Riglit Hlon. Mr. GRAHAM: There is no
law to prevent it, much as we miglit want
to.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I shahl be very brief.
I entirely sympathize with a great deal that
bas be-en said by my riglit honourabte friend
frorn Ottawa, because I have about as much
use f or liquor as lie bas. But this is a
matter that must be tooked at in a practical
way. If by one st-roke of the hand I could
wipe out every distitlery in the wortd, I
w0uld gladIy do ýit, provided th-at in 90
doing I should wipe liquor off the face of the
earth; but, knowing perfectly well that my
action would have no sucli effect, I think it
would be useless to attempt any such tbing.

SENATE
With reference to the observations madLe by
the honourable gentleman from P.icteu (Hon.
Mr. Tanner), who has spent some time in
the United States, 1 may say that I too
have spent some time there, and my observation is that the liquor which goes over there
from Canada does flot saturate even the
frontier. That liquor is met very close to
the 'border by a flood of liquor coming from
the interior States, which keeps Lt frorn flowing any farther. I have been to Nassau, icp
the Bahamnas, and 1 have been in Cuba, and
I arn sorry to have te tell my right honourable friend (Rt. Hon. Sir George E. Foster)
that I have there been shown vessel after
vessel loaded with liquor leaving for tha
United States.
Nevertheless, the quantity
wvhich goes f rom there and frorn Canada, as
my henourable friend from Picteu (Hon. Mr.
Tanner) has said, is only a small proportion
of what is consumed in the United States.
I arn satisfied that the United States can
neyer reach the point desired by the so-called
dry law, because in order to do so t-hey would
have to do certain thin-gs which they neyer
will do. To begin with, they would have to
pass a law preventing the farmers from planting corn. That would bring about a reduction
of millions of quarts of liquor.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: What would they feed
their hogs?
Hon. Mr. GORDON: In addition te that,
they would have to pass a similar law to
prevent the ra.ising of barley, they would have

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: If there are
more left we probably shaîl hear froin them in
due cou-se.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I do net desire
Vo oppose this Bill in any way, but before it
is given the third reading I think it is fitting
that we should consider briefly the results of

289

the indiscriminate policy of railwamy building
and granting of charters in the past, the fruits
of which pofiey Parliament and the country
are now plucking. Do- honourable gentlemen
realize that within the last week Parliament
bas authorized the purchase of 786 miles of
railroad, nearly ahl net self-supporting, at a
ceet of 329,000,000? We have increased our
total obligations Vo that large extent without
getting a mile of aidditional railroad for the
accommodation of passenger or freight trafflc.
I arn not objecting Vo our authorization of
the purchases, because I was a member of the
Committee which considered the Bills, and I
thinir that in each case there was a reasona'ble
necessity te acquire the road in order Vo give
the people cf certain districts the service Vo
which they were entitled, or Vo .put an end Vo
the a]ready big leaks which. were draining
some provincial treasuries. But the burden
bas been merely ransferred Vo the Federal
arena. Surely the picture that we saw in the
Railway Committee the other day of the dire
results of indiscriminate railroad building and
charter granting should bring us Vo a realiz,ation that we must determine now and forever that there shaîl be ne more railroad construction, except as extensions Vo the Vwo
existing systems, unless we can be shown in
a manner that leaves no room. for doubt that
there is justification for the work.
Hon. Mr. MeME ANS: I understand that
there is another $51,000,000 Vo be granted Vo
the Canadian National Railways for the purpose of building a railway station; so we shaîl
be adding 380,000,000 Vo the debt of this country, I do net know how f ar this thing is
going. Year after year we are adding Vo the
burdens on the people, and there seems to be
in sîght no end to these huge expenditures.
The public debt is increasing by leaps and
bounds, but there is no growth in the country's prosperity.
I should like Vo ask my right honourable
friend (Right Hon. Mr. Graham) a question.
If a man were endeavouring Vo select a place
in which to live Vo-day, wouid he choose Vhe
Province of Manitoba, for instance, in the
face of the heavy taxes that are imposed upon
our citizens? I am noV one who is given to
decrying bis own country, nor do I indulge in
whispers of death, but I am wondering whether some prospective settlers do noV consider
that our high taxation is a greater handicap
than they care Vo assume. Is it net time to
caîl a hait in the unnecessary expenditure of
huge sums of money? Should we noV endeavour Vo institute a policy of retrenchment,
with a view Vo lightening taxes instead of increasing Vhem year by year?

78600-19
REVISED EDITION

290

SENATE

I realize that it is useless to raise my feebie
voice in protest against the Government's
policy in this matter, but I hope that the
time will come when we shall no longer be
asked to approve of the expenditure of
$6,000,000 for some railway here, $10,000,000
for another railway there, and $50,000,000 for
a new station somewhere else. And I may
say here that the station which I mentioned
at the beginning of my remarks is likely to
cost a great deal more than the estimated
amount.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I am sure most
of us will agree with the general tenor of the
remarks af my honourable friend from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. MoMeans), but I think we
might with propriety postpone criticism of
the Montreal Terminals project until we are
more familiar with the -details of it. I had
the advantage of getting a couple of years
ago some intimate knowledge of the New
York Central Railway terminals in New York
City, and I think without doubt those terminals are among the most profitable of that
railway's investments. I am very hopeful
that the Montreail Terminals will prove a
great asset to the Canadian National Railways, and I regard the project that is about
to be undertaken as a sound business proposition, provided it is carried to compietion
reasonably, without extravagant expenditures
of money and construction on too large a
scale.
The point that I wished to emphasize when
I rose just now was that we have this week
aoquired six broken-down railroads which have
not been paying their way and have been
burdens to the provinces where they were
owned. We have now assumed those burdens,
although we know that the money spent on
the roads will never be a good investment.
The lesson we should learn fron this is that
in future we should grant charters no more
to private concerns, but only to the two
large railway systems when conditions warrant the extension of their lines. The continuance of the old policy can result only in
saddling generations to come with unnecessary
debts.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I agree with
what the honourable gentleman from Welland
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) has said about the
Montreal Terminals-not a station project.
I feel sure that when the Billl coimes before the
House, if the information we have is correct,
I shall be almost able to convince my
honourable friend from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
MeMeans) that the proposed terminals will be
a great asset. I -ball say no more now.
Hon.

Mr. McMEANS.

I have been for some years of the opinion
that not only should xve go more slowly in
the granting of railway charters to private
companies, but we should endeavour to corne
to some arrangement wiith the 'provincial govcrnments whereby they will not grant charters
to cormpanies thait wild have to be taken over
by the National Railways eventually.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: That is locking the
stable after the hose is stolen.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

Hon.

Mr.

GRAHAM.

On section 1-export of power:
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Honourable gentlemen, this Bill cornes before the Coffmmittee
now on aceount of an amendment wihich I
mnoved some time ago, the effect of which
was to bring aIl licenses or aIl permits for
export of electric .power under the control of
Parliament, 'in 1935. My objeet in presenting
the amndment was to have someibody explain the reason why the proposed. change in
the Act was sought. I think the first Bill
that ever came before this Parliament for
incorporating a company for the purpose of
prodsicing po'wer and conneecting its wires with
wires across the Niagara river was in'troduced
in 1887.
T-here was a company then inconp.orated to deve]ep po'wer at Niagara Falls.
In 1891 it ýcame before Parliament again and
as-ked for an extension of six years within
which to perforn or terminate itis work. In
1900 it again came before Parîriament requesting a funther extension of time, for another
six years, wh.i'ch would bring it to the year
1906. In 1906, after those Bills in conne-ction with the Ontario Power Company of
Niagara Falls had repeýatedýly corne bel ore
Parliament, a Bill was presented by Sir Charles
Fitzpatrick, thon Minister of Justàce, for the
purpose of vo-,;ting in the Goernor in Council
the right to issue lýicensesý.
The Bill was
thoroughly discussed, -but it was not passed,
because of the contention that it was important to cengult with the Ontanio authýorities.
Sir James Whitnev, thon Premier cf Ontario,
was consultcd and in the following Session, in
1907, the sarme Bill was presented by the
then M'inister of Justice, the honouralble
gentleman who is my right-hand neighbour
(Hon. Sir Alilen Aylesworth). At that time
there was a full discussion, and the suggestions of the Premier cf Ontario were given
due consideration.
The Bill went before
Com-mittee, where it wvas further disGutssed.
When it camie before the House of Commons
for third readîng, the then Leader of the
Opposition, Right Hon. .Sir Robert Borden,
movod an amendaien, the purposeocf which
was to transfer to the Railwa.y Commission
the power te issue licenses for the expert of
electricity.
Let me say en passant that the principle of
exporting power by license was then universnlly admitd, but various amendmnents were
proposed bcaring more on the subjeet of who
should exorcise the authority. The wisdom. of
leaving te the Governor in Council any discretion as te the issue of dicenses for the expert
cf power was challenged, on the gruund, as it
was then put by Sir Robert Borden, that the
Govennior in Council was a transient and
partisan body and there was danger that ail

MAY 28, 1929
applications wouid not (receive equal consideration. The first amendinent ws.s negatived
without being put to a vote. Another aiendment was ,proposed by Dr. Sprouie, and t.his
was negatived on the third reRding. A third
amendment was aiso thrown out upon a
division. I see niy hoinourable friend fromn
Wentworth <Hon. Mr. Smith) amiling. He
was the -last mani to speak iupon this question.
I think the vote was 38 to 102. There was a
big miajority of the bouse in favour of granting the Governor in CounceM the right to issue
licenses for the export of power.
As I stated aut the opening of my remaîrks,
Parliament, lad granted a charter to the
Ontario Power Company of Niagara Falls, and,
as everybody in the House knew, the ooupany
was at this turne in existence. The onl'y discussion was on the export of power from
Niagara Falls. I think my honourabie frieiid
froma Wentworth (Hon. Mrt. Smith) did
mention some other powers, but nobody else
mentioned any oythers tlian those at Niagara
Falls.
The principle cf controhiling the export of
.power by iicense was flot disputed, the whole
discussion being over who shouid exercise this
right. When the present Bill was introduced
in the Seinate I looked up 'the Hiouse of Commons Hanswrd to see what reasons we
advanced to justify the proposed change of
legisiation. I found thaît the mover of the Bill
had advanced no other reason than that,
electric power being one of our great natural
resources and being exported in sucli increasingly large amounts, it had beome necessary
to give the control of the export, to Parlisiment.
But if the increase in the exports is the chief
reason -for the proposed change, then what
about controlling the export of pulpwood, and
iWheat, the exports -of whidh have also increased
wonderrfuily? I see no reason why I should
change my mind and vote differently £rom the
way I did in 1907. This Bill went through the
House of Commons without discussion, and I
suppose we shail neyer know the reason why
there was no opposition to it. My contention
is that if licenses for the eflport of power are
to lie granted by the Crown-and, they are
priviieges of -the Crown, as wtas said by the
then Minister of Justice (Hon. Sir Alien
Aylesworth)-they shouid lie granted by some
departiment of the Governient or by some
officer representing the Crown. But if it is
agreed that there should lie a change in the
systema which formeriy was universahly admitted to be the right one, of exporting under
a license, then I say that that change ïshould
lie coxnpiete and thst ail appiicanits should be
subject to the saine authority. My right
honourabie friend from, Ottawa (Right Hon.
Sir George E. Foster) said it was possible that

293

Parliament might refuse to grant a license. 1
agree with him there, but I think that Parliament, having granted a compa.ny the right to
deveiop electric porwer end conineet its wiree
with those of an Americsn company, wou'id
respect its obligations and sot as wisely towarde
those who have had lice'nses in the past as
towards those who will require them f or the
first time in the futu-re.
My reason for moving the amendment is
that I think it is unfair to have two classes
of exporters, or two different authorities to
regulate the same thing. If in the past the
Governor ini Council lias flot overstepped the
bounds of wisdom in issuing licenses, are
there any particular reasons now why we
should fear that in the future, under the
same circumastances, the Governor in Council
will be icas efficient and impartial? On the
other hand, if we think it is in the interests
of the country that Parliament should control
the export of power, that the question of the
advisabiity or inadvisability of granting the
right to export electrie power shouid he submitted to Parliament, then why should this
control not be exercised over ail companies,
including those who now hold lîcenses and
are exporting power? I want my position
to be very clear. If it was feared in 1907
that the Governor in Council was too partial
a body, too much under the influence of
partisan motives, it must be admitted that
the Huse of Commons is far more so. The
House of Commons is equaiiy as transitory
as the Governor in Council, and just as liable
to be influenced by partisan motives. Af ter
ail, we might say. that there is oniy one stable
body, which is flot transient and not partisan,
and that is the Senate.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: But, if any bill for
such a license is defeated in the other bouse,
it wiii neyer reach this Chamber for analysis,
and we shall be heIpiess.
Are we justified in changing the systema that
lias been in force since 1907? No new conditions have arisen and ail the companies
that are now exporting power from Niagara
Falls, with one exception, were exporting at
that time. The whoie subject was thoroughly
discussed during two Sessions. The matter
came before the Senate and it was amended.
The Bill required ail companies exporting
power to take out a license three months
after the iaw -came into force, and in the
Senate the three months period was changed
to six months. This amendment was agreed
to by the House of Commons and the Bill
hecame law.
As I have said before, my soie object in
moving this amendment was to discover if

294

SENATE

thore was any justification for the proposed
change.
1 made the declaration, which I
new repeat, that I had ne interest to protect,
and that I was net inspired by anyone to
propose this amendment.
But I thought
that if Parliamont dosirod to stop the granting of licenses for the expert of oloctric
poer, it was only f air that those Amorican
companios which to-day are buying power
from this country for consumption in the
United States should have a fair notice of
That ivas the reason why, in

purpose was te have these questiens discussed.
By being givon ample notice, if
companies foar thoir liconses will net ho renowod after 1935 they have timo te provide
other moans for the generation of electricity.
If I caoi becorno convincod that the proposed

I do net want te press rny amendrnent, but
as thingýs now stand I desire te brave rny
ameodment for consideration by honourable
gentlemen.
lion, C. E. TANNER: Honourable g-entle.
men, of course 1 am no more interesied thon
vny other h.onoura:-ble momber of thils Heuse in
the Bill.
It camne from the lieuse of Ceinmens; and happons te be standing in rny name;
se probaibly 1 should say a few word, in "oply
to my honourable friend w4ho has just resumied
his seat.
1 arn a little at a loss te understand just
what my honourable friend means.
From.
his romarns one might think that the Bill
proposed the taking of some rather grave
stops which might imporil the public interest.
Now, I presume we, ail are going te d--ai with
this Bill with a view te the public interest as
we unuderstand it, and I comfess that I am
unable te sc any danger in Parliam,Žnt itseif
undertaking te decide when power shall or
sh-ah not be oxported.
If this Pariiamont,
embracing the House of Commons :rnd the
Sonate, is net an authority to whorn that discretion may safely be entrusted, then, honourable gentleimen, I do net know whorn in this
,country we rnay trust.
It appears to me
4hat the argument of rny honourablo friend
would lead inevitabiy to the conclusion that
we do not trust ourselves.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU:

Oh, ne.

Hon. Mr. TANNER:
It seems te me bis
stand, if endorsed 'here, wouid imply that we
l-ave not sufficient self-conifidence to reinvcst
ourselves with the authority to decide when
power shahl or shahl net be experted.
I arn
Hon. Mr. BUREAU.

net prepared te take that position and 1 ho-pe
that othor honourable membors of t1iis lieuse
are net prepared te, take it.
It is quite true that in 1907 Parliaroont delegated authority te the Governor in Ceincil
te, issue liconses for the expert of power. My
honeurablo friend seems te ho under the impression that there is ne good reason why the
stop takon at that timo shouid be re-tra;ced.
Well, I amn net disposed, fier do I think other
honourable gentlemen are, te stand fast te,
a policy because it was adoptod twe'nty years
age.
Time pastses and conditions chang.., and
what was the hest policy in 1907 is flot
necossarily the best in 1929.
There fias been
great advancement in the development of
olectric power since 1907, but I do not think
it is any exaggerajtien te, say that right now in
Canada we are only bogînning te, go ahoad in
this direction.
I arn looking forward te the
tirne ws4ion this country will have a very mnucb
larger population and much more extensive
development of electrie pewoer, and I see ne
rea.sen why Parhiarnont should net take any
sto-p which niight be caloulated te saleguard the public int-orest for the future.
Corning back te, my first point, if we cannot
safely lodge the control of expert licenses in
the hands of Parliament, I arn at a loes tn
understand to whern we can entrust this discrotrenary poer.
Now, heneurable gentlemen, this Bill was
introduced in the other lieuse in 1928, and if
it had neot fallen by the way with a number
of private bills.-it having been introduced by
a privato momber-it wouid have cerne te this
lieuse in the ferrn in which it now is, wvîth
the approval and the bonediction of the Geveromont of the day. This year it was introduced earlier in the Session, and more quickly
passed its sovoral stages in tho other lieuse.
It has corne te us 'again in a forrn %vhichI
feol bound te accopt. net morely as the Bill
of a private membor, but as one which bas
the full approval and the benediction of the
Goverroment. To my mind ne argument is
nocossary to ostablish that peint, hocauso anyone who knows anything about the proceodings of Parliament-as my honourable friends
bore do-must realizo that it is net very
likely that the Bill wvould have corne bero if
it had net the approval of the Goernment.
All thoé Goveroment of the day bad te do was
te lift its hand, and the supporters of the
Governmont would net have allowed it te
corne hore. Se I arn troating this Bill net
merely as the Bill of a private mombor of the
othor Chamber, but as oe involving a very
important matter of public policy whicb cornes
te us with the Governmont's approval.
I
beld that unýder our parliarnentary system, if

MAY 28, 1929
a Bill deals with an important matter of public policy, whether it be introduced by a
private member of not, we must look to the
Government of the day to approve of it or
not ta approve af it; tu accept it or to rejet
it. I think it is its duty and responsibility ta
the country flot ta let such an important Bill
become law unless it has menit.
I do nut know wbether my honourable friend
<Hon. Mr. Bureau) intended to suggest such
a thing or not, but in my judgment there can
be no reflection on the Governor in Council,
for the reasan I have just stated, and for the
further reason that if -the Bill dues pass and
some question arises in regard ta the export
af leiectrical. power, any proposition submitted
to Parliament must corne through the Governor in Council. The Governor in Councîl
will advise Parliament; the Governor in
Council will give Pariliament information;
Parliament will look ta the Governor in Council for guidance and information and counsel
an the subjet. After ali, the Governor in
Council is but an integral part of Parliament,
a Committee of Parliament; and I hope that
this Chaniber will not in its mind divorce the
Governor in Counoil f rom Parliament, because the twa are part of the one syatem which
controls public business in this country. As I
see it, we have beo re us a Bill dealing with
an important public question, the whole prin,ciple of wlich is 'whether or not we shahl provide for the future an additionail safeguard, if
yau like to cail it that, by allowing Parliament ta take back inta its awn hands the control of the issuing of licenses for the expart oi
power. That is the funds.mental principle of
the Bill.
The pravisas, as honourable members na
doubt have observed, deal with licenses already issued. They provide that the Governor
in Council shahl continue, if weil advised, ta
renew or cancel wholly or in part any -of
those licenses, and may either authorize an
increase or grant a license for the purpose oi
meeting temparary emergencies. That part
of the Bill, I arn înformed. was put in speciaIly at the instance and direction ai the Government of the day; and I think the other
Chamber, sa directed and sa advised, Vook a
very wise course.
My honaurable friend has moved an
amendment which would fix a date-1935, if
I remember rightly-when the Governor in
Council would cea se ta exercise tbis power.
1 submit that we are taking a very important
and ver>' prudent step when we re-invest
Parliament with power in regard ta licenses;
I further subinit that we are also taking a
very wise and very prudent step when we

leave the Governor in Council, for the
present at least, to deal with the licenses
which have been issued. We have had a
etatement submitted. bY the honourable
leader af bhe House, who is now absent,
showing the licenses that have been issued.
1 arn convinced that those licenses, the circumstances surrounding them, and the conditions under which they were issued, require
careful and perhaps prolonged study, and
that we are flot at this moment in a position to deal with them summarily, but should
be on f ar safer ground if we accepted the
proposition whioh I understand came from.
the Government of the day, and which is
embodied. in these two provisos thiat my
honourable friend opposite proposes to
amend.
I do not know that there is anything f urther that I can add to the discussion at
this stage. I do not know whether 1 have
convinced my honourable friend that it is
not necessary for us to adhere to the policy
of 1907, or that we -are flot stepping on to
dangerous ground at ail. I hope that he will
see that it is sufficient for the day to take
the one step, namely, to re-invest the authorit~y -in Parliament for tho future, leaving
it with the Governar in Council ta deal with
the licenses already issued.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Honourable gentlemen, on a previous occasion, in Committee
of the Whole, I stated that as far as I was
concerned lI had not sufficient information
regarding the Bill to enable me to arrive at
a judgment. I suggested that the leader of
the Government should, obta-in a list of the
different companies exporting power, the
quantity of power exported, the price at
which it was sold on the other side of the
line, and the terms of the contract. Hanourable members of this bouse will find some
staitistical tables on page 208 of Hansard, but
the answer to my question la not there. 1
think that it is essential ta any member ci
this House, in order to pasa judgment on the
Biill, to, know the terms of each contract;
and there are other important terms besides
the q.uantÊity of power expod'ed and the price
at which it is sold. I refer especiily to the
terms governing the right of renewal, whether
by license or otherwise. In the absence of
this information ýI shall be unable to pass
judgment an the Bill.
1 attach a great deal of importance to, the
su1bject deait with biy this measure. 1 doubt
whether we in this country realize the magniýtude of the national wealth represented by
electric or hydraulie.power. I think we should
realize n-ot on.ly the value of the power îtsel.f,
but the national weal1th which la involved ini

296

SENATE

the use of such power, on account of the
expense and the number of persons necessarily
added to the population by reason of the
man-4power required for building and operating the works.
Unless it i shown that there is a special
reason for dealing with this measure now, I
would suggest that it would be wiser for this
honourable House to wai.t until next Session,
and then, early in the Session, entrust to a
committee of this House a study of the whole
situation under the different existing contracte
in regard to the export cf power. I cannot
suppose that there is any hurry. If Lt were
not so la.te in the Session I would move for a
reference of the Bill -to such a committee as
I suggest, but it is evidently too late now to
do so, and therefore I think it is our duty
to defer the consideration of the Bill until
next Session, and then to make a complete
study of the whole subject.
An additional reason for taking that position would be the fact thait in several respects the relations between the United States
and Canada are to a certain extent in
the making, and while taking steps towards
conserving the whole of our national wealth
for this country, we shouid be very careful,
on -the other hand, to avoid infringing upon
any contract.
The terms of some of those contracts may
be renewable with the eonsent of the Governor in Council. If there were any such provision if wouid be an infringement of the
contract to substitute Parliament for the
Governor in Council, and I think we should
be careful to avoid the danger of committing
a mistake of that kind.
In dealing with a Bi-I I always try to understand it fully, but in this case I feel that we
are not sufficiently endlghtened to pass judgment upon the proposal. Unless honourable
members should think otherwise, I should be
tempted to move that the committee rise, and
the adoption of such a motion would of
course kill the Bill for the present Session.

arrangements in the matter of exportation of
power have been valueless, and that the
situation has some elements of danger in it.
I am rather inclined to agree wit:h the honourable gentleman from De Salaberry (Hon.
Mr. Beique) that we are very ignorant of all
the circumstances involved in matters of this
sort. I should be disposed to think favourably
of the proposaI he has made. If, on the other
hand, the House desires to proceed with the
Bill, then I feel that I ought te move an
amendment whichî
woudd bring out in bold
relief the situation in which those domestie
producers of power will find themselves.
As has been said by the honoumble gentleman from La Salle (Hon. Mr. Bureau) and
the honourable gentleman from Pictou (Hon.
Mr. Tanner), under the Bill oif 1907 the power
to license resided in the Governor in Council.
It is the purpose of this Bill to remove that
power from the Governor in Counoil and place
it in Parliament, but not wholly so. The two
provisos are pret.ty far-readhing in their nature.
The first reads:
Provided nothing herein contained shall be
deeined to affect the right of the Governor in
Council to renew or cancel wholly or in part
any license for the exportation of power issued
before the first day of January, 1929.
In other words, by the terms of this proviso
the d.isposition of all electrie power now under
license remains where it was before. I cannot conceive of its being transferred to Parliament unless the Governor in Council were
able to cancel the contract outright, and then
I am not sure that the proviso would not
apply. What is being transferred to Parliaments control is the right to export power
that may be developed and leased in the
future, but is not now in contemplation at all.
Then there is this further clause:
Providel also that the Governor in Council
may grant licenses, or may authorize an increase

Hon.
Mr. GRIESBACH:
Honourable
gentlemen, I have been endeavouring to interest the House in an aspect of this Biii
which is net without some importance. I have
spoken for the power plant that has been
establ.ished in Canada for the production of
power for use within this country, but that
acciden.tally, owing to falling off in demand
for power or because of exceptionally high
water or some other condition, has a substantial surplus of power, which, unleass it can
be disposed of, would be a dead loss.
I am in the heartiest agreement with those
who think tiat in the past some of our

body whit these words "temporary emergency"
mean. When I asked the honourable leader
ot the Government (R'on. Mr. Dandurand)
vhat they meant, his answer, as given him by
some member of the Government, was that
any dictionary would define an emergency.
But I am not asking for a definition; I can
go to a dictionary and get a definition myself.
What I want is an explanation of Government policy in respect to this matter. On
a previous ocasion I added the further
observation that Government officiais, in interpreting a statu.te, ought not to interpret it
as a court of law does, but should carry out

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE.

in the amount of surplus power to be exported
undier existing licenses, in cases of tenporary
emergency.
I hav

endeavoured

to ascertain

from any-

MAY 28, 1929
the statute in accardance wit~h the terms and
tenor of the explanations made by representatives of the Government in the Bouse. Sa
I think I was right in asking what this word
"emergeney" meant-whether it meant an
emergency in thie United States from a shortage of power, or whether by a stretch of
imnagination it rnight be taken ta mean the
existence of a situation wherein sonieLody
produced more power tiban hie could use.
Having no explanation of that term, I do not
know what it means, and I do not think
an3flbody else does, because nobody bas tauched
the kernel cd it.
Those people for whom I amn speeking, wha
have power plants erected in Canada for the
purpose of developing power here, who accidentally-beoause of failure of orders in aur
own country, or hecause of higlh water and
such oonditîons-produce more power than
they can use, and who have .power ta seli,
muet be very amai in nuimber. As matters
now stand, I -believe that the Gedar Rapids
Power Company and the Niagara Power Company, I think it is, export, 96 per cent of aIl
the power that is eiported, and the smalier
cancerne in Canada export only 4 per cent
altogether. These smaller concerne are the
peoPle for whom I amn speakcing. They are
not covered by either of tihese provisos, hooause tlhey have na licenses as yet. Under
this proposai, if it carrnes s ut is, shouki, these
people bave a few thousand extra horse-power
to, exiport, they wil ha put ta the expense
and delay of having to a4pply to Parliaiment
for a BilIl. Parliement might not be sitting
at the moment of need, end even if Parliament were in session, the time taken in passing the Bill would seriously militate against
any profitable transaction.
What I hoped for was that we mnight have
an amendmenit ta this Bill ta provide that
these small exporters cf power migt appy
to the Governor in Council to procure the
necessary permit with the least possible delay.
With that end ini. vie'w 1 ihad prepared an
amendinent, which m.ight go in as a third
provisa:
Provided that the Governor in Council may
grant licenses ta export power when such grante
are consented ta by the Government of the
province where the power originates.
That raises aniotiher question of provincial
rights--the question of the iright of a province to have same say in the disposai of
power, while reeognizing clerly the right of
4
contrai by the Federai Paii iame'nt. The
Provincial Governent is on the spot and
knows the situation. If, having granted its
ow'n terme ta corporations or companies developing power in a smal1 way, the Provincial

297

Governmaent is of the opiniion that those
small companies should have the right ta
export theiir accidentai surplus and there4y
add something to their revenue, the Governor
in Counicil might be well advised to agree
ta such -a smali egport under a special Act.
Othevwise, under the terms of tihis Bill, ail
thase small exporters who have no licenses
for the exportation of even the amallest
quantity of power-and who, according ta, my
recollection number a hundred or so-must
corne to Par'iiamenit for a private Bill. They
must put up the necessary, fund!s, and in addition ta that expense mnuet endure a delay
of several months in getting the Bill through.
In many cases the resuit wýiH- not jusify the
expense. It is ta bhese small ex!porters that
I would dlirecet the attention of the House.
I arn inclined ta, agree with the honcuraible
gentleman from De Salaberry. From converiation with other honourable gentlemen
1 arn led te thinik we are actuated more ar
Iess by the motive of parnie when we propose
pasuing this Bill at ail. We ought to, know
a great deal more about the su:bject hefore we
solýeminly ernbalm in a stataite of Parliament
our somewhat uniconsidered views on, the
matter.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I may be allowed ta,
add this, that on referring to page 367 of thie
Debates of tihe Bouse of Gormnons honouraible
gentlemen will see that this measure, which
is a very important one, did flot recetive the
attention thUt it deserved. The second reading and the passing of the Bill are covered in
five or six lines cd Hansard. Ilt was not
discussed at ail. A motion was made for the
second rcading of the Bill and was agreed ta
imýmediatély, without any de4bate Then the
Bilil was rend thie third time. I thin;k that is
an addit;ional reason for us ta detfer con-*
sideration of the menasure until next Session.
We ought ta be fu.ldy ad'vised.

any idea where those small exporters are? I

Hon. Mm. WILLOUGHBY: 1 want to say
a word on surhsection 2 of this section. If
provides that:
No adjudication or other action of a juvenile
coutrt wifh respect to a ehild shaHl ho quashed
or set aside because of any inforrnality or irmegulardty whlere it appears thaf the disposition
of the case was in the best inferests of the
chlId.
That provision is most emibarra.sing to anybody practising law. and if is bardiv fair.
An irregularity appears in the proceedxngs mn
the juveuilo court, and action is faken f0
quaAh the court proceedýings. Aff c this bas
been apparenthy successful thoere arises the
intcrest of the ehild, wihich is always a confroversial question, and a muatter of opinion.
I tbink thait at least tbere ,should ho some
provision fbat a person wbo, in thec interest
of the cbild, properly takes procecdings for
the purpose of quashing thc action of tbe
juvenile court, even if unsueccessful, shouhld ho
indemnifled as to costs. If you bring irregular
procecedings in any other court you are punished by baving to pay fli ceosts; but in this
case you may bo successfuh and yet bave f0
pay your own costs.

This provision bas

I tbink i 0 the Criminal Code there are some

provisions similar to this. In the province of
Quebec, for instance, even in civil matters we
used to be very formal; but recently the
Governmenit and the people at large came to
the conclusion that it was wise to get rid of
these formalities.

Hon. Mr. WILOUGHZBY: I am not going
to press my suggestion unduly. The proceedings are not always taken under this Act.
As a matter of fact, they frequently are iastigated by some private individual. However, I shall not press my point.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:

As a rule proceedings

are taken at the instance of an officer whose
duty it is to help, to guide, and to see that

the child is protected. The interest of the
child always should be the causé for the proceedings, and it is the duty of the judge to
see that this is so.

(5) If a child who has been before a juve-

of
mile court and is still under the surveillance ha
such court has been caused by the court to

placed in a foster home outside of the jurisdictien of such court or has been committed by
the court to the care or custody of a probation
officer or other suitable person or te an industrial school, outside of the jurisdiction of such
court, the court may take any action with
respect tW such child that it could take were the

child within the jurisdiction of such court, and

for any such purpose any warrant or other proces@ issued with respect to such child may be
executed or served in any place in Canada outside of the jurisdiction of such court without

the necessity of complying with the provisions
of slbsection 3 of this section.

The comment by the Department of Justice is:
The purpose of this amendment is t authorize a juvenile court tW exercise control
over a child who has been before it, and who
has been committed tW a 'home or place of detention outside the territorial jurisdiction of
the court.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Can the right honourable gentleman give us a little more ex-

planation?

What does it really mean?

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: If a child is sent
to another province, the original court still

looks after it.

Hcn. Mr. MeMEANS: Does it change the
old law in any way, and if so, what is the
neoesity for the change?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It is an addition to
the law to make it more efficient.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: These children
move from place to place.
The amendnent was agreed to, and secticn
17 as amended was agreed to.
Sections 18 to 21, inclusive, were agreed to
On section 22-recovery of amount:
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Honourable
gentlemen, I wish to move that the present
subsection 3 of section 22 be stricken out and
the following inserted in lieu thereof.
(3) Where, under the provisions of this section or of section 20, a sum of money is ordered
to be paid, the court may adjudge, either by the
order respecting the payment of such sum or by

an order made subsequently, that the same shall
be recoverable by distress and sale of the goods
and chattels of the party and in default of
such distress by imprisonment, and the amount
shaH be so recoverable or shall be recoverable
in the same manner as a fine imposed under
any provision of the Criminal Code is recoverable, or shaH be recoverable as provided in any
Act of the legislature of the province making
provision for the recovery of fines.
That amendment has been drawn because
of objection to the present draft by the
Deputy Attorney General of the Province of
Nova Scotia. The proposed new subsection
is more specific.
The amendment was agreed to, and section
22 as amended was agreed to.
Sections 23 to 35 were agreed to.
On section 36-Contempt of court;
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I have an
amendment to this section. Strike out section 36, and substitute therefor the following:
(1) Every juvenile court shall have such
and like powers and authority te preserve order
in court during the sittings thereof and by the
like ways and means as now by law are or may
be exercised and used in like cases and for the
like purposes by any court in Canada and by
the judges thereof, during the sittings thereof.
(2) Every judge of a juvenile court, whenever any resistance is offered te the execution
of any summons, warrant of execution or
other process issued by him, may enforce the
due execution of the same by the means provided by the law for enforcing the execution of
the process of other courts in like cases.
The comment of the Department is as
follows:
Section 36 as presently drafted is not satisfactory to the sponsors of the BiH because it
does not go far enough, and some slight objec-

INQUIRY AND DISCUSSION

Holl. J. D. TAYLOR rose in accordance
with the following notice:
That lie will eall attention to maladministration in the Penitentiaries Brandi of the Depar-tment of Justice, and wiil inquire whether
or flot the Government wi1I direct investigation
of thie matter hy royal commission.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, any proceedings that 1 have in contemplation with
respect to this inquiry miglit lie shortened
very mucli if the right honourable gentleman
Ieading the House (Right Honl. Mr. Graham)
would signify the assent of the Government
to the proposition I am about to make. This
notice has been on the Order Paper f or ten
days now, and I presume the right honourable gentleman has received some advice on
the subject from the Department concerned.
Riglit Ronl. Mr. GRAHAM: Let me hear
the argument.
Hlon. Mr. TAYLOR: I am pleased to find
that the riglit honourable gentleman is at
least in a receptive mood, and although they
are lengthy, I will proceed to present, not se
much the arguments as the f acte. Let me
say that as to these facts I speak by the
book, from a record submitted to Parliament
-a very lengthy record indeed, which 1 have
done my hest to houl down into reasonable
compass.
About this time hast year I directed the
attention of the Senate to this subi ect and
concluded, as I shall now conclude, with a
request for an inquiry. Up to the date of
prorogation hast year the honourable gentleman then leading the House (Ron. Mr. Dandurand) had not been able to get into touch
with the Department of Justice, pleading the
inevitable rush at the close of the session; so
I could get no answer before the House
prorogued. After prorogation, in answer to
a communication that 1 addressed directly to
the Minister of Justice, I reoeived from him
a reply tihat, as tille Wsrden at New Westminster had been dismissed simply that efficiency and harmony might lie promoted, and
as there were no charges affecting the character of the gentleman conoerned, lie did not
see that any good purpose would lie served
hy an inquiry. Since that time the head of

MAY 29, 1929
by Superintendent Hughes against an officer
of the Penitentiaries Branch of the Department.
In case anyone who bas read the voluminotis
documents from the Superintendent to the
Minister, none of which have been disclosed
to Cooper, has been misled, I wan.t to read
to the Huse now the lust officiai report made
by Superintendent Hughes on Cooper while
he was stili a warden in the service. That report is to be found on page 243 of the return.
It is frora the office of the Superintendent of
Penitentiaries, and is daited Ottawa, October
7, 1927. The officiai inspection hy Superint-endent Hughes and Inspector Jackson and an
engineer of the 'Department who d-oes flot
enter into the st.ory, and whose namne bas
slipped my memory at the moment, had
taiken place about the middle of September.
Freish frora that inspection, the Supermntendent
se'nt the usual letter to bis Warden. I read
froin page 246:
Some of your officers, more particu]arly your
instructors, do flot appear to realize their position or underotand thiat they are employed in
a disciplinary institution where discipline is
essential and where a chain of responsibility is
imperative. Most of the discipline officers appeared to be doing their duty whiie a number
of them were very new and muoh could flot
he expected froin thein.
The type is visibly
improved sa compared with what it was some
years ago. but there is not the esprit de corps
that existe in some of the other penitentiaries.
Outstanding in this respect, I would mention
Dorchester and Prince Aibert, with Manitoba
also doing fairly well in thie respect. This is a
condition you ehould set youroelf about heartily
to iraprove.
The small yard within the'brick enceosure 'bas
been wonderfully improved since my last visit.
Work in conneetion with the north wi-ng, kitchen, new chapel, etc., 'bas been done in a most
praiseworthy manner. It bas not heen done as
speedily as I would like to have seen it. The
laundry and changing room were in exceptionallly good condition- in fact ail of the sbops
were iniproved as compared with previous years.
Work being done on the administration building while I was at your institution was being
carried on splendidly-in fact, if continued at
the saine rate it would be ready for the roof
in a very short time. I will hbreathe a goocl
deal easier when that building is completeýd and
the gateway erected. No penitentiary is worthy
of the namne with a construction sueh as exisrted aet your institution when 1 took over
as Superintendent. It was a joke.
There seems a great deal of unnecessary
obstruction regarding movement of officers and
performance of duty in connection with the
handling of keys and locking of doors between
your office and -the dome. It is better to, err
on the aide of caution than to be too lenient
and lax in administration, but ama of the
opinion that several of the present methods
of doing things in that ha'llway particularly
during the noon-hour are unnecessary. I hope
to visit your institution next year earlier than
I did this yeav and I trust will find the work

303

prohiera I left you carried out and a tremendoiis change made in connection with the
entire place.
If there is anything that we may do at this
end, more than is being done at present, we
will be glad if the matter is brought to our
attention, to asest in every way. The most important things in connection with your construction at the present time are the Deputy Warden's residence, the new administration building and the roadway across the front.
Just here let me interpolate. This is told
by Superintendent Hughes to Cooper.
Hon. Mr. HAYDON: Will the honomiable
gentleman say to wha-t 'period the report
refers?
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Yes. I tbink I did
say so. This is the report on the lest inspec,tion macle during Cooyper's iýnouismbency.
It
is dated the 7th of (>ctober, 1927. This is
from, 'the report of the 'leslt visit thiat Superintendent Hughes made while Cooper was
Warden. H1e says here:
The most important things in connection with
your construction at the present turne are the
Deputy Warden's residence and the new administration building.
A few lines before tihat he says the work
being clone on the administration building
was being earried on splendidly. That ie, the
most important work of -the institution was
being carried on splendidly.
Then he
proceeds:
Your fariner should 'be given a smiall gang of
safe men and an officer to properly guard thern
and he should be made work every available
day during the year at clearing up some of
the 'land in order that your institution may at
least grow its required supply of vegetables,
roots, etc., as well as sufficient oats to, feed bis
horses.
I had better rend to the end. There is not
much m6re.
It is the intention to, remove a portion of the
old 'board wall'l, twelve feet high, each year
and replace saine with a Permanent non-climbahle fence. This is something tha-t you should
make arrangements for in connection with your
work problein. I feel tha-t if you diseuse motters witb your Deputy Warden, Chief Trade
Instructor and decide on your industrial problemn you wilI not have the difficulty you have
been experiencing.
It woufld appear that a
great deal of waste effort bas in the past existed
in the British Columabia Penitentiary. I hope
to see týhis removed.
The Structural Engi-neer, Industrial Inspector Jackson and myself have discussed this
matter very fully since we lef t your institution.
I have written moderately as compared with
our remarks regarding some of the things
mentioned. It is recognized that you are et
turnes handicapped by fog, perhape more so
than other penitentiaries, but if yourself and
your officers bave only the intereet of the penitentiary at hieart, do not worry about matters
outside, build up a happy family amongst your

SENATE
staff. This does nor, mean that the Warden
should asseciate with bis guards socia'lly and
after heurs, but it does mnean that the Warden
and bis; family inust respect the officers aud
familles under him and treat thein in preper
mauner, else neither esprit de corps nor succes4
will resuit.
Yours sincerely,
(Signed) W. S. Hughes,
Superintendent.
1 wonder who would imagine that within.
a few weeks of t.hat report Suporintendent
Hughes wouýld bo recomanending te the Justieg
Department that this man sýheuld 'be summari]y dismissed from the service fer luefficiency and for fa.iling to promoto harmony,
wben the iast report is in e'very sense cemnpiimen-tary te his admiuistratien-eemplimentary whiie written in the spirit of criticisma by a Supeintendent. There is pyraise
larne, but, on the ivho1e, t'he praiso
and
predominates; and there is the promise that
the Superintendent wiQl meot the Warden
again next yoar. Before the year comes about
hoe is writing that vile paragraph, wbich I
have read, about the application to theo msurance company, te indicate that Cooper is a
man of dc'fieient mienýtali'ty and flot te, be
triiste-d eitbher with the administration of a
peuitentiary or out.side work.
The first paragraph is 'ne administration."
It says thene:
Relative te the above, youn administration gtaff,
being enbirely new, oould net be expected te
undenstand penitentiary administration and control as officers who have been unauy years in
the Service wvould. 1 foinid a great deal in

the boundary iwallI will net go inte that, beteause thore is an
answor We it, but I will rail attention te, the
fact that that was goiug back fouir yoars te
Cooper's first yenr.
The next paaragraph reads:
An assistant was appo<iuted for the Accountautt
w-boni I pensoually waw a fair portion of the
timie, -wben at your insqtitiition lu 1926, driving
tr-ucks around tîte prison yard.
A -wbol yean had passed beffore ho t'hought
it was worth while te ask the person why
hoe vas driviug trucks, or te check Cooper
about it. 'Me answen, I may say, is t.ypical
of the aniswer te most of these criticisrn3.
This c>ierk wvas eugage.d at -the time as temponary storekeeper and 'vas dri'viug n truck

TAYLOR.

occasio>ns as iuefficient, but you did nothiug
w-hateven of colnstnuqtive nature te bave mnatiters

It was the Su;perintendent's duty te remOV13
the' storekeeiper, who brad helen Teportetd mauy
times as inefficient. He dees not do se, but
comes back for anotheir report.
You iwent whole-'heartedly bebind the appointment ef youn presenit Chiet Keeper, Mr. Goss,
,te the position of Obief Trade Instructon.
That was 'two years ago, and tbree years
since Goss retired as Chief Keeper. It gees
on:
The work on the Depuity Wardeu's bouse,
whi-ch sbouild have ýbeen cornipleted and eccupied
before new, bas been eairried on ini a most
indiffernat manuer.
The werk lu connection with your farmn dees
net &ppear te be taken seriously, apart fromn
the piggery, which appeared te be dlean andi
the hegs iii good condition.
Do honouraýbie gentlemen note that in al
this report there is not a word about the
priseners lu the peu?
The Superlutendent
seems te have been totally uuaware of wbat
condition the 300 prisoners were in, and the
good aud safe busbaudiug they bad hadl
fromn Wardeu Cooper, but hie bias time te go
eut aud ceunt the hegs lu the piggery, and te
ascertain that the farm was net properiy
adrninistered.
Tbe farm, I may say, is a
joke. And there is somethiug lu the report
about gaVes being open at noon heur, wben
ail the men are luside. But apart from these
criticisms, there are ail those expressions of
praiso and satisfaction with Cooper, and
ackuowiedgment of improvements that had
been made under several heads, iu spiteocf
difficulties due te, the presence et now officers.
There is also the promise of a friendiy conference next year. Now, what came over the
spirit of the Superintend-ent's dreamn betweeu
the writing of the letter cf October 7 and the
dismissal of Wardeu Cooper?
In tbis file we bave some of the private

5-o'clock-tea letters from Warden Cooper.
The first of the series complained that the
Warden and the Inspector, who had travelled
three thousand miles for the purpose of inspecting a great institution, were in their
correspondence paying no attention whatever
to the 300 prisoners, not even to the extent of
mentioning them in the correspondence, but
were filling up page after page with what they
saw at the 5 o'clock teas-how many pieces

respondence was going on then, and that is
what sorely touched the social tea Superintendent and induced him to send the series
of abusive and destructive letters immediately
following that hymn of praise.
Warden Cooper answered this letter on the

answer on pages 252 and 253 ef the report.
The answer is not solely to the letter of the
7th, but is based alsa on Superintendent
Hughes' private and confidential letters about

naturally became annoyed at that and finally,
perhaps with more courage than discretion,
asked Superintendent Hughes to mind his own
business and make no further reference te the
women and families of the staff in the official
correepondence. Cooper finished his repily to
Superintendent Hughes de this way, as set
out in page 252 et the report:
For a Warden to reacih hie greatest efficiency, he muet not only have the support of
his superior, but it must be generally known
that he will be upheld unIess proven to be in
the wrang. Wifthout that support and common
knowledge of it, his preâtige is diminished and
hie difficulties increased. But when he finds
he is officially censured upon conclusions hased
upon insufficient premises and that there are
recorded againat him statements which have no
foundation in faet, he is robbed of the confidence necessary to handle hie staff and the inmates committed to his charge for detention
and reformation. No su-bordinate can act freely
when he feels hie actions may be miesonstrued
and he may be given the reverse of the benefit
of the doubt.
During the two weeks which have passed
since receiving your letter, I have endeavoured
to free myselif from this feeling, but cannot
do so.
I therefore respeetfully ask that this correspondence be forwarded to the Honourable the
Minister for his consideration and that I be
permitted to communicate directly with him on
niatters arising out of these letiters, and on
other subjects affecting the Penitentiary administrations.
I would also ask that should the Honourable
the Minister then deem an investigation necessary, that it be conducted by one other than
an offici-al of the Penitentiaries' Branch.

Yours faithfulfly,
H. W. Cooper,

Warden.

Superintendent

Hughes

made

a

simply

furious rejoinder to this respectiful request
from a man whom he had threatened with
dismissal in a private letter, saying in effect:
"Unless you bring these two women together,
and compel your wife to accept on cordial

terms this other woman, I wil'l remove you;
I put you there."

"I put you there," he says,

and perhaps it is truc that the Civil Service
Commission has nothing te do with appointments under Superintendent Hughes. "I put
you there," he says, "and I will remove you
unless you bring this about." That is what
caused Cooper te say: "If my position is
menaced, I ask the right te appear personally
before the Minister antd to plead my case."
Surely the man had a right te do that without being abused for it. The result of this

appears at page 254, under date of December
8, 1927, as a Memorandum from Hughes te

the Honourable the Minister of Justice. As
I have sized it up, this one letter contains
nine or more absolute misrepresentations or
direct falsehoods. I say that on the basis of
my own knowledge and with a full sense of
my responsibility as a member of this honour-

able House; and the unfortunate Cooper dees
not know te this day what the contents of
this letter were.

In the meantime, during those months
while the aerimonious oorrespondence had
been going an, something had been happening out in British Columbia.

There was a

carpenter-instructor naned Robertson there,
an official for about one yea'r. The reference to this is on page 164.

with leaving

He was charged

post without

authority.

The Warden telegraphed to Otitawa the
circumstances and recommended that this
officer be dismissed, because in his opinion a
fine would have no beneficial effeat on
Robertson. He also asked that the names of
two eligible persons be sent to him from a
list submitted a few months previously, se
that he might replace him.
I might say that the man haid left his

post in the ward, -leaving fifteen convicts, four
or five of whom were lifers, entirely unattended.
This was a defiance of one of the strictest

rules of the institution, namely, that no one
should leave his post without written authority from his superior officer, who of course
would have power to replace him.
Cooper sent down the ful particulars with

his report, and also the evidence that he had
taken from the Chief Keeper and the Chief
Trade Instructor, Allan. The latter was in the
confidence of Superintendent Hughes. He
has been spaken of, and still is, in terms of
the highest confidence, and I believe he is

here on headquarters duty now, but I am not
sure of this. He is a man of irreproachable
character, and is net, and never was, a partizan
of Cooper's. He had supplied the evidence;
Instructor Alian himself had told this man te
get out of bis place and back to his ward,
where he belonged. He had joined in the
report to the Warden, and the Warden simply
heard it. But what did Superintendent Hughes
do? At a cost of upwards of $1,000, in the
most penurious of all the Government departments, he sent Inspector Jackson straight
out to British Columbia te investigate whether
or not they should remove an offier of only
one year's standing who deliberately went
away from bis post, leaving fifteen prisoners
unattended, including several lifers.
This occurred during the cake correspondence period. When Inspector Jackson got
out thera he took the part of a friend of the
accused; not an investigator or prosecutor,
but a man there making excuses. His reports
reflected on Cooper for having ventured to
take notice of information conveyed by the
Chief Keeper and the Chief Trade Instirctor.
He recommended that Robertson be fincd $15,
that he be restored to duty, and that be be
paid for all his time while he had been under
suspension. He recommended further that the
Superintendent send word back at once, because h wanted to restore Robertson before
he left the institution. On the same day that
all tbis was done he was restored.
The man
was put back, but the Warden was snubbed.
On the very day when Jackson did this he
in turn was reported by Cooper. The report
is not on the file; possibly it was private and
confidential.
He was reported by Cooper for
an indiscretion at New Westminster, which
had caused grave scandial and was the subject
of general conversation on the part of guards
and convicts alike.
Cooper's duty was te report this, and be did report.
No investigation
was held.
It was worth sending Jackson
across the continent over a carpenter-instructor who had leSt his fifteen prisoners unattended, but no investigation was held into
the case of this high officer in the Department
causing such a scandal as he is alleged te have
caused there.
Indeed, his own answer was
taken by the Superintendent as absolutely
satisfactory, and Coopers word was not
credited.
The Inspector, went back to
Ottawa.
Some one may say that perhaps this carpenter-instructor was a very valuable officer,
more valuable tban the Warden who recommended his dismissal.
That question was
asked by Jackson of Chief Instructor Allen,
how would be rate Robertson, and be said,
Hon.

Mr. TAYLOR.

"I would rate him at about 50 ,per cent." That
is, he was just coming and going; be was net
a particularly valuable man.
Two weeks later the same Robertson was
reported again for two offences in one day.
The first was that, being nominally on duty
outside of the institution, he attended in the
office of his assistant carpenter-instructor at
eight in the morning, and until 9.30 sat beside
a prisoner, named, in a ward, conversing intimately with him.
The assistant finally reported him to the Deputy Warden, Trollope,
as interfering with the progress of a place
where the assistant was supposed to be in
charge.
Trollope saw him, and passed on te
Warden Cooper the complaint of the assistant,
with bis own addition te it.
Cooper had no direct connection with that
information at ail; be was simply the recipient
of it.
He held a penitentiary inquiry, the
evidence being taken down in shorthand, the
witnesses being Chief Trade Instructor Allen,
Deputy Warden Trollope, and carpenter-assistant Chaplin, ail establishing the man's committal of those two offences, two in one day,
just two weeks after be had been restored by
Inspecter Jackson.
The Warden sent a report te Ottawa.
When ail that information came te Ottawa,
what do you suppose Superintendent Hughes
did with it?
Gave it te this very Inspecter,
Jackson, whom Cooper had reported two weeks
before for investigation; as much as te say,
"Now, Jackson, <ere is your chance at Cooper."
And what did Jackson do?
Reference
te this is at page 237 cf the return.
Before
lea.rning anything about it except the evidence
that Cooper had sent-the evidence of the three
chief officers establishing those offences-Inspector Jackson says:
The whole case has the appearance, ei-ther
rightly or wTongly, of retaliution.
And having established his opinion, and
bis course of action, to Superintendent Hughes,
the Superintendent appears with another report te the Minister, withholding from the
Ministe.r tihe fact that the Trade Instructor and
other superior officers of the institution have
testified against Robertson, and that Cooper
is only a mechanical actor in the piece; and
he receives from the Minister authority te
send Jackson out on another trip te make anether investigation between Cooper and this
accused carpenter-instructor.
At the same
lime, and only as a secondary matter, the Minister says, "When he is out there let him investigate the charges made by Cooper."
I
am entitled te assume that the Minister was
innocent in thus commissienîng Jackson, because be had not ail the information before
him when be gave that instruction in per-

MAY 29, 1929
fectly good faith to Hughes.
The Superintendent had written to the Minister-see page
261-with reference to Cooper's letter of
October 31, as follows:
The Warden's action in writing the letter lie
has to the Superintendent demonstrates that he
has not fully recovered from the serious illiness
with which he was afflicted :last year. The best
friend he has ever had, and he admits it, is the
Superintendent of Penitentiaries.
He recognized the weakness of.his second attempt to get
rid of Instructor Robertson. He knows that
if anyone investigates this case the result could
only be favourable to Instructor Robertson. He
himself is guilty of insubordination in doing
what he bas done. It was recognized when
Superintendent was at British Columbia in
1927 that the Warden was in somewhat of an
unsettled state of mind and far from being
the officer he was when transferred to that
Institution. His recommendation that one other
than an official of the Penitentiaries Branch be
sent to investigate this matter is an insuit and
an aet of insubordination. Any other Wardenî
would have received the letter written by Superintendent in the proper spirit, made any explanation he deemed necessary in the proper
way, and would have promised at once to agree
to remedy anything the Superintendent had
suggested.
It is respectfully submitted and recommended
that Inspector Jackson be sent to British
Columbia to make full enquiry into this matter,
and also report on the present condition of the
Institution, ineiluding any complaints the
Warden may have to make.
There is not a word there about the recent
difficulties with Jackson, Cooper's report on
him, or the evidence that Cooper had sent
down. That is all withheld from the Minister,
and on thait partial statement the Minister
makes this order (page 262):
Inspeotor Jackson is instructed t go imimediately to British Columbia to investigate
the whole matter, and report on present conditions in the Institution, inciuding all complaints fron the Warden and others, and he
should be given all papers, documents, or correspondence concerning matters causing the existing difficulties and troubles.
The next I want to rend is Superintendent
Hughes' vernion of those instructions. I thinik
this is the most remarkable document ever
written in connection with a sworn investigation. He says, at page 266:
Please take all evidence in connection with
this investigation ýunder oath. Secure the services of an outside stenographer and I would
advise your being very careful in the selection
of this person. Place them under oath not to
divulge any matters resulting in connection with
the investigation nor to retain extra copies of
evidence, or books containi.ng shorthand notes.
Do not permit other than those called to give
evidence to be present in the court, and please
use your best endeavours to keep the fact that
an investigation is being held from the newspapers and public generally. I trust you will
impress the necessity of this being done on those
giving evidence.
Do not permit the admission of extraneous
affairs that do not pertain to penitentiary
management to be introduced by any officer.
78600-20à

307

By that sentence he excluded the very
thing that Cooper had taken the responsibility
of asking the Minister to investigate. Cooper
had applied to the Minister to investigate the
threat that he would be d-ismissed because he
would not tel his wife that she must make
up with the other woman. The Minister sent
his officer to make an investigation into
all the matters under discussion, but the
Superintendent limited this and issued the
order that no transcript of the evidence
should be retained by the reporter, nor
should he retain even the note books.
I have had a great deal of experience
in listening to evidence and seeing the
taking of evidence on enquiries in courte
and in other places, and I never heard of anything of that kind before. I can conceive of
no honest reason why such an order should be
issued, and the only purpose that could be
served by having the notes destroyed, it
seems to me, would be that the evidence might
be manipulated to suit the ends of the person
giving the order. If any other suggestion is
forthcoming, I should like to hear it.
I am told-and to this extent I must depart
from the record-that when Jackson went up
there he moved around amongst the officers
in the penitentiary grounds, talking to this
one and the other privately, and ascertained
from them what, if anything, they wouild say
to the discredit of the Warden; and if they
would say nothing to his discredit they were
not called, but if they would, then they would
be called and, following a preliminary talk
with the person who was to give the testimony, Jackson would turn to the reporter and
say, "Now, you can take that down." And a
series of leading questions would be put, in
order to get from the witness precisely what
Jackson needed. I have the written evidence
of the result of that process in the case of
two witnesses, at page 224 of the report. W'hen
Cooper sent down the evidence of Deputy
Warden Trollope and the carpenter, Trollope
reported:
That while visiting the Carpenter's shop this
morning albout 9.30 I went into the Paint Shop
and siw Instructor Robertson sitting by the
side of inmate No. 3212-de Bortoli. On my
entering the Shop Mr. Roberteon got up and
I spoke to him regarding the shipment of a
crate to Inspector Jackson. He did not seem
to know exactly why this had not been shipped
and I went outside to'Mr. Chaplin to enquire
why. I did not make the enquiry, as Mr.
Chaplin at once made the remark that it was
unfair for that gentleman, meaning Mr. Robertson, to be allowed to carry on as be was dodig.
Asked what he meant, he replied "Sitting alongside inmates for periods (I think he mentioned
hour, or hour and a half) was not conducive
to discipline-he was trying to get as much
work as possible done by the men, but snih
actions d-id not assist him." I asked if lie war

escape; sending a conviet condenmed to
lashes out to work before this punishment
was inflicteid, and exposing him to the temptation to attempt an escape, for which the
unfortunate received an additional term of
punihrnent; the addition of hours of useless
duty in retaliation on guards who asked their
rights under the regulations; the levy of $6,000
upon the Dominion Treasury to keep the
Acting Warden in luxury at a fashionable
hotel in Vancouver, while the regulations
direct that the Warden shall reside at the
penitentiary. All these things have come
under Inspector Jackson. Surely this is an
incomparable record of accomplishment for
one year.
Is it to be believed that the
Inspector owning this record is being recommended by the Superintendent for permanent
appointment to the office of Warden, and
that he in turn is being hear'd as a suppliant
for higher pay for his endorser, the Superintendent?
That is the kettile of fish stewing now at
New Westminster.
Some of us have heard
of Kingston and the penitentiary there. In
his letter to the Minister, Cooper ventured
to say that he addressed him in the hope
that he would avoid a state suich as had been
brought about at another institution through
continued friction between the Warden and
the Superintendent. When Inspector Jackson
was holding his inquisition ,he insisted upon
ful particulars of what he called this charge.
He threatened Cooper, a gentleman, a lieutenant-calonel in the military service, and
Jackson's senior in the penitentiary service.
He threatened him with twc weeks in Oakalla,
which he said he ha'd authority to infliet upon
him unless he answered every part of Jackson's inquisition. He made him teill who was
his informant, and what penitentiary he
meant. I have lost my reference for the
moment-lost it permanently, for I am about
through-but all this is in the evidence.
Cooper said his reference was to the Kingston
Penitentiary and to Warden Ponsford. He
was asked, "From whom did you hear it?"
and fie said, "Do you, Inspector Jackson, asg.
me that?" "Yes," 'he sai-d, "and I demand
your answer." Then Cooper said, "I heard
it from you, Inspector Jackson, and Superintendent Hughes, when you were out here,
in numerous free conversations, open ta any
persons who woulid listen to them." Inspector
Jackson in his report tenders an unsworn
statement contradicting Cooper's sworn evidence that he took part in any such conversation, and says tihat he never heard of
àny difference or difficulty between Superintendent Hughes and Warden Ponsford.
Superintendent Hughes, on his part, writes

a confirming letter describing Cooper's statement as an odious misstatement. He denies
it in a most positive way.
There is not a soul in this Parliament who
knows anything about the relations between
Kingston and Ottawa who is not aware that
Cooper was correct in every particular in his
statement, though perhaps he was injudicious
in making it, and that if Inspector Jackson and
Superintendent Hughes were put upon their
oath and compelled te answer, as they compelled Cooper to answer, and answered as they
did in that correspondence, they themselves
would be in danger of spending seven years
behind the bars for perjury.
Now, is that a state of affairs that should
be investigated, or is it not?
I feel very
keenly orl this subject, and I believe that
every syllable of what I have said is easily
capable of establishment anywhere under any
process. I feel for the people of the penitentiary service; I come from a penitentiary town,
and I want ta see ended the reign of terror
that has been maintained by Superintendent
Hughes.
I want to see placed over the
penitentiaries the sort of government that will
put an end forever to the conditions there existing. I am fully aware, as I have stated
before, that the last amendment ta the
Penitentiaries Act was made with the object
of putting a responsible Superintendent over
the inspectors who were then on duty, although
the inspectors of the day were men of very
high character indeed.
I recall partioularly
the late Douglas Stewart, whorn all old-timera
in Parliament knew very well. Over men of
that character it was thought desirable to
place a Superintendent.
Most of us who are
acquainted with affairs of that kind know
what happened that recommendation.
A
Cormittee appointed to choose a superman
to be Superintendent failed to find any, and
the job went to the Senior Inspector by promotion. The penitentiaries are paying the
penalty to-day.
This Goveirrnment appoints Commissions to
investigate every little post office, every little
lighthouse, where anybody says a disrespectful
word about the local big man. Commissions
issue as a matter of course. Why hesitate in
a matter of this importance to grant the request that I made last year, and that was refused for a cause which does not now exist?
Colonel Cooper is the victim of a most serious
situation.
Why refuse the inquiry which
he has asked for in letter after letter to the
Minister since bis dismissal?
I regret that this House is not in a position
to give effect ta its wishes or desires except
through the impression tihat may be made by
any member on the honourable gentleman

310

SENATE

who is entrusted with the responsibility of
leading the House.
I say that; the right honourable gentleman opposite me (Right Hon.
Mr. Graham) is a fair man, a man closely in
touch with affairs all his lfe, and so must
realize that the mass of statements in this
record could not be got together except under
very great provocation, and tihat anything that
has given rise to a return of 512 pages is worth
more than the little effort involved in the independent inquiry that I ask.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I shall make
but a few remarks in regard to the matter
which has been referred to in such great detail by my honourable friend. He has the
advantage of being familiar with all the circum.stances. Coming, as he does, from a small
city like New Westminster, he is in a position
te acquire a knowlege of the fa'cts more easily
than perhaps he would in a large city. I was
astonished to lean from the remarks of the
honourable gentleman that after an investigation was d.irected, no copy of the verbatim
evidence was accessible, and the shorthand
writer was ordered not to reta-in his notes.
I think it is the duty of the Senate and
the other House to guard the good name of
the public servants of Canada. The man in
question here, the Warden of a penitentiary,
oecupied a higli and important position, and
we shouild not deny to him an opportunity
for the fullest investigation by an independent
party of the circumstances which have been
referred to by the honourablie gentleman. In
any case where similarly improper incidents
were brought to the attention of the House
by any honourable member I woulid take the
same stand, without regard to the side of the
House on which he was sitting.
The honourable gentleman, in addition to
giving us a statement of the facts from his
personal knowledge, read a voluminous correspondence which has been difficult for me,
and perhaps for other honourable gentlemen,
to follow. But he has todd us that of his own
personal knowledge it is necessary or desirable, in the interest of the public and of
former Warden Cooper, to have an independent investigation. I think we owe a duty
te publeic servants to make sure that no subordinate is denied by his superior the right to
ample investigation of any charge of unjust

Department, and net by some outsi.de party.
The complainant in this case has no ground

for an opportunity to clear his name. If
the charges that he has made should on investigation prove to be unfounled, let the
consequences faîl on him. I am quite satisfied
that any gentleman appointed by the Minister
of Justice, at the suggestion of thi-s House,
woul-d make a report that wouid command
our confidence. Nothing else is asked.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: May I ask the
lihonourable gentleman from New Westminster
what was the date of the dismissal of the
Warden?
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR:

Hon. Mr. TANNER: Inless my riglit honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr. Graham)
wants ýto go on. I should like to move the
adjourniment of this d'ebate. Of course, if he
wishes to speak now, I shall net intervene.
Sometimes there 'is an understanding in this
House that any honourable member who desires to speak on a subject should precede
the honourable gentleman who replies on behalf of the Governient; but I do not know
whether that is a (lefinite rule or not. If my
riglit honourable friend desires to make a
statement now and I imay have tlihe opportunity cf ioving the adjourmnent of tie
debate, that will be quite satisfactocy to me.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: We are getting pretty near to the end of the Session,
and my opinion would be that, since we have
taken most of the afternoon on this discussion,
we might go on with it till 6 o'clock in an
endeavour to ýfinish it. I have not a long
statement to make, but I would rather that
ny honourable friend spoke first, because he
miglit say something to which I should reply.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: If I might nake another remark, I was jockeyed
out of this
House-I hope that word is not disrespectful;
T do not intend anything of that kind-last
yearr, while waiting goodnaturedly for a rcply
from the Department of Justice. Now, a year
later, I again bring this matter to th attention of honourable gentlemen, and I think
before the subject is dropped we should know
what the prospects are of getting an inquiry

into the circumstances which I have revealed.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Tanner the debate
was adjourned.
NORTHERN ALBERTA RAILWAYS BILL
THIRD READING

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM moved the third
reading of Bill 71, an Act to incorpoate the
Northern Alberta Railways Company and re-

MAY 29, 1929

specting the Canadian National Railway Company and the CarLadian Pacifie Railway Company.
Hon. Mr. GRJESBACH: I have a few
observations to make before this Bill is carried, as I think the House is entitled to a short
history of the facts preceding this measure.
The ra'ilways in Northern Alberta were buiît
by the Government of that province, and
for a number of years have been operated at
a loss. For some years they have been offered
for sale, and last yýear an arrangement was
corne to whereby the Northiern Railways were
sold by the Province to the Canadian Pacifie
Railway Company for some $26,000,000, to be
paid partly in cash and partly by the assumption of liabilities. Af ter the arrangement had
heen concluded, the Canadian National Railways were invited ta take a haif interest in
the railways, and, they having done so, the
present Bill is brought down to create a holding coinpany for the purpose of operating
these limes on behaîf of the two principal
railways. The agreement to seli has been
approved by the Government, and, it may be
said, hy the people, of the Province of Alberta.
Ail that remains for discussion is the situation resulting within the territory served by
the railways, namely the Peace River country.
Statisties concerning that country have heen
laid hefore the other House, and it is well
known here that it is a very large, very
fertile, and generally very desirable territory,
with a great future. It is a part of Canada
which the National Railways might well have
entered, both in the exercise of its function
of developing railways to serve the people,
and also because of the profit to be derived
there.
Havîng came in on the basis of paying half
the oost, the Dominion Government has
acquiesced in the price and cansiot n'ow
repudiate the agreement. But I say that the
National Railways should have entered into
an arrangeiment wi.th t.he Province of Alberta
and had the sole railway privileges for this
tierritory. I venture Vo assert that the only
reason the National Railways did flot do s0
was beosuse of a lack of courage on the part of
the Government to authorize the purchase;
and the result -of that lack of courage will be,
1 submit, more or lesa detrimental Vo the
people of that part of the country.
I atm going to vote for this Bill, for the
reason that a vote against it would ýdo no
good. The Government of the Province, and
tJhe Province as a whole, have agreed to the
purchase. But althoug-h everybody is satisfled
with the arrangement, it is proper for me Vo
draw attention to the condition of affairs that

311

will now ýresult from the passing of thîs Bill,
including the creation -of a holding and operating company Vo run the railways in that part
of Canada on hehaîf of the two major railway
companies. The ibranch line program, which
is so essential to the development of that Verritory, is so, limited in scape wider this arrangement as Vo be of no value at aI. -In the purchase agreemnent some 60 miles of branch lime
railways were proposed, to be conipleted only in
five years. As a matter of fact, 1,000 miles of
bnanch lines are necessary to put a large nlumber of the people in that district within Vwenty
miles of a rail.way. But because of lack of
comipetition, there wiil be no activity in branch,
line construction. On the contrary, the people
of that country will be entirely et, the mercy
cf the holding campany, which will have no
inducemenit to adopt a vigorous 'branch lime
policy.
The produce of that country amounts
annually Vo something like 10,000,000 bu.shels of
grain, which is brought down over the Northern
R.ailways Vo Edmnonton and then earried to
the Pacifie 'Coast or down enst by way cf
Fort William. The people of that part of the
country are condesnned to pay freight rates
over a very long haul, although they are comparatively close Vo tide-water on the Pacifie
Coast. The real developiment of that Large
section will corneonly when there is an outlet
to .the Paciýfie Coast, and such an outlet znight
have been f ound by the building of a line of
raiiwoay from, Grande Prairie, in t.he Peace
River counltry, Vo soine point in the neighbourhocd cf Jasper on the Cantadian National; or
another outtiet rnight have been found hy
extending the lime of railway heyond Whi.te
Court, or by a route ffrou-gh the mnountamis.
But no sueh solution has been atternpted, and
by reason df Vhe lack of competition that
there will be in, the future, the prospects for a
line of railway from the Peace River -country
Vo the Pacifie Coast are m-uch more remote
than they ever were before. The development
of that great country, measuring some 400
miles square, into which thousands of people
are thronging to--day, will be ýretarded seriously
as a result of this -agreement.
As I have said, 1 shail vote for the Bill,
because any other action would be futile,
but it is my duty to point out Vo this House
that the people of tiaat section of the country
have bee-n treated with injustice, the effeets of
which will be f cît for many years Vo corne.
The motion was agreed Vo, a.nd the Bill was
read the third time and passed.

312

SENATE
SPECIAL WAR

REVENUE

BILL

SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM moved the second reading of Bill 278, an Act to amend
the Special War Revenue Act.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

Explain.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
The object
of this Bill is two-fold. It reduces taxation
by removing certain impositions from railway
and steamship tickets, and that kind of thing.
Such taxes have not been in effect since the
lst day of May, as the people who buy railway tickets are aware. Those honourable
gentlemen who buy chair seats will realize
that since May 1 the War Revenue tax on
parleur car tickets has not been collected.
The other portion of the Bill has been discussed at great length by members of Government and of Parliament. It is designed
to replace the present tax on the transfer of
stocks with a new kind of imposition. I am
not sufficiently familiar with the entire effect
that this will have on those dealing particularly in lower-prieed stoek. We are aware
that this country, like others, bas gone very
far afield in making investmcnts, and soma
people noted for care and acumen in finance
believe tihat it would not be amibs to have
a ha1t called to undiýge-ted and thioughtless
investments.
This Bià will undoubtedly affect certain
classes. One is the investor in small securities,
what are called penny securities. Some people
argue that it will affect prospectors. I am
not so sure of that myself. The prospectors
usually get their recompense in stocks in
settlement with those who take over their
properties, but I am not at ail alarmed that
they will be affected very materially. Then
there are the people who wish te floa.t securities in order to obtain money for carrying on
their developments. If a development is supprorted by low-priced stiock, I am inolined to
think it will be affected to some extent.
On the other hand, ail countries impose
such taxes, and we have had in force for some
time a tax of this kind, of which the present
Bill furnishes a revision. I think the Province
of Ontario imposes a tax on transfer of shares,
and so do England and a great many other
countries. As to the effect of this Bill, I
have been informed frrom one source that it
wi'll not be serions, and it will give Canada a
fai-rer revenie.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
nIaie?
Il n. Mr. GRIESBACH.

What is the esti-

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Some est-imate
about half a million dollars, perhaps a little
more; by others I am told that it will reduce
the business to such an extent that the revenue
will not be as large as the Minister of Finance
estimates. I have here a statement of the
estimated reduction of revenue on account of
tariff changes by the resolution of March 1,
1929, and amendments, as follows:
Insurance premiunms.. .. .. . $ 1,007.456
Cable and telegrap'h messages.
343,842
Railway and other tickets..
2,191.139

Less estimated increase on
transfer of shares of stock.

$24,542,437

$24,142,437

I wou.ld suggest that for the discussion of
the details of the Bill honourable gentlemen
allow it to go into Committee of the Whole.
Then they will be in a position to ask for information, and I shall endeavour to get aIl
the information I can on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I have a suggestion to make to the honourable gentleman,
that instead of sending the Bill te Committee
of the Whole we send it to the Commitee on
Banking and Commerce.
The benourable
getlenian himself has said that it is a litile
indefinite in some of its sections.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I think it is.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: The honourable
gentleman is not alone in making that discovery. I think it would be very desirable
for us to have the better facilities of our
Banking and Commerce Committee, where we
coulid call anyone we wished for the purpose
of invcstigating what the burden really is. Is
that suggestion agreeable to the right honourable leader of the House? I do not want
to make a formal motion. I assume that the
proposal will be agreeable and that the Bill
will be taken up at the earliest possible date
by the Standing Committee.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: If it is a money
Bill, can we aunend or change it?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Well, some of
us have some ideas on that subject, too; but,
apart from those ideas, I think we have a
right te make the fullest inquiry, and to ask
and obtain judgments on the Bill. If the Government is agreeable to that, I have nothing
further to say on it now.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Honourable gentlemen, this is the second reading stage of the
Bill, and perhaps after the information I have

MAY 29, 1929
to give is heard in this Chamber it may be
deemed unnecessary to send the Bill to a
Committee, for I believe that I can show the
inequalities of the Bill's provisions. I wish
to deal with the proposed tax under section
4.
Hon. MT. WILLOUGHBY: I do not want
to interrupt the honourable gentleman. He
bas informed me that he would not have the
opportunity of being here next week, and I
know the House would be delighted to hear
him, but his remarks would not interfere with
the disposal of my suggestion. When that is
dealt with, he might proceed to give the information that he wishes to impart to us,
which I think would be very welcome.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I see no objection to it, and I could not object if I
wanted to do so. I should be glad to have
the honourable gentleman speak on the second
reading of the Bill, so that we may have at
our disposal the information that he will give
us.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: But you have
not dealt with my request.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I will before
I sit down. I understand the honourable
gentleman is going to apply his criticisms to
the increase of taxation on mining.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Yes.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I have no
objection to referring the Bill to the Banking and Commerce Committee for thorough
action.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: That will be
satisfactory.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Honourable gentlemen, as a preliminary to my criticisn, which
will be practically altogether directed to section 4, I should like to make a few general
remarks.
Canada's call to-day is for intensive and
energetie research to develop our mining
lands, having particular regard to the base
metals, the importation of which' in manufactured form from other countries is costing
us appalling sums, creating industries elsewhere than at home, thereby losing population and markets for our own people. This
necessitates unwarranted and wasteful expenditure for immigrants, who are brought
in at one door and go out by another to
swell the population and prosperity of foreign countries manufacturing mineral products, of which I believe we have an undreamed of proportion.

Let me instance, in this connection, the
possibilities ànd potential wealth in iron ore
alone, when hitched up with our water and
coal. Is it conceivable that metallurgists,
following the lead of those, for example, who
have conquered the air, cannot solve the problem of economically treating our low-grade
ore, of which we have quantities beyond calculation? I am convinced that if only a
part of the millions thrown away on immigration were devoted to this task research
would win for Canada, through mining, unparalileIed progress and prosperity in industrial activity. This prosperity would react
on every business throughout our land, and
not the least of it would redound to the benefit of tillers of the soil. In other words, the
creation of an industrial beehive of great
dimensions would assure work to the newcomer in advance of his landing.
By section 4, new section 58, second paragraph (a), it is proposed to impose a tax
of three cents for every $100 or fraction thereof cif the par value of the 'bond sold or transferred. There is no objection to that.
In paragraph ('b) a tx is imposed of four
cents for every share of stock sold or transferred at a price over $100 per share. There
is no objection to that. May I say the rates
mentioned in these paragraphs (a) and (b) are
really only a simple stamp tax, that is, a
nominal charge on documents, papers, cheques
and things of that sort, without regard to their
value.
The Minister of Finance said that
this was a stamp tax, and he cited as a comparison the postal taxes. He said that the
Leader of the Opposition night send to Calgary a letter constaining a cheque for $100,000
at a cost of two. cents, whereas the cost
wouldt be the same if he himself sent to
Valleyfield a cheque for $100.
He instanced
that as an unequal basis of charge. Now, the
postal tax, if it is a tax, is for services performed in the way of receiving letters, sorting
them, then distributing and delivering them;
and it costs as much to handle and transmit a
cheque for $100 as it does to handle $100,000.
Therefore there is no discrimination there; the
,charge is a proper one and has a god foundation. That having been given as an exaimiple
by the Minister of Finance, why does he propose to deal in this Bill on an unfair basis?
I want to prove iby his own words that this is
not the same sort of thing at all. In my
opinion the basis of taxation should be an
equal adjustment of value, and if we start
with a wrong foundation the whole superstructure as well as the foundation will be
wrong.
Looking ait this Bill superficially, one might
think it would be fair to al], because it etarts

314

SENATE

by making a tax of one-tenth of a cent on
certain shares, one-quarter of a cent on others,
one cent on others, two cents on others, and
so on; but hee are the facts in connection
with that.
I am going to produce figures
based upon the selling of $100 of securities,
and I am talking pa.rticularly of mining
securities.
Under paragraph (g) the tax is one-tenth
of a cent per share of stock sold or transferred
at 50 cents or less; therefore if a small investor
sells 200 shares of stock valued at 50 cents
the charge will be 20 cents; buit in that very
saine class, an investor who has 10,000 shares
of stock which he sells at one cent will realize
$100, the same as his neighbour, but his tax
will be $10.
In other words, one man's $100
is taxed fifty times as much as the other's.
That comes within one clause. I am taking
the minimum and the maximum amount that
each of these shares will produce under paragraph (g).
Now, under paragraph (f) the charge is
one-fourth of one cent on shares over 50 cents
and up to $1. What is the resuit? My right
honourable friend, the new leader of the
Houýse, sellIs 100 shares of stock at $1 a share,
realizing $100. The tax on that is 25 cents.
But the leader of the Opposition realizes oniy
$100 by selling 196 shares of stock at 51 cents.
The tex on that is 49 cents, or nearly double
what my riglit honourable friend pays.
Under paragraph (e) tihe charge is one
cent on shares over $1 and up to $3. Welil,
under this, 33 shares sold at $3, producing
practically $100, wouild pay a tax of 33 cents;
but 99 shares selling at $1.01, realizing practically $100, would pay a tax of 99 cents.
Under paragraph (d) the tax is two cents
a share at a price over $3 and up to $20.
As an example, if five shares are sodd at $20
the tax would be 10 cents; 33 shares sold at
$3.01 would pay a tax of 66 cents-six times
the other one, though both are in the same
class.
Under paragraph (c) the tax is tihree cents
on shares over $20 and up to $100, and as an
example, one share sold at $100 would pay a
tax of three cents, but five shares sold at
$20.01 producing $100, wouild be taxed 15
cents.
Under paragraph (b) the charge is four
cents a share over $100; so if one share had
sold at $100.01 it would pay a tax of four
cents, and if that share were worth $1,000, or
produced $1,000, the tax woulid be the same,
four cents.
I am sure, honourable gentlemen, that after
you have listened to these figures it would be
insulting to your intelligence to ask if you
thought this a fair proposition,. It was said
Hon. Mr. GORDON.

by the right honourable leader of the House
a few moments ago that speculation is rife in
the country and that many people are sitting
up at night and wondering what might
be done to stop this wild speculation.
Well, there ias been a good deal of it,
and if any method could bei idevised to
stop or limit it, it would be a good thing.
Does anyone imagine for a moment that this
will achieve that end? As soon as this Act
goes into force many small investors will be
desirous, as they have been heretofore, of
selling their stocks. I ask honourable gentlemen to bear with me for a moment while
I give them an example of what would happen. Living here in Ottawa is a very rich
widow-rich by reason of the faet that ber
husband some years ago invested in Consolidated Smelters at $25 a share, a stock that
is selling on the market to-day for $400 a
share. This widow wants to buy a new gown,
and as she has no small change she sends a
share certificate over to the broker, who sells
it and hands ber $400 less the 4 cents tax
and his commission. Down in the city of
Montreal is another widow. She is living
in a very modest way in a very small building upon which there is a mortgage.
The
Ottawa lady had no children, but Mrs. Montreal has ten children, ranging ail the way
from little Pierre, who is only fourteen
ionths old, to smiling Mario. who is fifteen
years of age. This widow finds among the
assets ber husband left ber, in addition to
these valuable children, some shares of
Boischatel, which is selling for about 1 cent
a share. In order to realize $400 she sells
forty thousand shares. Much to ber surprise,
the broker tells ber that the Government
imposes a tax upon that sale of one-tenth of a
cent per share, or $40. Now, why is that?
She was not a speculator. Her husband was
not a speculator. He had bought these shares
as an investment, and they were held as
such. Nevertheless, she has to pay a tax of
$40, whereas the rich widow, who held a rich
man's stock, had to pay only 4 cents on
a transaction of the same size. What does
thait mean? It means that little Pierre, who
heretofore has been getting milk with about
50 per cent of water in it, will now get milk
with about 90 per cent of water in it, and
that instead of the pea soup with a bone in
it that he used to get, he will get soup without anything in it but peas and water. How
anybody can justify a tax of that description
is beyond me.
I cannot discern in this Bill the usually
skiliful hand of the Minister of Finance. This
Bill is designed to strangle not only the

MAY 29, 1929
human baby in the cradile, but the mining
baby, There is no mine in existence in Canada, flot even Consolidated Smelters or International Nickel, which was flot once a
very poor prospect, and at one turne tihe value
cxf th-oee properties might very well have been
represented in cents rather than dollars. The
prospect, like the baby, starits off in a small
way; but as it gradually grows and proves its
worth, its value inoreases from. cents to dollars,
and it takes its *place in the world. Some
people say that we should have no more of
these penny stocks, that they should be
squeezed out. When they talk that way they
forget that many men, and many women too,
for that matter, who invested a very lifitle
money in a penny stock and held it tili the
mine proved itself have been rewarded. Time
flies, but I rernember very well that not 50
long ago-not beyond 1921 or 1922-Lake
Shore was a prospect. At that time an investment of $100 in Lake Shore at 30 cents, the
price at which it was then selling, would
have bought 333 shares of stock-and you
could get a barrel of it at that price. That
would have meant nothing if the stock had
been sold on the market shortly afterwards,
because very little more would have been got
for it; but those who have continued to
hold thaýt stock until to-day find that their
little hundred-dollar investiment is now worth
about $8,325, in addition to which they have
received dividends meanwhile. That stock
started off by paying 6 per cent; it is now
paying 80 per cent, and I think before long
it will pay 100 per cent. Il this legislation
had been in effect at that time and had wiped
out the amall penny stocks, nobody would
have been the gainer. Take Teck Hughes: at
that time it was worth about 15 cents, and
$100 would purchase 666 shares. To-day those
shares are worth $5,994, irrespective of the
dividends that have been 'paid. A hundred
dollars invested in Melntyre at that time
would to-day ho worth 34,500, ini addition tu
the dividends. Some people think that there
has been an orgy of speoulation in Northern
Ontaioc miiies. They say: "Oh, So-'and-so lûet
money. Some of the mines up there are wildcat schemes." That is true enough and it will
continue to ho true, but I want to read
a list of mines that originally were penny
stock affairs and later paîd money to their
shareholders on the basis I have stated:
Keeley, Larose, Kerr Lake, Noranda (in the
Province of Quebec), Nipissing, MWning Corporation, Dome, Hollinger, Hudson Bay.
With reference to Hudson Bay, leýt me
state thât a few fariners and smnall merchants
in the town of New Liskeard thougU~ there

niight be some mineral in that counitry. They
organized a little eompany and, started to
prospect on a capital od $8,000, and for a
long tiine their stock could be purchased at
10 cents a share. I know people living close
to me who bought shares for less than 10
cents, as I did myself, and thought the stock
was of no value at ail. But within a short
time silver was found near Cobalt. Fortunately this proved tc, be a poor man's mine;
no large plant was required. Then someone
came along and gave them 8800,000 in cash
for the property. Not a single mnan in that
littie cosnpany had be-en wortlh anything to
speak of. Lateir -on they develýoped other
prospetts andito my knowledge that co'mpany
distributed many millions and en-riched many
deserv-ing peuple who bad been. poor up to
that time.
Some other mines which were originally in
the penny stoick clas and developed into
good paying proposition are: Crown Reserve,
Croesus, Tretheway, Coniagas.
And noir I come to the last, but not
the least, on my list. 1 have given the naines
of these mines because most of thern are
w
ithin my own diistriot--all aaround my own
door, I mîgh't almost say. The last naine
I wish to mention is International Nickel.
Thiat was, in its eaely stages, one of the
wvorst prospects that money was ever spent
on in the Dominion of Canada. It was
originally started as a copper mine, and when
nickel wus disco-vered mixed with the coipper
the owners ve-re horrified, because there
iras no known process wberelby the two
metals could be separated eronomically. They
were f aoed with ban'kruptcy, but instead of
accepting defeat, they engaged ithe best engineering brains in ithe world and in a short time
they solved the problem, of separating nickel
from copper. As liate as 1923 this company
iras stili in the penny stock class, its shares
selling on a basis of about $1.66. That stock
sdd for $10, but subsequently the âhares
were divided into six for one; se they were
stili a penny stock.
This fatherly legisiation seeks to deprive
all the poor people ocf the country of the
opportunity of investing in mines such as I
have named. I am appealling against it solely
on bebalf of the small inrvestor. The large
investor can take care of hiinsele, as under
this Bil he would be subjected to a tax of
onlly four cents a share on stocks producing
$100 or over per éhare. I think I have maid
enough to, obtiain the support of hosiourahie
nienibers of this Chanmber ini ny endeavour
,to bave this itax put cn a proper basie. Is not
the poor widaw's dollar as good as the mil-

SENATE
lioaiire's? Should not both receive the same
consideration in this matter? Tiat is all I
am asking, that the smaill investor should
have the same opportnity as the big capitalist. Al investors should be taxed the saie,
dollar for dollar. Certainly our poor people
shoulid not be penalized. Shares which have
a value of fromi $100 to $400 or $500 are dealt
in only by the rich men. Persons of small
means if they buy stock at all, are restricted
ta shares whieh have a muceh snaller value,
and many poaple buy the stocks of mines the
pos-ilirtics of which have not been proven.
The chances are that if those shares are reta:ined the healders will be enriched in the
saine proportion as those who held stocks in
the mines which I have enrumerated.
J may be wearying some honourable gentlemen-

Some hon. SENATORS:

No, no.

Hon. Mr. GORDON: -particulal1y on this
side of the House, but this is a tihing which I
have at heart. If I were still a'ctively engaged
in politics, as I used to be when I was a

falîs evenly on al concerned may be attacked
froim a good many angles, but it could not be
opposed w\tih the same force as one sulch as
this Bill levies. which imposes an injustice on
poor people. It seems ta me that it is no
credit to a demoacratic country tihat a Bilil of
this kind should receive a considerable majority in its passage through the other House.
In my opinion it is a ridiculous piece of legislation. I am sure that in China or any of
those countries that we think are net on our
level we should find that they do net levy
taxes except on an equalized basis.
I think I could talk about this for a week,
but it all comes back to what I have said. I
think I have given a fair summary that should
convince any man who wants ta be fairminded that this Bill is unjust, inequitable
and iniquitous. I am going ta oppose it as
strongly as I can, for several reasons. First,
that it would deprive the small investor of his
inherent right to buy or sell stock on an
equal basis with his richer neighbour. Second,
that the assessment basis is unequal and conHon.

trary to all known deniocratic methods, because it discrimiui.tes against mining operations in their infancy, thereby preventing or
retarding their development. Third, it would
impose on ipresent hoIders of certain stocks an
excessive and exorbitant tax, greater than a
property or income tax, under cover of a
classification as a stamp tax, as the examples
which I have given show. Fourth, it would
discourage a stock market method which constitutes a value-indicator through the gradual
process of development of a prospect into a
producing mine, commencing in cents and
ending in dollars. Fifth, it would impose a
tax on the snaIl proprietor without any eormpensating reti-rn such as is given by ie provinces te mines, in the way af schools, roads,
etc. Sixth, outside of paragraiphs (a), (b)
and (c) it cannot be described as a stamp tax,
but is rea.lly a property tax on proprietors
within the jurisdiction of the provinces, whose
rights are being superseded.
Now, in regard ta the section which imposes
a tax on shares of $100 or over, that looks
to me like a real stamp tax, but I am satisfied that the others might be called property
taxes. A certificate in a mining company is
only evidence to show that the holder is
proprietor to the extent of the nuinber of
shares he has in relation ta the capitalization.
A real stamp tax on the sale of a certificate
would represent only a nominal sun, like any
other stamp tax, whereas this Bill calls for an
improper charge on property.
The Province of Quebec has spent a great
deal of money in building roads, bridges,
schools, etc., where mines are located, but the
tax it levies does not anount ta anything
at all; it is merely a stamp tax. It is somewhat similar with the Province of Ontario.
But here we have the Dominion Government
intervening and putting on the small proprietor this excessive tax. I therefore say
that the tax is unjust and unfair, and that
in the interest of the Provinces and of the
people of Canada, the presenrt Government
should refuse ta propose unequal taxes of this
description.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE.

Is that new?
These words are new.

Hon. Mr. GORDON: The reason I ask is
that for some years I have had occasion to
protest, both here and at the office of the
Provincial Secretary, against companies being
permitted to use names whioh confliet with
other names already in use. For instance, if
a mine proves successful, somebody with a
mine which is not known at all gives it a
name simiqar to tihat of the well known mine.
For years I have been protesting against that
sort of thing, and I a.m glad to sec this amendment.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Of course, the matter
has to be dealt with by the Secretary of State.
He bas power to change the name if it is so
similar as to be liable to be confounded with
another name.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: If proper care were
taken to see that a simillar na:me is not
given in the first place there would be no
conflict, and it would not be necessary afterwards to change it. I am making my statement in the House now in order that the
right honourable leader of the House may

rights, trade-

The amendment was agreed to.
Paragraphs (a) to (s) were agreed to.
Hon. Me. HAYDON: I shoulld like to ask
the honourable gentleman who is making explanation of this Bill why paragraph (t) was
struck out. It has been a very common practice in this province to issue shares of capital stock in payment of property acquired by
a company. I believe that, with care, the
original provision could be used in a manner that would advance business. I do not
understand why it should be struck out.
Hon. 'Mr. BEIQUE: The paragrapli was
struck out at my suggestion. Paragraph (t)
read:
(t) to issue and allot fully paid shares of
the capital stock of the company in payment
or part payment of any real or personal
property purchased . or acquired by the company.
I took this position, that the public dealing
with a company should have means of knowing whether they were dealing with a company off substance or not, and that suah a
provision epened the door to this possibility,
that the board could accept a property of
smail value in return for a large amount of
the capital stock of the company, thereby
misleading the public. Some twenty years
ago there was introduced in the Legislature
ýof Quebec a dlause of that kind. Being interested in the proposed legislation, I suggested that there would be no objection to
it with a proviso that a copy of the contract
under which the transaction took place should
be lodged with the Provincial Secretary. The
law in Quebec has stood in that form up to
the present time. I suggested to Mr. Mulvey
a similiar dlause, whidh woulid have maintained paragraiph (t), thus amended, but he
stated that he preferred to have the paragraph strudk out, and I could not prevent
that.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Does the striking out
of this paragraph mean that matter to the
same effect is in some other paragraph?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Under the Companies
Act the capital has to be paîid in cash, or the
equivalent of cash.
When $100 worth of
sha.res are issued, $100 of value should be
paid. If it is desired to permit of shares
being paid for by pro'perty or any other value
which canniot be controlled, then I think it
is but fair tha.t, by means of a copy of the
contract lodged with the Secretary of State,
the public should be able to ascertain what

payment is made for the stock. I suggested
an amendment to this effect, but MT. Mnlvey
preferred to haive the paragraph struck out.
Hon. MT. GORDON:
That is, the thing
which this was intended to change willI still
be in existence?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: This was a new paragraph initended as an amendment to the principail Act.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Perhaps the honourable gentleman has not understood what I
meant to ask. The law which has been in
effect is quite proper, and the practice has
been going on firem time imimemorial.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It remains as it wus.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: So then I was right
when I suggested to the honourable gentlemen that -if paragraph (t) were struck out,
the pradtice would stitl be legal.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: So far as this is concerned, the law remains as it was.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: But my honourable
friend says that this is an amendment.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It was an amendment,
but it has been struck out.
If an amendment
Hon. Mr. GORDON:
was proposed, and you now wipe out the
amendment, what is the position?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The honourable gentleman has just stated that he was satisfied with
the law as it has been for twenty years.
Hon. Mr. GORDON:

Yes.

Hon. 'Mr. BEIQUE: Well, I affirm that
the law remains as it has been for twenty
years.

Hon. Mr. BRIQUE: Paragraph (v), giving

land and has been frequently used in this
province-to distribute among the shareholders 'of ithe company in kind, specie or
otherwise as .may be resolved, the assets, shares
or securities, or any property of the company.
I would suggest that some words of that kind
should be inserted. I understand the honourable gentileman's objection to be that it places
in the hands of the directors an opportunity
to cheat or to get hold of the shareholders'
profits. I would respectfully suggest to the
honourable gentleman, whose experience is
much longer than mine, that former paragraph
(v) shiould still remain, giving the power to
distribute the remaining assets of the company in specie, etc. I have advised it many
imes, and I have never found it to be unfair
or illegal or wrong to any shareholder.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I am disposed to agree
with the honourable gentleman, and I took
the trouble to write to the Under-Secre'tary
of Sta'te last week suggesting that this paragraph might remain if it were amended to
permit the distribution of the assets of a
company in lieu of dividends or bonus to
which the said shareholders are by law entitled, and to a value not exceeding the
amount of such dividend or bonus, or such
portion thereof as has noit been paid in cash.
I think it would have been a good clause if
modified in that way; but again the UnderSecretary of State preferred not to alccept my
amendment.
Of course the time is very
much limited, and the Bil may be amended
next Session. It was represented to us that
in the Bill there are a number of provisions
which are very badily needed by persons dealing in company matters, and we should try
to expedite the Bill as much as possible so
that the necessary amendments might be carried out.
The amendment to strike out paragraph
(v) wvas agreed to.
Paragraphs (x), (y) and (z) were agreed to.
Subsection 2 of section 12 was agreed to.
Section 12 as amended was agreed to.
Section 13 (new section 38) and sections 14
and 15 were agreed to.
On section 16, new section 50A-rectification of filing of prospectus in certain cases:
Hon. Mr. BRIQUE: That is an important
amendment made by the sub-committee at
my suggestion. The duty which is assigned
to the judge by this section is an important
one. If the law is administered as it is in
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE.

Montreal, where there are twenty or more
judges, a lawyer may find a judge who will be
kind enough to grant his application; so I
think it would be well to word the section in
this way in ,order to entrust the duty to the
Chief Justice or a person delegated by the
Chief Justice. In practice it would put the
responsibility upon one man. Therefore there
would be more uniformity if the clause were
made to read as follows:
50A. If the chief place of business of the
company is in the province of Quebec the
Chief Justice or the acting Chief Justice of
the Superior Court for the district in which
such chief place of business is situated, or a
judge of the said court desig-nated by either of
them, or, if such place of business is in any
other province any chief justice in that province or a judge designated by him, on being
satisfied that the omission to file a prospectusThen I would suggest adding the words "or
a statement in lieu of prospectus."
as heretofore required, or that the omission
or mis-statement of any particular prescribed
to be contained in such prospectusor statement
-was accidental or due to inadvertence, or somo
other sufficient cause, or is not of a nature to
prejudice the position of subscribers to any
issue of shares or securities referred to in such
prospectusor statement
-or that on other grounds it is just and equitable to grant relief, may, on the application of
the company or any person interested, and on
such terms and conditions as may seem to the
said judge just and expedient, order that the
time for filing be extended or dispense with the
signature of any director or directors or make
such other order as to the said judge seems
proper, and a copy of the prospectus filed in
accordance with any order of such judge shall
be deemed for all purposes a compliance with
subsection 2 of section fifty of this Act.
I therefore move that the words "or a statement" be added after the word "prospectus"
in lines 24, 26, and 29.

On section 20-notices ef changes in capital
structure to be filed:
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: What notice must be
sent to the shareholders under new section
56B?
Hon. Mr. BEIQJE: The notice is provided
for in the by-laws.
Every company has to
pass by-laws, and they provide what notice
Someshall be given te the shareholders.
times the notice is given by letter; sometimes
when the number of shareholders is too large,
it is done by publication in the newspapers
Every .company is its own master in that.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: I am aware of that,
but I think it is absolutely wrong. I think
that when a company is going te increase
its capitalization a personal notice should
be sent to every shareholder.
Hon. Mr. HAYDON: So it is.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE:
Take a company
started by a few men in Winnipeg, say: they
form their company, pass their by-laws and
sell their stock from Halifax te Vancouver.
Then when they want to increase the capitalization what do they do? They simply print
a notice in a local newspaper in Winnipeg,
and it is not seen by any person in Vancouver
or lalifax, and a few of the shareholders meet
and increase the capitalization. I think there
should be some arrangement whereby every
shareholder should be notified.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I see what my honourable friend means, and think there is something in it. But section 21 provides:
The company may make a by-law for increasing the capital stock of the company to
any amount which they consider requisite for
the due carrying out of the objects of the conpany.
Then section 22 says:
At any time, not more than six months after
the approval by the shareholders of a by4law
for increasing or reducing the capital stock of
the company, or for subdividing the shares, the
company may apply to the Secretary of State
for the issue of supplementary letters patent to
confirm the saine.
That makes it compulsory upon the company
te have a by-law passed before it can increase
or decrease its capital stock. The directors
cannot pass the by-law; they must have a
majority of the shareholders.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Of those present.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: It seems to me that if
you made it necessary te go beyond those
provisions there would ibe very great danger
of your interfering with the operation of the
ceompany.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: You must bear in
mind that subsection 4 of section 56 of the
principal Act remains in force.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: That does not cover
my objection at all. Take the case I have
cited of four or five men in Winnipeg forming a company. They alseo frame the by-laws
and pass themr. That is a general meeting,
because they are the only stockholders at the
time. Later on the stock is sold throughout
Canada, and the capitalization can be increased simply by inserting a notice in the
Winnipeg papers.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Under subsection 4
of section 56 of the principal Act there can be
no increase of capital stock of any company
without the shareholders being called together
in a special meeting and the increase being
sanctioned by at least two-thirds of the shareholders present.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Two-thirds of the
capital stock sold?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Two-thirds of the
special meeting.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: The honourable gentleman from Manitou (Hon. Mr. Sharpe)
means that if a company, say at Winnipeg,
decides te raise the capitalization, it can do
se without sending word te anyone who is
not in Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. COPP: They have te give notice.
lon. Mr. GORDON: Of course. That is
easily done. But the honourable gentleman
frein Manitou (Hon. Mr. Sharpe) thinks that
before the capital is increased or decreased
notices should be sent te all the shareholders
on the books.
l'on. Mr. SHARPE:

Absolutely.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I have been practising for over sixty-one years, during which
time I have had a good deal of experience
in cornpany matters, and I can assert that the
provisions of our Comipanies Act are more
conservative than those of any other I am
acquainted with, and I fail te see the ground
for demanding that a notice be sent te every
shareholder. In many cases that would be
very expensive. Sometimes there are thousands of Mharehoêlders, and very ofiten the coinpany bas net the addresses af more than a
small proportion of them; so it would be impossible te send a notice te each individual.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: While it might be
desirable, it could net possibly do any good,
because having control-

outsiders; they do not still hold control.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I think this is
a very important point. Let us assume that
a new company is formed in Ottawa, with a
capitalization of, say, S500,000, composed of
50,000 shares of $10 each, and that the stock
is largely sold to people throughout Canada,
and perhaps elsewhere. Are we to understand
that if the board of directons, who were perhaps the owners before any of the treasury
stock was sold, desire to double their capitalization, they may insert a notice in a local
paper calling a meeting for that purpose withcut notifying any of the present owners of
the stock, and that they can thereby rcduce
the value of the securities held by tihe shareholders without their knowledge and consent?
I can only repeat
Ron. Mr. BEIQUE:
what I said a moment ago, 'that as soon as
the company has been incorporated by4aws

the notice to be given is to be by letter to

Hon. Mr. CURRY: My experience is that

Hon. Mr. LAIRD: To my mind the best
evidence that the point raised by the honourable mentber for Manitou (Hon. Mr.
Sharpe) is well taken is the fact that under
the provincial law the very point lie has referred to is well covered.
Within the last
three mîonths a company with which I am
connected had occasion to raise its capitalizatien.
After the directors had passed upon
the iatter a meeting of the shareholders was
called; they passed upon it, and an extraordinarv general meeting was called; and
before the Provincial Sccrctary would issue
supplementary letters patent the president of
the company had to sign an affidavit accompanying copies of all the by-laws, and minutes
of those meetings.
That was in accordance
with the provincial larw, the principle of which
is right.
I agree with every word that the
honourable gentleman has said.
I do not know whether under the Federal
law notice ýto shareholders is required or
net in regard to issuing of preference stock,
but a company with which I am connected
recently changed a portion of its capital stock
into preference shares, and I know we had
to call meetings of the shareholders and te
furnish the Secretary of State with copies
of the by-laws passed by the directors and
by the shareholders, together with a list of
shareholders and the amounts of stock held
by them, and their addresses, before he would
consider the question of the issuing of lebters
patent at all. If that is a good principle in
the case of a company changing common
shares to preference stock, surely it ought te
be adopted when a company is increasing
its capital stock. I can see where all kinds
.of seulduggery might enter into the increasing of capital stock if no provision were made

MAY 29, 1929
for notification of shareholders. The bcst
evidence we have that that is possible is
the fact tha-t it bas occurred in cases that
have corne to our personal attention within
the last year. If the law as it now stands
makes no provision against that, I can think
of no better time than the presenit, when we
are con.soliclating this Companies Art, for
making the required amendment.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: It is already required
by the Statutes that each shareholder must
be notified of meetings.
Hon. Mr. SITARPE: No, it is not. You
can slip a no-tice into the newspapers if you

wish.

It ail dependis on the by-laws.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: You are required te
publish a notice in a news'paper in the town
where the head office of the company in.
There is ne reputable conapany that would
flot do its best f0 noti.fy ifs shflreholders, but
serne disreputable companies may flot do se.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I would suggest that
we defer further consideration of the sections
dealing with this matter, in order that we
may communicate with Mr. Mulvey, UnderSecretary of Stafte, and get his opinion.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I would draw the attention of the honourable gentleman to the
fact that the Session is te end, I arn told,
early next week-Hon. Mr. GORDON:

Provided

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It is very likely that
the Session will end early next week, and I
arn wondering whether it would flot be better to let the Bill go through without further
delay andl introduce next Session a Bill f0
give effect to the suggested a.mendment.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Every year there is
the saine trouble beoause a lot of work is left

opinion on this question miight he very valuable to us, and if it is necessary to incorporate

in a few minutes and inoorporated in the Bill.
There wauld ho no delay in the passage of the

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable gentlemen know that I arn not a lawyer, but I
try te taike a commonsense view of things
ef this kind. This section reads:
The directors rnayHon. Mr. GORDON:
My copy rends,
"The cornpany may."1
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
In this copy it
rends:
The directors may make a by-]aw for increasing the capital stock of the company te
any arnount which they consider requisite for
the due carrying eut of the objects ef the coe
pany.
It would appear that that section gives the
directors power without consultation with the
shareholders, which is t'he very fhing the hionourable gentleman from Manitou (Hon. Mr.

324

Sharpe) has been objecting to. May I suggest
to the honourable gentleman who has charge
of the Bill (Hon. Mr. Beique) that it would
serve the purpose and do no injury to any
interest, to change this section to read as
follows:
The directors may make a by-law for increasing the capital stock of the company to any
amount which they, with the shareholders' approval. consider requisite for the due carrying
out of the objects of the company.
That is already in
Hon. Mr. HAYDON:
the Act.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No. The honourable gentleman in charge of this Bill explained a little while ago that the directors,

been sold to tihe public, might make by-lawa

would have complete control and power under
a by-law, which the shareholders did not know
existed, to increase the capital stock of the
comipany wibhout the knowledge of the shareholders.
I do not think that is good business,
let alone good law.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Would the point the
honourable gentleman has in mind not be
covered by an amendment of this nature?
No such by-law shall be passed without notice addressed to ail registered shareholders.
It would have to be limited to such shareholders as registered their addresses in the
company's books.
That is al.1 right, if
Mr. ROBERTSON:
my honourable friend would make an amendment.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: May I call my honourable friend's attention to the fact that if
the directurs did as 'he suggested, their action
would be altogether illegal, because their
action bas to b ratified by the shareholders.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The Companies Act,
seotion 56, subsection 4, provides:
No such by-law shall have any force or
effect whatever until after it has been sanctioned by at least two-thirds of the votes cast
at a special general meeting of the shareholders
of the company duly called for considering the
same.
Of whieh notice shall have been addressed

Section 21 stands.
Sections 22 and 23 were agreed to.
On section 24-registration of mortgages and
charges:
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE moved that paragraph
<d) of subsection 4 be amended by adding
after the word "charge," in the 38th line on
page 13 of the Bill, the words:
or, in the province of Quebec, a notarial copy
thereof.
The motion was agreed to, and section 24,
as amended, was agreed to.
On section 25, new section 87-,filing of
accounts of receivers and managers:
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: This subsection was
amended in order to compel the receiver or
manager of property of a company to file the
statement of the expenses, within the periods
of delay therein mentioned. The law as it
stands in the Companies Act is very much
abused by receivers, and this is to compel
them to be more prompt in making their
returns.
Section 25 was agrecd to.
On section 26, new section 103-qualifications of directors elected:
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:
Subsections 1 and
2 were amended to allow a company to hold
shares in another company and be able to be
represented on the board by nominees.
The amendment was agreed to, and section
26, as amended, was agreed to.
On section 27-executive committee:
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: This section provides
for the appointment of an executive committee. By the clause as first proposed power
was given to a Board of Directors to delegate
all their powers to a sub-committee. Personally I took exception to that provision; I
thought it a very dangerous one. The practice
which obtains in all companies is to appoint
an executive committee. The work is better
done by a small group, but it is always subject to ratification by the shareholders. A
retired judge of the Supreme Court came to
sec me and represented that in companies
whose capital is held in the United States
lawyers in the United States will not accept
resolutions of executive committees, as they
are not familiar with our practice in regard
to the executive committee; and he insisted
very strongly that provisions should be made
in order to facilitate functioning of companies
of that kind. I draft the clause as follows:

MAY 29, 1929
"108A. The board of dlirectors of a company,
whenever it consists of more than six, may, if
authorized by by-law, duiy passed by the directors, and sanctioned by at ieast two-thirds (,f
the votes passed at a special generai meeting

of shareholders, duiy c'ai1ed for considering the
by-law, eiect from its number an executive
committee consisting of flot iess than thrcc,
which execuitive committce may exercise al the
powers of the board. subject to any restrictions
contained in any such by-iaw and to any regulatiens inmposed fromi timie to time by the directors.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Would that
be retroactive?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:

Yes.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:

It wili affect

neariy every cempany in Canada.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: In order to put it in
effeet the by-iaw rnust be passed, andb
sanctioned by the Secretary of State; so i

will not affect any cornpany unless it passes
a by-iaw according to this provision. There
cannot be any objection te it. My object
in drafting this was to make it as conservative as possible, and to frarne it in such a
way that it would be of an exceptienal character. I arn quite satisfied that very few

cempanieq will go to the trouble of passing
a by-iaw of that kind and having it sanetioned hy the Secretary of State; they will
procecd as they have been proceeding here-

toi ore.
Hon. Mr. HAYDON: Many companies in
this province, at ieast, are operating through
an executive comm.ittee. I arn ready to admit,
on personal knewledge, t1hat ýperhaps the coinpanies are operating iliegally, tha't they had
ne right to have an executive comnittee,
who have done things that the whole board ouf
directors shouid do. Now, if this legisiation
were in force, how would it affect a company
that has ten directors who have appointed
an executive committee of four, whic.h cornmittee bas gone on. doing many Vhings?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It will go on. 1 arn
on a number of executive cornrnittees, a.nd

we are proceeding that way, and we shall prooeed in the saine way without availing ourselves of tbi.s provision.
Hou. Mr. CORDON: To rny mind tis
is very objectionabIe, and very dangerous.
Suppose the Secretary of State approves in
Ibat way of an executive cornmittee. Now,

the words used by rny ho-nouraible friend were

means anything it rneans that a board cornposed of 16, 18 or 20 direetors can entirely
divest thenselves of ail responsibility by dele-

2

gating ail their powers te three or four men.
Wctuld not that be a dangerous thing to do?
The directors of eveTy com.pany to-day have
delegated part of their powers as directors
to a committee, but I understand the proposai is to enable directors te delegate al
their po-wers to such a cornmittee, and that
wouid have the approval of the Secretary
of State.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Approval by
the shareholders.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: But approval by the
shreholders does flot rnakie it any better.
That mneans that if there is an executive of
three or four, the directors have unloaded
upon them ail the liabilities, and the rest
of the directors are relieved of any responqibii.ity.
Hon. Mr. HAYDON: No; it would, be just
what is comrnitted to thie executive by the
whole board of directers; just that much.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If my honourâble friend will look at line 34 in section 27
hie will see what it means. It says, "whic-h
executive committee may exercise such powers
of the board as are delegated by such byiaw."'
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Exaotly, and the
sharcholders approve of this executive coinmittee, but my honourable friend said that hie
wtanted ta have ail the powers of the directors
dclegated te this executive committee.
Hon. Mr. BERIQUE: No; I objected to that
because I th-ought it was flot proper to euggest
that al the -powers ocould be delegatedi to an
executive oonsmittee; aod the clause as worded
is jntended to ýcorne to tihe relief of a few cornpanies who cannot pro>ceed very well with the
law ais it stands to-day on -the statute book. I
arn satisfield rnogt of tihe comipanies will not
take advantage of Vhs provision.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Then I dfo not see
voihy Vhs ds required at ail, because now
every director knows t'hat tihe boand haî
power at any tirne to delegate its powers to

BILL
SECOND ]READING

Rlight Hon. Mr. GRAHAM moved the
second reading of Bill 310, an Act to amend
the Returned Soidiers' Insurance Act.
H1e said: Honourable gentlemen, it is not
necessary to say rnuch iii expianation of this
Bill, as I think every honourable member of
the bouse understands it. In 1920 the Returned Soldiers' Insurance Act was pamsed,
providing that returned soldiers could secure
insurance under very easy conditions. That
Act remained in forece until 1922, and in that
year, after certain classes were made uninsurable, it was extenided until 1923. There were
no applications from 1923 tili 1928. Lest year
an amendrnent was passed in the other flouse
providing that applications might be received
for another five year-s, but the Bill was
amended in this flouse and the Act was extended for one year. That time bas now expired and the present Biii, which, cornes from

328

SENATE

the other House, provides for another extension which would permit returned soldiers to
make application for insurance until August
31, 1930. I understand that strong representations were made by representatives of returned men in favour of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Could the right
lionourable gentleman infora the House how
many applications for insurance were received
during the past year, since the last extension
was granted?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I have that information here. There were 5,222 applications
received from June. 1928, to April, 1929, for
insurance totalling $12,886,000.
The number
of applications refused in that time was 604,
while there were 88 applications outstanding
as at April, 1929. From June, 1928, until Aipril,
1929, 4,530 policies were issued, for $11,018,000; and from June, 1920, until April, 1929.
there were 38,107 policies issued, for insurance
totalling $86,746,500. Death claims, settled by
paymont or. annuity, to April, 1929, were
1,985, totalling $5,504,313.64. Disability claims
were paid on 29 policies to the amount of
$62,655.51. There were 27,968 policies in force,
ropresenting insurance of $62,157,931.01, as at
April, 1929.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Does my right
honourable friend contemplate that no further extension is likely to be asked for?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I cannot say.
We all want to go to any reasonable length
for the returned men. I wilM go ius far in
ainswer to my honourmble friend: this is
all the extension thait is asked~for at this time.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: A year ago t'his
mattor was very carefully investigated and
inquired into by a committee, and I think
this House was pretty generally of the
opinion that the extension of one year was
satisfactory ait thbat time to all concerned.
It was at first asked that the time should be
extended for five years, huit after consultations with representatives of the returned men,
the Appeal Board and the Board of Pension
Commissioners, it was agreed that one year's
extension was sufficient. That is the reason
why I inquired whether we might expect a
request for a further extension later.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
MOTION FOR THIRD READING
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM moved the third
reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I suggest to
my right honourable friend that we have a
very slim attendance, and, inasmuch as this
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM.

matter was very fully considered a year ago,
I think we should postpone the third reading
until to-morrow.
It may be that some
honouraible senators are absent who did not
anticipate that this Bil would be dealt with
to-night. I heard one honourable gentleman,
who is not now present, remark that we would
adjourn after we had finished wi'th the
ompanies Act.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Why not go through
with the Bill now? I do not think any
honourable gentleman would objeict to an
exension of five years, if it were asked,
instead of one. If we refused the extension
of five years before, I think we ouglt to
repent now.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: The request for an extension of this Act has becoie almost an
annual affair. The matter was thoroughly
discus;ed last year, when a compromise extension of one year, instead of five, was agreed
upon. The comnittee that. considered the
question thon was, if I Temember, unanimously
of the opinion that no further extension should
be gramted beyond one year. In view of that
f ict, it does not secm to me thast the third
reading should be given by the House when
so few hionourable members are present. I
ai not opposing the Bill, but I would oppose
third reading now bcause there are at present
in the House only two or three honourable
gentleren who were on the committee last
year. I have no doubt the Bill willl be
passed, but a much better impression would
be created if it were not given third reading

to-night.

The motion stands.

only a little of the reparations money had
been received, providing that the money
should be kept in a separate account and
pavments made pro rata on the claims as they
came in; but that resolution was not favourably received and it was withdirawn.
The
Government then waited until the Friel Report was ready.
Of course, as honourable
gentlemen know, there were elections in 1925
and 1926, and there was not much done in
governmental circles during a considerable
portion of those years; so there was further
delay in the making of these payments.
Everybody recognizes that no applicant has a
legal claim to any of this money, but the
Government has realized its moral obligation
to pay the full amount of all claims passed
upon by the Reparations Commission. As my
right honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr.
Graham) has just stated, the total of these
claims is something like $4,000,000, and when
interest is added the total will be over $6,000,000.
As I have stated, I agree with the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Willoughby) that
there has been considerable delay, but the
Government is paying interest on the money.
No doubt the claimants would have been
glad to have their money earlier, but they
will now receive the interest plus the principal. The settling of this matter was a sort
of pet baby of mine when I was a member
of the Government, and I am very glad that
the whole question is being disposed of now.
I am pleased to learn from the remarks
of the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr.
Willoughby) that there will be no opposition
to the measure; so we may rest assured that
on all the claims recommended by the Cummissioner the money will be paid not long
after the prorogation of this Session.

Hon. Mr. F. L. BEIQUE: At the request
of the honourable leader of the Governument
in this House I made some inquiries with
respect to this matter, and I found that the
resolution on which this Bill was based was
agreed to by the House of Commons on the
17th of May. A long discussion took place
on that occasion and the- opinion was expressed on both sides of the House that he
claims should be paid in full. The Bill as
presented provided for the payment of only
$2,500000. Claims up to $15,000 were to be
paid in full; elaims involving from $15,000 to
$25,000 were to be paid 25 per cent; and on
those in excess of $25,000, the amount payable was 10 per cent. The Government then,
with the approval of the Opposition. decided
that the claims should be paid in full. Thtre
were 280 laims passed upon by the late Mr.
Hon. Mr. COPP.

Pugsley and about 1,600 by Mr. Friel. The
total of the claims themselves is about
$4,000,000, and the interest amounts to a little
over 50 per cent of that sum; so the total
will come up to over $6,000,000. The Bill as
we have it here provi.des for Gnlv $2,500.000,
but, a.s I have said, both sidcs of the other
House expressed the desire that the full
amount of the caims 1hould be paid, and the
Government then announced its intention

With regard to the criticism by the honurable leader on the othor side (Hon. Mr.
Willoughby), I think we should bear in mind
that the Dominion of Canada suffered to a
large extent by reason of the war, and that
the payment of these claims is an act of
grace on the part of the Government. As
has been said, the applicants have no legal
claim, and if these anounts are paid aus it is
now intended they shall be, no one should
have any reason to grumble because they were
not paid sooner.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:

Are you com-

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I do not suppose they
will compound the interest.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY:
While I do not
wish to offer any objection to the payment
of these claims, which I think should be
paid in full, it is not clear to me why we
should proceed along the lines that we are
now following. We have before us a Bill
which provides for only S2,500,000, and ve
are told by the leader of the Government
that it is proposed to pay out some $6,500,000.
If the Government changed their mind, would
it not have been better for them to bring
in a Bill covering the whole amount rather
than to make two efforts in place of one?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It is just a
matter of opinion. The purpose in bringing in
the Bill for the $2,500,000 was, if I may express
my own view of it, rather to test the opinion
of Parliament on the whole matter; and Parliament was so strongly in favour of paying
the whole amount, both sides being apparently
in favour of full payment, that the Government suggested that the Bill be supplemented
by an item in the Estimates to cover the
entire claims. Of course, if we were to drop
the Bill at the present time our action would
remove the clauses of the Bill, one of which,
for example, provides for referring to the
Exchequer Court claims on which two opinions

the Supreme Court Act.
Hie said: Legs] gentlemen in this flouse
with understand thoroughty what this Diii
means. The existing Act provides that if a
member of the Supreme Court Bencli has
heard a case he is not preciuded by absence

334

SENATE

from having his finding form part of the
judgment of the Court. This Bill is to make
it clear that if a Supreme Court judge has
sat as one of the judges on any case, even
if he should leave the Bench or retire from
office before judgment is given, his finding
may be incorporated with those of the judges
on the Bench. If judges were always unanimous in their findings, such a provision would
have no effect, but it is thought proper by the
Justice Department that in the event of a
difference of opinion, and in the interest of
justice, a judge who has heard a case and
bas since retired from the Bench should be
able to hand in his findings as though he
had not retired.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Honourable gentlemen, I wish to make sorne observations that
are not exactly on this Bill, but have regard
to the administration of justice in Canada,
if I may be allowed to do so. There appears
to be an anomalous situation with regard to
the courts in Canada. If I understand the
matter aright, County Court judges are
obliged to retire at the age of 75, while
Supreme Court judges may continue in office
regardless of age. Is that not correct? Is
there a retiring age for the Supreme Court
judges?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:

I think so.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I know some judges
over 75 who are still sitting on the Bench.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
Honourable
gentlemen, I suppose this Bill arises out of a

A judge who

without having delivered his judgment. Under
the existing provision he c'ould not delivr it,

GREAT LAKES AND ATLANTIC POWER

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: If there should be
any difference in connection with the retiring
of judges, it should be the other way around,
because the Supreme Court judges have more
important duties to perform, and I know that,
generally speaking, the individual himself is
the last to know and realize that his faculties
are declining.

Hon. Mr. TANNER presented the eleventh
report of the Standing Committee on Standing Orders, to whom was referred the petiition
of the Great Lakes and Atlantic Power and
Canal Company, Linited.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, with the
consent of the House, I would ask that this
report be adopted to-day.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Honourable
gentilemen, I want to be reasonable in everything, but the character of this petition would
indicate that the House could not 'hink of

nýow sought to introcluce the pro.posed legisiation in this House. The project is a very large
one in conniection with the St. Lawrence developmenýt. I make no objection to it, and did
not o>bjeût to the petition being reiceived, but
I thini- it is only fair to warn the flouse, as
1 have warned the preenoters of this measure,
that it cannot be consjdered this Session. It
iýs beyond the boumds of possibility for us to
con.sider a Bill for a projeet of this kind at
so late a date. I said to the promoters a few
moments ago that as far as I arn concernedand I think I may speak for the Government-I think I may al.mo.st speak for this

Right Hon. Mr. GRtAHAM: I wish to lay

to get it, but have not 'been successful.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD:
The correspondence

is certain correspondence between Sir Henry

SPECIAL WAR REVENUE BILL
THIRD READING

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM moved the third
readiog of Bil-i 278, an Act to amend the
Speciail War Revenue Act.
Hon. W. B. WILLOU-GHBY: Honourable
gentlemen, this is a money Bill, and %vhile1
recognize the rights wve have in connection
,with money Buis, aecord-ing to the findings
of a Comimittee of this House, I arn not going
to enter into any long discussion on this orme,
but I shou-ld like te mnake one or two ob,'ervations with regard to it.
In hnving this Bill considered by the Committen on Banking and Commerce we had the
n(lvantage of being able to get more informa~tion as to its effects than we could have
obtaiiied in Cuiumittee of the Whole. I ask'ýd
Mr. Russell, wvbo attended at the Commiuire,
to state on behaif of the Government what
were the objects and expected effects of the
Bill. He answered, if I remeniber riglily.
that the revenue now derived from the classes
of taxes covered by the Bill is $615,000, and
under the proposed new scahe of taxation it
would ba over $1,000,00O; but I have been
ïLssured by .many persons outside this Chamber
that on a proper computation, on the sarne
volume of business as is being done now, the
spread between the taxation that is nowv
received and that which would be received
under the Bill wouhd be very much more than
$400,000; and, of course, if the volume of business were increased, the spread would be pr'opentionately more. I arn not vouching for the
correctness of that information, as I have not
checked the figures at ail, but even on Mr.
Russell's own admission, the extra revenue
wil be $400,000 at least.
Perhaîps some of us in our righteousness
tbink it is our duty to prevent the smali
people from speculating, but I arn democratic
enough to recognize that the mian who goes
te the Derby in the Old Country with a ehilling in bis rpoeket hais as much rigbt to bet as
the man with tan pounds.
I recognize that the stock of nearly al
the mines thrat uitimatehy becama successful
was originally sold at a v.ery low price, while,
unfortunately, many of -the mines that were
atble te get high prices for their stock at the
ou'tset neyer bene4lted ainyone but the piromoters. The fact that. the stock of an undievehoped mine is offered at a very low price
on an exehanga is no proof, according to my
In fact,
observation, that it is of no value.
I have found that the contraTy is ve.ry
irequently the nase. A'fter the mining cernpany has entered on a period of dieveloprnent
and tbe property has been to sozne extent

336

SENATE

iested and its possibilities have been made
known investors are in a position to estimate
wha't the stock should be worth, but when one
is putting some money into a piece of ground
that thas been staked out on the assunption
that there may be minerals underneath, I
suppose it may be de'scr'bed as a gamble. I
find thalt in ail mdning countries, induding
South Africa and Austraia, it is recognized as
a desirable thing that when mining stocks are
first placed on the market they should be
offered at very low prices.
Hon. G. CORDON:
Honourable gentlemen, J have advoca,ted unsuccessfully the
elimination of section 4 from this Bill, and
have ibeen unable even to get the section
amended.
However, I should like to make
a little more comment on it. The gentleman
who represented the Department of Finance
before the Committee on Banking and Commerce said the objects of the Bill were, first,
to prevent specul.ation and gambling in small
stocks, and, secondly, to save annoyanice to
brokers.
He quoted a prominent broker,
member of the Montreal Exchange, as saying
they had been pestered to death in handling
low priced stocks, and while he did not think
it fair to divulge the name of that broker
before the Committee, he offered · o give it
t
privately to any member.
I do not know
whether any member inquired for it, but I
did not.
I asked the official if he or the Department
thought that both these objects of the Bill would
be achieved, and he frankly said that he did
not know. J further inquired if there was to his
knowledge anything within the four corners
of the Statutes, or anywhere else, which would
safeguard a person who had invested in small
stocks, but who was not a gambler in any
sense of the word, and he admitted there was
not. I hope that if this Bill passes it will
succeed in doing what the Depa.rtment expects
it to do, but I think any person who realizes
that two and two can make nothing more than
four, will agree small investors will be
subjected to gross injustice from the day the
measure becomes law.
Let me show how fallacious is the complaint
that the handling of smiall stocks overworks
the brokers. If one purchases a single share
valued at $400, it is represented by one stock
certificate on which there wiii be, under this
Bill, a tax of four cents; and if ho bought
4D,000 hares of one-cent stock, the total vaiue
of which would be $400, there stiiH would be
only one certificate issued, although the tax
on it would be $40. Niow. I think no reasonable and impartial man will cotntend that in
making a certificate for 40,000 shares there is
Hon.

Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

more work tdhan in rnaking a certificate for
one share. If this is readly a stamp tax, as
the Minister bas clainmed, then à is only a tax
on documents, and should be the mme on
one document as on the other.
Some Hon. SENATORS: A little louder.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I am getting older,
and I am so deadly in earnest that I cannot
raise my voice, but I hope honourable gentlemen will read in Hansard what I am saying.
I have been looking up Webster to see what
the word "staifmp" means, and I find that it
has several different meanings, one of which
is to crush or to pulverize-Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
mining process, is it not?

That is one

Hon. Mr. GORDON: Yes. I would suggest
that the whole of section 4 be eliminated, or,
otherwise, that the Act be entitled, "Ta.cks"noct t-a-x, but t-a-c-k-s--"to crush and pulverize the smnall investor."
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Did I understand
the honourable gentleman to say that there
will be a tax of $40 on a $400 transaction?
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Yes.
Hon. Mr. MacARTIHUR: How does the
honourable gentleman compute that?
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Here is the way it
is made up. The tax would be one-tenth of
one cent for every share, and on 40,000 shares
there would be a tax of $40.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: But that would
be only in the case of penny stocks.
Hon. Mr. CORDON: The higher the value
of the stock the less the tax is. Taking the
illustration I used, in one case you would have
to lick only one 4-cent stamp, but in the other
case there would be so many stamps you
would have te get a machine to lick them.
Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH: It is a licker
tax as well. Iionourable gentlemen, if this
Bill :s as successful as the Govermment suggests it ought to be in putting an end to
speculation in Canada, I shail be very sorry.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
suggested.
Hon. Mr. GORDON:
gamibling.

That was not

It was to suppress

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: It has been stated
in support of the measure that it will tend
to reduce specularion. I hope it does not,
for the reason that we are living in a new
country which is constantly undergoing processes of development. We have large natural
resources that are undeveloped, particularly

MAY 31, 1929
in mines and oul. In the Province of Alberta
we are seeking capital for the drilling of oit
fieldss. If every well were kno'wn to be a good
producer there would be no difficulty at att
in getting aIl the nioney required, but eveTybody knows that of the wiells that are drilled
at enormous cost a large proportion turn out
to he dry and non-productive.
Every successful oit business was at one time a wildcat
scheme, and the development of oit fields
in this country is dependent upon those who
are willing to speculate.
I arn protesting against this tax because
it will seriously hamper the carrying on of
the oit industry in Alberta. The- speculator's
money is needed if the moat is to be made
out of the oit resources in that province,
for prospecting is carried on there hy the
samne methods as in new areas ail over the
world. A few individuals get an idea that
a certain field promises to be a good producer, and they form a company and issue,
say, a million shares setling at 10 cents each.

If after the spending of the $100,000 no oit
is found, that is the~ end of the company;
but if they strike oit they can get ail the
money required.
It may be asked why no formal protest
is made against tbis Bill, but honourabte
gentlemen know why those who are opposed
to it do not take that action. This is a
(jovernment measure and has to do with the
financing of the country. The Government
is responsible for the administration of affaira
and for the raising of the necessary money.
A certain amount of revenue is predicated
upon this tax and we should hesitate some
time before we interfere with the responsibility of the Government in this matter. The
Government must assume that responsibility
for the imposition of the tax, and it will be
held accountable by the people of Alberta
for the effects of the Bill on the oit industry
of that province.
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON:
Honourable
gent lemen, the measure before us for third
reading is one of sucb widespread importance
and interest, and affects so many people in
the humbler walks of life, thaf I feel coinpelled f0 say something concerning it. If
migbf well be argued, I fhink, thaf in matters
of taxation the pooir man shouki have an
advantage over the rich man. I think al
honourable gentlemen will agree that, at
least, taxation should bear with reasonable
equality upon aIl classes of fthc people, and
that the rich man, or the large investor, ouglif
to pay a tax proportionate to thaf of the
poor man, who, of necessity, must be a simall
investor.
I desire to place on record a
demonstration of how clause 4 works out.

Under the Bill as proposed by the Gevernment the person investing $10 in certain
rnining shares will pay more than six times
the tax imposed on the person invesfing
$1,000 in certain other mining securifies. I
submit to you, honourable gentlemen, that
that is bad legistation-thaf it iis absolutely
unfair to, those in the huibler wa*lks of life,
who are unable to invest large sums, and
thiait it is a crime agingt, the people.
The person who invests haîf a million dollars in Consolidated Smelters af current
prices would pay a tax of. $54, but if a poor
man, who f elt thaf hie had sufficient money
to, speculate a liffile. învested a tibousand
dollars in another mining concern, lie would
be taxed $80.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Shame!
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I have prepared
a littie statement showing what the fax would
be on an investment of $1,000 in each of the
classes fromn (b) f0 (g) referred to in section
4 of the Bill thaf we are now asked f0 pass.
I have taken the current *prices from the
standard niining record. One tbousand dollars
would this week buy three shares of Consolidated Smelters, and on that thec invester
would pay a tax of 12 cents; a man investing
31,000 under class (c) would this week be
able to huy 22 shares of International Nickel,
on which fthe fax would be 66 cents; 81,000
invcsted under class (d) would this week purchase 132 shares of Teck Hughes, on which
the tax would be $2.64; $1,000 invested under
class (e) would purchase this week 340 shares
of Nipissing, on which the tax wouild be
83.40; and an investinent of $1,000 under
elaas (f) flua week would purdhase 1,450
shares of Siscoe, on whicb the tax would be
$3.62. Now, in att those classes the variation
is not so great, and miight bie fairly patatable,
aithougli I think the discrimination is against
the purchaser of the tower priced stocks-and
who can say that a man is nof justified in
p)urchasing Teck Hughes in;qtead of Gonisolidated Smelters?
But when you corne f0
class (g) stocks, f0 which seme honourable
gentlemen have referred as penny stocks,
there is a terrible disparity. If a man were
this week te invest $1,000 at current prices
in Kirktand Hunton hie could buy 80,000
sharees-and in time KiTkland Hunton rnay be
.iust as good a mine as Teck Hughes. I remember purchasing 5,000 shares cf Teck
Hughes af 15 cents, whidh, footishly, I faited
te keep long enough.
But if a poor man
takes the risk cf buying those 80,000 shares,
under tbis Bitl, he wilt pay a fax cf M8 as
against fhe fax of fwetve cents te be paid

upon an equal investment in Consolidated
Smelters.
I point ont fnrther that uýpon a $100 investment in 8,000 shares of Kirkland Hunton the
tax won*1d be $8, and that upon a $10 investment in 800 sharcs of t-hat stock the tax
wotild be 80 cents, or more than six times
the tax îîpon an investiment of $1,000 in Consolidated *Smelters. Surely tho people will flot

against a vast mai ority of oirr citizens, and
it musat bc apparent to the Government that
that tax cannot 'bc cogarded, and nevet' wil'

which he has placed before the House. In

But above ail that, the Government are
nol going te make an-y money out of this Vax,
for already the brokers are establishing themselves in the border cihies across the line.
The sales of our low-priced stocks, wheu
Ihis Bill cemes into effecl, wihî be made in
those cities and no revenue will comne to the
Government. That resull cannot be prevented, be-cause any person can buy one share
or a thousand or ten thousand shares of
stock and have it delivered te himo without
ils being endoSted te any partieular indiividual, as is done ai over the world with mining stock, and the naame can be filled in

therefore you cannot gel any money 'rom

He said: Honoura;ble gentlemen, in the
absence of the honourable member who introduced this Bill (Hon. Mr. Bureau) I move
the second reading. This Bill passed, in the
House of Commons. There was somne objection taken to it, referring to trade marks.
The objeet of the Bill is to permit importers
of jewelry and articles of that kind to stamp
their trade mark on the article and mark
it "imported." The Minister of Trade and
Commerce bas written me a note concerning
it, and hie favours the Bill if an amendment
is made to strike out the words, "such trade
mark," and substitute the name of the
importer, with the word "imported".
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

to objeot or to approve. I suppose tha main

but are gathered up from. different parts of
Europe, as I arn told, and bear only the

of Canada who are buying the-se goods imagine
that they are all mnanufactured in Canada.
The intention is to put on the name instead

going to take up rnuch time in
I ar n ft
discussing this affair, but I want to refer to

342

SENATE

two or three points that, froîm the records,
appear to me to be salient.
As I have said,
bere was Colonel Cooper, a decent citizen of
this cointry, who was doing Lis duty as any
man of good character would.
During the
war he took an active part; it is enough te
say that at that time lie did a real man's
work and earned some distinction. On returning to Canada le did not stand arocund waiting for someone to provide him with a high
position in either the public service or private
life; lie was willing to work and grasped the'.
opportunity te become a penitentiary guard.
He faithfully discharged the duties of that
minor post and in course of time was proiote(l on merit te the rank of Warden of
the British Columbia Penitentiary.
There
he remained for some three or four yea-rs, and,
as the records that have been presented here
and in another place distinctly show, he was
a capable and conscientious official against
whom no single dinerit mark was registered.
The lionourable gentleman from New Westminster summed up the whole situation in
Ihat regard when lie read the report made by
Siperintendent (Hughes in 1928, in which
Colonel Cooper vas given a reputation for
efficiency that it would be difficult te excel.
Colonel Cooper was regarded by the Departient and by the Superintendent of Peniientiaries as an ideal warden.
Why didi he
fall from grace?
What happened te wipe
out [he memory of all the efficiency with
nwhich he was credited?
The correspondence
which lias been tabled shows that there was a
women's tea party, if you please, at, I think,
the Warrens home in New Westminster.
Among those present were Colonel Cooper's
wife and the wives of other officials of the

cake and other viands, and some lady offered
chocolate cake te Mrs. Cooper.
It se happened that she did net have a liking for that
variety, and, as was her right, she did net
take any, but went over te a table and helped
herself to a piece of a kind she did like. New,
that was a mortal offence in the eyes of some
of the ladies there, particularly of seme whose
hunbands were associated with the management of the penitentiary, and a report of this
terrible chocolate cake affray was made te
the office of the Superintendent of Penitentiaries nt Ottawa.
Then the Superintendent,
this man in one of the most important administrative posts in the country, had enough
time on his hands te sit down and write a
violent letter te Colonel Cooper, upbraiding
him for the conduct of his wife in not taking
chocolate cake at the tea party and informing
him, in emphatic terms, that if he did net
bring his wife te ler senses on this question
Hon. Mr. TANNER.

and thus prevent further mêlées over the cake
table, he would be discharged from his position as Warden of the penitentiary.
Think
of that, honourable gentlemen!
Singularly
enough, as a reading of the letter shows, lie
was to bring his wife to her senses on this
subject without letting her know that be was
doing so.
All memory of Colonel Cooper's
efficiency, of his high ability for carrying on
the work of that institution, passed away with
theHou. Mr. TAYLOR:

Chocolate cake.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: -with the chocolate
cake. In the course of a few weeks an investigation was called. I am net going to
say that this investigation was net properly
authorized by the Department of Justice, but
I think the Department did net really understand what was at the back of the trouble.
Now, in this country, honourable gentlemen,
we have a habit-in fact, it has grown into
an established rule-of giving people a fair
trial. The worst criminal who is brought
intio court is a'ilowed te confront his accuser-.
le bears the evidence that is givien and is
permsittted 'to have lawyers te defend lhai.
If he cannot afford a lawyer, the court vill
see to ir that one is provided for him., so
abat he nay have fair play. Furtiher, rhere
is tho funduriental principle that ho is presume'd innocent unle-s and until proven guilty.
But poor Colonel Cooper was adjudged
gtyi'l
long befero he was put on trial.
Thi,
is cre
i
Supuerintendent
of Penitentiaies -cnt a ge ntf ikman all th(, way out
to British Columbia to hold a-n investigation,
and instr-ucted him-and the instructions were
carried out-that Colonel Cooper was not te
be admitted into the place where the investigation was being held. The accused man
was shut out and coul'd net hear bis aoeusers
nor sec then face to face. As my honourable
friend the leader on this side of the House
(Hon. Mr. Willoughby) pointed out, the
stenorgraphic reports of the evidence were to
be dIestroyed or kept out of the way. There
was no possi.bility of a fair trial under those
conditions, but, on the contrary, all the proliminaries necessary for an inquisition were
carried out by the gentleman who was despatched to British Columbia to "gct" Colonel
Cooper. And they "got" him. He was dismissed.
As I said before, I am net going te take
up the time of the House in reading any of
the documents 'that I have here. When
Colonel Cooper went te the Canada Life

SENATE

Colonel Cooper had made to this insurance
company a mendacious report, which, he said,
was typical of all Colonel Cooper's reports.
In the documents laid on the Table yesterday
the Canada Life Insurance Company take
upon themselves the whole burden of the
error in the question to the Justice Department. They inform Superintendent Hughes
that they are solely responsible for the reference to the Vancouver jail instead of the
New Westmin.ster penitentiary, and renew
their request for a reply to their first letter.
The Superintendet got fhat information about
the time when he was making to his Minister
the- charge that Colonel Cooper had made a
mendacious sta t ement. So he had the truth
in bis posse.sion about the very time he was
making this charge to the Minister, and he
allowed his own damning report to remain
mnthatl
Minister's possession for one year after
he had got the correction-which he never
supplied to the Minister-and a year afer
Cooper was exonerated by the insurance coinpany, the Minister innocently laid that faise
report of his Superintendent before Parliament.
I may have old-fashioned ideas about Parliament, but when I entered this Parliament
I did not think the time would come when
a right honourable gentleman, a Minister of
the Crown, would say that there was no
matter for consideration in an act of dishonour, deceit and treachery to one's own
Minister, such as is ind'icated by that correnpondence.

matter; i1t is serious, and we should treat
it seriously.
Some men arc good subordinates but poor leaders. A large manufacturing concern, when it is eallled upon to select
a manager, very often would like to select
one of its own workmen, and nany a time
that has been tried, and occasionally it
has succeeded. But there are thousands of
splendid men, against whose character or
ability nothing can be said so long as they
remain in a subordinate position, but who
lack the temperament te handle men who
may be put under them. After bearing my
honourable friend, that is the category in
which I would place Colonel Cooper.

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Surely.

MAY 31, 1929
Right Bon. Mr. GRAHAM: The documents read by my bonourabie friend prove
that there was insubordination, that there was
wbat might be ealled treacbery, that there
was quarrelling throughout the staff. One
guard would compiain to somebody about
another guard sitting beside a prisoner. Perhaps it was flot his business at ail. But I
want to take this incident which has been
referred to so jocuiarly as a climax ta the
insubordination, -the riv'al-ry, aJhnost the
treachery, where men on the gta.ff were quarirelling-.
It reached their faimilies, and it
was oo bitter that, it even broke ou.t at a
social gathering. Who will tell me that what
existed amocg their families did not exist
to a greater degree amocg the officiais themselves? To mv mmnd that is the real gist of
the complaint against Colonel Cooper; at
least it would be if I were Superintendentthat hie was flot able to maintaîn amocg the
members of the staff what my honourabie
friend referred to in some correspondence as
esprit de corps.
My honourable friend read a ietter or a
report of the Superin tendent to prove Calonel
Cooper an efficient officer. If my memory
serves me, in that very report hie referred
to the lack of esprit de corps among the officials of the staff. This state did exist. The
correspondence and the documents read by
my bonourable frieud prove tiiat it did exist.
We should not have ail this fuss if it bad
not existed.
Now, wbom. does one hold responsible, no
matter bow fine hie is, for Iack of discipline,
lack of what might be called teamn work in
any organization?
The man ait the bead,
who bas the responsibility of that particular
position. In a manufacturing etablishment
whom. would you caii to task for having one
part of your organization pyuliing one way a.nd
anot-her part the other way?
You would
go to the manager.
Be might say some
person else did it, but the head of the concern would say: "You are the man wbo is
responsible for giving me a good output in
this industry, and for maintaining harmiony
among the staff, and if you cannot do that you
are unfit for the position."
And bie might
be one of the finest men in the worid. I do
say, after having read the correspondence
fairly well, and after hearing my honourtible
friend, witbh bis editing of the correspondence,
wbich bie did very stc'ongly, tbat the complaint
against Colonel Cooper of being inefficient in
maintaining esprit de corps among tbe staff
bas been sbown to be correct.
Esprit de
corps is necessary in any organization, but ho-w

much more necessary is it in an establishment
sucb as a penitentiary.
Now, it seems curious, but information
leaked out fromn that institution, apparentiy,
almnost to tbe mac on the street.
It was
discussed. Things that sbouid have been kept
private and closely.confined to, the moembers
of tbe staff could aimost be picked up on the
street. Men had no trouble in getting ail this
information about the penitentiary before the
investigation, and after it.

QUEBEC CITADEL AND FORTIFICATION WALLS
INQUIRY AND

DISCUSSION

Hon. P. J. PARADIS rose in accordance
with the following notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate
to the dilapidated state of one of the Government properties at Quebec, namely the Citadel
and the Fortification Walls that surround it;
and will enquire of the Governent what
measures they propose to take to save fron
ruin and destruction this great national historie
site antd monument.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, every
member of this Chamber will no doubt recolleet that their Excellencies the Governor
Gecral and Viscountess Willingdon, shortly
after their arrival in Canada, suggested the
revival of an old custom by wlich the representatives of His Majesty had a "pied-a-terre"
in flhe Citadel of Quebec. The Government
endorsed this happy and patriotic suggestion,
and recently completed restoration of a portion of the viceregal living quarters. Suitable facilities have been provided, so that
Their Excellencies from now on will be able
tO sojourn for appreciable lengths of time in
our ancient Capital. The citizens of the city
of Quebec are, as a result, deeply appreciative
both of the sentiment expressed and of the
Government's co-operation; and they are acquiring new pride in the charm and picturesqueness of the Citadel, which crowns the
eastern end of the Plains of Abraham and
commands an inspiring view of the broad
estuary of the St. Lawrence. New interest
and appreciation are felt by citizens of other
parts of Canada as often as they approach
Quebec from alcross the seas and see our
flag floating above these majestic battlements.
Travellers from many lands, who are flocking
to us in annually increasing numbers, are
thriiied too by the same sight. The Citadel
justly nay be regarded as the Mecca of our
greatest tourist trade.
Seattered over this Dominion were forts
and oather works that marked various military
occupations and the progress of settlement.
The ruins of many of those old places, some
of which are now surrounded by thriving cities,
are being restored and preserved in response
to most commendable local sentiment. Where
now stand the walls and turrets of Canada's
only fortified city was played the drama of
war that decided the future of our whole
country. So we al] may congratulate ourselves that our ancient fortress still stands,
not a ruin but nearly complete in every wall,

347

portal and embrasure. But close upon the
completion of the restoration of the Governor
General's quarters came the discovery that
the walls of the fortress are falling into decay.
As those walls support and form an integral
part of the superstructure, including the restored portions, the whole will soon be beyond repair unless the Government has repairs made at an early date.
The earliest portion cf the fortress was
erected fin 1645. The major portion of the
outer waiis was built, roughly speaking, one
hundred years ago. I will not attempt to
relate 'to you in detal the history of the
early fortifications of Quebec. Suffice it to
say, the first were erected in 1608, when
Champlain surrounded his "habitation" close
to the river bank with a rough protection
known as a stockade. Montmagny, a little
later, built a stone fort on the site of the
present Chateau Frontenac, in order to protect the band of settlers from attack by the
Indians. When he arrived in Quebec, Count
Frontenac, Lieutenant-General of the French
King's armies, saw that Montmagny's fortification was not strong enough to protect
more than its immediate surroundings, and he
stressed to his superiors the importance of
immediately erecting fortifications powerful
enough to command the river. But the Royal
Departments in Paris were so slow to act that
the inhabitants of Quebec started the work
themselves. The King, however, was quick
to realize the strategic importance of the site
of this original fort. He saw clearly that the
St. Lawrence river provided the only feasible
means of access to New France, and he
ordered the preparation of plans for an extens3ive and wei-nigh impregnable fortress.
These plans were faithfully carried out by
Frontenac, de Lévis, de Champigny, le Vasseur de Nér6, the Marquis of Beauharnois,
Nicholas Bellin, Franquet, the Marquis de
Vaudreuil and Pontleroy.
The British authorities, after the conquest,
gave special care to strengthening this keystone fortress. Several works of a more or
less temporary nature were built, and finally
there was started a system of fortifications, to
include boE Gitadel and walls, which was to
beome the strongest and most important in
all America. This enterprise was carried out
by such eminent men as Lord Townshend,
Governor Haldimand, Major Holland, Engineer Hunter, and particularly Captain Twiss,
then commanding officer of the military
engineers in Canada, whose plans were afterwards executed by Lieutenant-Colonel Durnford and Colonel Mann. Under these men
the fortress took its present form. It was
begun in 1823 and completed in 1833, at a

JUNE 4, 1929
It is impossible either to look back on this
long and stirring history, or to look forward
to the heritage of Quebec in future generations, without entering a strong protest against
any scheme for throwing down the walls, or any
portion of them.
It is true that they are not so very old, and
that they lack the historie charm of containing
at least some remains of the old French works.
But, on the other hand, th.ey are most interesting in themselves, and doubly so because they
still mark the lines followed by those which
existed in the days of Wolfe and Montcalm.
Moreover, they have the priceless advantage of
m.aking Quebec absolutely unique among all the
cities of America. It may be that if Quebec
were to lose all claim to being the one walled
city of the western world, she might still remain a queen among her sister cities. For her
superb, unchallengeable throne was founded in
strength and set here in beauty by Nature ages
But it was Man who came and
long ago.
crowned her. And where the works of Nature
and of Man have so perfectly combined in one
befitting glory, it would surely be an abject
desecration to discrown ber now. For let it
be clearly understood that the true d.isgrace of
any such schemes lies in their very wantonness.
Of course necessity knows no law; and of
course everything must accommodate itself to
its surroundings in the struggle for existence,
or die out. We all know that. And of course
if war should ever require the destruction of
the present walls, theu they must be destroyed.
And, equally of course, if peaceful traffic should
ever really require it, then they must disappear
just the same. But, as a matter of certain fact,
neither war nor peace requires any such sacrifice at all. Modern defences would be far
away from the city; and the walls around it
could not do any harm, and might conceivably
do good. And, as for peaceful every day traffie,
it already bas all the natural outlets that it
requires, and eau pass freely to and fro at
will. without let or hindrance, inwards or out.
Indeed, it may be truly said that the walls are
now no more of a material barrier to traffie
to-day than their memory would be, should they
be wantonly thrown down to-morrow. But the
greatest plea in their favour is that they are
the living symbols of a glorious past, in which
the honours of war were equally divided between French and English, and for the living
monument of wh-ich, therefore, French and
English alike should stand united. The waterfront is the same from which Frontenac hurled
steadfast defiance at the discomfited fleet and
army of England; and the landward face follows the same line of defence which stood there
when the two greatest masters of the art of war
ever seen in Canada fought for the dominion of
a continent-the profound and aspiring Wolfe,
and the equally great, though unfortunate,
Montcalm.
And so these present walls really stand as a
link between the twin honours of two gallant
races, as well as whaît should be a perpetual
link between present, past and future.
And their own mute appeal is more eloquent
of all living honour than all the vain words that
might record them after they had disappeared
forever.

I hope that these words, so much more
eloquent in their appeal than any I could
utter, will induce all members of this House,

349

regardless of party, to join in bringing this
non-partisan matter to the immediate attention of the Government.
Upon none of the honourable gentlemen opposite do I rely more strongly than upon my
friend from Grandviile (Hon. Mr. Ohapais),
the learned author of several inspiring works
on Canadian history, and the distinguished
lecturer at the University of Laval.
Should we of this Ohamber, who are all
charged with some responsibility for instilling
in coming generations a pride in our glorious
history, not do our utmost to see that this
greatest of all our monuments is made to
resist the attacks of time?
Hon. J. S. MeLENNAN: Honourable gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to congratulate our honourable colleague who bas just
taken bis seat, on the important matter lie
bas brought to the attention of this House
and the Government, and its great historie
influence. No other place that exists to-day
as a living city bas connected with it so
many distinguished and truthfully historie
memories as Quebec. Scarcely anywhere in

Europe, and certainly nowhere else in
America, bas nature combined with the work
of man to make a city more picturesque, or
more appealing to those who visit it.
In the preservation of our historical monumentä the Canadian people, whatever be their

racial origin, must unite in a desire to safeguard for future

with the honourable gentlethe Government, I would

call the attention of even the more erudite
of our members, and of historians, to the

fact that in Cape Breton there stands a
citadel, with some vestiges of a town which
in its time was as important as Quebec; I
mean Louisburg. It was a town that the
Government of France had fortified more
strongly than they had fortified Quebec, and
when the two nations engaged in their final
struggle for the possession of North America
it was as strongly garrisoned. I will not say
much about generalship, but as regards
bravery, there was as much displayed on
both sides there as on the Plains of Abraham.
It was at Louisburg that Wolfe for the first
time showed those qualities of leadership, of
care for bis men, and of burning enthusiasm

His
which later he displayed at Quebec.
death at Quebec made that city promiinent
in the public mind, but bis services there
were no more important than those which
ha gave at Louisburg, in the opinion of the
people who have made military history their'
study.

350

SENATE

Louisburg was the first place in North
America to have a fire-proof lighthouse. One
was built there about 1735. I have ascertained that there was no hospital larger,
better or more important in the whole of
North America than there was at Louisburg
about 1730. The trade of the town was so
great that it excited the envy, animosity and
fear of the more populous colonies of Great
Britain, and pamphlet after pamphlet was
written to the people in the Old Country who
were engaged in the colonial trade, pointing
out how the French were driving them out
of the market for the fish of the North
Atlantic, which in the iiddle of the eighteenth century was the only really important
commodity in the trade with North America;
and the controversy on that subject led to two
wars.
Louisburg has another claim to attention
from those who study the developmont
of
peoples. It was at Louisburg that the raw
levies of New England, engaged in what
seemed to be a madman's scheme, first met
and fought against trained troops, the French
regulars. They captured the town. That success gave the New Englanders and the other
colonies that confidence in themselves which
had such stupendous results when they took
to arms in what proved ultimately to be the
Revolution.
It is a matter of minor incident that Louisburg was the only American port that was
exer touched at by East Indiamen going
around South America. On the economie side
there was at Louisburg the enormous success
in the fisheries of which I spoke. It was the
entrepôt where vessels fron Quebec and the
We- lndies, and smuggling vessels fron the
New England colonies. carried on a trade.
Sc solid was t hat trade, and so well balanced, that Loui -burg. J think, was the only
place on the continent of North America that
never had to resort to paper money.
I had not intended to speak this afternoon,
and I certainly do not intend to continue
these desultory remarks, but I should like to
ask the right honourable leader of the House
if he would request the Government to take
into consideration as promptly as possible the
desirability of seeing to it that on the land
that they have acquired on the site of Louisburg for historical purposes no further dilapidation takes place. Little by little are disappearing those vestiges which, if not equal to
those at Quebec, are certainly very valuable,
in our opinion, from the standpoint of historie
merit. It is a great site of what in its time
was a stupendous place in a military as well
as in a commercial way, and in the developHon. Mr. McLENNAN.

ment of what is now Canada, and all that
took place there was of equal credit to one
side and the other.
Hon. H. S. BELAND: Honourable gentdemen, I may be permitted to add a few words
of congratulation to my honourable friend
from Shawinigan (Hon. Mr. Paradis)
for
having presented in so able a manner the
case, as I would call it, of the old Ciitadel and
the old walls of Quebec. His speech-which
I think is his maiden speech in this Househas attracted, deservedly, the closest attention
on the part of honourable members. Had the
Government not already decided to appropriate a certain amount of money as provided
for in the supplementary estimates that were
laid on the table yesterday, I am certain that
the brilliant speech of my honourable friend
would have carried conviction to the Government that something must be done.
Some say that ours is a century of high
civiilization; others, less enthusiastic, and less
ready to yield to the idea of modernizing the
most venerable and ancient things, express
the view that our age is rather an age of
vandalism. It is likely that the truth lies between theso two extremes and that in this
instance, as in many others, the old motto
flids its application-in medio stat virtus.
Quebec enjoys the unique distinction of
being the oldest city on this continent. Within and without its walls, and in the walls
themselves,

can be found the vestiges of

a

century that is long gonce. Quebec is the gi-teway of the inner part of the continent. It
was so reeognized by the hardy adventurers,
Ja cques C:ar-tieor and Chainplain. It is today
roadilv andmitted to be so by thoexvisitors
from Europe who,i haxing crossed the Atlantic
and sailed up the St. Laewronce, behold suddenly, as they turn the Ie!and of Orleans. the
h-c
nîaietIc heutv of the prciotrtoy cf
and its Citadel.
Whetiher or not We share thos views, or are
in sympathy with the customs, usages, systems
or policies of three centuries ago, mîtteus
little. One thing is certain: the pteservation,
the
conservation
of these
old Quebec
walls. of this Citadel, can only jitbue the
soiul of every Can-adian wth a deep sentiment of admiration for our ancestors. Artistic
beauty and indomitable energy are written
in letters cf stone w-hich the remorseless
action of time -will be indeed very slow to
deface.

It

is now proposed to arouse

iain

the attention of the powers that be in order
that these historicall beauties inav be presorved. not only for us, but for thoe who
will ecne after us.
The exigencies of
modern life, of tourisi, of conmmercialism,

JUNE 4, 1929
have, much to my regret, caused the disappearance of many of the old features of
Quebee. Enough, however, remains to be
admired, and we in this Chamber, who, I
should say, partake of the past at least as
much as we do of the future, will be ready
to recagnize and proclaim that more admirable
in the city of Quebec than the new artificial
features of lier complexion is the gray hair
that has remained.
Be that as it may, the action of my honouralble friend from Shawinigan (Hon. Mr. Paradis) is to be highly commended. He has
already succeeded in securing something for
the preservation and conservation of those
beauties. He hopes that every honourable
member in this House will join with him in
pressing the Government towards some action
which will perpetuate those walls and those
monuments, that their silent language, so
eloquent, may penetraite the souls of the
Canadian people, irrespective of the province
from which they hail or the tongue they speak,
and that language may be forever spoken to
the young giant, Canada.
Hon. THOS. CHAPAIS (translation): Honourable gentlemen, I had not intended to
speak this afternoon on the subject of this
inquiry. But the symipathetic allusion made
to my humble self by our honourable colleague has rendered it alnost necessary for
me to say a few words. And I have thought
that perhaps this would be a fitting occasion
on which a few words in French might be
heard in this Ohamber. Besides, several of
our Engli-speaking colleagues, I am aware,
understand French.
I am glaid to re-echo the sentiments expressed by the honourable Seniator for the
division of Shawinigan (Hon. Mr. Paradis).
The fortifications of Quebee are certainly a
national monument, and it i3 the duty of the
Government cf t-his country to do all that is
required in order to conserve and, at need,
to restore them. Quebec has been the cradle
of the Canadian nation. There it was that
Champlain planted the seed cf a Christian
civilization. There it was that in later years
those great battles were fought which shaped
our destinies and from which our existing
institutions have sprung. The wails that surround our old city awaken the most glorious
memories. They are pages of history-history
of which both sides may well be proud.
Other p'iaces in Can-ada have also their
memories. Our ionourable colleague froum
Sydney (Hon. Mr. McLennan) told us comething, a little whie ago, of the ruins of Louisburg, that famous outpost of France on the

351

Atlantic coast Of Ncrth America. Those ruins
te has reconstruoted in the fine book he has
devoted to them, and on whbch I congratulate
him. They form part of that treasure of
historie monuments whieh it is our duty to
defend against the ravages of time.
From those ravages of time, as we see by
the supplementary estimates, lt is the Government's desire to preserve the fortifications
of Quebea. Ail nightqminded peopile will encourage it ta persevere in this direction. The
proposed vote for this year is $50,000. May
I express tIhe hope that it will be repeated, if
not doubled, next year, and so on from budget ta budget, until the woik cf restoration
is accomplished.
These monuments, these ramparts two
centuries old, recall to our minds the efforts,
the struggles, the sacrifices, the heroism of
those who have gone before us. To one side
belongs the honour cf founding and creating;

to the other tlhe hionour of continuing and
bringing to completion. After their armed
confliot they became engaged in a co-'operative
effort in the pacifiec arena of progress. United,

·they

form the Canadian nation, for which we

foresee so glorious a future.
Once more I congratulate our honourable
colleague on his initiative, which, I am certain, wilI help to insure the success of the
work of restoration that he lias in view.
Honourable
Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH:
gentlemen, I am sure we all have listened withb

address of the honourable member from

lias done more for Canada in a very practical
way than the honourable gentleman to my
left, (Hon. Mr. Béland), and the honourable
gentleman from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbacli). They displayed high courage and truc
patriotisai during a crucial period of our
history, and their adidresses on a subjeet of
this kind, are entitled to our most careful
attention and consideration.
No Canadian can tread the streets of the
old City of Quebec without being thrilled.
He realizes that hie is in a place where a very
important part of our history was made.
Affection and veneration for these oid historie
sites are cmbedded in the hearts and minds
of us ail. I sometimes think that until recent
years, at least, we have been neglectful of
many of the old reminders of our past. As
a boy and as a young man going to sehool
1 learned ail about ail the mountains, rivers,
capes and capitals of Europe,, the United
States and other countries, but very littie
about Canada. Even yet few histories of this
great Dominion have heen published that are
suitabie for otudy by cur young people. Bt
despite the slight attention that lias 'been paid
to it, Canada bas a thrilling history, and my
honourable friend from Shawinigan (Hon. Mr.
Paradis) lias brought some of it to our minds
to-day.
The Citadel at Quebee is not a memoria!
of the conquering of one race by another. Wc
ougbt to lookc upon it as an everlasting reminder that on the Plains of Abraham was
laid the foundation of the Dominion of Canada, whose people are coxmposed of two principal races and several others. I have been
impresseýd by the view that in teaehing history
to our young people we should be careful to
keep before t'hem not so mucli the details of
oid batties as the fact that French and English
speaking people have been united here for
ail time as Canadians and British stùbjects.
Now, what are we to do with these old
fortifications which stand as mute testimony
of Canada's found-ation and deveiopment? Il
seems Vo me we are ail agreed they should
be kept in a good state of repair, in order tha-t
our yo-ung people may continually have before
thein these authentie factors in the history of
their own country. My own view is that thesc
fortifications should be kept as far as possible
in a -condition representative of what ihey
mean, rather than have modern fandangles
added to them. The honourable gentleman.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY moved concurrence in the Report of the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce to whom
was referred Bill V3, an Act respecting Investment Coipan'ies.-Hon. Mr. Black.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the honourable Senator from Westmoreland (Hon.
Mr. Black) informed me that ho was going
horne to-day, and if the right honourable the
acting leader of the House (Rt. Hon. Mr.

tell what was donc with regard to this Bill,
which, in the absence of the honourable
leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), was the particular charge of the bonourable member froni De Salaberry (Hon.
Mr. Béique).
Most of the unimportant amendments that
might have come under this Bill are embodied in the Companies Bill, and this Bill, I
undurstand, wiil not be proceeded with this Session. I believe, however, that it is the intention to introduce this or a similar measure
next year. The report before us contains
merely the recommendation that the Bill be
not proceeded with this year. I move the
adoption of the report.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
I have expressed the view that no matter what may
be the merits cof this proposal it would be useless to proceed at this Session, in the hope
of examining into it even cursorily. Therefore, if the Senate bas no objection, I would
suggest that we do not proceed further with
it this Sessi-on.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: In reply to the
suggestion of my right honourable friend, I
may say that the House, so far as I know, bas
no knowledge of the proposals referred to.
I can sec no harm whatever in the Bill being
given first reading. If, through lack of opportunity to deal with it, it proceeds no further,
well and good. But inasmuch as the Committee bas reported that the petition is in
order, it would seem discourteous to the promoters to decline to give the Bill the first
reading without even letting it become a matter of knowledge and consideration before the
House; therefore I would ask my right honourable friend to allow the first reading of the
Bill.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I would point
out that the question before us is the adoption of the report.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
I appreciate
that, Mr. Speaker, but the Bill cannot be introduced until the report is adopted.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I do not want
to be discourteous, and I do not mind our
giving the Bill the first reading on the understanding that the second reading will be postponed for quite a long period.

JUNE 4, 1929
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I quite agree with
that, and if we find that the Bill is of such
a nature that it is going to take up time,
it may properly stand over. My thought,
bowever, was that after the Committee had
made a report to the effect, as I understand
it, that the Bill is in proper form to be considered, the Senate would be acting very
differently from what it usually does if we
refused to permit introduction of the Bill and
did not give it its first reading.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Let somebody
move on behalf of the honourable gentleman
from Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner).
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I move concurrence in the Committee's report.
The motion was agreed to.

DIVORCE JURISDICTION BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

Hon. L. MeMEANS moved. the second
reading of Bill 75, an Act respecting the
Domicile of Married Women in proceedings
for Divorce.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the Bill
which is now before the House has been
brought here as an orphan, and has been left
on my doorstep because I am Chairman of the
Divorce Committee.
My idea in becoming
the foster-father of this Bill is to give the
Senate every opportunity of discussing it.
The Bill provides for a radical departure
from the well established principle of British
law that the domicile of a married woman is
that of ber husband; that is, that a woman
seeking a divorce must apply to a court
having jurisdiction where her husband is
domiciled. In a case where a woman living
in the Province of Alberta endeavoured to get
a divorce from ber husband, who was domiciled
in another province, it was held by the Privy
Council, the highest judicial authority in the
British Empire, that the Alberta courts had
no jurisdiction. This Bill is framed for the
purpose of meeting such cases of hardship as
that of a wife whose husband has deserted her
and by moving to another jurisdiction bas
changed his domicile.
It would be very
difficult for ber to obtain relief, because in
order to apply to a court having jurisd-iction,
she would have to follow ber busband to the
place where be is domiciled at the time of ber
application for divorce. This Bill is intended
to give a separate domicile to a married
woman who bas been deserted by ber husband
and bas lived separate and apart from him for
two years. so that she may obtain relief, if
entitled to it, in the province in whieh she was
deserted, or in which she bas taken up a new
domicile.
The question of domicile has always been
an extremely difficult one to determine, because 'it dees not mean simply a change of
residence. Positive proof must be given that
any change of residence is a permanent change.
I think i't is laid down in Halsbury's Laws of
England thus:
The presumption of law is almost always
against a change of domicile, which must in
every case he proved with perfect clearness by
the person alleging it.
This statement .of the law has been adopted
in our own courts, and is also the law that
prevails to-day in England.
The only possible objection that I can see
to the Bill-and it is probably not worthy
of much attention by this House-is that it

356

SENATE

does not define how a woman is týo determine
ber domicile. Although she bas been deserted
by lier husband, hars lived soparate and apart
from him for two years, and moves to another
province, she may have some diffieulty in
proving that that pacticular province is ber
domicile. However, the courts would sotfie
that point if it should ever be raised, as I
think i, very unlikely.
Therc is another feature of tbe measure
,which 1 think I shbould bring te the attention
of the Huse. A divorce granted by a court
in the province whece the w'oman bas a
domicile separate from that of her busband
would not be hhnd'ineg in any other country
-heîie a similar law prevails. That
exccpt w
i,ý, if a woman doiciiled iii tbe Province of
Manitoba ohtains a divorce there, and lier
lîu-.baud is net living there, that divorce will
net ho rccognized by the courts in England

Hon. Mc. GRIESBACH: I wantcd te be
clear on tbat peint. Then, as te the Bill,
it seems te me that if we are geing te pass
a measuce of this sert we ougbt te complote
the job and decide wbat censtitutes the acquisition of a domicile. The word "domicile"
is used, and the benourable foster-father of
the Bill expresses somo deubt as te how domicile i, te be acquired. I sbould ebjeet te passing a Bill xvhicb upen tbe face cf it is open
te douibt, unless wc could clarify it new.
Sucely it %vould ho possible te amend the
Bill se as te sot eut that a w'eman bas ber
domicile in the province in which she cosides
and bias been residing- foc a certain peried.
If uve pass the Bill as it is, wve leave it te the
courts cf a province in which thece is jurisdiction te grant divorces te detormine just
w-bat is te ho considcred as domicile under
this Act. I think the fostor-fathor of the Bill
mlighit considor that aspect cf the case, and
ni:ke an arndment.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: In answer te mny
henourable fricnd, I (Ie net sc how the Bill
could ho aunended te provide for a case of
that kind, which is entirely a matter of eviclence. It is a question cf fact whether she
lias i-aniced hec domicile or net, and it is foc
the court, or for anyono wvho trios the case,
te sa v whether Ale has establishcd beor domicile. If -,hc has bought a home or ew-es other
preperty ivithin a new juiicsiction and bas

nover intendieg te romain thoce, thon it weuld

JUNE 5, 1929
that the Senate has already taken on a Bill
which I presumne is forgotten, perhaps even
by the older memibers who have not had to
do with divorce.
In 1920 the laite Senator*Rosa, of Middleton,
brought ini a Divorce Court Bill applicable to
the provinces cf Ontario and Prince Edward
Island, and it passed this House. The language cd the Bill was very much the same as
that cf the Bill whîch this House passed last
year. ]n addition to that, Senator Ross
brought in a Bill for the dissolution and annulment cf marriage, which emibodied some
provisions cf the common law and some provisions, differently phrased, cf the English
statutory law, the Matrimonial Causes Act.
The measure introduced by Senator Ross, Bill
J cf 1920, enumerated the grounds upon which
divorce might be granted, and contained this
clause:
5. For the purposes cf any proceedings to
dissolve a marriage or to annul a marriage, ilf
the petitioner or applicant is a married woman
her domicile shall be determined by the same
laws anld rules as apply to the dletermination
cf the domicile cf a man, and the law or rule
that the wife's domicile is that cf heT husband
shaîl flot apply.
This House. as I say, has already committed itsel'f tu that principle. Bill J was a
general divorce Bill. It abolished the right
cf a co-respondent under the English law to
join issue, and provided for the passing of
a decree nisi in the first instance and its becoming absolute at the end cf six months.
It also prohibited the publication cf the
evidence in divorce suits. Some honourable
gentlemen will remember, with regard tu a
sensational case from Montreal which was
even more sensational-ly reported in a paper
there, that it became necessary to devise a
remedy in order to preserve the dignity of
this House. That remedy is now te be found
in a clause cf the Criminel Code which prohibits the publication cf reports of our Comnuittee without. I think, the consent cf the
Speaker first having been secured.
Bill J passed this House without any very
serious objection, and, along with Bill 1,
was sent te the Huse cf Communs, where
it was placed in the hands cf a distinguished
member. It received its flrst and perhaps
its second reading-as tu the latter I am not
sure-but owing tu the abseýnce c-f its sponsor,
who ivas attending to other engagements, it
was dropped from the Order Paper, the then
Minister cf Justice not being a -very strong
supporter of divorce legislation. When an
effort ýwas made to restore the Bill the Minîster cf Justice did not fa-cilitate the move,
and it disappeared from the Order Paper

entirely. Since that time the gentleman wbo
had charge of the Bill in the other House
has more than once assured me of his belief
th-ait hnd the Bill camne before tihe House in
1920, it woiild have pa.'sed. As to that I
make no statement at ail, although I think
that at that time we were very near to
having a more extended laýw in respect to
divorce than was proposed in the Bill that
I later had the honour of introducing in this
House.
Now that I amrn a gowiping mood, I may
say that I have read in the newspapers that
the Anglican Synod of Toronto, whidh was
supposed tu be very mujch opposed tu divorce,
paaised by -a vole of 82 tu 10 or 12 a resolulion Mafavour of the establishment cf a
divorce court in Oritario.
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH: Honourable gentlemen, I was flot ia tihe House yesterday, but I see from the Minutes that this
Bill came from the House of Commons and
was, by leave of the Senate, placed on the
Order Paper for second reading to-day. Recause it cornes hefore us under circumstances
that seem a littie unusual, and because, if it
beconies Iaýw, it effects a very radical change
in the' principles which underlie our law, I for
my part do flot feel prepared tu go on with
the discussion of the measure to-day. I wi.sh
therefore, if there is no0 sericus objection, tu
move the adjourament of the debate.
The debate was adjourned.

INTERPARLIAMENTARY UNION
REPORT OF CONFERENCE
On the notice:
By the Honourable Mr. Belcourt:That he will call the attention of the Senate
to the 25th Conference of the Interparliamentary Union held in the City of Berlin,
Gernany, on the 23rd day and subsequent days
of August, 1928, and to the proceedings thereof
and the resolutions adopted.
Rizht Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Honourable
gentlemen, we all regret that the honourable
gentleman from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt)
is still indisposed, and hope that very shortly
he will be restored to complete health. In
view of his absence he has asked me by letter
this morning to secure the indulgence of the
Senate in order te place on record a report
which he has prepared concerning the meeting
of the Interparliamentary Union in Berlin
in August last.
He points out that as head
of the Canadian branch he is charged with
the duty of presenting the report and resolutions to Parliament at its first subsequent
session.
I would therefore ask permission to
place this report on record as though the honcurable gentleman had delivered it.
The motion was agreed te.
Following is the report submitted by Hon.
Mr. Belcourt:
Honourable gentlemen, as Fresident and
delegate of the Canadian group of the Interparlianentary Union, it was a duty and
plea.sure for me to attend and take part in the
25th Conference of the Union, whidh was held
in the City of Berlin, Germany, on the 23rd
and follcwing days of the mon'th of August,
1928; and it is now my duty, under the rules
governing each n(atsional group, to acquaint
the Paxtiament of Canada with the proceedings had and tie resolutions adopted at this
Conference.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS.

It is a matter for congratulation, I think,
that the nembership in this institution, both
as to national groups and individuals, is increasing yearly in number and importance,
attracting greater attention and producing
larger co-operation throughout the world. This
is also true of our national group, wherein the
majority of the members are recruited in this
honourable House.
At the various conferences the Senate generally provides the
larger number of the representatives from
Canada.
This, to my mind, is as it should
be, since Senate members have more leisure
and opportunity for international co-operation.
It is also noticeable that the members of the
Upper Houses in Europe and Ameni:ca take a
greater interest in the work of the Union.
I hope I may be permitted to take adivantage
of this occasion to again urge the members of
this honourable House to join tihe Canadian
group of the Interparliamentary Union.
All
parliamentarians and ex-parliamentarians are
eligible, and upon becoming members are
entitled te receive the publications of the
Union, including the full and complete annual
report of the proceedings of its Conference,
and are thus afforded very valuable information not easily obtained elsewhere.
Whilst the Union is not an official body
and has no authority or power to enforce
its decisions, beyond 'the pressure on public
opinion whicb its constant and protracted
study of matters interesting the whole civilized world permits it to exercise, it serves international needs in a v ery substantial manner.
Its decisions are communicated from
time to time to the Society of Nations and
other associations formed for the establishment of universal and permanent peace,
mutual understanding and co-operation, as
well as the promotion of the common interests of mankind throughout the universe.
At the Conference held in Berlin last summer, the following national groups w're represented by one or more delegates:
Germany, United States of America, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Bulgaria, Canada, Chili, Costa Rica, Denmark, Dantzig,
Dominican Republic, Egypt, Esthonia, Finland, France, Great Britain, Greece, Hungary,
British India, Dutch Indies, Ireland, Italy,
Japan. Latvia, Norway, Netherlands, Peru,
Poland. Rumania, San Salvador, Kingdom of
Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, Sweden, Switzerland, Cze'chio-Slovakia, Uruguay and South
Africa; in all thirty-eight nations.
These were represented by delegates ranging in number from one from Australia to
73 from Germany, with 48 from Poland, 44
from Hungary, 41 from Rumania, 21 from

JUNE 6, 1929
Netherlands, 12 from Great Britain, 25 from
France, 9 from United States of America,
Italy 11, Japan 17, etc.; in all 475.
The Canadian representatives were the
honourable leader of the Government in this
Hiouse (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), and myselfwho have been also, for many years, members
of the Council of the Union-our colleague
Hon. Mr. Beaubien, Dr. Murray MacLa-en,
Member of the House of Commons, and Hon.
Mr. Justice Wilson of Montreal.
The President of the Canadian group was
chosen as one of the Vice-Presidents of the
Conference.
The Conference was the first occasion since
the Armistice when delegates from the
different nations of the world met on German
soil, on the invitation of the Government of
Republican Germany, with the intention and
for the purpose of contributing in the fullest
measure possible to the establishment and
miaintenance of universally peaceful relations.
All the delegates seemed to be impressed with
the necessity of taking full advantage of this
opportunity, and the members of the German
group, as well as the leaders of the German
Government, spared no effort to assure the
success of the meeting.
The agenda, after providing for the election
of the President, Vice-Presidents and officers
of the Conference, and a full discussion of
the report of the Secretary-General, contained
the following main subjects:
Parliamentary Evolution.-Rappor-teur: Dr.
Wirth. Meieber of the Reichstag and exChancellor of the Germaan Empire.
Migration Problems.-Rapporteur: Mr. Slavko
Secerov, Member of the Skoupdhtina of the
Serb-Croat-Slovene Kingdom.
The Rights and Duties of States.-Rapporteur:
M. Henri La Fontaine, Vice-President of the
Belgian Senate.
Revision of Articles 3, 4, 5, 15 and 16 of
the Statutes of the Interparliamentary Union.
Mr. Stanislas Posner, Vice-Rapporteur:
Marshal of the Senate of Poland.
And other matters of secondary importance.
The subject of Parhiamentary Evolution,
which had been placed on the order paper
at my urgent request made at the Conference
of 1927, was intended to be the principal and
really was the most important matter submitted for discussion, and it was listened to
with great and sustained interest during
almost two days.
The debate was based on the report submitted by Doctor Wirth, one of the leaders
of the Reichstag and an ex-chancellor of the
German Empire. The following is the report:

ön

(Translation)
The Evolution of the Parliamentary System
in our Times
Draft Resolution
presented in the name of the permanent Committee for Political and Organization
Questions by Herr J. Wirth
Member of the Reichstag, formerly Chancellor
of the German Reich.
1
The XXVth Inter-Parliamentary Conference,
comprising the representatives of. . . Parliaments, expresses its faith in the parliamentary
system. That system is the only one which
allows of self-government by the people. By
calling upon all citizens to take part in 'publie
life it guarantees a control over the action of
the government and contributes to the political
education of the nations.
II
Seeing that men owe to parliamentary institutions the conquest of their personal liberties
and of their civil and political rights,
but seeing that the complexity and the technical nature of the problems which arise in
our times, particularly in the economie and
social fields, demand fron Parliaments and
Governments not only a more considerable and
more specialized work, but also its more rapid
execution;
The XXVth Conference,
while recognizing that the customs and traditions of the different peoples render uniform
solutions impossible, requests the National
Groups to initiate within their respective Parliaments a study and a discussion of their
national political and parliamentary life in the
light of the debates held within the InterParliamentary Union and of the experience of
other countries. It invites them, if necessary,
to submit proposals in that connection to their
respective parliaments.
In this connection the Conference calls the
special attention of the Groups to the following points:
1. The desirability of insuring a greater
degree of governmental and parliamentary
stability, either by the nomination of inembers of the Government for a fixed period
(United States of America, Switzerland), or
by the adoption of an electoral system of a
nature to prevent the multiplication of parties
and insure a definite majority representing the
opinions of the majority of the electors, while,
however, guaranteeing that the minority shall
be represented.
2. The necessity of insuring the independence
of the parliament and of the government as
regards great economic organizations which
too often influence parliamentary and governmental decisions.
3. The desirability of providing parliamentary
authorities with a more complete practical
documentation and. if necessary, with the cooperation of experts for the solution of the
questions submitted to them (international exchange of parliamentary and administrative information; creation of consultative bodies in
connection with the Parliament; hearing of experts by parliamentary committees; creation
of research departments for the use of parliaments);
4. The necessity of winning the co-operation
of a conscious and enlightened public opinion
for the work of Parliament, for instance (as

3bu

SENATE

examples): by creating a medium of information guaranteeing an impartial documentation
and public discussion; by the officiai recognition
of the parliamentary opposition through the
remuneration of its leader (Canadian system);
by the institution of the legislative referendum
and of the popular initiative (Swiss and German systems); by the institution of "public
hearings"
before parliamentary committees
(Massachusetts system);
5. The desirability of ligitening the task of
Parliament by conferring certain powers either
on local organizations or on autonomous national authorities (as for instance the British
" Trade Boards ") acting alongside of the Parliament;
6. The improvement of parliamentary technique and procedure in order to avoid delay
in the taking of decisions and to insure the
better drafting of laws (institution of permanent parliamentary committees corresponding roughly to the Government departments;
institution of a general permanent legislative
committee (Yugoslav systei) ; limitation of the
rigit of aniendnent at Parliamentary readings.
III

The Conference believes that the Inter-Parliamentary Bureau is particularly fitted to
serve as the connecting link between the Groups
and, if necessary, between ithe Parliamsents. for
the exciange of information which the above
study will necessitate.
It expresses the wish that a second debate
on the foregoing problems be instituted at a
later Conference, based on the discussions within the Groups.
Those who took part in this debate were,
in the following order: Herr Doctor Wirth;
Mr. Andrew J. Mon'tague, delegate froan the
American Group; followed by mysef; Carl
Lindhagen, Sweden; M. de Lukacs, Hungary;
M. Munch, Denmark; M. Pierre Renaudel,
France; Herr Heller, Czecho-Slovakia; Herr
Halloin, President of Sweden group; Herr
Doctor LfIkatos; M. Aimé Berthod, France;
Stanislas Thuguitt, Poland; Markram Ebeid,
Egypt; P. J. Little, Ireland; the Secretary
General; M. Paul Bastid, France; Herr Franz
Odehnal, Austria; Arrigo Soini, Italy; Frédéric de Rabours, Switzerland; Madame Irene
Kosmowska, Poland.
M. Pierre Renaudel submitted the follow:Ig amendment:
(Translation)
That the first paragraph of
the proposed resolution be ainended to read as
follows:
. " By calling upon all citizens to tase
.
part in public life by exercising their franchise
and puîtting into practice the principles of
democratic freedon. it guarantees a control
over the action of the Goveriment and contributes to the political education of the nations."
I proposed, as an addition to the report
subm'itted by Doctor Wirth, the following:
(Translation) The necessity of instructing the
youth

attending

primary

schools in

the

ele-

ments of governient, constitutions, parliaments,
popular assemblies, electoral franchise, the
duties of citizens towards their country, in
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM.

order to teach these pupils the means of coinpleting, by experience, observation and study,
their traning for the discharge of their civie
duties. With this object in view, the preparation for the use of primary school teachers of
a political outline or syllabus on tie elements

of

representative goverinoent,

with directions

on the most suitable method andImeans of imparting this special instruction. It would be
necessary also to require teachers to prove
themselves sufficiently qualified to give thlese
lessons in governmeint.
This syllabus would be translated inîto the
language of eaci couiitry belonging to the
Union, and transmitted to the president of
eaci national group, who would, in turn. subsmit it for approval to lis Governmient in
order that it might be printed and distributed
to the teachers in all primuary schools.
The assembly decided to send thle whole
matter back to the Committee for futither
consideration.
The next subject of discussion 'was "Migra,
tory Problems." in which the following took
part: Latvia, Her Noijs Maizels; Germany,
Herr Robert Schmidt; France, M. Gracien
Candace; Herr Doctor Slavko Secérov, Serbia;
Herr Carl Lindhagen, Sweden.
On "Declaration of the Rigits and Duties
of St!a1tes," the discussion was led by M. La
Fontaine, Bellgium, rapporteur of the Committee which dealt with this subject, and the
following gentlemen took part in the debate:
Herr Docitor Schuckling, Germany; Mr. de
Berzeviczy, Hungary; Herr Vassileff, Bulgaria;
Mr. Vespasien V. Pella, Rumania; Herr
Koczor, Czecho-Slovakia; Mr. Eamon de
Valera, Ireland; Herr Doctor D. R. Wotawa,
Austria; Herr Doctor Van Embden, Netherinds; Carl Lindhagen, Sweden; Herr Lucki,
Poland; Pierre Renaudel, France; Holger
Anderson. Denmark; Mr. Roy G. Fitzgerald,
[.S.A.: Heemskeri., Netherlands; Doctor Gralinski, Poland; M. Brunet, France; Herr Wilhelm Heile, Germany; Frau Christine Teusch,
Germany; M. Nogaro. France; Herr Doctor
Karl Tinzl, Italy; M. LaFontaine, Belgium.
It would, I beliieve, be interesting to analyze
the question of the Rights and Duties of
States, so ably dealt with by the Vice-President of the Belgian Senate, but time will not
permit me to do so at this stage.
I shall certainly not inflict upon yon the
readinîg of the speech, ansong msany others,
which II delivered on Parliamen'tary Evolution. It will bu found reproduced in full in
the report of the 25th Conference of tie
Interparliamentary Union at Berlin last summer (1928), now in the hands of all the
members of the Canadian Group.. May I,
however, be permitited to make a brief reference to it, and at the saime time earnestly
invite mv honourable colleagues in this House
to express now, or at a later date, their views

361

JUNE 6, 1929
with regard to that most important and urgent
matter, for I a confident Ihat such observations would be received with gratitude
by all the members of the Union. I know
that many are close students of the Canadian
constitution and institutions and of the
political life of our country.
May I make here a short digression to tell
you th"t I have returned from this and
previous international gatherings which I have
been privileged to attend during years past,
greatly impressed by and pleased with the
frequent- evidences of the remarkable and
ever-increasing interest which the different
nations of Europe are manifesting in Canada's
affairs and future.
The Parliamentary Regime ocoupied a
prominent' place on the agenda and was discussed at considerable length because of the
recognition of the fact that parliamentary
government has not effectively filled the needs

and aspirations of democracy. Many now
admit that about the middle of the last
century representative

government

gave its

best results, and that since it bas made but
little -progress in many parts, while in some
others it has really retrograded.

Different causes have contributed more or
less to this result, which is manifested to-day
in the fact that but fifty per cent of the
electors in demoeratic cauntries take the
trouble to cast a vote in parliamentary elections. In some countries where the electorate
enjoy the greatest measure of parliamentary
franchise, the disappointing example has been

given, on many occasions, of either an evident lack of interest in the administration of
public affaira, or an increasing disposition to
shirk public service.

The main reason or cause of this situation,
which I placed before the last Conference-, is

that the majority of the electors in most
democratic countries have n'ot been taught
even the rudiments of parliamentary government. In other words, the electorate has been
given the privilege of voting without acquiring a sufficient appreciation of the importance
of the vote, and of the duty to exercise it,
and in consequence is incapable of making a
judicious choice of representatives. Demoratic governments have failed to establish
or to maintain a just and adequate conception

of democracy, its purpose and its needs, or
of the nights of the people and their duties to
the State. The emphasis has been too often
placed on the rights of the individual rather
than those of the people collectively. A real
and active public spirit is still wanting for

the proper functioning of the democratic
regime. The majority of the electors in all
countries of the world is composed of farmers

and artisans. Most of these have to be content with a primary education. They leave
school at the age of 14, and at 21 are entitled
to choose their representatives. They have
not in the meantime acquired an adequate
appreciation of the meaning of the vote, the
obligations which it involves, or the necessity
for making a reasônable and reasoned choice.
Can we, in the sincerity of our conscience,
be satisfied that the representation of to-day
in Parliament, in legislatures and in municipal
councils is all that it should or might be to
meet the needs and increasing demands of
suacessful democratic government? And if
we cannot, as it not generally because a properly prepared electorate does not exist?
Briefly stated, that is the position which I
felt constrained to take.
What are the remedies for this situation?
There are several. I was content to suggest
only one-to educate the electorate. How
can this be donc? I proposed that the Union
should prepare a syllabus on parliamentary
representation, to be handed to the different
national groupe in order that they might submit it for approval to their respective governments, and that when approved, translated and printed in the various languages,
it should be distributed to the teachers in
all their primary schools.
It is also my duty to draw the attention
of this honourable House to the resolutions
adopted by the Conference. I shall content
myself with reporting the three principal ones:
(Translation)
1. The Evolution of the Parliamentary System
in Our Times
The XXVth Inter-Parfiamentary Conference,
considering that the principle of representation of the people by freeiy elected parliamentarians is at the very foundation of the
work of the Union,
faithful to the tradition which lias guided
previous Conferences,
careful to avoid the expression of any opiion
which might be regarded as a pronouncement
on the political issues of the day, and particularly on the domestie policy of any State:

affirms its disapproval of every illegal act
committed with the object of abolishing the
parliamentary régime, and declares that that
régime can only be modified by the procedure
provided by the Constitution of the country
itself.

2. Migration Problems

The XXVth Inter-Parliamentary Conference,
considering the world-wide importance of migration problems,
considering that it is the right of each State,
in conformity with the principle of national
sovereignty, to regulate immigration into its
own territory,
but considering nevertheless that the neasures
enacted might, by their reaction on the standard of life and prosperity of other countries,
disturb good relations between the nations and,
consequently, international peace,

It was unanimously decided that there would

to be had in 1929-30 were not indicated.
The meeting then adjourned.
May I, with great respect, and equal
earnestness, suggest that the members of this
honourable House would derive a very substantial profit from adhering to the Union.
They will individually be furnished with interesting and very profitable information
regarding international affairs in general. The
annual report of the Interparliamentary Union
contains a copy of the deliberations of the
conferences and of the meetings of the various
commissions which deal with the subjects
reported on at each conference.

363

It is manifeet to me that Canada will
feel the necessity of taking an always increasing share in dealing with international world
affairs, and that both Houses of Parliament
will need all the information and experience
which the Inter-parliamentary Union will
always be able to offer.
It is true that the Union has no way of
enforcing its opinions and that its deliberations
have no other sanction than that which arises
froin the impressions it creates on public
opinion. But the whole of Canada, and
especially its parliamentarians, will derive very
great advantage from following closely the
work of the Union, and, whenever possible,
attending its very interesting and engrossing
conferences.
EXPEDITIONS TO LABRADOR AND
BAFFIN LAND
Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH: Honourable
gentlemen, I desire to draw the attention of
the Government to a despatch appearing in
this morning's Ottawa Journal. It is dated
Buffalo, New York, June 5, and is as follows:
Labrador, it seems, is not where it should be.
Existing charts place it 40 miles inland because
observations made some years ago were all
wrong.
An expedition to put Labrador _m its place
will be sent out late this month in charge of
Commander Donald B. MacMillan, of Aretie
faime.
Labrador is part of Newfoundland, and as one
would think the Newfoundland Government
would have to do with that, I am not going to
draw attention to that so much as to what
follows.
Commander Eugene F. McDonald, retired
naval officer, made this announcement to-day
when he arrived here in his sea-going yacht,
Mizpah. While Commander MacMillan is changing Labrador, Commander McDonald intends to
chart some of the inland lakes of Baffin Land
and "nerhaps give them some good Yankee
names."
Baffin Land is a part of Canada, and while
this may be just so much hot air, it is not
impossible that this gentleman may embark
upon some discoveries in the iiterior of Baffin
Land, and may, in -point of fact, give a number
of good Yankee names to some of the yet
undiscovered portions of that territory. I
suggest that the Government at least keep
their eye on the movement.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Honourable
gentlemen, I will call the attention of the
Government to the remarks of my honourable
friend.

DIVORCE STATISTICS, 1929

Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. L. McMEANS: Honourable gentlemen,
with the permission of the House, I would

Some honourable members may be interested
in knowing what has been done in the Divorce
Committee during the present session. A statement has been prepared, which is as follows:
For the present session 295 notices of intention to apply to Parliament for Bills of Divorce
were given in The Canada Gazette. Of the
foregoing 270 petitions were actually presented
in rhe Senate and dealt with by the Committee
on Divorce, as follows:

It is a matter of self-congratulation to me
that there are no members of the legal profession in the list.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
the law too well.

They know

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS (reading):
In 113 cases the Conmittee on Divorce
reconnuended that part of the parlianentary
fees be reinitted.
In the taking of evidence during the present
Session the Committee sat on 30 days, on 22
of which days a Sub-Comittee also took
evidence in 83 cases.
Right Hon.

Mr. GRAHAM.

In addition to the sittings of the Committee
for hearing evidence. very numerous and frequent meetings of Sub-Committee were held for
the consideration of varions matters arising out
of divorce petitions, other than the taking of
evidence.
Assuming that all the Bills of Divorce recommended by the Conmittee (less three Bille not
concurred in by the House of Commons) and
now in varions stages before Parliament receive
the Royal Assent, the comparison of the number
of divorces and annuîlissents of marriage granted
by the Parlianent of Canada in the last ten
years is as follows:

That is usp to the present day.
Riglht Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: In view of the
work performed by the Divorce Committee,
1 cannot see why they should recommend that
any part of the fee be remitted.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I was going to add
that the situation in the Divorce Committee
is rather serious.
Unless the other House
concurs in a Bill granting the Province of
Ontario jurisdiction to try divorce cases, some
means will have to be devised by this
Chamber eit.her to put the Divorce Committee
on a different footing or to change the method
of handling divorce petitions so that they may
be dealt with more easily and in such a manner that the present objections will be overcose.
Last cssion our late lamented leader,
Hon. Mr. Ross, of Middleton, stated that we
on this side of the House would have nothing
further to do witi divorce petitions.
As a
Bill to cstablish a court in Ontario was introduced in the Senate this year and sent to
the House of Commons, and as we did not
know what would happen, we went on in the
usual way.
That Bill has been defeated, and
something will have to be done to change
the method of dealing with this subject.
Riglst Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: As I remember
the statement of the honourable leader of the
other side of the House, it was that honourable members on his side would take no part
in the proceedings of the Divorce Committee
unless the House of Commons permitted the
Bill to corne to a vote, and that if it came to
a vo t e and was defeated he would insist that
the House of Commons share the burden of
trying divorce cases.

appointee alone has the right to get the
papers.
Hon. Mr. PARADIS: No, not necessarily
an appointee. A messenger could be authorized by the returning officer to receive the
papers.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: What would be the
use, then, of appointing a successor? That
is not the intention of the law. Would the
returning officer give the messenger a note
authorizing him to get all the documents from
the ex-registrar?
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Yes.
Hon. Mr. PARADIS: To be turned over
to the new registrar.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: The returning officer
can act within the scope of his duties, but
immediately he appoints a registrar he relinquishes the duties which belong to a registrar;
and I claim he cannot go over the head of
his appointee to do anything which is exclusively within the registrar's jurisdiction.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: After listening to
the somewhat extended legal interpretation
of the section, I take the liberty of moving
that the right honourable the acting leader of
the Government appoint a committee of three
laymen to redraft this Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I should be
eligible to act on that committee, I submit.
As I see it, when a registrar is replaced by
some other person, the returning officer, who
is the responsible party, sends to this registrar who bas been replaced and asks him to
give up all the books and papers he has.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: He sends either the
new appointee or someone else.
He might
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
send someone else, but whoever is sent would
be authorized by the returning officer to
receive the papers. It strikes me that is the
meaning of the clause. Then the information,
books and other documents would be transferred to the new appointee.
Transferred to the
Hon. Mr. BUREAU:
returning officer.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It is his duty
to transfer to the new registrar the papers
that were formerly held by the registrar who
has been replaced.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: The section does not
say so.

367

I take the
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
responsibility, Mr. Chairman, of moving that

"to" be omitted and replaced by the word
"eby."

And after

The amendment was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. PARADIS: With reference to
the French version of the Bill, I have a number of amendments to make. There is no
other way to do so than to move them one
by one.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Has my honourable friend the French version here?
Hon. Mr. PARADIS: Yes.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It strikes me
that it is the duty of the translators to see
that the French and the English versions are
in agreement.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Honourable gentlemen must not forget that both versions are
official before the courts.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Yes, one language is as official as the other. I think it is
the duty of the translators to see that the
Bill is properly translated.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I quite agree
with the view of the right honourable the
acting leader of the House. It is clearly the
duty of the translators to give us a correct
translation in French.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is quite right.
We are not translators.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: If the translators
were given a list of the errors, they could
make the necessary corrections and time would
be saved.
Hon. Mr. REID: Let the translators make
the corrections before we pass the bill.
Hon. Mr. PARADIS: As an instance, I
would draw attention to paragraph (c) on
page 8, where there is an error in the FrenchHon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: The French
translation has not been circulated.
Hon. Mr. PARADIS: I have it.

of section (c) on page 8 reads:

seven of the preceding twelve months, been

But the French version says "for the last
seven of the preceding twelve months," instead of "for at least seven of the preceding
twelve months." It makes a big difference.
The paragranh in French reads:
pendant les sept derniers des douze mois
précédents.
It is a clerical error.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
Honouraible
gentlemen, I suggest that the attention of
the translators be called to this discussion, so
that the necessary corrections may immediately be made and the properly translated
Bill be distributed among honourable members.
My honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Paradis) might take upon himself the duty
of pointing out to the translators the errors
and the necessary corrections in the French
version. If that is agreeable, I think it would

Hon. Mr. BELAND: May I ask my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Paradis) if this is the
only error he has found in the French translation?
Hon. Mr. PARADIS: No; there are some
twenty or twen'ty-five.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: If there are more,
should they not be mentioned, so that the
translators could find reference to them in the
Debates?

money will be required for these terminals.
It may develop in the carrying out of this
large project, as it often does in the case of
smaller undertakings, that some change is
required which would necessitate the spending
of a little more money than is estimated;
but Sir Henry Thornton's opinion, based on

DIVORCE JURISDICTION BILL
DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned debate on the second reading of Bill
75, an Act respecting the domicile of married
women in proceedings for divorce.
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH: Honourable gentlemen, this Bill is entitled "An
Act respecting the domicile of married women
in ;proceedings for dýivorce," but the first
section of the Bill provides that "this Act may
be cited as the Divorce Jurisdiction Act, 1929."
So the Bill concerns two things, the domicile
of married women for the purpose of divorce,
and also the jurisdiction of courts to decree
divorce; and the two things, while connected
with each other, are perfectly distinct.
To clear up one's ideas of what we are dealing with, it seems to me that it would be useful to consider the meaning of the words that
Take first the common word
are employed.
I suppose everybody has a
"domicile."
fair idea of what that word means, but if one
were to attempt to define it in the signification in which it is ueed in courte cf law
or in Acts of Parliament there would be a
good deal of difficulty about it. In brief,
there is no other English wordi which has exactly the same significance, and the best that
anyone can do about it is to try to understand exactly what the legal signification of
the word "domicile" is.
Of course it implies residence; but it means
far more than that. A man may have half
a dozen residences, he may reside in one place
for a month and in another place for the
remainder of the year, or he may travel about
as he pleases; but all the time lie has some
one domicile. The nearest equivalent to the

word, I should think, is our English word
It is the place at which a man

sleeps and lives most of the time, and where
lie makes his home.
But domicile is not that alone. It depends
to a very great extent, perhaps mainly, upon
the intention the man has in making that

particular place his home.
temporary affair, if he is residing for a few
inonths at saine hotel or in a furnished house
in some other part of the world than where he
ordinarily lives, he has not changed hie
domioile at al. Intention is perhaps the most
important feature in considering the meaning
of the word "domicile" from the legal point
of view; and in order to create a change of
domicile the intention must be to make a
change of consid'erable permanency-to live at
a particular place, not necessarily for life,
not necessarily for any definite tern of years,
but for a considerable time.
Then one ought to consider lhow a domicile
is aoquired. Every child at birth acquires
its domicile of origin; not dependent at all
upon the mce to whioh its parents bekcng,
not even dependent upon their place of residence unless that residence has the permanent
character that I have alluded to. A child
may be born away froin home, upon a journey
or during some transient absence from the
place of home of the child's mother. That
child's domicile ·is the home of its parents,
and it so continues until the child is able to
change it. That home, of course, may change
from one country to another. If it does, the
child's domicile changes with the domicile of
the parents, until the chilid is of an age to
acquire a new domicile for itself.
A new domicile may be acquired before the
chiltd attains its majority, by the marriage of
the child, because marriage necessarily implies,
under any and every systen of civilized law,
the establishment of a new domicile-a matrimonial domicile-a home for the spouses.
If there is no marriage, the child upon
attaining the age of twenty-one may by its
own choice, under our law, acquire a new
domicile, and when it does it has no longer
the domicile of its parents, but ite own domicile of choice; which continues, in turn,
through the life of that man or woman until
it is changed by choice.
Thus we have three possible kinds of domicile-the domicile of origin, the domicile of
choice, and the matrimonial domicile; and
the last-mentioned kind is the one with which
this Bill deals, and the one that is important
for consideration now.
I have said that the matrimonial domicile
necessarily arises upon the relationship of
matrimony being entered into, and that, it

seems to me, is manifestly of course. We
are all told in the marriage services of the
churches, in this country at any rate, that
the purpose of marriage is the procreation of
children. Well, whether or not the spouses
both understand and believe that to be se, I
take it that it must be universal that any
man and woman intending to get married, and
going through the ceremony of marriage, do
it with the then present intention, aýt least,
that they two wiill, at any rate for a while,
live together. The intention is not that they
are to live apart, that one is to have one home
and the other another home, but the very
idea of matrimonial union involves the living
together of those two persons from thlat time
forward, at any rate for a certain length of time.
So I submit to you, honourable gentlemen,
that it is a fundamental principle that
marriage signifies such a unity between the
spouses that for them, as long as their matrimonial union lasts, there cannot be at any
one time two domiciles--there can be but
one matrimonial domicile. I consider that a
fundatmental principle of civilized matrimonial
law; net merely of English law, but of the
law of any civilized people. It is the very
essence of the relationship of husband and
wife that there should be thencelforward the
one, and -but one, home for them both.
Then I say that even if for any reason
these two spouses are net in fact living together, there is still 'but the one domicile,
the one place which is the matrimonial home
of the two. Now, the rule of our laaw is
that that one domicile is the domicile of the
husband; and that is the consequence of the
union between man and woman which has
been brought about by the marriage.
On motion of Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth,
the debate was adjourned.

YUKON QUARTZ MINING BILL
FIRST READING

Bill 343, an Act to amend the Yukon Quartz
Mining Act.-Right Hon. Mr. Graham.
SECOND

READING

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM moved the
second reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, if I may
bel permitted, I will re-ad the explanation of
this Bill which has been handed to me by
the Department of Mines.
The Act to amend the Yukon Quartz Mining
Act seeks to overcome a danger to the recorded
owners of mineral claims in the Yukon Territory which lias arisen through a recent judgment of the courts. This judgment is te the
effect that ittie to a mineral claim cau only be
mtaintetned in case it can be shown that the
original locator of such claim strictly complied
in all respects with the ternis and conditions
of the regulations at the time in force as to the
proper size nf the posts employed, the erection
of the requi.red mound of earth or stones around
the base of the post, the discovery of mineral
in place prior te location, etc.
This judgment is based on legal precedent,
being a decision rendered by the Supreme Court
of Canada in the case of Manley versus Collom,
and reported in volume 32 of the Judgments of
the Supreme Court, page 371.
Under this judgment it is feared that innocent purchasers of mineral claims for which cetries were granted many years ago, wlio accepted the grants issued by the Crown as proof
that the claims liad been properly located, thus
justifying the large expenditures in development subsequently inecurred, may now sustain
very serious loss through having their titles
contested, while being quite unable, after the
lapse of years, to prove that the original locator
staked the claim in strict conformîity with the
provisions of the regulations.
This judgment would appear to indicate that
net merely a substantial compliance with the
requirements of the regulations is necessary,
but that all details as to the exact heiglit and
width of the posts, the precise dimensions of
the mounds surrncding the sane, etc., must
bc shown to have been complied with.
The amendment is for the purpose of providing that if a substantial compliance witli all
the requirements of the regulations has been
made, so that other prospectors may not be
misled, the location may be accepted as valid.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: I should like
to say a word or two on this Bill. I am net
opposing it, for I can quite sec that a Bill of
this kind may be very much in the public
interest. But there are one or two provisions
that I think might very well and very prop-

JUNE 7, 1929
erly have been inserted in it. The first is a
provision for the protection of those who,
bona fide, have begun litigation. I do not
know whether there are any such persons or
not, but if there are, under this Bill they
would be divested of their status in court.
Another very desirable provision would be
something in the nature of the Quieting
Titles Act which we had in Ontario years
ago, and which some of the other provinces
may have. Take the case of a miner who
has staked a claim. Perhaps he has not technically complied with the provisions of the
Act, but has been accepted as the pending
locatee. An action is brought contesting the
priority and regularity of his application, and
he has to show a substantial compliance with
the regulations. Who is to determine that
question, the mining recorder or the court?
It seems to me there should be some provision for that, and certainly I think there ought
to be some protection for pending litigants,
and some provision covering future litigation.
As to protecting
Hon. Mr. MURPHY:
pending litigants, would the honourable
gentleman be of the opinion that a clause
similar to those in Acts reviving lapsed
patents would be sufficient?
Hon.
would.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I will call the
attention of the 'Department to the remarks

the matter thoroughly.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
DOMINION ELECTIONS BILL
FURTHER CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE
The Senate again went into Committee on
Bill 313, an Act to amend the Dominion
Elections Act.

They do not change the principle of the Bill
at ail, but provide for the insertion of words
that have been omitted. The first is on page
2 of the Bill, line 5, paragraph iv. I would
move that the word "which" be inserted after
the word "within", so that it will read:
-the judge of the county court of the county,
or the judge of the district court of the district,
as the case may be, within which such place
lies.
The aimendment was agreed to.
On section 6, new section 21, subsection 2appointment by title:
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Subsection 2
of section 21, which begins at the 46th line
on page 3, reads as follows:
Any appointment made by the Chief Electoral
Officer may be made by reference to the title of
office of the appointee. . .
It is suggested that the word "the" be inserted between the words " of " and "office,"
making that line read:
-may be made by reference to the title of the
office of the appointee. . .
I move that the word "the" be inserted between the words "of" and "office" in the 47th
line on page 3.
The amendment was agreed to.
On section 12, new section 28, subsection 1
-polling divisions with 300 electors:
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: On page 6, in
section 28, subsection 1, there is evidently an
error by the printers. Printers seldom make
errors, I will say in their defence, but this
seems to be one place where they slipped.
Beginning on line 5, page 6, it reads as follows:
each designed to contain as nearly as possible
there hundred electors. . .
The word "there" should read "three." I
move that the word "there" be stricken out
and the word "three" be substituted therefor.
The amendment was agreed to.

to Rule 8, on page 18, the Electoral Officer

DIVORCE

JURISDICTION BILL
REJECTED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the second reading of
Bill 75, an Act respecting the domicile of
married women in proceedings for Divorce.
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH:
Honourable gentlemen, I was not able yesterday
to go any further than I did in what I was
trying to say with reference to this Bill, ani
I wish to thank honourable gentlemen for
their kindness to me in permitting, yesterday,
the adjournment of the debate.
I shall not attempt to-day to say all that I
was intending to say when I began to speak
yesterday, because I feel I am not able today to do it.
I am not well.
But I should
like to say somet.hing further with reference
to the proposals of this measure.
This Bill proposes two things: first, to make
a change, and a very radical change indeed,
in what bas always been the law as to the
domicile, or home, of any man and woman
who enter into matrimonial union.
But not
only does t'his Bill do that, contravening ail
existing principles in its proposal that there
mnay be, for the purposes of divorce, two
separate and independent domiciles of the
spouses (one of which may be but a temporary place of residence of the woman), but
Right

Hon.

Mr. GRAHAM.

it prpopses also to confer upon the court of
the province in which the domicile of the
woman has been chosen the jurisdiction to
decree divorce, and that jurisdiction is to be
exercised not only over the woman who bas
selected that court, but also over the husband, who very possibly has never in his life
been within the territorial jurisdiction of the
court to which the wife applies.
That
strikes me as a very extraordinary proposition and a serions inroad upon all the
principles which we have supposed underlay
the jurisdiction of our courts in Canada.
The point of view of importance in considering the jurisdiction of any court is not
whether or no it has jurisdiction over tie
complainant. The complainant gives it jurisdiction over herself by resorting to that court
for aid.
The question of importance às
whether or no the court resorted to has
jurisdiction over the defendant, that is to say,
over the person to answer. This Bill proposes a revolutionary change: it proposes that
a wife may apply for divorce to a tribunal
in sene other province of Canada, to which
ie resorts for that purpose, and for that
purpose alone, and that such tribunal shall
have jurisdiction over the absent husband,
and may take from him his status as a
married man and permit his wife to divorce
him. That seems to me simply a revolutionary idea, and I must admit that I have a
feeling of astonishment that a measure of
this sort should come to us from the House
of Commons.
If one is at liberty te speak here of what
one bas learned from the• newspapers, or
otherwise, of the reasons that were given in
support, of this measure in another place,
they seem to my mind equally extraordinary.
The Bill was supported as one concerning the
equality of the sexes. It was sa.id that the
woman seeking divorce ought to have equai
rigbts with the man. The proposal was apparently based upon the principle that the
female sex needed emancipation from the
domination of the male, and that a woman
must be given authority, by this measure, to
hunt, fron one province of Canada to another,
for some court in which, though her husband
might never have been in any way subject
to the jurisdiction of that court, she could
find the means of getting a divorce from him
Before sitting down I wish to draw attention to exactly what this Bill proposes. If
honourable gentlemen will look at it they
will sec that (superfluous words being elimi
nated, and the effect being stated in one
sentence) the Bill provides that a married
woman, deserted, may acquire a domicile
of ber own for the purpose of commencing

had become law it would have changed the
law in a very material respect, whatever the
consequences of that -change might be; but
it did not go by any means as far as the
present measure does.
This Bill being so ill-drawn, and having
received such inadequate consideration, I venture to offer the opinion that it needs far
more consideration than it bas yet received,
and in these circumstances I beg to move,
seconded by my honourable friend from La
Salle (Hon. Mr. Bureau):
That the said Bill be not now read a second
time. bu-t be read a second time this day six
months.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
gentlemen, it is no part of my duty to speak
on behalf of this Bill, and I have made no
special preparation in order to do so, but
as the Chaiirman cf the Seniate Committee
on Divorce bas gone home, I may, perhaps,
say a few words. The Bill may have some
latent defects, it may even have some which
are patent, but on the whole the principle
of it is one that I support. I am sure that
every member of this House is delighted to
hear the honourable gentleman who bas just

spoken (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth).
would be a ploasure, and an advantage, to
hear him more frequently than he bas been
able to address us.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: We are only
sorry that the bonourable gentleman was not
able to continue his remarks yesterday. We all
recognize-and I particularly, as one who was
a youth when ho was a legal practitioner in
Toronto-the very eminent position that he
bld, even before he became Minister of
Justice. I have always regarded the honourable
gentleman with a great deal of admiration as
a member of my own profession. However, as
you know, honourable gentlemen, not only
lawyers but even judges disagree, and I for
one do net fear the terrible consequences
predicted by my honourable friend.
I accede to the honourable gentleman's proposition that this House is not committed to
the position taken on the Bill of 1920. The
action taken at that time was simply an
expression of the opinion of this honourable
House, and even though the Bill never became
law, nevertheless, according to the records, it
passed this House unanimously, and I think I
may invoke that action n.s tending in a certain
direction.
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH.

I am absolutely in accord with the statement
of law made yesterday by the honourable
gcntleman as to what constitutes domicilethe domicile of origin, where the person is
born; the domicile of choice, where he elects
to live afterward; and the domicile of marriage
in the case of a woman who bas changed her
status and bas become a wife. There is no
dissent from these general principles at ail.
While a restatement of them may refresh the
memory of laymen in this House, to those who
are familiar with the Iaw of matrimony and
divorce they are nothing new. In saying that,
I do not wish to comment adversely upon
what the honourable gentleman bas said, for it
is quite wi:hin his right to remind us of these
principles.
I do not at all share the solicitude of the
honourable gentleman for the class of people
aimed at by this Bill, for they are absolutely
undeserving, and they are the only ones
punished, if anyone is. in the event of a dissolution o>f iarriage as a result of divorce
proceedings. The Bill says:
A married woman who either before or after
the passing of this Act has been deserted by
and has lived separate and apart from her
bhusband for a period of two years and upwards,
and is still living separate and apart from her
husband.
It deais only with the cases of wonmen whose
busbands have deserted them for a period of
two years or upwards.
Now, what is desertion? It is not the mere
leaving of a wife. I say that a husband
formerly living in the Province of Ontario who
bas deserted bis wife and gone to live outside
of that province is not deserving of our
sympathy. It will be for the court that hears
the application to decide whether or not he
bas deserted his wife, or whether the acts of
whicl he is guilty constitute desertion. I do
not admit that the illustration given by the
honourable gentleman of a husband who goes
to live in another part of Ontario is apropos.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: las desertion to be
proved before the application for divorce?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: No; it would
have to be proved to the court.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: But the woman bas
to prove desertion before making her application?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: She would have
to prove it in the course of her application.
She makes an allegation, as she would in
any other action in court; she asserts that
she bas been deserted for two years by her
husband; then when her application is heard
the judge bas to decide, among other things,

JUNE 7, 1929
wbether or not there has been desertion. The
act of a man ini rerely gaing frorn one portion
of the province to another, or from one province to another, in order to earn a livelihood,
does flot constitute desertion. It must be a
deliberate albandonrnent of the wif e qua wife.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: And withdrawal of
support.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: And withdrawal
of support. The mere fact that a man goes
away and works somcwbere cîse is only an
elernent to be considcred.
The honourable gentleman (Hon. Sir Allen
Aylesworth) has drawn a haraissing picture
af the poor man who has dcserted hais wif e
for two years foilowing bier to Winnipeg,
perhaps, and then chasing bier tbrough tbe
courts of the West as she changes lier domicile. and then back to the East. 0f course
such a thing is burnanly possible, but if the

is she to do other than find herscîf a home
and a means of adequately supporting bierself? She doca not have to go from one
province to another for the purpose of getting
a divorce, because she ýcan get bier divorce
in Ontario if she bas lived there; but sbe
may go to Manitoba because she bas cbildren
tbcre, or in order ta earn a livelibood. And
if she cannot cara it in Manitoba, there is
no reason wby she sbould flot go fartber west.
All this time she is trying to do wbat was
the bounden and legal obligation of bier busband, namely, to find bier a borne and support
bier.
As I say, it doca flot lie at my door ta
support this Bill. It bas been my privilege
-lot toa eagcrly sougt-to ait on the
Divorce Committee for a considerable number
of yeara. It is the dutýy of that Cornmittee,
as everybody in tbis Cbamber knows, ta
adjudicate an the question of domicile. That
question is constantly arising, and it is an
embarrassing and difflcult onc ta decide. The
law in England, so far as domicile is eoncerned,
lias been rather tigbtened up ini the celebrated
case af Cooke v. Cookýe, that went froém Alberta to the Privy Council ini 1924, if I remember tbe date correctly. Tbere were
nurnerous cases, the namnes of whioh I shal
flot rnention-hardsbip cases, as they are described. in the Old Country-in whicb the law
was interpreted differently, but in Cooke v.
Cooke the law ia laid down ranch more atringcntly. The law of this cauntry aa to domicile
was governed by the well known case of Le
Mesurier v. Le Mesurier, wbich is applicable
ta all the Dominions. In England the need
of a Bill of this kind would not be feit, because once a persan crosses tbe channel bie

is on the Continent, wbere tbey have different
laws and speak difflerent languages. The same
is truc in a lesaer degrec af the other British
Dominions. But unfortunately in Canada, because it lies alongside tbe United States, a
great aister nation who speaka aur awn. language, this meas-ure is more in point. We
know tbat intbe State of Micigan-I arn
speaking frorn memory now-f or twa or tbree
years past tbere bave been more divorces
granted ta Canadians than have been granted
in all the courts af Canada durîng the sarne
period. Sa our position is sornewbat unique.
Here wc arc, placed alongaide a great country
where, unfortunately, divorce is becorning too
common, and wbere it is granted for causes
that wc in this country would not conaider
for a moment. We bave bere anc standard
cause that should appeal ta every man. I
would flot have vcry mucb respect for a man
wbo was willing ta continue ta be the husband
of and to live with a debaucbed wife.
In tbe course af every year large numbers
of womnen go across the border into the United
Stateis and secure divorces frosu ttbeir buslbandjs.
It may be that in not a few individual cases
tbe husiband bas cornritted an offence that
warrants bis wife~s leaving hirn, but, whatever
the reason, rnany of aur warnen do secure
divorces in the United States. Many Canadian mcn do tbe same tbing, but we are considering for tbe tirne being tbe case of a
woman wbo takes tbis action.. It may be
thiat she remarries in the United States after
securing a divorce wbich ia lot recognized in
Canada, wbilc bier buaband and cbildren, if
any, continue to live in this country. In tbe
eyes of aur law that wornan is living in the
-United States in adultery, because abe had not
acquired a domicile separate from tbat of bier
buaband, and tberefore bier divorce is not legs]
here.
Tbe bonourable gentleman migbt suggest,
altbouga lie bas not donc so, that in no other
British country bas a law of this character
been enacted; but it must be considcred that
fia otber part of the British Emnpire is situat:ed geograpbically as we arc. Because
of aur peculiar conditions a law of this kind
rnigbt appeal ta us as sound and justifiable,
wbile it would not be regarded as desirable
at all by ather British counitries. If thia Bill
paaifcs this House and it is found ;ta be
wider in scope than it sbould be, it will be
subjeet ta, amendment afterwards.
I do not quarrel witb -tbc views af the hionoura!ble gentleman from Nortàh York (Hon.
Sir Allen Ayleswortb) in regard ta marriage-.
Tbere are very. many people wbo do not

a.ny person to take that view if he wishes.
As I say, if this Bil becomes law and it is
found that it does not work out in practice
as we had expeeted, it will be wilthin the
competence of Parli'ament, wh'ich has passed
the law, to change it.
I am not suggestiîng that any amendment will ever be necessary, but if we should find that the law
is responsible for some abuses which we had
net anticipated, and that unforeseen difficulties arise, then Parliament could amend

accede to the amendrment of the honourable
gentleman, and I shall vote for the Bill.
Hon. H. J. LOGAN: Honourable gcntlemen, the case made out against this Bill by
the honourable gentleman from North York
(Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth) is, I think, a
very strong one. I cannot understand bow
the Bill ever got through the House of Comions, because as it readsA married wornan who either before or after

must be a Canadian.
goes, "a married woman" might mean a
woman from any part of the world. That is
the first objection I have to the Bill, and I
cannot vote for the measure as it is presented
to us.
Then it strikes me that a very strong argucient has been made against the proposai to
legalize an application for a divorce by a
woman in different provinces. I cannot combat that argument.
But there is a principle in this Bill with which
I agree. Take the case of a m'arried Canadian
man who deserts his wife and goes to he
United States, where he gets a Renc divorce,
and subsequently marries another woman in
that country. He may have a family by his
second wife, but in any event he establishes
a domicile in the United States, while his
first wife-and, under Canadian law, his only
legal wife-remains in Canada and earns ber
living in this country. But she cannot take
proceedings for the purpose of securing freedom from that man, because ber domicile,
under our law, is in the United States, where
ber busband's domicile is. It is because of
the injustice that I think arises in such a
situation that I should like to sec all womnc
put on an equal status with men in proceedings for divorce. It is not a question of
whether we believe in divorce or not, but one
of justice to women who ray find themselves
in the position of the woman in the hypothetical instance I have just referred to.
Hon.

Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

In case some honourable gentlemen have net
followed me, I shall repeat what I have said.
If a man is married in Canada and deserts
his wife, goes to the United States, gets a
Reno divorce, as we call it, marries a woman
in the United States, bas a family by that
woman, establishes a domicile in that country,
his Canadian wife-his only legal wife. under
our law-has ber domicile in the United States,
and there is no way, as far as I can sec, by
Which that woman can acquire a divorce in
Canada. I should like to have that inconsistency and injustice removed. But I cannot vote for the Bill as it now stands, because
i, is mi.serably drawn. As I have said, I
cannot understand how it ever got by the
other House in this shape. I would mako a
suggestion such as this: "A married woman
who is a British subject,"Hon. Mr. BUREAU:
before the House.

There is a motion

Hon. Mr. LOGAN: I might move it as
an amendment, but I am just suggesting it
now: "A married woman who is a British
subject and has been resident in Canada for a
period of five years, who cither before or after
the passing of this Act has been deserted by
ber husband, residing out of Canada,''-and
then go on with the rest of the section. That
is the way I should like to see the Bill go
tihrough, but in the way it stands now I shall
have to vote for the six months' hoist.
The amendment of Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth was agreed to: ;contents, 18; noncontents, 12.
Hon. Mr. COBP: I was paired with tho
lonourable gentleman from Westnoreland
(Hon. Mr. Black) in a way, and J do net
know how he would vote on this question.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: With regard te the
honourable gentleman's statenent, I should
like to know how if is possible for honourable
members to be paired on a question like
ihis, and whether pairs are recognized in this
House. I do net sec how honourable gentlemen can pair on such a question. We are
net divided into parties here. We are supposed to take an impartial vikw of Bills and
other inatters that come before this Senate,
and decide them on their mnrits. If my
honourable friend should pair with soencbody,
both honourable gentlemen might happen te
agrce, and wish to vote the sane way. I do
net know whether there is any rule in connection with this question, but I think that
when a Bill comes up to be voted on every
niember present is required by the rules of
this Chamber to cxpress his assent or dissent

JUNE 7, 1929
'by voting. I should like to ask His Honour
the Speaker whether I amn correct in that
view. Is it flot the rule thýat every member
present must vote, Mr. Speaker?
Hon. Mr. COPP: While His Honour the
Speaker is looking up the point raised by rny
honourable iriend, I might say to him, if he
is offering criticism as to why I did flo vote,
that when I was in the other buse, if a pair
ivas made with a friend on the other side
of the House I always took particular care
to observe it. The other day rny hoejouraible
friend from Westmoreland (Hon. Mr. Black)
told me ho was going away, and asked me if
1 would pair with him on any vote coming
before the House. 1 was very glad to do so,
and I have kept faith with rny honourable
friend, as I promised. I may be somewhat
green or unlearned in the rules o'f this bouse,
and if I have committed a breach of etiquette
of the Sonate I apologize to bis Honour the
Speaker and to my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL:

I think you have.

Hon. Mr. GORDON: Before His Honour
the Speaker gives lis ruling, I should like to
say that my honourable friend from St. John
(Hon. Mr. Daniel), while he looked over at
the membor frorn Westmoreland (Hon. Mr.
.Copp), meant to give his desk-mate a littie
dig beeaiise he did not vote. I arn sorry that
I did flot have the excuse of having a pair,
but my case is one of ignorance, for I came
in too late to hear the latter part of the
speech of the honourable member from North
York (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth), and, as I
happened to ibe busily engaged, I could not
give this matter the thought that it deserved.
As a consequence I foît that I should not
vote.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL:
I would ask rny
honouraible friend if he did not read the Bill,
and form an opinion based on that reading.
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
Honourable
gentlemen, I would say that Rule 52 reads as
follows:
52. If two senators require it, the "Contents"
and "Non-Contents" are entered upon the
minutes: provided the Senaite shaîl not have
taken up other business; and eadh senator shal
vote en the question, openly and without debate;
unless for special reamons he be excused by the
Senate.
Then our Rule 54 says:
54. A senator, deelining to vote, shaîl assign
reasons therefor; and the Speaker shall submit
to the Senate the question,-"Shall the Senator.
for the reasons assigned by him, be excused
from votîng?"
I understand that the honourable senator
las assigned a reason for n-ot voting, and tIc

377

question is wîetîer le is to be excused. for
that reason.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
le is not excused?
TIe Hon. tIc SPEAKER:

What happons if
He has to vote.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The trouble is
that the vote has been already -taken. How
can you judge him or deal with him tIen?
Surely there is something rwrong witî that
rule.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Provide a motion excus-ing this honourable gentleman from voting.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: I would asic His bonour the Speaker how the vote is recorded in
the Chamber when the Speaker is in the
Chair. I thought that undor thc rules a standing vote was taken on.iy wîen tIe bouse was
in Committee of the Whoie.
TIc Hon. the SPEAKER: For the information of the honourable gentleman I rnight
read our wîole procedure. On the second
reading of a Bill:
71. Should the words "Not Content" be heard,
the Speaker says: "The Contents will pleaso
lise," and judging to the best of bis knowiedge,
says: "The Contents" or "Non-Contents have
it," adding, "the motion is lost" or "Carried:"
"Read the Bill" or "Cati the next Order."
72. If the "Yeas" and "Nays" are called for,
the Speaker says: " The Yeas and Nays being
called for by two Senators, the Contents wiii
please rise;" their naines laving been taken
down; the Non-Contents are then calied upon
te rise, and tîteir naines being also taken down,
the Clerk 'then reads from the Division List,
thus: "Contents 25; Non-contents 18," or vice
versa, and the Speaker says: "The Contents,"
or "The Non-Contents have it."
There are tîree mcthods of deaiing with a
vote in thc Sonate. First of ail, tho Contents
may ho asked to risc, and then the Non-Contents, and they need not be counted. The second method is that the Yeas and Nays are
caled for. andl they risp and are counted, and
tIen the Clerc, as he d-id on this occasion,
gives the result to the bouse. The third
rnethod is that if the words " Cali in the
Senaters " are heard, the Speaker rises and,
addressing the Sergeant at Arrns, says, " Cali
in the Senaitors." I have proceeded aecording

CANADA GRAIN BILL
FERST READING

Bill 359, an Act to amend the Canada Grain
Art.-Right Hon. Mr. Graham.
SECOND

READING

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM moved the
,second reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the text
of this Grain Bill may be somewhat new to
us, but we are more or less conversant with
the discussion on the subject. A commission
oe inquiry, known as the Brown Commission,
was appointed some time ago, heard evidence
and brought in a report.
That report was
referred to the Agricultural Committee in
anothe r place, which in turn placed the matter
in the bands of a sub-committee, and after
the sma.dler body had made its flndings the
report of the full Committee was presented
to the other House.
The Bill, which in its present form bas been
approved unanimously in another place, purports to deal with only the high spots of
grain legislation. Te
intention is to consolidate the Grain Act and probably introduce
several additional amendments at the next
Session. These high spots are the abolition of
grain mixing in grades 1, 2, and 3, an outturn standard of 75 per cent of the average
of the grade, with 25 per cent of the minimum,
and a provision allowing any producer of
grain to ship bis product to any terminal
elevator that ha seleicts. The Bill provides
also that in addition to tha three Grain Commissioners there shall be four assistants, who
are to be stationed in different parts of
Canada so that they may be on the ground
to give decisions when required. These are
the chief points of this legislation.
Hiot.

Mr. LAIRD.

I have been waited on by rapresentatives
of, I think, all the classes interested, and as
they are unanimously in favour of the Bill
as now before us, I do not think we can do
better than pass it.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
gentlemen, it ds alvays a pleasure to me to
find myself in accord with the leader of the
Gevernment. Tihis has frequently been the
case during the present session, vhich certainly
bas not been a contentious one. On this Bill
I am again in accord wiith my right honourable
friend opposite (Right Hon. Mr. Graham).
Wiýthout arrogating to myself any special
authority, I may claim that, coming as I do
from the greatest grain-growing province in
Canada, I have a fair first-hand knowledge of
the needs and desires of the farmers of the
West in regard to the operation of the Grain
Act. I venture to say that the great mass
of the farmers, whether members of the pool
or not, are in faveur of a change in the grading. I am equially satisfied that they are
opposed to mixing-to perhaps a greater
degree than to anything else dealt with in
the Act. The prohibition of mixing will not
come into effect for a year. It bas been
contended by the grain trade that in the
operation of the terminal elevators and in th
spouting of grain into the boats some technical
readjustments will be necessary in order to
meet the new conditions brought about by
this prohibition. As to that I do not profess
to have any technical knowledge, but it is
quite obvious that the sponsors of the Bill
have tried to play fairly with the grain trade
and to give them an opportunity to prepare
for the fate that is going to befall them, for
I have no doubt that next session mixing
will be absolutely abolished.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: May I be
permitted to interrupt the honourable gentleman? I omitted to say that the abolition of
mixing in grades 1, 2, and 3 will net come
anto operation until August, 1930.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
That is what
I am referring to.
The provision as to
mixing is net to become operative this year,
and it applies only to the higher grades. The
other provision-the standard of 75 per cent
of the average with 25 per cent of the
minimum of the grade, with the possibility
that -t may be extended to grades below No.
3-is a new departure, and it is hoped that it
will be beneficial to the farmer. It bas been
contenided in this House, as well as throughout the grain-,growing sections of Canada, that
there is a tendency to skim the grade to the
absolute minimum. I have met gentlemen

JUNE 10, 1929
from the Old Coun'try interested in grain, who,
while making no speoific charge against the
operation of the Act in Canada or the integrity of our grades, think that the present
Act does permit of the grade being skimmed
And that is
down to the very minimum.
reflected in the sale. The miller in the Old
Country is our purchaser; he buys on test, and
he knows what he is buying; and if it is
skimmed to the minimum of the grade, he is
weil aware of the fact when he offers the price.
It is therefore hoped that this experimentfor, after all, it is only an experiment-of
mixing 75 per cent of the average with 25
per cent of the minimum will result in a
better grade of grain of a particular class.
As there is no opposition from any party
in the other House, so far as I know, and
no opposition in this House, it would be in
my opinion aibsurd to make any extended
remarks. It is not the habit of members of
this House to make speeches for publication
unless they have some tangible object in view
in securing the rejection or the passage of
legislation submitted to us.
Hon. A. B. GILLIS: During the past two
or three years there has been a very objecti-onable form of ticket. I do not know
whether there is any provision in this Bill to

concerned, I may say that no legislation, no
matter how stringent it may be, will stop it.
To do that would necessitate the presence of
an inspector at every elevaitor in Western
Canada. There always has been and always
will be more or less mixing at the initial

cause it is important that the standard of our
grain should be maintained as high as possible.
It is probably advisable, though, to
pass stringent legislation for the purpose of
preventing mixing. However, what I intended
to ask was whether there is any safeguard
provided as to those tickets which were so
obnoxious.
I think my
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
honourable friend will find that provision is
made for a uniform ticket, to be supplied
under the supervision of the Grain Commissioners themselves.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

Right Hon. Mr. 'GRAHAM: I move that
the House go into Committee of the Whole
on this Bill.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: You need not
go into Committee at all, as far as this side
of the House is concerned.

379

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Then, with the
consent of the House, we will omit the
Committee stage, because there seems to be
perfect unanimity in regard to this legislation.
Shall the Bill be read the third time now?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: That will be
agreeable to this side of the House.
In
answer to what the honourable gentleman
(Hon. Mr. Gillis) has said about mixing, I
may say that we are dealing in this Bill only
with the terminals. The third reading may
take place now as far as we are concerned.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM moved the third
reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: When the Grain Bill
was before the Senate last year, or the year
before, there was some dispute between
farmers out in the West and the owners of
certain elevators at various points throughout
Western Canada.
Many of the farmers
objected to using those elevators. Speaking
from memory, I think that they wished to
place their own elevators there, so that they
would be free from the use of those elevators
that were already established. Against that
position it was argued that such a course
would destroy the investment of a very large
amount of -money spent in erecting those local
elevators, and would not be fair to those
who in good faith had invested their money in
that way. I should like to ask the right
honourable gentleman who is leading the
House whether any difficulty of that kind
exists now, or whether it has all passed away.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I would ask
the honourable gentleman opposite if he
knows anything about that.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
I am very
happy to state from personal knowledge, as
weIl as from what I have heard, that the old
line elevators have not been put out of business, but that, on the contrary, a very large
number have been built during the last year.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL:
They are still
running?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
Not only
running, but a great many more have been
built.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time and passed.

Canada, is well aware of the requirements in
this regard, as hie bas taken out permits in

For some time the press bas containcd
articles outlining the expedition which Commnander MacMillan and Ctommander E. F.
McDonald intended making this ycar to

by the High Comimissioner's Office in Londýon,
or Government was advised that Commander
McDonald bad written to the Royal Geographical Society offering to fly over Baffin

officially or unoffieially, using a Faircbi!d's

out that ail names of goographical features

Hon. Mr. Béland in the Ch-air.
On section 1-interpretation:
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: These interpretations are necessary in order to make clear
section 5 of the Bill.
Section 1 wus agreed to.
On section 2-fl.shery leases and licenses:
Hon. Mr. DAN IEL: This section amends
section 7 bY inserting dn the first line, after
the word "may," the words "in Mis absolute
discretioný." I should like to kn-ow what is
the Purport cf section 7. It refers to some
Iicensing authority, no doub't.
Perhaips it
refers to the Minister, but I do not know te
whom it refers. May we have a little explanalion as te whait it really means?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Section 7 as
it now stands reads as folilows:
The Minister may, wherever the exclusive
right of fishing does not already exist by law,
issue or authorize te be issued fishery leaees and
licenses for fiaheries and fishing wheresoever
situate or carried on; but leases or licenses for
any terra exceeding nine years shall be issued
only under authori.ty of the Governor in Council.

381

The interpret-ation that has been placed on
the word "may " is that the Manîater lias a
discrdtionary power. Under tihis interpretation
fishery licenses in British Columbia, for instance, were being restricted te white Britishi
subj ects and native Indijans. The question
whether or not the Minister has sucli discretionary power lias been raised, and wliile a
decision in the matter is still. before the courts,
it was decided in the Standing Committee on
Marine and Fisheries that this section should
be se amended as te leave ajbsolutelY ne room
for doubt that the Minister bas such discretionary authority. Hence the inclusion after
the word "may" cf the words "in bis absolute
discretion."
Section 2 was agreed te.
Sections 3 te 6i, inclusive, were agreed te.
On section 7-penalty for using trawls:
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Henourable
gentlemen, I might give an explanatien
whicýh I have received from the Department
concerning this section. Section 7 la substituted for section 5 cf the original Bill. The
Select Standing Coenmittee on Marine and
Fisheries finally reoomimended thýat inatead of
the original section 5 it 'be required that al
vessels operating otter trawls should be
licensed 'by the Minister, who should have
power te, determine the number cf such
licenses, and that the Governor in Couneil
shouid have autherity te specify the conditions under which such licenses would be
issued. Also, that su-eh vessels should flot be
allowed te operate within twelve miles cf the
shore, ao.d that they should be registered and
owned in Canada.
As the Fisheries Act prcsbably does net
apply beyond territorial waters, it is necessary in order te carry eut the recommendatiens of the Committee, that the Act be
amended se as te exercise the needed control
over such vessels when they are in our ports
and territorial waters.
The Atlantic Fisheries Commission divided
on the steam trawler question, four cf them
recommcnding the total abolition of trawlers
Irom Canadian ports, but the chairman
recommending control.
The obvieus and outsttanding difficulty cf
the situation is that a large fleeit of otter
trawlers from the United States, France, and
at times other European countries, operates
on the banks off our coasts, beyond territorial
waters. Also, even the abolition cf the use
cf trawlers froým Canadian Atlantic ports
would net prevent Canadian steam trawlers
from operating beyond territorial waters and

382

SENATE

taking their fish to United States ports, to be
shipped thence in bond to the interior Canadian markets.
It is essential that ail feasible encouragement should be given to the development of
our inshore fisheries and that to this end suoh
trawlers should be restrioted.
The Bill, as
amended, enables this to be done, and at the
same time subsection 3 will enable the
Department to encourage the inshore fishermen to equip themselves with small boats
operating along the lines of the bigger ones,
by means of which they can fish more steadily
and for a greater period of the year.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I should judge
that during the year those trawlers are not
to engage in fishing within twelve miles of
the land.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
I understand.

That is what

Section 8 was agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed to.
The Bill was reported.

UNITED STATES TARIFF
INQUIRY

Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Sir EDWARD KEMP: Honourable
gentlemen, I should like to ask the right
honourable leader of the House a question,
and in order to make it quite clear I ask
permission to read a brief Associated Press
despatch which appears in this morning's
Citizen:
Washington, June 12.-A formal note fron
France protesting against the proposal to increase tariff on certain French products
imported into the United States has been
by
delivered to the state department
Ambassado.r Claudel.
Formal protests against the tariff also have
been fyled by Spain, Italy and Persia, and
retaliatory action has been urged in these
countries as well as France. More than a
dozen nations have forwarded material through
the state department for the consideration of
the house ways and means and senate finance
committees.
I should like to inquire of the ight honourable leader of the House whether Canada has
forwarded representations to the Government
of the United States with regard to pending
tariff legislation of the United States and
any adverse effect it may have on Canadian
products going into that counitry.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Honourable
gentlemen, I have no information on this
matter. I wiill inquire of the Government,
and will cai attention to the question asked
by ny honourable friend.
ORiMINAL CODE AMENDMENT

BILL

REJECTED

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM moved the
second reading of Bill 81, an Act to amend
the Criminal Code.

383

Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
gentlemen, it is my intention to make but a
few remarks on ýthis Bill. I assume the Government have not been obsessed with the
necessity for this proposed legislation, or they
would have brought it down much earlier in
the Session. In a limited way, during the
time at my disposal, I have been looking into
the origin and the history of this Bill, and
if it reaches another stage in this House I
may have more to say on it than at present.
As honourable gentlemen know, the sections
of the Criminal Code which this measure
proposes to lepeal were passed in 1919. In
another place the Mdnister of Justice made
some remarks about the Bill having been sent
to this Chanber four or five times and rejected.
I have not loolked up this matter
myself, but I have caused the records to be
searched and I find that the samie Bill has
been passed by the other House on only three
previous occasions, namely, in the Sessions of
1926, 1926-27, and 1928, and it was not discussed there, in any formal way at least, fromn
the time the amendmente to the Criminal
Code were made in 1919 up to and including
the year 1925.
The first comment I have te make on the
Bill itself is that everynone admits there has
never been any proceeding, criminal or other,
under section 98 of the Criminal Code,
which we are asked te repeal.
This shows
that in actual practice, which is the best test
of legislation, the section has not been the
cause of hardship or oppression to anyone.
If there had been a prosecution under this
section of the Code we should have a record of
it; but it is conceded, even by those in the
other House who favoured the Bill, that
advantage has not been taken of the section.
It is a well defined practice in British Parliaments to pass legislation when the need
for it arises, or when public sentiment demanda it, and not to pass very much anticipatory legislation.
The only possible justification I can see for
the Bill would be the assumption that section
98 of the Criminal Code is prejudicial to the
rights of trades unions, but I can find no
ground for such an assumption in the section
as I read it. We on this side of the House
are as kindly disposed to the activities and
functions of trades unions as are honourable
gentlemen on the other side; we have no desire to harass or embarrass the unions, nor to
intenfere in their proper operations.
In accordance with a healthy practice which
I had some part in advocating, and which
was introduced in this House, there are explanatory notes printed with the Bill. These

384

SENATE

notes give us all the explanations necessary
for an understanding of the proposed logislation.
We repealed the old law against
sedition, a law which was not oppressive. As
I have stated, I am not going into an elaborate discussion of this matter, but I should like
to quote the opinion of an acknowledged
authority on our criminal law, and the author
of textbooks on it-Mr. Crankshaav. In the
third edition of his work on the Criminal
Code, page 131, he says:
At the present day, when the right of forming
political organizations. of holding political meetings. and of giv ing,-through the press, or on the
publie plattforni.-free expression to our thoughts
upon and criticisn of public men and affairs, is
so well recognized, a written or printed publication. a publie speech, or an assembly, meeting. convention or conibination would have to be
>f an extreimely vicions, inflammatory and dan,-rous character to form the basis of a success:ul prosecution for a seditious libel, a seditious
speech, or a seditious conspiracy.
Mark the language of this acknowledged
authority, that there would have to be something " of an extremely vicious, inflammatory
and dangerous character " in order to form
the basis of a successful prosecution.
Section 98 of the Code prohibits the use
of force in doing what nay perhaps be donc
lawfully by other means. Subsection 1 says:
Any association, organization, society or corporation. whose professed purpose or one of
whos.e purposes is to bring about any governmental. industrial or economical change within
Canada. by use of force, violence or physical
injiry to person or property, or by threats of
such injury, or which teaches, advocates, advises or defends the use of force, violence, terroiismi, or physical injury to person or property. or threats of such injury, in order to accomplish such change, or for any other purpose,
or which shall by any means prosecute or pursue
such purpose or professed purpose, or shall so
teach. advocate. advise or defend, shall be an
unlawful association.
I say that the application of that section in
any charge is based upon the use Of force.
Subsection 2 reads:
Any property, real or personal, belonging or
suspected to belong to an unlawful association,
or held or suspected to be held by any person
for or on behalf thereof may, without warrant,
be seized or taken possession of by any person
thereunto authorized by the Commissioner of
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and may
thereupon be forfeited to His Majesty.
Honourable gentlemen will notice that the
authorization to act without warrant cannot
be given by any subordinate official, but is
exclusively within the power of the Conmissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police. Every lawyer, at least, knows that
there are many cases where a search may be
made without a warrant.
H1on.

Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

Subsection 3 reads:
Any person who acts or professes to act as an
officer of any such unlawful association and who
shall sell, speak, write or publish anything as
the representative or professed representative
of any such unlawful association, or becone
and continue to be a member thereof, or wear,
carry or cause to be displayed upon or about his
person or elsewiere, any badge, insignia, emabien, banner, motto, pennant, card, button or
other device, whatsoever, indicating or intended
to show or suggest that ho is a member of or in
any wise associated witls any such unlawful
association, or who shall contribute anything
as dues or otherwise, to it or to any one for it,
or who shall solicit subscriptions or contribu.
tions for it, shall be guilty of an offence and
liable to imprisonmsent for not more than twenty
years.
Before this subsection can be applied there
must be an unlawful association such as is
dealt with in the first paragraph. It is designed to cover cases where force is used or
advocated.
Section 3 of the Bill amends section 134 of
the Criminal Code by providing maximum
imprisonment of two years instead of twenty
years as at present. I sulbmit, honourable gentlemen, that although section 98 of the Code
has been in force since 1919, it has resulted
in no abuse. Under it no subjeet of His
Majesty has been deprived of his liberty; in
fact, as I have already pointed out, no prosecution has been brought. It may be asked
why the section should be retained. My submission is that its very presence in our
Statutes is a warning to the people who might
be tempted to use force in the way that the
section prohibits, and that it operates as a
restraining influence upon them. If this law
were exercised oppressively against freedom
of intercourse, or if free assembly for lawful
purposes were prevented by arbitrary power
in any part of Canada, then, I submit, it
would be time for this Parliament to intervene. I appeal not only to my friends behind me, but to all who believe in the maintenance of safe, sane, established government.
Even more than to any others, perhaps, do
I appeal to our friends from Quebec, who
stand pre-eminently for stabilized, moderato
and strong government, and if I may say soI say it without being offensive-who stand
for ordered liberty.
I sec no reason why this Bill should now,
in these dying hours of the Session, be brought
again before this House, which on three
other occasions did not see fit to adopt it.
Apparently nobody is now complaining particularly about the law. If any complaints
at all are coming, they are from that section
of the community of whose views I do no.t
approve. Those who are designated as Reds
have something to fear from the present law,

JUNE 13, 1929
wbich is a warning of what will happen to
themn if they transgr-ess ag-ainst it. They
could nlot have been deait with adequately
under the former provision of the Code. When
organized labour through its representatives
intimates that its associations have been oppressed by this law-not merely by a barren
threat, but by the actual operation of the
Iaw-then we shahI have time to consider the
complaint and determine what should be our
attitude towarde a Bill of this kind. Therefore I cannot support the motion for the
second reading of this Bill, and I intend to
vote against it.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Honeurable
gentlemen, I cannot, of course, pretend to indulge in any legal argument on this measure.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Pardon me. I
presumne the right honourable gentleman is
not closing the debate. There arc others who
wish to speak.
Right Hon. Mr. GRiAHAM: They max as
well speak now.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable gentlemen, on the subjeet under discussion,
which bas been before us a number of times
-previously, I desire to say a few words because the Minister of Justice, whcn introducing the Bill this year in another place, stated
that it was prescnited at the rcquest of labour
organizations in Canada. I do not suggest
-that that statement is nlot true; I do suggest,
however, that it is onhly partially truc, and
that there are labour organizations in Canada
that do not desire to sec the law amendcd in
this regard.
The Miniseter wnbo introd-uced thc Bill stated
clearly iihait ftâ purpose wae to put the
Criminal Code, se fer as seditious utterances
and acts arc conccrned, in cxactly the position
that it, ocoupied prior tio 1919. Honourable
gentlemen wi.ll remember the serious trouble
that arrse ini 1919, wbe-n that bympatietic
strike oocurred which. everybody in Western
Canada knew wais a reviolutiona-ry move. The
old law permitted such things te be done, for
under the law s it stood, then men eauld
net -be brougbt Vo juxstice for oommititing offiances wbich were recgnized to be seditious.
Now it is proposed to rest.ore thait ]aw. 1v
wais emended ini 1919D becAuse of the experience cd thie oountry in that year. Ten years
have passed sinoe the aniendment was made,
andi ne persion in Canada, be he citizen or
not, has suffered any ineonvenience, embarraisment or oppression as a result of that
legislaticin. Su.rely, tbhen. there cught te be
some good reason for changing the haw at
the present time.

I atsk hoinourable gentlemen to look inte
their maorning papers of to-day and see what
is happening th.roughout the world as a resuit cif the propaganLa thMi is being carried
on by the very element tihat eaused this haw
to be brought into exis~tence in 1919. Sec
what ie going on in India to-day; the massacres that have occurred in Chins within the
lnst tdaree days; the airrest of tbirty-one
officia'k in Russia itselif, under the oppressive
laws tihat are in force there. Yet those people
comnpliain against ithis l-aw, which bas maintained order in this oountnjy fcir the haet ten
years. The claffl who are prutesting against
our law are the very ones that are oppressimg
their own people to-day.
Hon. Mr. HAYDON: Wouhd the bonourable gentleman compare those experiences
with ours?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My honourable
friend naay make his renmarks latoïr. Now, 1
suibmît that tihuis far no good rmaison ha.3
been advanced Vo prove the necessity for any
change of the law at this tumre, oir to ehow
the wiedom, of sucb a change. I have been
for inearly thirty years associated with one of
thbe recognized standard labour organizations
in Canada. For nearly twcnty years I have
been at the head of it in this country, and
as direotly representing mcTe than 8,000 men
in Canada now I say that there is in tbat
organiziation no snob sentiment a.s would
juatify tlhe startement. thiat a change in this
law is desircd. On the other band, the )aw

so this laïw, as long as irt stands on the staku-te

As one who, is perhaps as closely associated
witb erganized. labour in Canada as any honcurable gentleman in this Heuse, I would net

method -would be much preferable ta ail the
hole-and-corner atuif cont.ained in this rigmarole, which, I submit, although nlot a
lawyer, is a mere defacement of our statute
book. We might as well preserve the la.ws
against witchcraf t and say that they do no
barra because nobody bas been prosecutcd
under themn for a couple cf hundred years.
We all agree that men ought to be perfectly
free ta express their opinions, ta criticize the
Governinent, or to ad-vocate changes in the
mode of government, and while we want ta
impyress the publie mmid witb the idea that
force or violence must not be used in the
adva'ncement of ideas, it seems ta ie that
it is possible ta do so without ahl this rubbish,
which I think we ought, ta sweep off the
statute book.
Right Hon. Mr. G'RAHAM: Honourable
gentlemen, my words will be few. 1 started
ta say a few moments ago that I could not
enter into any legal argument, because I arn
nlot passessed of the necessary qualifications.
Nevertheleas a man may bold views outside
of those of the 1&w courts.
The argumnent of xny honourable friend
(Hon. Mr. Willoughby) that the presence of
this section of the Criminal Code on the
statute book bas prolbably had the effect of
preventing crime bas sosne force. We will
alI agree that it has not beeu used. But
surely the fact that it was on the statute book
did nlot evangelize ail the people of Canada
and convert aIl who are supposed ta be subnormal criminals ta proper thinking. It is

just as argua.ble that the fact of this statute

not having been used for ten years is at least
comparative proof that it was not needed.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: No.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: And a thing
that is neyer used is, in ordinaTy parlance,
useless.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: It is a preventive.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I say there la
some force in the argument of my bonourable friend, but it is not at ahl conclusive.
My own opinion is that, the statute as it
existed before 1919 would be more applicable
ta present-day conditions than the a>mendment adopted in that year. Honourable
gentlemen will agree that the conditions exiat-

387

ing at the end of 1919 do not exist to-day.
Conditions then might possibly be described
as a bit panicky, because at that time people
who were inclined ta be oppased ta stable
government and that sort of thing thaught
the time was ripe te take certain action, and
they did so. But we are now ten years away
froma the war. Nations are rediucing their
armnaments ta normal strength, and it strikes
me that we miglit very well remove from aur
statutes a weapon which bas neyer been used,
and substitute -for~this bigh-power guýn the
weapon that we had before 1919, which ta
my mmnd would be just as effective.
My honourable friend from, Welland (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) suggcsted that the trades
unions were not unanimaus. Well, I have
hardly ever known thcmn ta be unanimous
about any aone thing. In fact, about some
things we in this Hause axe not unanîinous.
But that does net alter the situation that a
great many of the tra>des unions are in faveur
of restoring the provision which was in the
Criminal Code before the war.
It will be remembered that in conjunctian
with the Criminal Code amendment in 1919
there was an amendment ta the Imimigration
Act which gave the Immigration Department
extensive porwers as ta the deportation of individuals fou.nd guilty of treason and offences
of that character. Last year the Parliament
of Canada, including this House, amended the
Immigration Act, and agreed, I t'hink unanimously, ta restare ta a large extent the old
law. The proposaî ta repeal the -provisions
placed in the Co-de in 1919 is along the line
of the action taken. by Parliament a year
ago in repealing certain clauses of the Imm-igration Act which were found. ta ha very
obnoxious.
I had thought of reading a portion of the
amendment of 1919, but my honourable friend
bas read sufficient, ta show that it is very
drastic. A considerable portion of aur population consider that that provision miay be a
reflection on thern or an impediment in the
way of carrying on the legitimate affairs of
tbeir organizatian, and I feel that we might
well trust the people of Canada ta adhere ta
the law which was previouely on. the statute
book, and wau certainly sufficiently drastie te
prateet the cit.izenship of Canada, aur Governmnent, and aur constitution..
The section repealed in 1919 reads as
follows:
133. No ane shail -be deemed ta have. a
seditious intention only because ha initands in
good faith-(a) to show that Hia Majasty has bean
misled or mistaken in bis meaeures; or,
(b) ta point eut erxors or dafects in the

Se far as this section is conjcerned,

I presume that we ail have advocated constitutienal
changes-different

doing things.
I tbink we should do 'well to
place a littie more faith in our fe1-low-citizens,
and to restore the section in force before the
amieiidmrnt of 1919, which, as I say, was
passed when the people were more or less
excited, and wben perhaps it was essential.
But the world is moving; that time bas
passed; and in my opinio>n we ought, as far as
possible, to, forget tbhe war and get back

SPEECH

FROM

THE

THRONE

After which His Excellency the Governor
General was pleasel to close -the Third
Session of the Sixteentli Parliament of the
Dominion of Canada
with the following
Speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I desire to express my appreciation of the
expedition with which yoi have conducted the
proceedings of the session of parliament now
concluded, and of the attention given by you to
its exacting duties.
It is gratifying to observe that it has again
been possible to effect a further reduction of
taxation, and also a substantial reduction in
the Public Debt.
The improvement in Canada's financial position lias been paralleled by a continnuos
improvement

in the

financial

position of the

Canadian railways and by a steady growth
in manufacturing and in domestic and foreigi
trade.
'lie Acts making provision for another
compreliensive progran of brancli line construction by the two railway systenis, for the
acquisition by the Canadian National System
of certain lines of railway in different provinces, for the construction of adequate terminal
facilities at Montreal, for the completion of the
Hudson Bay railway and harbour facilities at
Fort Churchill, and for further Joans to the
Harbour Comnissioners of our national ports,
are indications of your recognition of the urgent

demand for more adequate transportation and
trade facilities.
The policy of promoting the expansion of
trade by assisting the establishment of steamîThe Hon. The SPEAKER.

slip services abroad bas been amply justified.
The Canadian National service inaugurated last
vear to ports in South America lias required
tlue addition of more ships than was at first
contemplated, and the West Indies service
has attracted an increasing export trade. Provision bas been made for an increased service
te South Africa, also for establishing a new
connection with Australia and New Zealand.
Provision bas also been made for an increase
in the number of Trade Commissioners in
foreign countries.
Resulting from an exhaustive inquiry and a

unanimous report by the Standing Committee of
the House of Comnions on Agriculture and
Colonization, amendments have been made to
the Canada Grain Act respecting the storage,
shipping, mixing, inspection and grading of
grain, which it is believed will more adequately
protect the standards of Canadian grain and
prove of benefit to the producers.
With a view to the improveient of the existing electoral system, a Special Comnittee of the
louse of Commons was appointed to inquire
into the Dominion Elections Act and the Corrupt Practices Inquiries Act.
After devoting
much, time and study to the several subjects
submitted for its consideration, this Committee
also presented a unanimous report, in accordance with the recommendations of which
iuportant
amendmuents
to the
Dominion
Elections Act have been enacted.
Among other
changes introduced by this legislation, provision is made for the future appointnent of
returning ofeicers by the Clief Electoral Officer,
and for a more efficient method of preparing
election lists in urban centres.
Among

other

important

measures

enacted

vere Bills respecting pensions to employees of
the Canadian National Railways, also amendients to the Narcotir Drug Act, the Fisheries
Act. the Insurance Act, and the Juvenile
Delinquents Act.
The report of the Royal Commission appointed to inquire into the financial read-

justments incidental to a transfer to the Province of Manitoba of its natural resources has

been received. The report will be made the
basis of negotiations between the governments
