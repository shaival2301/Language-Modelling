I welcome you at a time when our country
stands upon the threshold of a new era of
prosperity. It will be for you, by your labours,
to throw wide the door.
During the past year the grip of liard times
bas been broken.
Conditions show inarked
improvement. Empicyment is increasing. Our
trade is expanding. The national revenues are
higber. These evidences of recovery attest the
wisdomn and efficacy of the measures you have
taken. In these improved conditions, there may
now successfully be carried forward those great
tasks of reformn upon whicb the well-being of
this country depends.
In the anxious years througb which you have
passed, you have been the witnesses of grave
defects and abuses in the capitalist system.
Unemployment and want are the proof of these.
Great changes are taking place about us. New
conditions prevail. These require modifications
in the capitalist system to enable that systemn
more effectively to serve the people. Ref ormn
mneasures will therefore be submnitted to you
as part of a comprehiensive plan designed to
remedy the oocial and economie injustices now
prevailing, and to ensure to al] classes and to
ail parts of the country a greater degree of
equality in the distribution of the benefits of
the capitalist system.
Upon this plan you have made a 'begianing.
Reform measures approved by you at the last
session of Parliament are already in ouccessful
operation. I observe with especial gratification
the manner in wbich the Natural Produets

ABITIBI POWER DEVELOPMENT
QUESTION 0F PRIVILEGE

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Honourable
members, it is with very real regret that 1 feel
compelled to invite the attention of the
House to a matter which concerns myseif,
especially as this is the second occasion on
which I have feit it my duty to do so, and
especially also as I have reason ta feel, and
have had reason to believe, that this buse
is flot very receptive to a discussion of the
subi ect.
It will be recalled that on the 6th of ApriI,
1933, the subject having been introduced, in
a manner to which no one could take exception, by the honourable senator fromn London
(Hon. Mr. Little), I referred to certain aspersions affecting myseif and made a very definite
statement regarding them, to every sentence
and line of which I now wish to express complete adherence.
Subsequently certain correspondence took
place between myself and the Prime Minister
which resulted in the appointment of the
Chief Justice of Canada to investigate certain
specifie allegations reflecting on myseif. Prior
to this, correspondence had passed between
the then Premier of Ontario and myseif. I
shall not burden our record with this cor-~
respondence, but shall meqely refer honourable members to it, as it is contained in
tevidence to whichi I shall presently refer.
After appointment of the Chief Justice of
Canada to which I have alluded, a furtherstop was taken by the Govornment of Ontario,
and an investigation was held last summer..
It was during the course of evidence theregiven that the correspondence to which I
have just made allusion was presented. I
intend to be excoedingly brief, because the
subject does flot warrant consideration at.
length on my part under present circumstances;
so I merely rofer honourable members to that
correspondence and the subsequent carrespondence between myseif and the Prime
Minister of Canada, ail of which appears
in the evidence so given.
I now merely wish to read two letters. One
of them was addressed by myself on the 4th
day of the present month to, the Prime Minister. It is as follows:
My dear Prime Minister:
I regret indeed thaît circusastances impel me
to bother you again with respect to the matiter
of allegations made somne time ago regarding the
purchase of Ontario Power Service bande and
the appointient by your Government of the Rt.
Han. the Chief Justice of Canada to make enquiry into same in eo far as such allegations.
affect my honour as a public man.

JANUARY 22, 1935
of certain bonds and ultimately of the property
securing the same.
From the documents, it
would appear that your contention was that tbe
property being administered by the Hydro Commission bedlonged to the seven hundred or more
partner municipalities (subjeot, o course, to
indebtedness) and that as Commissioner you
were acting as Trustee of such municipalities
and that, as the contemplated purchase was
being made by the Government of Ontario on
the credit of that Government and the properties
of the municipalities were in no way affected
it wvas net your duty to review the merits of
the Government's bargain. Consequently, you
believed and statel that you had no discretion
to exercise affecting in any way the price to be
paid for the bonds and properties. On this
belief your fellow Commissioners aIlso acted.
The investigating Commissioners appointed by
the Governor in Council of Ontario took another
view. Se far as I can gather from the publ he1 renort of their finding they hold that
the properties being administered by the Hydro
Commission do not belong to the partner municipalities but to the Province of Ontario and
that you had a duty to check and review any
purehases being made by the Ontario Government
I do not wvish-in fact it would be highly improper for me-to comment on the soundness or
unsoundness of their interpretation of the law,
but I think it fair to say that the idea of the
Hydro properties net being held for the partner municipalities bas not been heretofore the
accepted understanding of the situation. The
Hydro Commission is appointed and dismissible
by the Government itself. It is hardly conceivable that the Legislature intended to clothe
that body with the power to review and control
the actions of the Government which had appointed it with respect to purchases that in the
opinion of the Government should be made on
the terms agreed upon. I decline to assume
that the Legislature intended to set up a commission having power to modify or even nulify
agreements for purchases made by the Government which appointed it.
But the important consideration-indeed the
only consideration of interest te this Government-is not whether the investigating Commissioners are right in their interpretation of the
law or whether yeu are right in your interpretation. What concerns us is whether they
found in the circumstances anything reflecting
on your honour as a public man. Assuming for
the sake of argument that they are right and
you are wrong. it would appear to me even from
the Latchford-Smith report, that your view was
honestly held; this seems to me to dispose of
the question.
Under these circumstances, I really do not
feel there would be any justification for us
making to the Chief Justice the representations
you request. It is a matter of sincere regret
to me not to be able to meet your wishes, but
I trust on further reflection you will agree with
the views I have expressed.
With kindest regards, believe me,
Yours faithfully,
R. B. Bennett.
There is very much more that I coudd say.
I refrain at this time because of a conviction
that the House does not feel it appropriate
that I should say it. I accept the position
taken by the Prime Minister; but if any tonourable member of this House takes another

view, or feels that upon that report my honour
is even in the most oblique or remote way
concerned, I invite him to move here for a
committee to investigate the allegations made
against me. I shall accept such a motion without the shadow of a feeling of resoentment.
What is more, I shall support it and invite
and urge honouraible members to support it
as well. I shall gladly appear before that committee. But if it should not be the wish of
any honourable member so te move, then
from this date onward I shall treat this report
of the Latchford-Smith Commission with the
attention it deserves, which is exactly none
at all.
THE GOVERNOR

GENERAL'S SPEECH

ADDRESS IN REPLY
The Senate proceeded to the consideration
of His Excellency The Governor Genemal's
Speech at the opening of the session.
Hon. L. COTE rose to move that an Address be presented to His Excellency the
Governor General to offer the humble thanks
of this House to His Excellency for the gracious Speech which he has been pleased to
make to both Houses of Parliament.
He said (Translation): The right honourable leader of this House was no doubt thinking of the evangelical precept that "The last
shall be first" when te entrusted me with
the important and perilous honour of moving
the adoption of the Address in reply to the
Speech from His Excellency the Governor
General.
I accepted this task, the fulfilment of which
impresses me anew with a full consciousness of
my inexperience and lack of eloquence, merely
in order net to show ingratitude.
I hope the right honourable leader of this
House will allow me to express my sincere
thankfulness for his having thus honoured me
particularly. I must also tell him how happy
it makes me to see him in his seat, looking se
hale and healthy after his trip to the antipodes, where he contributed to inerease tte
fame of our country.
It is no doubt truc that, in this honourable
House, designed more for control and supervision, my right honourable friend must sometimes long for other spheres of public life,
spheres where te formerly served his country
so brilliantly. On the other hand, the very
thought that in this assembly which he adorne,
thanks to his vast experience, his clarity, his
intellectual power and integrity, he is still
serving his country, must sustain and console
his patriotism, and that, much better than my
feeble words could express.

SENATE

In these .precinots, which one feels to be
free of partisan feeling, shall I lay myself
open to accusations of party spirit if I offer
to the Prime Minister of Canada the expression of my personal homage? Who would
dare criticize me for greeting here the one
who took oommand of the ship of state, at the
very moment when it was already rocked by
the storm? And yet, his faith and courage
were never shaken, nothing could disturb
the ship, net the fury of the destructive elements which threatened it, nor the number of
reefs in its way, nor the doubt expressed cocerning its future.
His arduous and unceasing labours have
been an example to the nation. His confidence in the vital forces of the country and
his determination to overcome the difficulties
of the hour have everywhere given birth to
new courage and strength.
Generously and without counting the cost,
he gave himself to his noble and heavy task,
and it is net an exaggeration to say that if
valour, if love of couetry and trust in its
destinies were to disappear from Canadian
soil, t would be possible to rediscover them
in the heart of the Right Honourable Richard
Bedford Bennett.
And to-day, when the storm is abating and
one may read in the speech which His Excellency offers to our consideration that "the
grip of bard times bas been broken," that
"conditions show marked improvement," that
"employment is increasing," that "our trade
is expanding," and all these statements are
based on facts, as I shall try to show briefly
later, I believe it would be sheer ingratitude
mot to say to such a captain: Bravo and
thank yeo.
Honourable senators, since we parted last
July, the year 1934 ended its course and gave
us many reasons for rejoicing, as well as many
reasons for strengthening our courage, and
for temperingv our faith in the future.
anew
This time last year, the threatening clouds of
war overhanging old Europe as well as the
whole world, ready to break and by means
of the horrors of the new discoveries of science
te spread ruin and cieath on our modern
civilization, were the cause of great apprehensien among us. We realized fearfully that
distrust, hatred and international rivalries
were an ever rising tide. We deplored the
failure of the League of Nations.
What is 1935 offering to us? It is true that
the clouds have not all vanished. The great
nations have net yct solved the problem of
disarmament, but certain events have decreased-to quote the Speech from the Throne
-"the political tension and unrest in Europe

Mr. COTE.

which have intensified rivalry in armamente
and economic restrictions.'
The agonizing problem of the Saar basin
is being settled. The plebiscite is over. The
results were awaited with great interest, but
the solution of the grave problem which it
raised had already been found in Geneva,
before the polling. Europe owes this conspicuous success to the efficient part played by
the League of Nations. its Couecil, and the
Committee of Three. Thanks to the Conmittee, a settlement was reached concerning
economie and financial questions, a settlement
satisfactory to the French as well as to tie
German interests.
Ruissia has joined the League of Nations.
The Union of Soviet Republics bas modified
its foreign policy; bas given it a new orientation which becomes a significant indication.
The .Russian authoritieswere for ever criticizing
the League of Nations, they suspected all its
actions and openly expressed scepticism as to
the usefulness of its work They have turned
entirely around. If you leave aside its revolutionary theories on society, Russia bas become
to a certain point a power for peace in international affairs.
She bas been obliged to admit that ber
problems, as far as international relations are
concerned, are the same as those of other
countries, and that common action is the most
likely solution to these complicated problems.
I must say a word concerning the eminent
service rendered by the League at the time of
the double assassination in Marseilles. If it
had not been for the unanimous and immediate decision of the Council of the League,
the ýdiametrically opposed views of Yugoslavia
and Hungary musc have started a conflagratien, and it is only just to admit that the
peaceful solution arrived at by the Council
saved us from war.
It is therefore not temerity on my part to
believe that this honourable House will not
hesitate to endorse the statements from the
Speech froin the Throne, and that it will
recognize that if our fears are allayed to-day,
it is "largely as a result of the renewed determination to make use of the agencies of conciliation and co-operation provided by the
League of Nations."'
It seeins therefore that not only is the danger of war removed, at least for the moment,
but there is even the possibility of European
accord.
Canada will no doubt benefit through the
economic relhabilitation which this accord will
bring forth and we may confidently expect-provided of course we do net forget the co-

JANUARY 22, 1935
operation we awe ta the League of Nationsta set ta work ta, secure the stability of its
ecanomic and social welfare.
It wae ýmoat fitting. that is Ex-cellency, in
his speech, ehould mention the fourth centenary af the discovery of aur country, as well
as the- celebrations in honour of that famous
navigator, th-at illustriaus explarer, that great
Frenahinan, Jacques Cartier. Our population
was delighted with these celebratians, and it
is only right ta say that the echo froin Gaspé
was carried froin ane spire ta another, ever
grawing until it found its highest expression
froin tihe tower whieh crowns aur federal
buildings.
May I be alýlowed ta congratulate the joint
chairmen af the orgianizing committee of these
celebrations, the remembrance of which will
long endure. Bath are popular members of
this bouse, the honourable member fromn
Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) and the
right honourable member framn Eganville
(Rigbit Hon. Mr. Grahamn). Nor should we
forget their zealous collaborators.
Thanks ta the recalling of this fine and vital
page of bistory, ta the visit of such large numbers of au-r frienda from aid France, ta the
presence of the 'United Kingdomn delegate&-moved also, as tihey weTe, by the remeinbrance of s0 much glary, their tactful and
delicate speeches giving us ta 'understand that
they shareýd the jay brought by reunion ta the
sons5 of aId France and New France, the latter
being devoted subjects of His Majesty King
George-thanka3 ta ahl that, we were reminded
once mare af the necessity of an entente
cordiale between Great Britain and France, if
we would sec the unhampered progresa of the
charmas and advan-tages af European civilizatýion.
Those celebrations aocomplished even more:
they remninded us Canadians that the representatives af the twa pioneer races in this
country sbould mare than ever strengthen the
feelings of friendship and solidarity which
must fiourish among thein, if we wish ta
develorp a national spirit, a Canadian spirit
bath hardy and worthy af aur immortal
destiny.
1 have always, in my own province of

Ontario, p-reached the nemcessity (>f this understanding, the

necessity

for mutual

respect

of the dignity af eux ethnical inheritance and
ai aur mutual aspirations, and Sir Robert
Borden proved thet ha felt that -necessity
also, and expressed it as folows in bis "Canada
in the Commonwealth":
The qualities of the French and the English
temperaments are in many respects campiemientary. Bach is capable af distinctive service ta

7

the state, and each has given it. Not in fusion,
but through co-aperation, the highest service of
the two races can best be given ta Canada.
In Canada, the French race, maintaining ite
distinctive qualifies, bas byrougbt to the service
of the country mueh that is valuable. In somne
measure, the qualities of each race may serve
to aid the possible deficiencies of the other.
Tu-ening to the economir, sphere, what dlid
Canada reap from the year 1934? There was
an increase in auT international trade. For
the first time since 1931, the total of our imports and exports was beyond a billion. To
be exact, it reached the sum of $1,173,373,000,
compared ta the $939,000,000 of 1933, representing an increase of $234,373, or 24 per cent.
And we rnay hope that this progress will
continue, thanks ta a palicy of commercial
pacts, a policy which bas been so, beneficial
ta us since the beginnîng of the depression.
It was witih great joy indeed tbhat we heard
yesterday the sta-teme nt of the Prime Minister
concerning negotiations with the UJnited
States, designed ta resuit in a pact or treaty
which. will allow Canada ta enjoy the benefit
af the American market in a reasonable way.
Unemployment has greably decreased. Statistics for tihe flrst eleven months ei 1934 show
that the labour index improved by 15.1 per
cent; the volume oi business by 19.3 per cent;
whalesale prices by 6-9 per cent; mining
production by 23.1 per cent; the receipts of
the national-ly-bwned railways by 11.5 par
cent, and those of the C.P.R. by 10.2 per cent.
There is soaine impravement also in the
farinera' lot. In 1934, the value of farm
products came ta $536,000,000, compared to,
$423,000,000 for 1933, representing an inarcase
of $113,000,000, at least haîf of which will be
maney in the farmers' hands.
One cao easily realize the benefits that aditional buying pawer will bring nat oynly ta the
farmers but also ta the econamic structure.
I do flot wish ta wast;e the time of this
Huse in arder ta prove at length what is
conceded and commented lupon by the whole
world, namely, that Canada is pulling itacîf
out of the depression just as well as certain
cauntries and much better than many athers.
Hawever, it seems unfortunately obvinus
that if we maintain aur economic system in
its presept forma we shail neyer succeýcd -i
giving ta aur people the assurance af happiness
and comfort which cvery citizen is entitled to
expeat. and which tihe community muot give
hum. When I speak of happiness, I mean
chiefiy that sense oyf very legitimate satisfactian which arises froin the recei-pt of a reward
commenm'rate with the work donc.
That is what His Excellency tells us in bis
message:

SENATE
In the anxious years through which you have
passed, you have been the witnesses of grave
defects and abuses in the capitalist system. Unemployment and want are the proof of these.
What are the defeets of the capitalist system as it operates to-day and will operate tomorrow if there is nobody to change it, to
modify it and to consolidate it?
Is its failure to produce in large quantities
for humanity the necessities of life and comfort the cause of these defects? Certainly not,
as machinery intended to relieve the worker's
muscles and the new processes invented by
hurnan ingenuity can produce and, as a matter
of fact, do produce more than the great
universal family cean absorb.
Can you understand how whole populations
are suffering from bunger when the granaries
are filled with wheat? The only answer to that
question is that the capitalist system failed in
its task of distributing cquitably, among all
the elements of the community, the annual
production of the farmer and the workman.
The laEk of work and, consequently, of bucying power, has been the main cause of that
failuire.
To the defects of the system have been
added egotism and want of foresight on the
part of the producers.
The human point of view and even Christian
charity have been forgotten to such an extent
that human labour has become an article of
trade. Manufacturers would settle in one
province rather than in another on account of
cheapcer labour-" a eh acp labour market
Some people will say that we should leave
people free to profit by their egotism. The
answer to that false theory about freedom is
tha.t we must claim for this Parliament and
this Chamber, which are the manifestation
of democracy, that they have the right to
legislate in order to guarantee the welfare of
the people.
As the leader of this Chamber said last
year, the treatment should be a new one. Let
me quote his words. After having shown to
what extenit machinery took the place of the
workers, he said:
But the naked and unassailable truth, which
only stupidity eau prevent anyone from seeing,
is that if the United States were to be brought
back to-morrow to the peak production of 1929,
a production which the world utterly failed to
consmne or to purchase, there would remain
in that country no fewer than six and probably eight millions of unecployed, representing
virtually one-third of its whole earning population. What is true there is true in other lands,
but the enigma is greater and perhaps the lesson
ought to bc clearc'r wxhen one looks upon the
situation as a phenomenon of the United States.
That is essentialily an immensely wealthy country, the greatest self-contained country in the
vorld. If it were a planet it would not need to
Hon. Mr. COTE.

trade with any other planet in order to multily
the wealth of man. It produces either all that
mankind needs or effective substitutes therefor,
and if it couild devise a plan for putting to
work those millions who are now unemployed
it would be a happy land. When we sec that
country struggling in the throes of one of the
most terrible depressions that any nation has
ever had to face, when we sec its people in
sudh desperate straits that even the people of
Old England are prosperous in comparison, we
are forced to think that something further is
needed than mere amendments te tariffs and the
holding of international conferences. or the trying of other and somewhat archaic medicines
thait have been applied to the body politic in
the past.
What wilI these reforms be?
The mes.sage of His Excellency points out
the ones already passed by this House, such
as the creation and the realization of a Central
Bank and the law res'pecting the metal coverage for our bank bills. Thac main object of
these laws is to provide a control of the financial credit of the country in order to secure
a greater amount of stability and prosperity.
We know by experience that it is much
better to enjoy reasonable comfort during our
whole lifetime rather tban be rich to-day and
poor to-morrow. On the other side, it is a
well known fact that a rational control of
credit is necessary to prevent, in the economie
body, those sharp ups and downs which always
bring poverty in their wake.
So we shlil have to study laws establishing
usinimum wages and maximum wceyiv hoiurs
of work; laws providing for the security of the
workers during periods of unemployment and
sickness and in old age; laws to put an end
to certain abuses in commercial methods, and
many othber legislative measures.
All those laws will tend, after all, to attain
the same result, so necessary to the avelfare of
the people: a more equitable distribution of
the buying power among our population. In
other words, that equitable measure of buying
pover is expressed by reasonable income or
wages which citizens can live on, according to
the legitimate aspirations and the dignity of
man.
Also, ln order to attain that result, we shall
have to study laws intended to divide the
burden of taxation so that its incidence will
be more consistent with the paying capacity
of the taxpayer.
These reforms cannot be made in one day
and they will form part of a concerted scheme.
To the ones already mentioned will be added
other schemes which will complete or perhaps
modify them. I think, however, that the
object towa.rds which we should concentrate
our whole ability, efforts and goodwill is as
clearly indicated as the Polar Star indicates

JANUARY 22, 1935
the north and it is to bring about, by judicious
but courageous legisiation, the disappearance
of social injustices resulting flot from the
capibialist system itself but from its defects
and deficiencies.
Honourable senators, I amrn ot an economist. I obtaincd my political experience in
a more humble Legisiature than
this one,
where problems, such as public edu'oetion,
hospitals, public roads, mothers' allowances
and other matters relating to publie services
were constantly under consideration. However, the opinions 1 bave briefly expressed
reflect triily, 1 am sure, the state of mind
of the Canadian citizen wvho bas reached
the age of forty. This citizen belongs to a
large section of our population which started
in active life a fittle before or during the
Great War. A turmoil, the bitterness of
whieh wvas flot lessened by the dance of the
dollars between 1926 and 1929, followed the
War. We were born under the old regime,
but we neyer have entirely enjoyed the fullness of its development. We bclong to a
transient generation coming between the old
regime and the new one which we are hopefully looking for, ready as we are t'o set our
efforts towards its realization or at least to
contribute loyally to it.
Because of the arduous living conditions in
whieh we have found oursel-ves the men of my
generation have mae a sp-ecial euidy of the
chaotic condition of public affairs, they have
searched for a formula likely te re-establish
order, they have pondered over prcb1es
which interested our predecessors huit littIe.
It would be presumiptuous to say that the
formula is found, but at leapt, we have our
convictions.
And while we are ready to dling te alI that
is useful and good in the old system, which
we receîved as part of our inheritance, we wish
te mcdify that systcm, so t-hat it ma; become
an instrument for happîness in the body
politic.
1 am convinced I am tru-ly describing the
state Mf mmnd of the honourable members of
this House, ne matter what their political
affiliations may be, ne matter what the scope
cf their experience, when I say thiat it is with
these sentiments that they will undertake the
study of the measures forecat in the Speech
from the Thone.
I have the honour Vo move that an address
be prcsented te lis Excellency the Governor
General, expressing the gratitude of this Huse
for the gracious speech he was pleased te
deliver te botih Houses of Parliament.

Hon. RALPH B. HORNER: Honourable
members, in rising ta second the Address in
reply te the Speech from the Throne, I feel
it my duty te thank the right honourable
leader of the Government for the very high
honour bestewed on me. an henour intended.
I take it, net se much for myself persenally
as for the great agricultural province cf Saskatchewan from which I corne, as well as fer
the farming communities generally throughout
the Dcminion.
I must ask honeurable members to bear
with me should I fail to maintain the high
traditions of these debates.
I arn delighted te secend this Address, for
I believe that the Speech from the Throne
will be regarded as an historie document.
Were it net that we are supposed to refrain
from discussing party politics, I should be
terrpted to say that the promised social legislation is such as we should expect from the
source front which it ernanates.
The Speech frem the Throne contains this
paragraph:
In the anxious years through which you have
passed, you have been the *witnesses of grave
defects and abuses in the capitalirt systemn. Uneniployrnent and wan't are the proef of these.
Great changes are taking place about us. New
conditions prevail. These require rmodifications
in the capitalist systemi te. enable that systemn
more effectively te serve the people..
Last session Parliament passed the Natural
Produets Marketing Act. When that legislation was before this Chamber seme bonourable members were opposed te it. Now 1
think I may be able te convince them of
the necessity for the Act and the great benetit
which has already resulted from its eperation.
We had felt for some time, particularly in
Western Canada, that the primary producer
should be assisted te organize in order te,
scîl bis ewn produce at the least possible
expense, on a basis similar te that adopted
by those from whem hie purchased bis requirements. Instead, the farmer had te, take wbat
hie was told bis produet was worth. On the
other hand, when buying bis implements,
the farmer was told what they cost te produce and what profit was added, and lie
could pay the price demanded or go without.
In other words, hie carried the whole burden
of bass.
Now, as I say, we have had evidence that
those who were selling the primary products
were net treating the primary producers
fairly. During the past few years of the
depressien the packers were paying for heavy
hogs as low as one cent and a haîf a pound.
Permit me te relate a personal experience. I
hiad a hog that when dressed would weigh

SENATE

10

six hundred pounds, and after I had paid
freight it would have brought me $7. The
local butcher processed the animal for me on
a fifty-fifty basis, and we each had 825 worth
of lard and pork. It is quite evident that when
a producer receives such a poor return from
the packer something is wrong with the
system. I am convinced that the Act will be
of untold benefit to the Prairie Provinces,
and this benefit, in the form of additional
revenue, will be reflected throughout the
whole country. Marketing is the important
end of any industry. There can be no doubt
that the remarkable success of Henry Ford
may to a large extent be attributed to the
efficiency of his sales service. I submit that
through the operation of the Marketing Act
our farmers will receive the quickest and
surest notification when they are producing
any line of produce in excess of market
requirements.
We hear suggestions with respect to the
control of wheat marketing. In my opinion
the most satisfactory medium the farmers of
Western Canada ever had for disposing of
tlieir wbeat was known as the Meighen Wheat
Board, wbich was established in 1919, and
for which we have to thank the right honourable leader of this House. Should any similar
measure come before this House, J would
appeal to honourable nembers for fair criticism. In 1919 those in Western Canada who
were opposed to our leader advised the
farumers te throw away their certiflicates, for,
they said, they were of no use. I advised to
the contrary. The certificates were valuable,
and those who held them received forty-eight
cents a bushel for their holdings. Those who
threw away their certifirates lest thousands
of dollars.
Another Act passed last session, the
Firmurs' Creditors Arrangement Act, will, I
t
onvinced, prove of great benefit te our
fatrmers. It has been stated that an arrangement under the Act will pay off more debt
than a good crop. It is working out very
satisfactorily. True, many of the land companies had been making adjustnents right
along with their debtors. For instance, the
Canadian Pacifie Railway Company in many
cases rut the price of its land in two;
the Iludson's Bay Comupany for a timo
adopted the policy of allowing a credit of 82
for every dollar paid in cash; the Canadian
National Railways followed a similar policy.
On the other band, many mortgage companies
and farmers will be glad to take advantage of
this legislation. I know of many instances
where very satisfactory debt adjustmttents have
been brought about between creditor and
debtor by virtue of the Act.
Hi.

Mr. HORNFR.

Now I should like te refer for a few
moments to the question of government interference in business. Had we had government interference in business in the years
gone by, there might have been a different
situation to-day. We need go back no further
than the close of the Great War. At that
time the railroads of Canada were allowed to
go ahead without any restraint whatever in
the building of new lines which parallelled
each other; and we know how, even within
more recent years, the Canadian Pacifie Railway was given charters for the construction of lines in the north country whieh
would compete with those of the Canadian
National, and how the Canadian National
built a 84,000,000 botel in Saskatoon and an
$11,000,000 hotel in Vancouver. The credit
of the country was being swamped, but there
was no governmental interference. The Government of Canada appeared te have moved
to Montreal, and there it seemed to be
established and naintained during the years
preceding 1930.
I speak with some knowledge of conditions
as they existed about that time, as I had
some experience as a director of the Canadian National Railways. And right here may
I make mention of the Press of this country?
I have no quarrel with the newspapers; they
bave been very kind to me; but they have
made very great mistakes. When the right
honourable the leader of this Chamber suggested a slight modification of a certain proposal for expansion he was castigated by the
newspapers of this country, regardless of their
politics, for attempting to interfere with the
publie ownership of railways; and the honourable memuber frou
Manitou (Hon. Mr.
Sharpe) was abused for daring to oppose a
850,000,000 expenditure in the city of Montreal.
As I say, bonourable gentlemen, this overdevelopment of the railroads should never
have been allowed to take place in this new
country. Canada is an immense country, it
is truc, and has tremendous resources, but at
thtat time it had a population of only ten
millions. And what was going on? It was
pointed out that we were fast approaching the
condition where half the population would be
employed by the Government or by governmnent-owned
railroads, and it would be
impossible for the rest of the people te support soch a situation.
But the great tragedy was that young men
were drawn away from the land. Many of
those young men are now middle-aged, and
have families to support. Had this unrestrained development in regard to our railways not taken place, those men would be

JANUARY 22, 1935
on the land to-day. This is all bound up with
the question of unemployment insurance. It
it true that we have to take care of our
people, but I claim that what occurred in connection with the Canadian National Railways
was the greatest calamity that ever befell
this young country. In the province of Saskatchewan, although we have had the grasshoppers and the drought, we shall be able
in a short time to overcome all such difficulties and in the majority of cases to pay
back one hundred cents on the dollar; but
I say, without fear of successful contradiction,
that it will take this country a hundred years
to recover from the blight put upon it by
what was donc in connection with the Canadian National Railways.
A serious situation faces this country with
regard to labour. There is reference in the
Speech from the Throne to unemployment
insurance and the security of labour. I am
somewhat alarmed by this. When, as a young
man, I left this part of the country to go
west and make a home for myself I had no
thought that it was the duty of any government or municipal council to see that I
secured a living. I know that times have
changed, and that many forms of assistance
have been adopted; nevertheless, I think we
should be very careful in the future. During
the years of the depression one thing has
been very noticeable, particularly in the province from which I come, where fifty per
cent of the population are people who have
been born outside of this country: at all times
propaganda is being carried on to have the
Government do various things. It is freely
stated that the Government should do this,
that or the other thing. Some of the people
who make these statements are well-meaning;
others are not, and they are only making a
bad condition very much worse. Of course
there are those who say, "This country can
supply work for everybody," but the Conmunists say: "Why work hard for small
wages? All the money of the country will
soon be divided." Consequently I am somewhat alarmed at the undertaking of any
public works programme to relieve the people.
The result of such programmes is that people
leave their farms and endeavour to secure
places on these works in the pay of the
Government. I am still strongly in favour of
assisting and encouraging the farmer. In spite
of the great difficulties we have had in
Saskatchewan, in the northern part of that
province, fron which I come, there is scarcely
a municipality which has not paid every
dollar of its indebtedness to the banks. Many
of them have cash in the bank. There are
still great open spaces in the West, and many

il

men who have more land than they can use
to advantage. There is plenty of room for
the young man who wants to make a home
for himself, and he can do it much more
easily and more comfortably than could those
men who built up this great country of ours,
and who were not drawn away, by an overexpansion of business, from the work on
the farms. The object of all these measures
that have been put into effect or are being
proposed is to encourage and assist men to
stay on the land. I believe there is not a
city, town or village in Canada, and certainly
not in Western Canada, where men could not
be found who should never have left the land
and ought to be on farms to-day.
Another point of great importance in the
Speech from the Throne is this:
You will be invited also to enact measures to
provide the investing publie with means to protect itself against exploitation.
Honourable senators may be surprised if
I tell them that the farmer has been the
chief victim of such exploitation in the
Dominion of Canada. I believe that is the
fact. Millions of dollars of Western Canadian
money have been put into schemes that never
had a chance of paying a single cent in
return. It is impossible for a busy farmer to
understand stories that are told to him by
high pressure salesmen. The salesman has
an unfair advantage, because he probably does
not get out of bed until nine o'clock, after
having had a fine night's rest, whereas the
farmer has been up and trudging about since
four o'clock and is therefore not as fit to
put up a good argument as he otherwise
would be. And in addition to that the
farmer is flattered by being told that he has
a beautiful wife and a lovely farm. Farmers
have borrowed money on their land to go into
schemes that they thought would make them
rich overnight. People of the little conmunity in which I live put a quarter of a
million dollars into the Canadian Farm Implement Company, which was promoted in
Medicine Hat, Alberta. Not one dollar of
that money was returned. We have heard a
great deal about the Grain Exchange as the
ideal means for disposing of grain, but many
million dollars of farmers' savings have been
squandered in efforts to make money on the
market instead of by actual production of
grain. We believe that sort of thing is unnecessary.
I wish again to express my gratitude for
the great privilege of seconding the Address
in reply to the Speech from the Throne. I also
desire to thank honourable members sincerely
for the kind attention they have given to my
rambling remarks.

12

SENATE

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, it is a very pleasant duty for me to
congratulate the mover and the seconder of
this Address, whose remarks I have followed
with considerable interest. I am sorry that
all members of this House could not enjoy
the speech by the honourable senator from
Ottawa East (Hon. Mr. Coté), which was
excellent in form and matter, but they will
be able to read the translation of it in our
Hansard.
The honourable gentleman dealt
with not only domestic matters, but also
questions of international concern, and his
mastery of them surprised me, for I did not
think tîat so busy a man as he is had the
time to study world affairs so thoroughly. The
honourable senator from Saskatchewan North
(Hon. Mr. Horner) gave us some very helpful information concerning his part of the
country. We from the East are all deeply
interested in what is going on in the Middle
West. We know that the farming communities out there are confronted with a very
difficult situation, and in addition to our
sympatlietic consideration for their welfare
there is the realization that their fate is intimately linked with ours in finance and in
business generally. We in the East cannot
hope to prosper when there is no prosperity in
the West, and I am glad to think that some
measures passed by this Parliament are helping to some extent the people of the Prairie
Provinces.
I was surprised early in the New Year
to hear that the situation in this country was
not as good as statistical reports of preceding
months had indicated. We were all rejoicing
in the belief that conditions were improving.
The honourable gentleman from Ottawa East
bas given figures to show that we were going
up-hill. Nevertheless we were making some
progress. I am grateful to the Prime Minister
for allowing us to have an agreeable Christmas and New Year's Day and postponing
until the second of January his surprising
statements, which shocked the country. He
told us that all was wrong in Canada; that
the world-I an using his words-is in tragie
circumstances, the signs of recovery are few
and doubtful, the signs of trouble are many,
and they do not lessen. The day after that
address I felt, as I met people here and there
in the metropolis of Canada, that the temperature had gone down considerably. Everybody wondered what had happened. We felt
it was a public confession by the Prime
Minister of the failure of the two most
important objectives in his programme of
1930-the settlement of unemployment and
the gaining of markets throughout the world.
Hon. Mr. HORNER.

Figures coming from the Bureau of Statistics have indicated an increase in employment, but we in Montreal have not noticed
it. in that city there are still on the dole
47,000 heads of families, and that means
175,000 people out of a population of approximatoly onec million. Most decidedly the
unemplovment problem has not yet been
solved, nor has the "blasting" of the way into
foreign markets yet been brought to fruition.
But we are told that if the failure to solve
these two important questions has not yet
restored prosperity a new recipe will work
wonder'-acnd the Right Hon. Prime Mini.ster
has heralded a programme of social reform.
Well, I listened carefully to bis recent radio
speeches, and I have weighed them generally
and specifically. Although I recognize that
social reform is a very good idea, and that
Liberalim has always stood for progress and
has to it, credit many measures in that field,
yet I am not convinced that it will be a slIution of our present economie problem.
We
must not forget that many of the priojeced
reforms will be very costly to put into effcet,
and tha t benoficent reuts will not follow immediately. Right Hon. Neville Chamberlain
said la-t week tîat there was no short-cuit to
prosperity. For my part, I do not think the
enactment of the social and othnr reforms
inentionedil in the Speech from the Throne can
er soon bring us much nearer to prosperity.
A certain number of the proposed reforms
will, as I say, be very costly to put into rffect,
and therefore we must scrutinize our financial
position to know to what extent we cau increase our burden. On the 2nd of January
the Riglit Hon. Prime Minister said, "Our
buirden of debt is heavy and our taxes are
high." We all know it. The taxpayer-and
who does not pay taxes?.-knows it. The
burden of debt is heavy, and we are crippled
to such an extent in meeting our present
responsibilities that a large deficit loois up
every year. When we add the railway deficits
to the ordinary and the uncontrollable expenditures, the situation is admittedly so
grave that the Government thus far hsw been
able to implement only a part of its expressed
policy. For example, in 1930 the Right Hon.
Prime Minister affirmed that he would place
the whole responsibility of old age pensions
on the federal treasury. Well, lie fell short by
25 per cent. The 75 per cent that he did contribute represents such a load that I wonder
whether lie was justified either in making such
a promise or in implementing it to the extent
that he did.

JANUARY 22, 1935
The national finances are in such a serious
state that the Right Hon. Prime Minister
felt the necessity of reducing the federal
contribution for unemployment reliel. The
financial situation is so critical that although
in 1931 he decided to resurrect the Vocational
Education Act-a mcasure dropped during
our regime-and promised the provinces an
annual contribution of $750,000 for fifteen
years, lie did flot dare implernent bis promises.
Ail this goes to show that the country is
carrying a very heavy load.
The Right Hon. Prime Minister admits
that measures of reform should "normally be
initiated not in times of depression but in
tirnes of comparative prosperity." I arn stîll
citing bis speech of January 2. It is because be chooses to affirm that we have
reached this stage that he launches a programme of social rcforms that may be very
costly to the treasury. I leave it to honourable members to ponder whether we bave returned to a state of "comparative prosperity."
I amrnfot ready to admit that we have. I
should be very glad indeed if I could share
bis optimism, but when 1 study bis speech
of the 2nd of January I arn rather depressed
and inclined to take the contrary view.
Notwithstanding this serious condition of
our finances the Right Hon. Prime Minister
bas placed in the Votes and Proceedings of
the other buse the following resolution:
That it is expedient toý introdurce a Bull to
establish an einployment and social insurance
commission; to provide for a nationail employment service; for insurance against u-nemployment: for aid to unemployed persons, and for
other forms of social insurance and secmrity,
and for purposes related thereto; and to provide for such contributions as may be necessary
to carry into elleet the proposed legisiation.
WeII, I arn quite sure that hefore the right
bonourable gentleman and bis colleagues proceed furthcr with that resolution he as a
business man with some acumen will state
the ways and means by which these new
obligations will be met. These comprise old
age pensions, sickness insurance, and unemployment insurance. I amn sure that ail three
must be contributory. The beneficiaries themselves, represented by their labour unions,
bave passed resolutions asking that these be
placed on a contributory basis.
When the preceding Govem'ment brought
in the old age pension legislation the Conservative members in this Chaxnber at first
balkcd at the financial responsibility involved,
although the Federal Government was assuming but haîf the cost-in fact not even
haîf, for it Ieft the administration to the
provinces.
We provided old age pensions
without exacting any contribution from the
beneficiary. In doing that we were following

13

what had 'been done in Great Britain, and
when the Bill was presented in this Chamber
1 suggested that it was a provisional measure,
the first ste.p towards crcating old age pensions.
I pointed out that while Great Britain had
started out in the same way, it had soonwithin four or five years, I think-turned
around and established the contributory
system, but that we might well begin by
adopting the non-contributory system, at ail
events sO far as conccrned t-hose who were
past forty. I mnay say I tbought the provinces themselves would hasten to establish a
contributory scherne. However, not.bing was
donc; andI notlhing could be done after the
present Govcrnmcnt took office andI de!clared
bhrougb its head that it would take charge
of the wbole system.
But one ne-ed only look at tbc cost to the
federal trea.sur3e during the last trwo ye-ars,
of the seven.ty-five per cent paid to those
provinces which entered into the schome-for
a number have not yet done so-to realize
Uhat when old age pensions are taken over
entirely by the Federal Go'vernment and the
full cost is borne by the federal treasury,
we cannot afford to continue the sobeme
unless it is placed on a contributory basis.
I do not know exactly what form the pension
for sickness would take, or what it would
represent in money, but the same argument
would apply.
We are told that we are to have unemploymcnt insurance. It must not be forgotten
that any scheime of unemployment insurance
established to-morrow could affect only the
men on the pay rolîs to-day, and not those
at present
uneýmployed.
The
principle
.iustifying the levy tapon the employer is, I
think, that he sbould help to m-aintain the
men he lays off temporarily or emjploys only
part time. An employer who under normal
conditions gives work to a certain number of
workmen should take care of the men he
may need in a short time. It seexns to me,
thorefore, that the scheme should be brought
into being iii normal t-imes.
The Prime
Minister has frît that many of these schemes
should be undertaken in times of prosperity.
I amn seaking not of prosperity, but of
normal conditions, when industry is working
nearly full time, because no labourer who is
not on a pay roll can corne undier such a
scheme. Industry is now piroceeding in Iow
gear, andI a large proportion o'f men are on
the dole. I feel, therefore, that this is flot
the time to bring this soheane into, operation.
Manifestly it would not help tshe army of
unemployed, antI in the present difficult
situation I feel that in bringing it into effect
we shnîîld be uselessly handicapping our
industries, more especially those that are

SENATE
striving for export trade. So I still put the
question-my right honourable friend may
bave some light upon it which I have not:
Do our finances allow of these schemes being
brought into being at the present time?
I have spoken of the state of our finances.
The deficit of the Canadian National Railways represents a heavy load. On the 2nd of
January the Prime Minister said: "Look at
our railway problem. Its solution is, I earnestly believe. a condition precedent to prosYet no mention is made in the
perity."
Spcech from the Throne of this engrossing
subject, nor is there any indication of how
the situation can he improved. In 1933 we
passed an Act to bring about co-operation
between the railways, upon which Act we
worked diligently, in the hope that the situation might thrreby be improvîd. But it bas
been practically a dead letter. The railways
bave been co-operating hardly at all; the
machinery provided for in the Act has not
even been set up, and last week in Brockville
the Minister of Railways said that he really
saw no solution of our present difficult railway
situation. Meanwhile the taxpayer has to
find a million dollars a week, or $52,000,000 a
year.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Youî are too cheap.
It is a million and a quarter a week.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I say that because I have been told that the railway deficit is around $50,000,000 a year. In a financial sense. we arc bleeding to the extent of
one million dollars a week, yet no hope is
given us by the Minister of Railways. On the
contrary. he bas frankly declared that he sees
no solution to the problem.
The Speech from the Throne has a reference to the Bank of Canada and expresses
the hope that it max- regulate our credit. It
is said that the Bank should prevent wild and
frenzied speculation, such as reached its peak
in 1929. I think we shall find that hope to
bh vain. The Bank of England, the Bank of
France and the United States Foderal Reserve
System tried to restrain credit in the years
before the depression, and they entirely
failed. I have figures showing that the Federal
Reserve rediscount rate went up from three
to five per cent in 1928-29, and the interest
rate on call loans from 4.05 per cent in 1927
to 9-23 per cent in 1929. Yet the stock exchange loans expanded from $3,642,000,000 in
1927 to $4,837,000,000 in 1928 and to $7,474,000.000 in 1929. Loans are down to-day to
$876000,000. These figures go to show that a
high rate of intorest does not deter speculation. When profits are in sight, or seem to be
in sight, people will borrow money even
though the cost is high. It seems to me that
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

renedies should be sought elsewhbere. Sirnce
our Prime Minister bas been turning southwards for inspiration, I wonder that he did
not borrow from President Roosevelt's legislation to cope with the stock exchange and
surround the speculator with some safeguards.
This reminds me that in July, 1933, there
was a flurry on the stock exchange. Was that
du( to the repeal of the prohibition law? I
do not know, but in any event there was a
flurry and immediately speculators jumped
into the market and stocks started to move
upward. That condition did not last long,
but it continue(d long enough to cause people
all over the world to believe that there was
apparently a omaterial recovery in Now York.
However, it was soon generally recognized
that prosperity had not yet turned the corn11r.
I saw a new-spaper dispatch, whether
from the othor side of tho ocean or this I
forget, which contained what was perhaps a
facetious remari-k b\ our Prime Minister. He
was quotet as asking, "Why don't they close
the New York Stock Exchange?" Well, many
p1ople have been asking if that was not the
very point at whicl, speculation could be
curbed. J am not disposed to be very radical,
vct T believe something should be donc, perhaps along the line of Mr. Roosevelt's legislation. to cope with the excitement and the
allurements of the stock exchange.
The principal reason given for the creation
of the Central Bank was the expectation that
in matters of exchange, which means foreign
excliange, our monetary unit could be more
easily stabilized. To what extent and to what
advantage, and at what cost, the future only
can tell. Can the Bank of Canada expand
credit?
Not more so, I believe, than bas
been possible under the Finance Act which
we have had in this country since 1914.
Everyone who bas read addresses of bank
presidents at recent annual meetings knows
of their complaint that business men have
been limiting their borrowings to actual needs
and that the banks have had to resort bo the
purchase of bonds and debentures.
People
cannot be forced to borrow money that they
do not require, and at the present time firms
will not make purchases simply for the
pleasure of adding to their stocks. They
consider everything very carefully before they
make any move towards expansion, and quite
logically so.
My honourable friend from Ottawa East
mentioned the fact of negotiations. between
the United States and Canada for the exchange of commodities. That indicates the
possibility of a reciprocity convention.
I
frankly confess I did not think I should live
long enough to sec the Conservative party

JANUARY 22, 1935
gleefully announcing that it was seeking to
make reciprocal arrangements with the United
States. In 1911 we had an arrangement in
black and white, the Taft-Fielding agreement.
Hon. Mr. POPE:

It was too black.

I do not hear
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
my honourable friend.
- Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: He means
it was too good.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
We had that
convention. It covered natural products, and
was along the same lines as the treaty of
1854-66, which brought such prosperity to
Canada that Sir John A. Macdonald never
ceased looking towards Washington in the
hope that the agreement would be renewed.
He sent delegation after delegation. And
when in 1878 or 1879 he brought forward his
National Policy of protection, there was an
annex to the Bill which stated that when
the United States would signify its readiness
to exchange products specified in the listwhich was the same list as in the old treatythe Government of Canada would by Order
in Council do likewise. To everybody's surprise Congress ratified the proposal, and that
ratification remained for years on the statute
book of the United States. In fact I had
occasion to state in this Chamber that in
1913, when leaving for Washington, I was
requested by Sir Wilfrid Laurier to see
President Wilson and ascertain whether he
was favourably inclined towards the policy
contained in the convention, and, if so, not
to withdraw it, because he, Sir Wilfrid, intended at the following election to submit the
treaty again for endorsation.
We are apt to see the sins of our opponents
more clearly than our own, and I suppose it
may be readily admitted that no one is infallible; but I dare any honourable member
to say that it was not a grievous error to
reject the reciprocity treaty of 1911. The
objection then made to it was that it could be
abrogated by the United States within six or
twelve months. The Government is trying to
negotiate another convention. I shall be very
much surprised if it comes up to the level
of the convention of 1911. I hope we shall
live long enough to see the results of the
negotiations, but I submit the 1911 arrangement as the standard for the next convention.
And any convention, according to the powers
given to President Roosevelt, can last only
three years. Surely the convention of 1911
might have lasted as long. But it is useless
to cry over spilled milk, and those familiar

with circumstances may not be ready to
forgive the Conservative party for its actions
in 1911. I hope it will redeem its reputation
by succeeding in negotiating as good a convention as Mr. Fielding obtained in 1911.
The other measures prornised in the Speech
from the Throne I need not discuss at the
moment, for when the bills come before us
they will be examined on their merits. I
simply draw the attention of my honourable
friends facing me to the fact that the old
Conservative party may perhaps have sole
responsibility for implementing whatever
radical legislation is brought before us. We
used to speak of our friends opposite as
members of the Liberal-Conservative party,
resulting from the coalition of 1864 between
the French-Canadian Liberals and the old
Tory party of Ontario; but now I wonder if
I am not facing the Radical Conservative
party.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, I am quite as prepared as I shall
ever be to proceed with such remarks as
seem to fit the moment, but I understand
the honourable senator opposite has a certain
engagement to-morrow which would make it
convenient for him to speak now. If that be
the case, I would ask that the usual order
be departed from at this time, and that the
honourable member speak at such length as
he may choose to-night, and finish to-morrow.
Then we shall go on in the regular way.
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: Honourable
members, I desire to thank the right honourable gentleman who leads this House with
such ability and distinction for the great
favour he is doing me. I happen on this particular occasion to be in opposition to both
my own leader in another place and to the
Right Honourable Mr. Bennett. Apparently
they are both in favour of government ownership, and my remarks will be directed against
public ownership.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As a matter of
fact I did not speak on public ownership.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I do not believe
in public ownership, whether municipal, provincial or federal. I am against it from the
drop of the hat, and always have been. I
think it is no good. It never has been any
good and never will be. That is my opinion,
but no one need follow me. It is not the
first time I have been all alone in this House
in the stand I have taken, but I have usually
found that afterwards some honourable
members came around to my point of view.
According to well established practice, I
desire to congratulate the mover of the

SENATE
Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne, the honourable member for Ottawa
East (Hon. Mr. Coté). It is nothing new
for me to listen to him. I have heard him in
the Legislature at Toronto.
As usual, he
made a very able speech in impeccable French.
Btut it seemed to me that lie 'lt he was
fuifilling a rathier thankless duty. However,
I suppose ho is a little confumsed by the Conservative party becoming mîixed ump with
Socialism and Communisn, and consequently
his heart did not seem to be in his task.
I congratulate the honourable member from
Saskatchewan North (Hon. Mr. Horner). The
burlen of his remarks seems to ho that the
fairmers have lost a lot of money through
high pr-scsure sailesmanship.
Well, Western
Canada Lad no iionopoly of that; we had it
too. in the East.
Now, honourable menbers, if I speak at
some length to-night I cannot help realizing
that this month I have been thirty-five years
a member of this House. To-day there is
only one face that was here when I entered
tlie Senate. According to all the rules of
probabilities, this may be my swan song.
Sone Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
Hon. Mr. CASCRAIN: Therefore I crave
indulgence of honourable members if I speak
at length.
I like the atmnosphere of this
House. As I have said, I have been a memher so long, and I have always felt at home
here. At the time of my appointment the
Hon. David Mills was leading the House, and
of course ho was in duty bound to present me.
But I had an uncle, Dr. Casgrain, of Windsor,
Ontario, and he said to me, "I should like
to introduce you." I said, "I shall be only
too glad, but I will ask Mr. Mills." Mr. Mills
was quite agreeable to the proposal. Dr.
Casgrain was a Conservative, but he introduced me to the Speaker-also my uncleNaturally, I felt
Sir Alphonse Pelletier.
quite at home. I had lîeard of the Family
Compact before, and I had never been
opposed to it. It was only those who were
not in it who were against it.
As I walk around these halls I sec the
portrait of amy great grandfather, the Hon.
James Baby.
On the recommendation of
Colonel Simcoe he was appointed a Legislative
Couneillor by the King, and a member of the
executive of the province of Ontario.
It
night be of interest to this House to know
that he, I believe, holds the record for length
of tenure of office as a member of the
executive.
Some people in Ontario might
think it strange that a French Canadian
should hold a portfolio in that province longer
than anyone else. He was appointed in 1791
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

and died in 1833 in York, having held office
for forty-two years. I am not aware of
anyone else who, witlout a break, leld a
seat in the Legislative Council and was a
member of the executive for so long. When
le was buried in 1833 there was only eue
paper in what is now Toronto. It was called
the Correspondent.
That paper stated that
his funeral was the largest ever witnessed
there, and the most respectable.
Before he passed away his son-in-law, my
grandfather, the Hon. Eusèbe Casgrain, lad
become a member of the House of Assembly
of Lower Canada. He remained a niember
of that House from 1832 to 1848. For a while
after 1840 it was very doubtful whether we
really iad responsible government; it was the
Governor who macle the principal appointments; and this grandfather of mine was
made the first Commissioner of Public Works
for Lower Canada. I ask the House to pardon these personal references, as this is the
first time in more than a third of a century
that I have had occasion to make them. I
have a purpose in so doing. As I have said,
the Hon. Charles Eusèbe Casgrain died in
Montreal in 1848. My own father was elected
to Parliament in 1872, and remained till 1891.
Then the Hon. T. Chase Casgrain, AttorneyGeneral for the province of Quebec for many
years, came to Ottawa in 1896, and was Postmaster General wien ho died here in 1918.
But the Casgrains are still going strong. In
the other louse the chief Liberal whip is
Pierre Casgrain, who has been a member
for seventeon years.
On my mother's side Joseph François
Perrault was elected in 1796 as member for
HuntingIon. In those davs that constituniicy
comiprised Htuntingdon, Chateauguay and La
Prairie. Again, strange as it may seem, in
those davs some members of Parliament were
also in the Civil Service, and upon looking
up the old books in the Library you will lind
that in the year one thousand seven hundred
and ninety-semuetliing tis gentlemiin was
drawing £4,000 in Canadian currency. J. X.
Perrault was the member for Richelieu, and
to my great surprise, on one occasion, my
youngest son, who was then studying law at
McGill, was given as a model to learn by
heart a speech against Confoderation made
by this sane J. X. Perrault.
All this explains, honourable gentlemen,
why I am such an ardent Imperialist. When
one's family las served king and country for
one hundred and forty-four years almost consecutively, and sometimes simultaneously in
Parliament, in the Army and in the Civil
Service, especially when one is of my race,

JANUARY 22, 1935
tie would indeed be ungrateful if he were flot
the ardent Irnperialist that I arn.
Now, why arn I opposed te publie ownership? That is the question. Private enterprise is based on individualisrn; public ownership on Cornrunisrn. Take our Canadian
National Railways for instance. If that is
flot an example of Cornrunism, tell me what
Cornmunism is. Under Comrnunism we should
ail be equal and ail initiative would be
destroycd. If aIl were equal, who would
want to study? Who would want to work
when the lazy man and the lubber would be
on the saine footing as every other man? I
arn opposed to Cornmunisrn because it is an
absurd systern. It bas neyer worked and
neyer can work; nevertheless, we seem to be
approaching it very rapidly just now. I arn
surprised at this. In days long gone by, my
farnily flirted a little with the old Tory
party, but I neyer thought the day would
corne wben I sbould see such things as I sec
now. From listening to the radio one would
get the impression that the Tory party is
hendcd towards Comrnunisrn. It is doing al
sorts of things to-day that it was opposed
to in the past. For instance, we actually
have our national brotber-in-law in Washington advocating reciprocity, although I still
have ringing in rny cars the words, "No truck
nor trade with the Yankees. Let well enough
alone, Wilfrid Laurier." What do we hear
to-day?
"Let bad enough alone, R. B.
Bennett. Let bad enough alone."
If ail were equal, of course there would
be ne profit. Public ownership takes away
ail hope of gain. Basically, it is a false,
reactionary and dangerous doctrine. We hear
the cry: "Ruin the millionaire. Do away
with capitalism." Wcll, honourable gentlemen, who is going to pay the wages if there
is ne more capital? That is a question you
rnust tbink about. If there is no more capital
there will be no more wages for anybody.
In Ilussia there are no wagcs, if that is wbat
yeu want. There, instead of wages you are
given a ticket, and witb it perhaps you can
get a loaf of bread, or a .pound of butter,
which costs $2. I do not know wbetber
honourable gentlemen have read in the paper
cf the returri cf a certain man te Sault Ste.

years. Then he saiýd. "The wages are very

I will peint eut sorne cf the misdeeds cf
publie ownersbip. The province cf Quebec
is fortunate, be-cause it got bitten early. The
Quebec Gcvernmcnt got the bright idea of
building a railrcad from Que'bec City te
Ottawa andl putting Montreal on a aidetrack. The railrcad was built at a ceat cf
$14,0O0,000. I sec the honourable senator
frorn Grandville (Hon. Mr. Chapais) srniling.
He remembers what took place and what
scandaIs were cennected with the affair. That
wau public ownersbip. Why was that line run
straight from Quebec to Ottawa, with Montreal on a siding? I do not know whethcr this
Huse has ever heard it, but the explanation
was, notbing but politics. The Hem. Rodrigue
Masson was the member frein Terrebonne at
Ottawa, and Hon. J. A. Chapleau was Prime
Minister of the province. They wanted the
rail1rcad to, pa.ss neýar the manor-bouse cf the
Masson family, and se the railway ran down
te St. Vinrent de Paul cm its way te Ottawa.
There was a siding te Montreal running down
te Rivière des Prairies, then up over the
summit cf I1e Jésus, then down te the Back
rivter, then up again te the summit of the
Island cf Montreal, and finally down te Place
Viger station. It was a regular scenie railway.
Yet. as I pointed eut te Mr. Fullerton, the
road ceuld have been run on a water level
grade frem Mentreal te Quebec. T-rains are
still being mun up and down these steep
grades, as they have been for fifty years, all
on acceunt cf pelities. That is one example
cf public ewnersbip. It bappened te, be a
Censervative Government wbich was respons.ible in tihis case.
When people are dcterrned te get a thing
tbýey will net listen te reason. That Quebec
railroad could neyer be made te pay, but the
Government went ahead with it. Tbey lest
rnoney on it cvery year, and thýen there was
tremendous pressure brcught te bear on the
Canadian Pacific, wbicb was fcrced te buy it
fer $7,00O,000. As I bave said, the road cest
$14,000,O00. AIl this may be ancient bistory,
but public owncrsbip was ne better fifty ycars
ago than it is to-day. The railroad bad
previously been sold te L. A. Senecal, wbe
tbeught bie was geing te make a lot of meney
eut cf it. Hon. T. Chase Casgrain made a
figbýt about tbat incident, but it went tbrough
just the saine. Senecal ceuld net make it pay,
as it was a pelitical affair, and the Canadian
Pacific teck it.
On that deal the province cf Quebec lest

in future, so the people of Quebec will have
nothing to do with public ownership. Everybody from Prime Minister Taschereau down
is against it.
Let us look at Western Canada, where the
seconder of the Address (Hon. Mr. Horner)
comes from. They had a bright idea about
public ownership out there too. Mr. Sise
installed a telephone system in Manitoba,
Alberta and Saskatchewan and was sorry that
he ever did it. The customers were so far
apart, and so many poles and so much wire
were necessary in order to reach them, that
the affair never paid. Then there was a move
to nationalize the system and this was carried
through. Mr. Sise was very glad to sell it,
and if the purchasers had been good bargainers they would have got it for nothing,
for it was no asset to the Bell Telephone Company. Is any honourable member from
Alberta here who can tell us how much the
province lost on the telephone system at
year?
The farmers need rapid means of
communication, and so the necessary equipment was offered to them at a very low figure.
I am told that the price they are charged for
a complete pole, with all the wire and other
paraphernalia, is thirty cents. Is there anyone
here from Alberta to contradict that? And
what bas been the deficit? And who knows
what the deficit has been in Saskatchewan?
Of course that province is so big that it does

not mind deficits at all, for it knows that the
rest of the country will pay them.
In
Manitoba they had another public
ownership scheme. Banks would not give
accommodation, would not lend money withont security. Some people do not seem to
realize that the banks themselves have no
money, that they are but trustees for the
funds of depositors and cannot lend money
without some guarantee that it will be returned sooner or later. Well, the people decided they would have a bank of their own;
so they established the Province of Manitoba
Savings Bank. Citizens made deposits to the
tune of $14,000,000 and promptly borrowed
that money bock again. And the loans were
made, not as they would be from an ordinary
bank, but on long terms. The Prime Minister of this country did one good thing when
he saved their money for those depositors,
for otherwise they never would have had a
dollar of it. When there was a danger that
everything would be lost the Prime Minister
called together the bankers--the very men
who had been abused by the promoters of
this bank-and asked them if they would
take over among themselves, proportionately,
whatever there was remaining of this bank
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

and give the people their money. Those horrible bankers who are being denounced for
refusing to give accommodation to the West
were the very ones who prevented the depositors of Manitoba from losing every cent of

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Was it not
the Government of Canada which stood behind the banks and asked them to give the
credit?
Hon. ;Mr. CASGRAIN: I am giving the
credit to the Government of Canada. But the
banks put up the money.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That was not
very hard to do, on a Goverrnent guarantee.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I will give credit

in it they are in a bad fix.

the railroad was there, and I have been
there since. I know the country well. If ever
there was a place where a railroad should
have paid it was frorn North Bay to Cochrane. But again we see what publie ownership bas done. The Liberals of Ontario, under
Hon. George W. Ross, had a bright idea in
this case.
Perhaps the right honourable

Graham) started the thing.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I would have,

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That railroad

$300,000 a year for running rights. The line
was constructed through a rich mining and
agricultural country. I speak from personal
knowledge, for I laid out the township at
the first crossing of the Blanche river. Besides
the freight fron mining and agriculture. the
pulp industry afforded a substantial revenue.
A train of from fourteen to sixteen cars
loaded with paper left Iroquois Falls every
night for North Bay, where it was broken
up, some cars going east to Montreal, some
south to Toronto, and sone to the West.
If that railroad had been in the hands of a
private company it would have been a very

problem. There woulct flot be a railway debt

When the present Prime Minister was in
opposition I met him one day on Parliament
Hill with the Hon. Mr. Rhodes, who was then
Premier of Nova Scotia. As we stopped to
pass the time of day, I said, "WeIl, how is
the Premier, and how is the one who wants
to be Premier?" Bennett turned to Rhodes
and said, "You told me at the time I would
be ruining my political career if I took that
stand."
Undoubtedly hie displayed great
courage in the course hie had taken.
No
matter what political differences we may
have, I admire that man for being brave
enough to speak and vote against his party
in support of what lie t.hought was right. And
so with Hon. W. F. Nickle. H1e is a man of
high principles.
When hie was AttorneyGeneral in Premier Fcrguson's Government,
and it wvas decided to introduce legisiation
for governmcnt control of the sale of liquor,
Mr. Nickle disagreed with the policy and
stepped out.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hie was not worth a
nickel.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: He was not worth
a nickel? Oh, yes, lie is a credit to the public
life of the Dominion.
1 can neyer forget the dignity and charm. of
Sir Wilfrid Laurier. At a garden party at
Buckingham Palace we ordinary people entered by a side gate, but Sir Wilfrid Laurier
was driven through the royal entrance. On
the grounds-I think my honourable friend
beside me was there on that occasion-is a
wide stone piazza which, as a surveyor, I
estimate to bc about 150 feet long by 50 or
60 feet wide and about 4 or 5 feet above the
level of the lawn. When Sir Wilfrid arrived, perfectly dressed by an English tailor
in a grey Prince Albert suit-perhaps even
better tailored than that worn by King George
himself-he Iooked every inch a prince. A
bevy of princesses and duchesses surrounded
him. But he did not appear to lie phased at
ahl; lie regarded them with great condescension and lie nodded, turning round the while,
in the royal manner, so that everybody might
think, "Sir Wilfrid is looking at me." There
were very few mon present. The bevy of
exalted ladies in their beautiful Paris gowns
were there to be admired, and thoy were
only too glad to pay homage to Sir Wilfrid
Laurier.
By some strango coincidonco the
English ladies get thoir gowns in Paris, whilo
ahl the swell members of the French Jockey
Club go to the London tailors for thoir
clothes.

The previous niglit I had attonded a dinner

noon when Hon, W. S. Fielding anounced to
the House of Commons that a treaty of reciprocity had been signed betwoen the United
States and Canada. On the Consorvative
Ride, as on the Liberal side, there were cheers
from everyono.
The only possimistic man
that niglit was your humble servant. I remember Senator Gilmour said, "With that
policy Sir Wilfrid Laurier will be able to got
what Sir John Macdonald and Sir Charlos
Tupper and other Canadian statesmon aftor

At that tîme we had on the Senate side

house" because soveral senators met thoro,
and the way they went the Senate generally
wcnt too. It was like the Family Compact
-thoso who wero not in it were against it.
Senator Melville Joncs was not one of the
regular frequenters of room 17, but hie came
thero while they were all rejoicing. I was
regarded as the only one who was wrong in
my opinion. Sir Melville said, "Look hore,
we are going to carry Ontario." I said, "Ill
bot you a dinner Laurier will be boaton."
And lie was. I am saying this merely to give
confidence to those who are good enough to
liston to me.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

An Hon. SENATOR: Who is riglit now?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: You can draw

to the other fellow who tries that game?

the representative of the Queen. That was
when they signed their historie manifesto.
But that has nothing to do with the subject
of reciprocity. The cry in the country was,
"Don't have reciprocity, Laurier! Let well
enough alone!" There is a cry in the country
to-day, "Bennett, let bad enough alone!"
As I shall not be here when he speaks, I
shall send this book across the fioor to my
right honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen). There are charts and graphs in it
which will enable him to check up what I
say. I always think a speech is like a mustard
plaster-it nust draw. If it does not draw
some uncharitable remarks from opponents,
it is no good.
I am against government ownership. My
contention is that private companies are
better managed, and in most cases give lower
rates than do government undertakings. The
book that I have just passed across the floor
proves this-to my satisfaction anyway.
In 1923 there were in the United States
3,066 municipalized electrie companies. That
means that they were publicly owned. Only
seven years later that number had been
reduced by thirty-seven per cent. In other
words, 1,129 of these enterprises had given
up and were a total loss to the municipalities.
The science of electricity is a comparatively
new one, and constant transformations are
necessary to its further development. These
transformations are costly, and the salaries
of the experts who conduct the necessary
researches and experiments represent a large
sum of money. Nationally owned enterprises
when deciding on the scale of rates to be
charged do not and cannot provide for this
contingency; consequently there is bound to
be either an increase in rates or taxation.
Public ownership is erroneous in its conception. defective in its management, and carries
within itself the germ of its own destruction.
It is regarded as absurd by all right-thinking
people. It romains the attribute of publicityseeking politicians or ambitious governments
whose only wish is to grow rich at the expense
of the masses.
There is an idea abroad that water costs
nothing. That is another fallacy. True, it
costs nothing as long as you do nothing with
it, but simply allow it to run over the falls;
but the minute you commence to develop
power from it you must pay a royalty to the
province. Take the case of the Beauharnois
for instance. This year the Beauharnois Company will develop 500,000 horse-power, and
the Quebec Government will get a dollar for

that $500,000 will go to the Government from

ating the Beauharnois himself he would not
get a cent out of it. When the project is fully
developed and the Cedar rapids, where there
is a drop of forty feet, are closed up and the
water is sent around the other way, where
there is a drop of eighty feet, the quantity
of power developed will be just double. The
uiimate developinent at Beauharnoi will be
2,000,000 horse-power. That quantity is not
wanted now-though the Ontario Hydro took
some 250,000 horse-power whieh it did not
need. and which it bas Lad to sell at a great

power is developed at Beauharnois, the province of Quebec will receive from it a revenue
of 82,000,000 a year.
The cost of water is only a small proportion
of the cost of producing electrical energy.
Whether you use coal to generate your power
or do it otherwise depends upon where you
are situated. If you are in New York, for
instance, and want to bring power from this
development, the expense involved in the
erection of transmission lines from the St.
Lawrence to New York and in tapping then
would enter largely into the cost. Then
there must be two lines, one bending westward
and the other eastward, to pick up any
business that may be secured along the route.
The United States' share of power would be
one million horse-power. Well, there are
steam units in New York that develop more
than one million horse-power much more
brought from
cheaply than power can he
the St. Lawrence. They are even developing
power with oil. Still, the politicians who want
to make trouble go around the country and
say that water costs nothing, and ask why so
much should be charged for electric light.
I am very glad to have the honour of
speaking before the right honourable gentlemen (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), because he
was connected with the Ontario Hydro for
some time. He knows very well that I am
speaking only in the public interest, and have
no grudge against him. Quite the contrary is
the case. I want to thank him for giving way
so that I might have an opportunity of
speaking before leaving to catch my train.

to cost $10,000,000, but the final cost was

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable member is just 105. per cent out.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I am sorry if I
have been wrongly informed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It cost $70,000,000.

JANUARY 23, 1935
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Then the book
that I gave the right honourable gentleman
is not right.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is your
book.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I did not write it.
In any event, supposing it cost $150,000,000and I have seen it so stated in print many
times-the Hydro is selling power at $25, $40,
and $72 per horse-power. The private companies of Quebec paid in taxes last year
$3,088,285. That money fell into the tills, some
into the federal till, some into the provincial
till and perhaps some into municipal tills. But
if the private companies were wiped out, who
would pay that three millions dollars? Not
public ownership, because that pays nothing.
The Hydro purchased from the Gatineau
Power Company 250,000 horse-power, if I
am right, and from Beauharnois 240,000 horsepower at a rate of $14. Of course I always
speak subject to contradiction by the right
honourable gentleman opposite. Those purchases were in themselves an admission that
private companies could manufacture power
more cheaply than Hydro or other public
commissions, because if the Hydro could
make it as cheaply why did it not do so?
Mention of Beauharnois reminds me that
we had an inquiry here and one senator lost
his seat. I am afraid he has had a lot of
other trouble as well. According to evidence
presented to a committee at that time,
Dominion bonds to the value of $125,000
were given to a man named Aird, who I
think is a son of Sir John Aird, President of
the Canadian Bank of Commerce. Mr. Aird
said he never parted with those bonds. But
it was found, according to my information,
that his bonds did not bear the same numbers
as were on the bonds that Mr. Sweezey gave
him. How they could have shed their old
numbers and got new ones in the meanwhile
I do not know. It is very surprising. I do
not want to say anything disagreeable, so I
will let that drop.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That was
private ownership, the Beauharnois.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Yes, but whom
did they give the money to?

A private

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: And where was the
sale made? To the Hydro. Do you think a
private company would have paid that? If
the board of directors of a private company

23

paid anything like that, they would be put
out of office at the next meeting of shareholders.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Why?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Because the power
was not needed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable gentleman does not know what he is
talking about.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The Hydro did not
need all that power and does not need it all
to-day. Mr. Hepburn says that they have
more power than they need to-day.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: He does not
know what he is talking about, either.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: We will leave the
Hydro and pass to another experience in
public ownership. There is a lovely part of
the country comprising Windsor West, Sandwich East, Sandwich South, Gosfield North,
Gosfield South, Essex, Kingsville, Leamington
and Windsor. Those municipalities conceived
the bright idea that they would incorporate
a holding company to buy out the Windsor,
Essex and Lakeshore Company, which operated an electric railway. I want honourable
members to listen carefully to this, because
it is one of the best parts of my speech. The
municipalities realized at the outset that they
would need some money, so they went to the
banks to borrow the sum of $1,000,000. The
banks said they could not lend that without
some security, and the municipalities had to
deposit $1,100,000 of their own debentures as
a collateral guarantee. As the enterprise declined, the company, finding itself unable to
meet an obligation of $300,000, transferred its
property to the Hydro. I may tell you, in
parenthesis, that it owed the Hydro money
it never paid, for power. But this was a
public ownership business.
The Ontario
Hydro-Electric Commission, which had not
been able to collect for electrie power furnished, decided to operate the railway on its
own account. But it did not operate that
very long. It found that there was deficit
after deficit; so it scrapped the whole thing,
and there it is to-day. The rails are there,
but nothing goes over them and nobody even
bothers to pick them up.
The Hydro suffered a loss of credit and
the outlay disbursed in connection with the
operation of the railway, but the municipal
corporations are responsible in the last resort
and they will have to pay both the capital
and the interest represented by the debentures,
which I will now enumerate:

And they have nothing to show for that
sum except the interest coupons that they
will have to pay yearly, and will probably
have to go on paying for ever and ever. It
is no wonder that these municipalities are in
trouble, since they went into the public
ownership business. If they had left that
alone they would have been all right. Mr.
Graustein, of the International Paper Company, sells power at $14 per horse-power but
he buys it for much less. My information is
that he gets it for $3. I may not be right,
but I am stating what I have heard and
found and read.
Private companies are accused of making
enormous profits. Well, anybody who has
stock in private companies just now knows
how much profit they are making. Nationalization means the disappearance of private
companies. I may say that when the Hydro
was started Ontario had a Liberal Government, of which I think the right honourable
gentleman from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr.
Graham) was a member. Hon. George W.
Ross was getting pretty shaky. Although they
still had the right honourable gentleman from
Eganville, the Liberals were becoming weaker
while the Conservative party was becoming
stronger under the leadership of Sir James
Pliny Whitney, who made good after a while.
I remember that the honourable senator from
Eganville used to say that when Sir James
came to Morrisburg ho would walk around
and ask people if he had any right to sleep
in the town that night. That is a long
time ago.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: My memory
is net as good as the honourable gentleman's.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Hon. George W.
Ross went before the province, after having
announced his policies regarding Hydro, and
was defeated. But Sir James Pliny Whitney
thought there might be something in the
thing. He believed the people would take
kindly to it, to the spending of money, and
so on; so he consulted his colleague Adam
Beck

was a very clever man. He engaged good
engineers, and told them that when they

Power Company was charging too high rates.
That is all the Commission was going to do.
All it was going to do! I do not think today you can name one private power coinpany of any size operating in Ontario: the
Commission wiped them all out.
Australia had a similar experience with
respect to her railways. About the time the
Government took over the Canadian Northern Railway a Cabinet Minister from Australia
was passing through Montreal. I happened
to be sitting next to him at luncheon at the
Reform Club. He said to me, "I sec you
have taken over a railroad."
I said, "Yes,
the Canadian Northern."
"Well," he said,
"you will have to take them all over.
In
Australia our railroads were doing well. We
took control of one, then we had to take
over another, and still another, until at last
we had them all except a couple of insignificant lines." I ask honourable members to
take notice of our railway situation. If we
do not take over the Canadian Pacific Railway, what is going to happen? The company
is net paying dividends on its common stock.
The stockholders will soon become tired of
their loss of income, and it is net likely the

the railway.
Now, consumption decreases according to
the ratio of unemployment. We were promised
in 1930 that unemployment would be wiped
out in three months. The adverse influence
of unemployment on consumption is demonstrated in Montreal. Une.mployment has in
many cases forced one family to join with
another in a single apartment, to the disadvantage of the poor landlord. And he is
not the only loser by this enforced economy:
only one gas stove is used where in separate
apartments two were necessary; similarly the
consumption of electric light is limited. The
loss of customers restricts the revenues of the
private utility companies, and to weather the
storm they have to draw on their reserves.

a few facts in this connection. The Commission has been built up into a monopoly, for
no one was permitted to compete with it. It
obtained an advance of more than $10,000,000
for the construction of rural lines. That is
in addition to the initial advance of $10,000,000. It has the right to impose-I should

on the property of customers who fail to
pay their electricity bills on the nail. I
wonder how the farmers in Quebec would
like that. No government commission bas
any control over it: it fixes its own rates; its
decisions are final; it has arbitrary powers.
To illustrate this, let me direct the attention
of the House to the following tables. I am
dealing with the Niagara district, for it is
close to the centre of power generation. The
following rates per horse-power were paid in

In spite of these official figures, supporters
of nationalization of hydro power in Quebec
continue to state that Ontario municipalities
get their electricity from the Hydro Commission at from $12 to $15 per horse-power.
This varying rate-scale clearly proves that in
certain cases special favours have been given
to friends of the Government in power.
The Hydro-Electric Power Commission bas
increased its rates from time to time. For
instance, in 1909 its rate was $9.50; in 1919,
$16; in 1923, $24; in 1932, $27.50. On the other
hand the private power companies during that
time have decreased their rates.
Now I come to what I consider a very
serious blunder on the part of the HydroElectric Power Commission of Ontario, and
perhaps the right honourable gentleman
opposite will be surprised by what I am about
to say.
Montreal visitors to Toronto must often
have been puzzled by the fact that electric
light in the latter city, particularly during
"peak" hours, has a curious flickering quality
that is quite unknown in their own city. This
flickering light is the result of a policy
adopted by Ontario Hydro, a policy described

25

by the editor of the Electrical World as "the
prime electrical blunder of the age." It comes
about from the fact that under public ownership Ontario bas clung to an outrmoded
system of electrical current, while everywhere
else in the world, Montreal included, large
electric enterprises have moved forward with
what science bas shown to be the best engineering practice.
When electric lighting was in its infancy the
current supplied was what is known as 25-cycle
power. That gave a light which flickered.
Experiments proved that power of a higher
frequency eliminated the flicker. So in the
last two decades the trend in North and South
America, in Great Britain, and in Europe
generally, bas been toward 60-cycle frequency
power.
Private plants everywhere have
scrapped old equipment and changed to
50-cycle or 60-cycle power. In Montreal and
Quebec province generally 60-cycle power bas
long been supplied.
Ontario has kept on sinking capital in
25-cycle equipment, and even imported 25cycle equipment which Germany abandoned in
favour of higher frequencies. Why? Because
of politics.
Says the Financial Post, of
Toronto:
Before it became financially disastrous to do
so, Ontario could have changed over from 25cycle to 60-cycle equiprnent. But that might have
been politically disastrous. It would have been
adnitting a mistake!
Let anyone who imagines that polities can
be kept out of public ownership enterprises
make the best he can of that statement.
The remark I have quoted is made in connection with the fact that Hydro is now about
to set the clock back in the last oasis of
60-cycle power in the Niagara district. In
the days of private ownership 60-cycle power
was established in Hamilton, Oakville, Brantford, St. Catharines, Welland, Beamsville,
Grimsby, Burlington, Burlington Beach, Stony
Beach, Palermo, Dundas and other municipalities. This 60-cycle power was continued
after Hydro took over the Dominion Power
and Transmission Company. The Financial
Post says the fiat has now gone forth by
which Hydro will deprive these municipalities
of 60-cycle power and in exchange supply
them with what is termed "an inferior article."
They are to be given 25-cycle power in the
interest of unification of services, and to
permit switching of power in case of breakdowns. What else can be done?
Many
millions of dollars' worth of equipment will
have to be scrapped to set the clock back in
the municipalities mentioned, because Hydro
cannot undertake to set the clock forward
in other areas. More than $600,000,000 has
been spent on 25-cycle power projects. To

Obviously it can hardly be claimed that municipal ewnership has brought about any neticeable reduction in power rates.
Tise partisans ot gevernment ewnership contend that their soie object in cempeting with
privateiy-owned companies is te secure an

JANUARY 23, 1935
opportunity to demonstrate the efficiency of
their system. Such competition, they claim,
is fair and conceals no hidden motive or underlying design to confiscate the property of
their competitors.
But look at what has
taken place in Ontario, where every private
company was wiped out. The Ontario Hydro
Commission has forced the Government of
that province to legalize unlawful activities.
Government ownership is the first step towards
the confiscation of acquired rights.
There
is no quicker road to anarchy. That is why
the Communists are for government ownership.
They say: " Here are these big, tall poles,
and here are the wires running over your
place. Why not tap these wires?" Well, the
distribution of power from the generator to
the consumer is usually accomplished in three
stages: first, primary high voltage lines of
from 60,000 to 220,000 volts, capable of transmitting loads up to 200,000 horse-power for
long distances; second, secondary high voltage
lines of from 15,000 to 30,000 volts, carrying
loads up to 3,000 horse-power for medium
distances; and third, distribution lines of low
voltage-2,200 to 6,600 volts-for short distance transmission. Rural distribution, because
of the distances involved, usually requires
15,000-volt service, from which, at intervals,
taps are made to serve groups of fr-rms.
Transformers cost $30,000, and automatic
switches for the safety of the people cost
$20,000. They cannot be installed at each
farm any more than trains can be expected
to stop there; so there are one railway
station and one transformer for each parish.
People may say the original cost was so much,
but in the last forty or fifty years the equipment bas been renewed over and over again.
Our population in Quebec has had all the
advantages of these renewals without a dollar
of cost to the community.
We hear of
" Trusts! Trusts!"
What are these trusts?
They are companies. I have in my possession
a list of the shareholders in these companies,
and I dare say there is not a large Catholie
institution in the province, such as the Grey
Nuns and the Sisters of Charity, that does not
own shares.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: What about the
Protestant institutions?
I stuck te the

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is why I

What are the tendencies of Marxism? Karl
Marx maintained that the individual exists
for the state, and that collectivity has the
upper hand of every citizen. Louis XIV said,
" I am the state 1" Karl Marx improved upon
these historical words, and if I were to
epitomize Marxism in a phrase, I should say,
"The state is everything!"
Hitler is not satisfied with subduing the
individualism of the German people; he aims
to become the master of their consciences
by creating a state religion. Mussolini has
just proclaimed that, the state being the
absolute master of the individual, it is necessary that children in their infancy be regimented in the Fascist legions. Stalin, after
having de-Christianized the people of Russia
by closing the churches, wrecking marriage
and abolishing the family, attempts to realize
Marxism in its essence through integral
Sovietism. To show itself an adept in Marxism, Australia has nationalized the mines,
fisheries, printing establishments, navy, agriculture, butcheries, bakeries and hotels.'Well,
we have nationally-owned hotels here too.
When one sees throughout the world the
abundant bloom of Marxism-Communism in
Russia, Fascism in Italy, Hitlerism in Germany and Socialism in Australia-one should
not bc surprised to sec a movement for
Nationalism in Quebec. If you look at Germany and Russia you will admit that these
two countries are rapidly making their way
towards most flagrant barbarism. Germany is
going back to the ancient gods worshipped by
the Cimbres and Teutons during the time of
the barbarian invasion of the Roman Empire.
Russia, having cast off all religious ideas,
idolizes Lenin as its god, and the state, which
it inherited from him. All this is government ownership.
Since 1860 machinery has replaced fifty million men, and now capitalisms is blamed for
unemployment. When all the rest of the
American continent sided with the apostles of
prohibition, Quebec alone withstood the inroads of propaganda, and even turned a deaf
car to the entreaties of persons in whom it
reposed great confidence. The "noble experiment" was a dismal failure, and to-day
all the Canadian provinces and American
states have patterned their liquor legislation
on the Quebec Liquor Act. In the matter of
state ownership Quebec will remain true to
fora and faithful to its traditions. It will
not side with agitators whose sole purpose in
the campaign they are waging is to annihilate
earned and acquired rights and privileges, te
confiscate private property, and to involve
this country in the ruinous systeas propounded
by the German Socialist Karl Marx.

W'hen Quebec Burnt Its Fiogers
Agitators who picture public ownership as a
necessary preliminary to tie establishment of
a paradise on earth have never been able to

make much headway in Quebec.
Perhaps an experiment in publie ownersbip,
initiated in the old days of the Conservative
regimie in provincial affairs, is the reason.

That experiment cost a lot of money, but it
may have been worth the price.

There are people still living in Montreal who

field of nationalization.
The Quebec Government decided to build a
railway fromîs Montreal via St. Vincent de Paul
to Ottawa. It was called the North Railway.
By tie tinse it was completed it had cost
the province $14,000,000-a litge sui in those

days.

It never was a success. Year after year its
operation resulted in deficits, which accumulated to such an extent that they threatened
to ruin the credit of the province.

It was a costly lesson. but it saved the Province fromi committing itself more deeply. It
only got one foot minred instead of being sunk
inîto the bog of nationalization up to its neck,
and it managed to pull that one foot out, thanks
to a derrick supplied by the C.P.R.
Ontario would have been fortunate if it had
hiad such an early experience to guide and to

warn it.

That province jumnped into tie bog with both
feet whien it decided on the nationalization of
hydpuro-electric power.
By ieans of the Hydro-Electric Commission
it bas accumnsulated a debt that reaches the

Equally disastrous in proportion bas been the
nationalization of the telephone service in the

Prairie Provinces.
Hon.

Mr. CASGRAIN.

According to official statistics in Ottawa the
telephone in Alberta last year showed a deficit
of over $1,000,000.
Then there was the Provincial Savings Bank
established a few years ago by Manitoba. It
was uon the verge of collapse and was only
saved by the chartered banks coming to the
rescue.
These banks, by assuming the obligations of
the tottering provincial bank, saved the
$14,000,000 which represented the savings of
depositors.
Another shocking example of public ownership
and operation is tie famous T. and N.O.
Raihray of the Ontario Government.
Notwithstanding the exceptional advantages
of running througli a fabulously rich mining
district and receiving from the C.N.R. $300,000
per annum for running rights, the railway
showed a deficit of $9,000,000 on operation in
1933.
Lastly there is the Federal Government's
experiment in railway nationalization. Under
tise Western Provinces and
pressure fron
Ontario the Federal Government nationalized
the railway built by Mackenzie and Manu.
Last year that enterprise announced a deficit
of more than $64,000,000, this not taking into
account the money loaned by the Dominion
Government. Had these loans been taken into
account the total deficit for 1933 would have
exceed $100,000,000.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But he could
not speak for the province of Quebec. That
province has no special angle towards Ontario's
Hydro policy. But the private power interests
of Quebec-and I think, further back, the
larger and more powerful interests of the
United Stateshave an angle towards the
Hydro enterprise in Ontario. They have an
interest to which they have been remarkably
alive in these last few years and months, and
I venture to suggest that when attacks are
made upon the Hydro we ought to try hard
to discover the source of them. That is why
I ask the honourable gentleman what is the
source of the astonishing information, as be
described it, which he was giving to this House.
It was occasionally interlarded with some
extracts from the Financial Post. But that
publication supplied only a minor part of the
material which the honourable gentleman has
given to us. He himself did not provide the
source, otherwise he would have read his statement better than be did. I have a tolerably
safe idea as to the origin of his information,
and I should have liked the honourable gentleman to disclose it to us frankly. In the course
of his speech he supplied me with an enormous
memorandum prepared by the Shawinigan
Water and Power Company, or by engineers
in their employ. It would have been very
difficult- for me to analyse the memorandum
in the short space of time at my command
before I rose to speak. Indeed, any adequate
analysis could come only from an engineer as
well qualified as the one who prepared it. But
I intend to make some reference to it this
afternoon.
I think I have never been known as an
extreme or advanced advocate of public ownership; certainly never as an advocate of public
ownership of aIl things. But I have been

tated by circumstances resulting in the main
from the failure of private ownership to conduct enterprises which, though privately owned,
were essential to the State. If I were to
endeavour to express my view on this question in the space of a sentence, it would be
something like this. With respect to enterprises of a national or state character, particularly where the amount of capital is great
in relation to the labour required, it is very
probable that in these days public ownership
and operation will be the better. To the degree

power units, in which capital is a great factor
and labour a relatively minor one, the situation is different. In a rather thickly populated
province like Ontario, where without public
ownership we are bound to be faced with a
multiplicity of private enterprises, overlapping, conflicting with and usually destructive of one another, and as a result the users
of power would have to be charged higher
rates in order to pay for the multiplicity of
capital investments, it seems to me proper
that we should have not only state control
but state operation.
I know the people of Ontario will be grateful to the honourable senator for the kind
interest he is taking in their welfare, and
especially for the evidence of that tender
and merciful heart which he has exhibited
towards the power consumers of the province.
He regards us with an anxious pity. We are
struggling, he says, under a load of debt-I
do not know how many hundreds of millions
he estimates it is now-all due to public
ownership of Hydro. Though we are, he
believes, burdened with excessive rates, we
are bearing up manfully, and his heart goes
out to us. Furthermore, our eyes are blinking
because we use 25-cycle current, yet we are
unable to extricate ourselves from political
tentacles and get a swifter cycle. I should
like to see my honourable friend assume the
role of a John the Baptist in this province of
poor, benighted people. I have in my mind
a picture of the figure he would eut as he
went about preaching the gospel of private

ownership of electrical power. The honourable gentleman has not the first notion of
the real situation with respect te the HydroElectrie Power Commission and the service
it renders. I admit that service may some
day be blighted, but I am confident it will
not. I do not think the citizens of Ontario
will submit to any policy which they consider would result in the destruction of Hydro.
I believe there is no other institution in the
province to which the people as a whole are
so devoted as they are te the Hydro-Electric
Power Commission.
What are the facts? It is truc that in the
main private companies have disappeared.
The properties of these companies have
not been confiscated; they have been purchased by the process of bargaining, and
sometimes by arbitration. Their bonds have
been asstrmed and their shareholders paid. In
Ontario we are sometimes charged with confiscating these properties, and that appears to
bc the kind of thing my honourable friend
would age against us. At other times it is
said that we have paid too muai. I should
be in a position to come to an intelligent
opinion, and, J think, an honest one; and I
believe that in the main the assets of those
private firms have been fairly purchased. I
do not think thc charge of confiscation will lie
in any in<tance. I have never seen one where
I was convinced it did lie, nor have I had
an-thing to (o with one where that was even
charged. And I have not had to do with
an instance where it was alleged that we paid
too much.
There were always reasons for
whbatev'tr stop was taken, and when an intelligent commission went into the matter it
rcognized sueh reasons, put the proper value
upon them, and then made a sane report.
The resuilt is that in the province of Ontario w find ourselves now with one unit
insteadi of twenty. There is no duplication of
service, and we are paying interest only upon
the capital essential for the service instead of
upon a multiplication of capital which
inevitably wouîld have been employed had
there been multiple services. This fact is
responsible for the economy which Hydro has
brought to Ontario. The economy does not
lie-and no s-ane person would claim it doesin superiority of managerial skill on the part
of a commission or its officers as compared
with a private corporation and its officers.
The saving is due to the fact that we have
avoided tremendous charges that would have
coma from multiplication of services.
Let us go a step further and trace the results.
The honourable gentleman gave us some
figures as to the cost of power, by which he
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

means the cost to manufacturing indu-tries.
That is one factor and only one. He says that
in certain cases the cost lias increased, and in
this he is correct. As you have to go fartier
for your power, or to less economical plants,
necessarily the cost rises. If you could do
what a private institution can, develop only
the most economical plant and deliver power
only whiere it can be most economically
delivered, that is to people nearby, tlien of
course you could offer lower ratas. But if
your policy is service to all the people. not
to just a few, you must necessarily raie your
prices as you have to go farther for the
source of power which you distribute to the
masses. Consequently an intelligible comparison cannot bc drawn between conditions
under private operations and under public
operations.
Te objective in each ca-e is
entirelv different.
In Ontario we have a vastly wider distribution of power than thora is in Quebec. Our
rural service covers over 63,000 farmers. How
many are serxed in the province of Quebiec?
Just a comparative handful, only those who
happen to live near the source of power. I
speak now subject to correction, and witihout
having made an intensive study of the situation in tliat province, but I do not beliexve
that even in respect of power for indîustry
ftie comparison favours Quebec. And if it
did, that would argue very little or nothing
at aIl.
In the province of Ontario before the
introduction of Hydro, and afterwards in
those sections where prixvate icrsts were
serving before the Hydro organization was
spread as widely as it is to-day., the average
cost for electrical current to the domeftic
consumer was 5-7 cents per kilowatt-luiîîr.
That is approximately the average cost
throughout the whole state of New York
to-day, and I think the figure would not be
very far out as applied to the province of
Quebec. Econonies effected by the union of
power enterprises have resulted in reducing
the average cost in Ontario to-day to 1-7
cents. This current is used principally for
lighting purposes. The saving to consumers
on that account alone aggregates S30,000,000
a year, or sufficient to pay the interest on the
whole capital debt of the province. including
the Hydro debt.
While theli honourable
gentleman was talking he frequently pointed
to the rigit honourable senator froin Eganville (Riglht Hon. Mr. Graliamx), but for wlat
purpose I was not able to divine. I suggest
that the next time he is considering this
question he ask the right honourable senator
about results in the city of Brockville, where

JANUARY 23, 1935
he lives. Before the introduction of the
publicly owned Hydro system there domestic
consumers paid something like 7 cents per
kilowatt-hour for current. Difficulties ensued
and the municipality finally decided to purchase the private enterprise. That was not
very many years ago, but as I am not sure of
the year I will not venture a guess. After
the purchase the rates were slightly reduced,
and throughout the intervening period they
have been lowered almost annually to all
classes of consumers in that city, and particularly to the consumers of light, who compose by far the largest part of the conmunity. The result has been that notwithstanding the lowering of rates the local unit
has been able to pay for the cost of its whole
distribution system, it does not owe a dollar,
and its property is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. All this has come out of
earnings from the sale of electricity, for the
taxpayers did not contribute a cent towards
the purchase or operation of the plant. The
mortgage was burned over a year ago.
What is true of Brockville is true of about
seventy-five other municipalities in the province of Ontario. In every case reductions
have been constant, and the debt has been
lowered. Many municipalities have tremendous equities in their properties. All of them
have as well large equities in the great
central institution which owns the individual
plants for producing power and the overriding distribution system carrying the power
to individual municipalities.
I should like to see the honourable senator
from De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain)
come into Ontario and put himself at the
head of a movement such as he assumes to
lead in this House.
I am not seeking to
dictate to Quebec. It may be that province
wants the privately owned system, and possibly such a system is better suited to it.
But I should imagine that the municipalities
there are just as capable of doing business and
handling their own affairs as are those in
Ontario. However, that is a matter for the
province of Quebec. And I should like to
suggest to the honourable senator from De
Lanaudière that matters relating to the HydroElectric Commission of Ontario are the
business of the people of this province.
Now let me come to some subjects which
were touched upon yesterday by the honourable leader on the other side of the House
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand).
The Speech from
the Throne certainly cannot be criticized as
wanting in interesting material. It is perhaps
the most pregnant Speech from the Throne
which has been brought down in the history
of our country. It comes after a long series
of statutes passed here in recent years, and

31

follows immediately upon what I think was
the most fruitful session of which our Parliament can boast. When we last met we
put through a succession of measures, certainly most vital, courageous, if not dangerous,
but still well-considered-measures admittedly of tremendous import, designed to
attack a condition of affairs with which we
had never before been confronted.
Last session saw a Shipping Bill put through.
It saw this country adjust itself to a new
Imperial relationship in matters of shipping
-a
very difficult and complicated task for
which, I think, this House deserves by far the
major credit. It was one of the most important measures ever enacted by this Parliament.
Last session saw the Bank Act revised, with
more than the usual alterations in the principal sections, for it was revised under conditions radically different from those prevailing in previous revisions. This also was a
very important step involving high responsibility on the part of the representatives of
the people.
But last session saw further measures of a
category into which Parliament had rarely
ventured in other times. The Marketing Act
was perhaps the most forward of those
measures. We never before had tried to offer
to primary producers a mechanism for marketing such as in other fields was available
through united effort on the part of those
engaged in the industry. This mechanisn
could not reach the primary producer without
the assistance of Parliament. It is too soon
yet to pass any very useful judgment upon
the fruits of that measure. 'Suffice it to say
that it bas worked for the benefit of two or
more industries in the primary field in a way
acceptable to those engaged therein, and has
given promise of opening up an avenue of
usefulness perhaps even beyond the expectations of its sponsors. It looks as though it
would be possible to do much of real value
to primary producers along the lines laid
down in that statute. Undoubtedly it has
already been of special benefit to those
engaged in fruit growing. But the main point
of interest to us is that it seems to be workable through the instrumentality of those in
the industry rather than merely through governmental officials.
Another measure of great importance indeed
was the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act.
There has been more opportunity of judging
the practicability of that law than of the first
one referred to.
Many cases have come
before the boards. The working-out of the
legislation is still in motion. Much has been
done towards the laying down of general

SENATE

32

principles by a conference of the different
boards of the provinces. At least it bas been
shown that this law meets a keenly and
desperately felt want by our farmers for an
easy and quick method whereby both creditor
and debtor may face the inevitable, get down
to realities and place the whole situation on
a basis that will serve both in the best way.
Then last session we established a Central
Bank, by a measure that indeed was introduced amidst various forebodings and doubts
on the part of some very well qualified to
judge, a measure whose importance certainly
cannot be denied, and the courage of whose
sponsors must be admitted.
All this is the product of one session. It
was a session highly to the credit of the
Le ader of the Administration, and the results
of it give him warrant to command the sincere
confidence of the country wlhen he propounds
a still bigger logislative programme-that
upon which we are now launched.
I do not purpose to discuss at length the
prineiples of the rmeasures foreshadowed in
the Speech from the Throne. I shall just
recite three to indicate that we can all look
forward to having ouir timie well and usefully
occupied, our talents challenged to the utmost.
We have a real opportunity this session to
give that cure to moasures whiclh is demanded
by their importance, by thoir far-reaching
character, and by the tremendous responsibility of Parliament in relation thereto. These
three paragraphs, each of then very short, wili
indicate what I mean.
Better provision will be made for the security
of the woiker

during

ness, and in old age.

unemulployment, in sick-

It is difficult to over-emphasize the wealth
of neaning in that pronouncement. "Better
provision for the security of the worker during unemployment"-a new step in the pathway of Canada. "Better provision during
sickness"--distinctly, if not radically, new.
"Better provision in old age." All these are
inoves in the direction of laying the burden
of the straggler, who is not hiimself responsible
for his condition, upon the whole body.
The next paragraph reads:
Action will be taken to aieliorate the conditions of labour, to provide a better and more

assured standard of living for the worker, to
secira
ininnixîx w ages and a maximum working
week. aud to alter the incidence of taxation
so that it will more directly conforn to

cxpacity to pay.

This is the third paragraph:
You

,signel

be invited to enact measures
to safeguard the consumer and priiary

wl

pioducer against unfair trading practices and
to rcgulate, in the public interest, concentraons in production and distribution.
Right lon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Never before has
it

a

menu

so

Parliament

attractive,

a

had before

programme

so

challenging.
That care will be necessary in the framing
of these measures goes without saying; that
they will involve the placing of burdens upon
those best able to pay goes without saying;
but I ask honourable members who have
watched the evolution of the world in the
last ten years, who have examined the social
composition of our country itself, if in their
hearts they believe the action proposed can
be avoided. I ask them if under to-day's
conditions, the product of new forces, of
circumstances utterly unknown to our fathers,
they really feel these things can be resisted.
Are they not convinced that our only course
is to choose our steps carefully and to decide
definitely the direction in which we must go
conscientiously to discharge our duty, making
sure that every step of the march is as wisely
directed as it can possibly be?
An honourable senator opposite is very
much concerned as to where the money shall
come from. His concern is not only proper
and natural, it is inevitable. It would be
only uttering the argument of a party mannet wholly in place in this assembly-if I
were to say to bi
there is a leader of a
great party in Canada who does net seem
to be much concerned with these measures.
And lie is not the Leader of the Government. This leader pronounces himself right
behind theni, and wants to see them enacted.
He of course would never think of taking
this vital step unless he knew the money
could be provided. But little can be gained
by resorting to such an argument. The difficulty of financing is certainly great. No
honourable member can minimize the importance of that consideration, but we have
to bend our foreheads to the storni and sce
that the financing is done. There is indication
in the Speech from the Throne of the source
from which the money will come-fromn those
best able to pay.
There are in this country to-day tens of
thousands suffering, through no fault of their
own, the consequences of the industrial evolution of the last twenty-five years. That they
will continue to suffer unless new steps are
taken, we must all admit. That they should
not suffer under a properly regulated economy,
we must also all admit. That there are
dangers surrounding any solution is manifest
to everyone. The main danger is this, that
you are bound to include within the bounty
of Parliament those whxo are quite content to
lean upon that bounty, te give up all ideas
of self -reliance, of making their own way in
life. There lies the main difBculty of any

33

JANUARY 23, 1935
solution at ail. Such are the troubles that
surround us at this very moment. While
to-day there are tens of thousands, if flot
hundreds of thousands, who are in want or
dcpending upon charity through no deiinquency of their own, there are undoubtedly
many thousands who have by the generosity
of the State been led into habits deleterious
to themselves and to the nation. The lirie
must be drawn fairly, but we must not
shirk the duty of drawing that lime, of surrounding our legislation with ail the safeguards that wisdom can suggest, in order
that while doing the right and just tbing to
the deserving we may not contribute to
the delinquency of tbe undeserving.
I know that ahl honourable members are
prepared to give fair, just and intelligent
thought to the proposaIs of the Administration. I believe the country as a whole expects Parliament to take practical and f orward action in this direction. I do not think
we can reach any other conclusion from the
almost universal attitude of the Press of this
Dominion and the leaders of public thought.
It is to that duty we must devote ourselves,
and I bespcak the co-operation of ail.

It seems but a few short weeks since, in

A message was received from the House

DOMINION LANDS ACT
APPROVAL OF ORDERS IN COUNCIL
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved:
That the Orders in Couneil which have been

Deceiber, 1934, in accordance with the provisions of Section 75 of the Dominion Lands
Act, Chapter 113, R.S. 1927, and whieh were
laid on the Table on the 22nd day of January,
1935, be approved.
He said: In furtherance of what I said
yesterday in reply to an inquiry, I may
explain that these are all Orders in Council
under the Dominion Lands Act. When they
authorize the sale of any land, or the granting of any interest therein, it is provided by
statute that they shall be laid on the Table
of, and approved by, each House of Parliament.
A great many of these Orders in
Council consist of transfers made to the
different provinces on the removal of charges
for which the lands were held in the right
of the Dominion. Then there are numerous
leases, and grants of small interests in lands.
There is nothing, I should think, of anything
like national concern.

Is there a special

Right lion. Mr. MEIGHEN: Not for
Thanksgiving Day, but of course Remembrancc Day is the llth. of November.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I have often said
in this House that it would be a good thing
if this holiday were observed on the lst of
November, which has to be kept as a holyday, like a Sunday, by one-third of the population of the country. As it is now, we bave
Thanksgiving Day, Ail Saints, and Remembrance Day aIl coming close together. Every
time that we have discussed Remembrance
Day I have suggested that it should be
observed on the lst of November.
Right Hon. Mr. METOHEN: The bonourable gentleman's remarks might apply to
Thanksgiving Day, but would flot to Remembrance Day.
Right lion. Mr. GRAHAM: Honourable
members, my understanding, and I think that
of the public, is that heretofore Remembrance

READING

Right -Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 4, an Act to amend
the Representation Act, 1933.
He said: lionourable mxembers, this Bill is
necessary because at the time of the passing
of the general Act-usuaIIy caled the Redistribution Act-it was not known or at least
flot observed that already the boundaries of
liamilton had been changed by a provincial
statute, and consequenthy an error occurred
in the definition of constituencies in Hamilton. This Bill corrects that error and makes
the definition conform to the actual limits of
the city of liamilton as set out by statute.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It does not
make any important change that might interfere with the vote?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. It
appeared to be satisfactory to the other

I fancy, would bc to this House.

SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MFJGHEN moved the
second reading of Bihl 6, an Act to amend
the Pension Act.
lie said: Honourable members, it appears
that at present there is need of two additional members on the Pension Board. I
understand it is desired that tbey should be
doctors, because further professional assistance is required. IJnder the Act as it now
stands every commissioner is automatically
appointed for seven years. The Pension
Board represents that there is hikely to be no
need of retaining these new commissioners for
that length of time, and consequently this
amendment is brought forward to enable the
appointments to be made for such shorter
perîod as may be desired.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: I suppose the need
for additional doctors is accounted for by
the numerous amendments made to the
Pension Act hast year and the large number
of new applications received in the course
of the last few months.

that when a convention has been adopted,
the treaty following on it becomes an obligation of Canada; and Canada's jurisdiction
in respect of legislation to carry through such

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
May I ask my
right bonourable fricnd if manufacturers of
the articles covered by the Bill have made
any representations ta the ýGovernment with
respect ta the proposed amendments? The
tendency of the earlier amendments bas been
towards protecting tbe public against false
markings. It is only natural tbat this policy
should be continued. However, in the past
various members of the trades affected bave
appearcd before aur committees and suggested
that the amendmcnts tben proposcd were flot
opportune. It is not the practice of the bouse
of Commons ta senci bis of this character
ta a committee.

its every clause makes for further protection
of the public. Each amendment is very
plainly designcd ta further protect the public

the right honourable gentleman tell me why
it should corne before Parliament almost
every year?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable gentleman's remarks are nothing more
than the truth. There has hardly been a
session of Parliament in my experience when
there has not been some amendment to this
Act. One naturally wonders why the legislation will not stand for at least four or
five years. 1 presume the reason is that the
methods of the trade are continually changing
and improving, and that the adoption of
these new methods defeats the purpose of
the Act. The ingenuîty of man is quicker
than the action of Parliament. We are trying
to do something which is very complicated
and technical. For ail the jewellery I buy
it would not make mucli difference, but I
presume it is necessary to proteet the public
in the purchase of articles in regard to which
the ordinary man cannot possibly proteet
himself. Otherwise 1 should expect fraud to
be very easy and prevalent. Now, assuming
that the protection is neceasary, you have to
keep your Act up to date, and your legislation must meet the varying and progressive
ingenuity of business men, manufacturers and
ail other classes of the comrnunity.

specifications and claims, conflicting applications, the term of patents, conditions applicable to all patents, and revocation of patents.
The Commissioner of Patents, after a lingering illness, has died, and it becomes necessary
to appoint a new Commissioner. The Act
provides that the Commissioner is to be
appointed by the Government of the day.
The other officials, when appointments become necessary, are appointed under the Civil
Service Act.
I do not need at this time to go into further
details of the various amendments. My purpose, if it is the pleasure of the House to
accede to the motion for second reading now,
is to have the Bill referred to the Committee
on Commerce and Trade Relations, and ask
that it meet to-morrow forenoon, not for
serious consideration of the Bill clause by
clause-for probably that would be too soon,
as honourable members will want to study
the Bill very carefully-but rather in order
to make arrangements and fix a date for the
hearing of representations with respect to
the measure.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAiND: I conclude from
the remarks of the right honourable gentleman that by giving the Bill second reading
now we shall not be taken as sanctioning any
new principle that may be contained in the
measure. In other words, when the Bill is
reported from the committee the House will
remain free to express its opinion, and even
to vote on the question of principle, if there
be an important principle involved. This Bill
is a consolidation of the Patent Act. In my
time we had a consolidation, and I know
fairly well what the Act covered, but apparently there is to be also a reorganization
of the Bureau of Patents. I see the Commissioner will be appointed by the Government, while the other officials will be appointed by the Civil Serv'ice Commission.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: As vacancies
occur.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Does that mean

appointed by the Government and not by the
Civil Service Commission. Whether he is
to be on the same footing as a Deputy Minister I do not know. We may discuss that in
committee. Inasmuch as we are not sanctioning any principle now, 'I have no objection to the second reading.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This is one
of those measures to which I think we may
properly give second reading without feeling
that we commit ourselves to any principle.
It contains no special principle that is not in

41

the old measure. There are detail changes.
The principal changes are the two I have
defined: first, the restriction of the rights of
the patentee to a much briefer period and
the placing of more onerous obligations upon
him; and, second, the appointment of the
head of the branch by Order in Council
rather than by the Civil Service Commission
-if that can be considered a principle. The
other changes are perhaps more important
than the second I have just named, but they
are undoubtedly details.
The honourable senator has asked: is the
Commissioner of Patents under this Bill to
be elevated to the rank of a Deputy Minister? He is not. He still is the head of a
branch, but he is being selected as a Deputy
Minister is selected because of the importance
of his office-the technical knowledge, and
especially the legal knowledge, that he must
possess. It is apparent that that office should
be filled by the Government itself. But of
course this is a detail which is entirely et
the disposition of the House. If we do not
like it we can change it.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: May I ask the right
honourable gentleman a question? Heretofore, as I recall, patents and copyright have
been dealt with in the same branch of a
department. Do I understand the right honourable gentleman to say that the new Bill
deals only with patents, not with copyright?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think the
Bill deals only with patents, though I confess I have not yet read it in its entirety.
Copyright comes under another Act, but the
same branch deals with both patents and
copyright.
I give just a few figures. During the past
fiscal year there were before this branch
58,904 official transactions. Applications for
patents alone totalled 9,267. The examination
of applications by the expert officers of the
department resulted in the allowance of
9,621, and the number of patents actually
issued was 9,122. Besides these there were
a large number of assignments of patents,
and the deeds registered totalled 6,577. Then
in the Patent Office there is the Copyright
Branch. Copyright registrations last year
numbered 2,537.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: May I ask whether
that includes the trade-mark branch?
TradeRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
marks and copyrights are different, but I am
satisfied that trade-marks are under the sam
branch. The honourable senator from Russell
(Hon. Mr. Murphy) would be certain as to
that.

Geneva on the 24th day of June, 1926, reading
as followsHon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would ask
His Honour the Speaker to suspend the reading of this resolution, because I intend to ask
the right honourable gentleman to postpone
the consideration of these conventions for a
few days-perhaps until the first of next
week-so that I may have an opportunity
of examining them. I confess that I have
not read them, and I think they are of such
importance that the members of the Senate
should have the privilege of examining them
carefully before expressing an opinion upon
them. There is a constitutional question involved in one of them whieh may call for
some debate-I know that I intend to address
myself to that question-and I think we
could well afford to postpone consideration
until next week.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I certainly
will not resist, with any intention of finality,
the suggestion made by my honourable friend.
I think perhaps an examination of the conventions might be somewhat facilitated, made
easier of approach, if I were to say a few
words now, not with relation to the merits
of the resolutions, but with regard to considerations affecting the question whether
they are properly before us at this time.
Hight Hon.

Mr. MEIGHEN.

These considerations received a great deal
of attention when the resolutions were before
the other House.
I have moved only one resolution, that
relating to the convention concerning seamen's articles of agreement, but that motion
will be followed, immediately or later, by
others. Honourable members well know that
anything affecting seamen's articles of agreement comes under shipping, and consequently
is an undoubted federal prerogative.
The
next convention, re the marking of the weight
on heavy packages, also has to do with
shipping, and here again the same remarks
apply. Manifestly the third convention, re
the loading of ships, is in the same category.
The next convention refers to the eight-hour
day in industry, and then there is the convention regarding the weekly day of rest.
There are five in all. Honourable members
will have no difficulty in apprehending that
the first three subjects, historically, and without debate, have always been regarded as
within the purview of the Federal Parliament.
It is only when we come to the next two
that very close attention is required in order
that we may decide intelligently whether it
is well to deal with them in this Parliament
in the way suggested. I do not think I am
going too far in saying that historically we
have ordinarily regarded the determination
of the hours of labour per day as a provincial responsibility. We have not regarded
the subject of a weekly day of rest as a
provincial responsibility, but only, I fancy,
because we have always dealt with it under
the Criminal Code, and have what we know
as the Lord's Day Act.
Any remarks I may make now will be not
by way of argument at all, but only by way
of introduction to the general subject, in the
hope that they may be of value to honourable
members in emphasizing the real nature of
the problem we face. They will be directed
to this one convention relating to the day of
rest. I shall move the resolution later, but
my remarks may be made now.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Is it the convention referring to the weekly rest or the
one referring to the eight-hour day?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I mean the
convention relating to the eight-hour day,
because that is the one which any honourable member would select as protruding
objectionable features from the standpoint of
the Constitution, if he were disposed to contend that as to any one of the conventions.
This is in the form of a convention drawn
up by the International Labour Organization
and adopted by it, but adopted only as a draft
convention for submission to the members of

FEBRUARY 13, 1935
the League of Nations who signed the Treaty
of Versailles. Certain provisions of that
treaty, in addition to those establishing the
League of Nations, impose on the signatory
powers obligations with respect to any agreement arrived at by the International Labour
Organization and accepted by the parliaments
of the countries which. are parties to the
agreement. The agreement in this case- cornes
to Canada in the forrn of a draft convention.
It lias been before the Government of Canada
for sorne considerabie time, though it bas
nlot been specifically dealt with.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Has it not been
referred to the provinces?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: It lias not
been specifleally dealt with in any legislative
sense. As to the question how it ought to
be treated legislatively, it lias been deait with
by way of a discusion--one might even say
by way of a deeision-through an Order in
Council of November, 1020, I think. It lias
aiso been dealt with by a reference to the
Supreme Court of Canada for the advice or
decision of that Court as to wbat the obligation of Canada was with regard thereto. 1
want to make clear to honourable members
that it lias been before us only as a draft convention. The Order in Council expressed the
view, which was conflrmed by the Supreme
Court, that in so far as the obligation was
concerned it was necessary only to refer the
matter to sucli legislatures of Canada as under
our Constitution have jurisdietion in the piemises. I hope honourable members have noted
the use of the word "obligation." Sueh was
the only obligation upon us. I have no
doubt that the obligation, so described, was
fulfilled by the reference to the lieutenantgovernors of the provinces, the Government
considering that the provinces were the bodies
which under our Constitution had legislative
power.
I have laid before honoura;ble members the
base, upon which 1 purpose to add just a few
worde. We may say that certainly the obligation to which I have referred was the only
obligation upon us. But this is far from
saying that the Government does not posiess
power beyond that. There lias been a considerable development-one might possibly
desoribe it as an evolution-in constitutional
law as finally decided by our courts and th~e
Privy Council. There necessarily muet be
evolution in constitutional jurisprudence, because of the evolution of business, because
of the larger interprovinoial and international
aspects which business takes upon itself from
year to year. The more recent and more
important advances--or decisions, if that termn

43

is preferred-have been made in the celebrated
aeronauitics and radio cases. Aeronautics were
neyer thought of, stili less was radio, when
the British North America Act was pa.ssed.
In those times it was neyer for a moment
assumed that Canada would some day be
acting as an autonomous powver, with ail the
sappurtenances of nationhood. It was ratheT
considered that whenever she acted internationally it would lie only as a member of the
British Empire. Therefore in coming to conclusions in the matters submitted in these two
celebrated cases, the judges had to take into
account these recent developments and consider how the great prinoiples of our constitutional pact could be applied to, them, and
how the inteipretations had to be goveirned
by these recent and far-reaching evolutions.
Consequently the lawyers in the House, and
indeed ail honourable members who add*ress
themselves to this subjeet with a view to
getting a really intelligent grasp of it, will find
it necessary to read the judgments in these
two cases. Having read them, they will ask
thçmselves this question: thougli the subI ectmatter of this eight-hour day draft convention
has historically been dealt with, and regarded
as properly deait with, by the provinces, is it
not now one which cornes well within the
purview of the decision in the radio case
especially, and indeed within the broad principles of the decision in the aeronautics case
as well? As business evolves and intertwines
it becomes less and less of a local and private
character and more and more widespread and
national. I venture to put this question to
honourable members: is it ever going to be
possible for Canada to make any real progrees
in the way of keeping itself abreast of the
advanes in social legisiation throughout the
world, taking its place with the rest of the
forward powers and in spirit as in letter
complying with the obligations under the
Treaty of Versailles, especially those features
of that treaty related to the Labour Organization, if we are always going to say that we
must wait until ail the provinces are in
agreement? Shall we ever be able to get on
at ail if we continue to throw these problems
back on Ontario to-day, on Quebec to-morrow,
and on some other province the next day? If
we cannot get on in that way, then surely
our Constitution is broad enough to enabie
us to act as a whole body, as one country,
whieh. indeed we are. It is in an effort so to
act, an effort based on the belief that these
later decisions in particular give us the power
s0 to act, that we are bringing forward these
measures, which we hope will take statutory
form. In this respect I have particular refer-

44

SENATE

ence to the draft convention relating to hours
of labour per day.
I hope honourable members of this buse,
and particularly those who have had training
and experience in the law, will devote to an
intensive study of this subject the time between now and the date which my honourable friend opposite suggests for fuller consideration of it. In the Senate we are
favoured in having as members some hionourable gentlemen who have long stood in the
front ranks of the legal profession in our
country. Not only do they possess a great
store of learning in the Iaw, but they have had
long experiencýe in practice.
ilere is an
opportunity for them to render to our country
that service for which they are especially
qualified. I hope that they wilI bring their
great powers to, bear upon the discussion of
these matters, and particularly the twvo much
disputed resolutions.

subject-matter of that agreement mnust be considered to como within the peace, order and
good govcrnmcnt terrns of section 92. Sncb
wvas the pronounerent in the very latest case.
It is beiieved this matter cornes under the
principies there enunciated and relied upon,
and w'hich must ho helid now to be principles
in permanent effeet.
But as a practical matter, throwving aside
legalistie terms of every sort, I do asc honourable members to consider whether any other
course ýis open to us. Are we, not inelined,
perhaps wvith aIl the plausibility in the world,
perhaps being able even to quote in our
favour deýcisions of ton or twenty years ago,
to luse the provinces as a shield to proteet
us frorn critieism hecause of our evasion of
ýresponsibiiity to impiement an engqgýement
which ive entered into?

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: May I ask
the right honourable gentleman whether hais
argument is flot in favour of an arnendment
of the Constitution rather than an evasion
of what have always been eonsîdered its
terms?

Riglht Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
the buck.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: No, I did not
intend it to ho SO at ail. I amn sure that my
right honourable friend, with his long parliamentary experience, wiIl be able to read the
decisions in those cases just as intelligently as
any lawyer in the House. If he reads them
ho will find that -when we make an agrcement, as we do when we adopt a convention,
if it is made by Canada as a component part
of the Ernpire-and I emphasize that relationship at the moment-then, undoubtedly, no
matter what rnay have been the jurisdiction
on the subject before, the carrying into effeet
of the obligations so assumed hy the country
is a puroly federal responsibility. That has
been hield in the aeronauties case, without any
question, and in fact it was not subject to
dispute beforo that case was decided.
But there is still another complication. In
respect to, say, ail matters of radio, Canada
made hier convention or agreement with other
countries on this continent, I think ail togother, not as a component part of the Empire at all. Therefore she could not corne
under section 132 of the British North Amorica
Act and eouid not get jurisdiction under it.
She aeted as an autonomous country, and His
Majesty signod the convention on the advie
of the ministers of Canada. But the lords of
the Privy Council held-and this illustrates the
value of that tribunai-that inasmuch as there
couid ho only one, body competent practically
to carryv into effeet any agreement made, the
Riglit Ilon. M'.r. MEIGEEN.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Passing

the buck.
No, stealing

Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: I have followed the
right honourablo gentloman's explanation very
sympa theti cally, because ho genorally knows
what hoe is talking about, but I do not quite
agreo withi him when ho says that in the
interpretation of our Constitution wc must ho
guided by the principle of evolution. If I
understand my right honourable friend aright,
evulutiun accurding to hiîn would be revulution in the provincial sense.
After Confederation Sir John A. Macdonald
and other authiorities asserted federal rights in
cases where there was invasion of provincial
rights according to other great constitutionalists like Edward Blake and Sir Oliver
Mowat. The Ontario Streams Bill and the
question of licences, among other questions,
were brouglit before the Privy Council, and
each tirne the Privy Council decided in favour
of the provinces, on the ground that the
British North Arnerica Act clearly states to
wiîieh j uriscdictioti such anîd such a matter
appertains.
Now, evolution may ho a very fine theory,
but I adhere strictly to the principles whieh
were advocated f orty or fifty years ago by
such erninent constitutionalists as Sir John
A. Macdonald, Edward Blake and Sir Oliver
Mowat.
I stand irrevocably for provincial
rights, unless it has been demonstrated by
the right honourable gentleman's very able
argument this afternoon that we are in the
wrong, and that ive must, so to speak, blast
our way througha tho Constitution.
I arn
roady to study the matter, but it seems tu me
that the very ingenious theo-y adivanced by

FEBRUARY 13, 1935
the right honourable gentleman would nullify
ail provincial rigbts.
I agree with the right honourable gentleman that with respect to the three conventions dealing with shipping and other matters
of trade and commerce, we have jurisdiction;
but as regards civil laws, such as hours of
labour, and so on, these, I submit, come
directly under the jurisdiction of the provinces.
This is a most important matter, a matter
which awakens in our minds the great legal
fights of the past. Would not the Government be in a stronger position-I will flot say
to railroad this legislation through the
Senate, because the right honourable gentleman does not intend to do so, but would it
not strengthen the position of the Government if, before asking this House to pass
the prdposed legislation, the question at issue
were submitted for the opinion of the
Supreme Court?
The right honourable gentleman a moment
ago referred to the ruling of the Supreme
Court on the reference made to it. I gather
from bis remarks that lic thinks the answer
of the Supreme Court was not complete, and
he flnds a way of escape, in favour of the
present legislation, even according to that
ruling.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The answer
was complete, but the questions submitted
were flot complete.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But there is
no decision of tbe Privy Council on this
question.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: There is a decision
on the principle.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The right
honourable gentleman lias not said so.
Hon. Mr. POPE: Cannot anyone else say
s0 if he wishes to?
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
Tben lie
makes a mistake.
The Hon. the SPEAKERR:
Shall this
motion stand?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Stand.
Right Hon. Mr. MELGHEN: It is understood that, if so desired, it will stand until
we reassemble next week; but perhaps honourable members wilI be prepared to consider
the first three resolutions to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Say Tuesday
evening.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We can put
them ail through at once just as easily as one,
I suppose. Id the honourable member prefers to leave them ail tili Tuesday, I am
quite satisfied.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Ahl right.
The motion stands.

Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX:
But surely the
Orders in Council passed by both Govcrnments, Liberal and Conservative, and the
opinions given by the Attorneys-General cf
Ontario and Quebec count for something. I
have the highest regard for the opinion of
Mr. Taschereau, an able and alert lawyer. I
have, too, the highest regard for the opinion
of the present Attorney-General of Ontario,
Mr. Roebuck, and that of his predecessor,
Mr. Price. And I say again. that the Government would be much stronger in its position if it were supported by the latest opinion
of the Supreme Court with respect to this
matter. I am bound to say to the riglit
honourable leader that grave doubts are
entertained ail over Canada as to the legality
of this projected legisiation, notwithstanding
the two cases of aeronautics and radio just
quoted by 'him. However, I sin read~y to
listen and be convinced, if conviction can
be secured based on a sound legal argument.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Does my honourable friend think that the Supreme Court
of Canada would overrule a decision of the
Privy Council?

PRECIOUS

METALS

MARKING

BILL

MOTION FOR THIIRD READING

Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
third reading of Bihl 2, an Act to amend the
Precious Metals Marking Act, 1928.
He said: Honourable members, when this
Bill was up for third reading yesterday I
promised an answer as to what would be the
length of the prescription before entering
action if the present prescription of six months
were abolished. I întimated to my honourable
friend yesterday that I was satisfied there
still would lie a limitation. I find that I
was wrong. There will not be any-and that
is exactly what the department wants, no
limitation.
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: No limit.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIiGHEN: What I arn
told is this. If there is a sale of an article
of jewellery which does not bear the marking provided for by the Act, that sale is a
violation. The article is sold by the manufacturer to the wholesaler or the retailer: i
may lie on their sheives for three ye5ars before
being sold to the consumer, and it may lie

46

SENATE

another two years before the purchaser flnds
that it is not as marked. Five years will
have elapsed. Under the law as it now stands
there could be no prosecution after the lapse
of six months. Consequently it is intimated
that there should be no limitation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

I am somewhat

doubtful of the orthodoxy of this proposition.
I appreciate the reasonablencss of extending
the period from the date of the sale; but if
suit is taken two, three, five or ten years
later, how is the accused to be in a position
to defend himself when, through the demise
of the clerks in the store, and so forth, all
the evidence concerning the sale has disappeared? It seems hard that a law should
go on our Statute Book which would allow
anyone to prosecute for an offence five, ten
or fifteen years after it had been committed.
I took it for granted, of course, that there
was some limitation under the criminal law.
I am not ready to say whether or not there
is any precedent for such a sweeping enactment as this. There may be. Of course, you
may instance murder and one or two other
crimes, perhaps, that can be followed without limitation; but in matters like the violation of a trade-mark I wonder whether it
is good law to say there shall be no limitation.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: As a rule it
is not good law, because of the difficulty encountered by the accused, as intimated hy
my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand),
of producing evidence after many years. But
does that difficulty exist in this case? A
manufacturer is accused of placing a wrong
marking, or no marking at all, on his goods.
These goods are sold by him to a retailer,
who later sells them to a customer. It is the
customer who is muleted, the customer who
loses, and it is the customer we are seeking
to protect. Now, if after fifteen years, say,
it is found for the first time that there was
a false marking, and a man is accused, of
what is his evidcnce going to consist? He
does not have to go back to any clerks; he
is not dependent upon the life of anybody.
All that is in issue is. first. the statute which
provides what should have been done, and,
second, the article in question. The article
must be produccd. So the accused is not
handicapped at all. An offence under this
law is not a matter of doing an act the proof
of which depends on witnesses. The proof
depends only on the production of the article
sold; consequently the accused is not imperilled by the passage of time.
Right lon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Hon. Mr. DANDUDAND: In that case the
argument would be as to the marking, but I
think my right honourable friend wili find
that there are clauses in the Bill where the
question of marking is not involved. This
Bill says:
"Mount" means any part, other than the
plating of silver, of an article of silver plated
ware attached to the body of the article.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: What clause is that?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am reading
clause 1. The old section said:
"Mount' means any part, other tban the
plating of silver, of an article of silver plated
ware applied or attached to the body of the
article.
We are striking out the words "applied or."
In a suit under this clause, brought ton or
fifteen years after the offence of making a
sale has been committed, how could, the
defendant establish that the article was manufactured before this enactment became law?
It will not be easy for a person to defend
himseli when he is accused of violation of
this Act. He will have to establish that the
article was produced or manufactured prier
to the coming into force of tbis Act. If
there is no limitation, some of the other
cl'auses also. J think, will cause grave difficulty on the part of the defendant in an
action based on a sale made ten or fifteen
years earlier. I fear that in many cases the
removal of the limitation will work a hardship on the defendant.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In such a
case as my honourable friend suggests, the
duty would be on the prosecutor to prove
the time of the sale. The defendant has only
to show that the article complied with the
law at the time of the sale, as given by the
prosecutor, and no doubt the article itself
would be produced as proof. But I should
net like to say there might not be an instance
where the case of the defendant depended
on the evidence of witnesses, and be would
be placed in a precarious position on account
of mortality. Consequently J would suggest
that if the honourable gentleman so desires,
the third reading be deferred until to-morrow,
so that we may examine and see whether
there are any clauses which should be excepted and left under the old limitation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Why not wait
until Tuesday night? That would give more
time.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Very well.

F'EBRUARY 13, 1935
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The righttlhonourable gentleman might ask the department
to examine into the working of this Act.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHIEN: Yes.
The motion for third reading stands.
ELECTRICITY INSPECTION BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received fromn the House of

Commons with Bill 18, an Act to amend the
Electricity Inspection Act, 1928 (Frenchi
Version).
The Bill was read the first time.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
Bill be read a second time?
Riglit Hlon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Next sitting
of the House.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Why the next
sitting of the House? Copies of the Bill
have nat yet been distributed. Our regulations provide for forty-eight hours' notice
of motion for second reading. If there is no
necessity for hurry, why should we not follow
the rule?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Very well.
Tucsday next.
PRIVATE BILL
FIRST READING

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN introduced Bill B,
an Act respecting the Canadian Marconi
Company.
The Bill was read the first time.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: What is the object
of the Bill?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I intend to state
that an the motion for second reading. The
matter is very simple, I understand, but I
shahl be better equipped to explain it when
it comes up on Tuesday next.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I notice that
honourable members who have come from
the other House are inclined to ask for
explanations on first readings. The practice
in this Chamber has always been to explain
on the second reading.
DISTRIBUTION 0F COMMONS BILLS
On the motion to adjourn:
Hon. Mr. BELAND: Before the adjournment may I cail the attention of the right
honourable gentleman to a simple matter. It
seems to me 4that honourable members oÀthis
House should be provided with a copy of
every Bill which isintroduced into the other
House. I have in mmnd a very important

Bill, rehating to unemployment insurance,
which was introduced in another place yesterday by the Prime Minister. There was no
copy of that Bill in my mail to-day. I am
not very conversant with our rules, but is it
not custo>mary that a Bill of this kind should
be distributed to memnbers of the Senate? If
that is not the custom, it should be.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: We usually receive copies of Bis as soon as they are
availabie fromn the Printing Bureau. The
honourabie gentleman may find a copy of the
Bill to wbjdh lie has referred in his post office
box this afternoon.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I may say
to my honourabie friend that I really do nat
know what the practice is here. I was under
the impression that we did not get the bills
until they came before our House, but my
honourable friend fromn Pembroke (Hon. Mr.
White) tells me I am wrong. I shaîl hook
into the matter and give an answer tamorrow.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have just ohtained information fromn the Clerk. After the
buis have been given a first reading in the
other bouse they are distributed separately to
members of the Senate, and after third reading
they are placed on aur file. Sa we get themn
after the first reading.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: In what way are they
distributed?
Riglit Hlon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Through the
mail.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: Weli, I have nat had
a copy of that important Biil.

My understanding is that the proceedings will

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am inclined
to think there should bc a certain number of
copies printed in French. I notice that the
president of the Institute of Patent Attorneys
is a French Canadian. If the motion for concurrence passes it will be time enough at the
next meeting of the committee to decide the
number of copies to be printed in each

member there will be a proportion printed in
French.
The motion was agreed to.
IMPORTATION OF BUTTER
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. BELAND inquired of the Government:
1. What quantity of butter was imported
during the year 1934 (a) from New Zealand;
(b) from Australia?
2. What quantity was imported from the two
countries (a) by the Government; (b) by
individuals?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The answer
to the honourable gentleman's inquiry is as
follows:
1. Calendar year 1934: (a) from New Zealand, 627,108 pounds; (b) from Australia, nil.
2. During the calendar year 1934, imports
from the two countries: (a) by the Government, nil; (b) by individuals-from New Zealand, 627,108 pounds; from Australia, nil.
CANADA'S WAR POLICY
PROPOSED RESOLUTION

Hon. J. J. HUGHES rose to move the following resolution:
That in the opinion of this House, should
Canada ever again be at war with one or more
nations, she shall wage it with every ounce of
her strength in man and material power;
That the declaration of war or the beginning
of hostilities shall be followed immediately by
the mobilization and the conscription of all the
human power

and all the material wealth of

the nation;
Hon. Mr. BLACK.

That a War Cotmneil representing all the
provinces and the Government shall be formed
ant shall have supreme control of all war
activities and orders;
That said Council shall have the power to
assign every man and woman in Canada to
whatever position it thinks they are best qualified to fill, but making as few changes as
possible in the daily occupations of the people;
That the wages, salary or income for personal use or retention of no person in the
Dominion from the Governor General down,
including the offlcers of the Army, shall be
greater than the pay of the common soldier in
the field. plus a reasonable amount for
dependents;
That no money be borrowed or debts ineurred for the prosecution of the war, or for
demobilization;
That all the expenses of the war and of
leiobilization shall be met by taxation and
capital levies, so that at the end of the war
and of deniobilization the debt of the country
would be no larger than it was at the beginning
of the war.
He said: Honourable senators, there is not
much likelihood of Canada everbeingengaged
in another war, but if there were no possibility of such a calamity occurring, the resolution standing in my name would be superfluous, if not foolish.
We are a favoured people in mnny respects,
and our immunity from the dread of war is
net the least of our favours. We do not
intend, and we are not preparing, to attack
any nation in the world, and no nation intends or is preparing to attack us. Can we
ever be suficiently thankful to God for such
a position, particularly when we look abroad
and sec the nations of Europe and Asia spending more than twice as much a year in preparing for the next war as they spent in
getting ready for the last one?
When we read of all the treaties, pacts,
alliances and conventions that have been
formed by the nations to prevent war, and read
the next day that the same nations are speeding up their armament factories in order to
be ready for the next war-which may corne
from the sky with the rapidity of lightning,
sparing neither age nor sex nor condition in
its destruction,-we are appalled by the picture and are forerd to ask ourselves, if we
be Christians, wlether God has forsaken the
world or the world has abandoned God.
A week or two ago I read on the bulletin
board of the Dominion Church in this city
that the pastor would lecture or preach the
following Sunday on the subject, "Is Ontario
Sane?"
He might well have enlarged his
subject and asked if the world was sane. At
all events, speaking by and large, this at least
is certain, that man has lost all faith in his
fellow man. Nations no longer believe in the

FEBRUARY 14, 1935
hionour of nations. The most solemn pacts
and alliances are broken, or may be broken,
if advantage can be obtained by breaking
them. It was not always thus. There was a
time in the Middle Âges, or the Dark Âges, as
they are sometimes called, when, in ail the
affairs of if e, the knightiy word of kings,
princes and ruiers was taken, and couid be
taken with confidence.
1 believe it is a sound principle of Christian
doctrine that as faith in God weakens, faith
in man disappears; that faith in man is
impossible without faith in God; that a sanely ordered worid is inmpossible without faith
in God and man. As I see it, from my very
limýited point of view, the world in its national
and international relations thinks it can get
along without God, and that is the istake
of mîstakes.
The United States i its refusai to join the
League of Nations and the Worid Court of
Justice hias some argument in its faveur, but
net enough. Every nation in the world wouhd
suifer, and suifer severeiy, in another word
wnr, and it wouid be bard te imagine any
major nation keeping out of actual participation in sueh a confliet. Every man bora into
this worid has his duties and responsibilities,
and hie is not the higheet type of humanity
who tries te, evade bis duties. In ike manner every nation bas its duties and responsibilities. Humanly speaking, the United
States has the power te save or te destroy
the worid. Samson had the strength te pull
down the pillars of the Temple and bury
himseff in the ruins, but few think that Sainson's wisdom was equai te his strength. Neyertheless, we muet net overlook the contribution the great Repuiblic has made te humaaity,
even in war. Freedom aad respect for the
rights of the conquered followed its arms
wherever they went. lt wss the first nation
'n the world that did the unbeard of thing
of paying a war indomaity te a vanquished
foc for the territory it bad conquered.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Who did that?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: The United States.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGxHEN: What territory?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: The Philippine Islands.
It paid Spaia $20,000,000.
When the people of the United States make
up their minds, as they wili some time, te
join the World Court of Justice and the
League of Nations, they wiil do se in a nsanner
worthy of themselves. The recent accord
entered into, in respect to aerial warfare, by
our Motherlands, Great Britaia and France,

49

wvhich wîll likeiy be joined by Itaiy, Germaay
and the other nations of Europe, must gladden
the hearts of men of good-will everywhere. It
may, under God, be the turning point in
worid aifairs, and it certainiy would be if the
full partnership of America were obtained;
but whatever our seuthern friends may do,
Europe, with God, can save itself.
The resolution which I bave the honour te
meve means much. The giory, the pride and
the profit should have been taken eut of war
long ago; but it is never tee late te mend.
To me it seems te be a monstrous thing that
in war, or in any other conceivable circumstance, preperty shouid be regarded as
more sacred than human life. In my opinion,
net ahl the weaith of Canada, ner all the
-wealth of the world,--is equal in value te one
human life. Yet there may he such a thing
as a righteous war, a wa r in which men weuld
be in duty beund te offer their lives. Wbile i
the last war in which we were engaged some
me a were conscripted at 81.10 a day te fight
in the trenches, where fiitb and misery and
death prevaiied, others were ceaxed te werk
in the factories or were ailowed te follow
their ordinary occupations at many dollars a
day. Why, 1 even read of a business cencera
making five millioas of dollars eut of oae
bacon centract during the War, then iavesting the thousands aad the millions se made i
high-interest-bearing, nea-taxabie, non-callable
bonds, with the payment of which we are stili
struggiing. And i these respects Canada was
ne worse than, if as bad as, any of the other
participating nations. If there is any justice
in that kind of tbing, I have ne conception of
what justice means.
War has become revelutienized. It ie te be
ne longer confined te professional soidiers.
Women and chiidren, the aged and the sick are
te be its chief victims in future. Some men
are endowed with greater itellectuai strength
than others, and are given better eppertuaities
for developing this strength. If these men

what we can to see that there shall never

countries, that is, the countries in which they
still have a voice in the management of national affairs, would unite in declaring that
should the demon of war ever again visit
them all would bear alike its horrors and its
burdens, I believe that such a general resolve
on the part of the masses-and surely the
classes as well-might do much to rid the earth
of this monstrous evil. This is my prayer, at

He said: Honourable senators, there are on
the Order Paper five of these motions for the
approval of certain draft conventions. I think
I can safely say that there is no dispute as to
the wisdorn of adopting the first three, inasmuch as there is no issue in the law or in
point of jurisdiction as far as they are concerned. I do not think the merits of the
conventions t)hemselves are in issue. They, of

course, are really what we are adopting and
approving, but as far as I have learned no
.bonourable senator takes exception to them.
I suggest, then, that any debate on this subject, which I hope will be illuminating and
interesting, may be reserved until we come
to the fourth or fifth convention.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the first three.

We may adopt

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would simply
refer to the first three draft conventions, which
are on our Order Paper. I have wondered why
they were not approved at an earlier date, for
the first was adopted in 1926, the second in
1929, and the third in 1932. I may say as to
the first two i am advised that the reason for
delay in bringing them to Parliament was that

MEIGHEN.

up to 1930, when the Statute of Westminster
was enacted, the British Merchant Shipping
Act applied to Canada. The law is now embodied in our Shipping Act, which was passed
last year, but has not yet been proclaimed.
They now come under federal jurisdiction, and
for tiis reason there is no objection under
that head.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: So, practically
speaking, Canada by adopting a certain policy

Right Hon. Mr.,MEIGHEN: I do not think
there was any reason for earlier introduction.
The motion was agreed to.

Article 15.-The French and English texts of
this convention shall both be authentie.
And that this House do approve of the same.
Hon. R. DANDURAND: I think the right
honourable leader stated that we had already
legislated on this matter under the criminal
law.
Rigit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Lord's
Day Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: When that Act
came before the Senate I had something te do
with resisting some of its provisions, but we
managed to add numcrous amendments which
resulted in making the legislation satisfactory
throughout the length and breadth of the country. When this convention reached Ottawa,
Geneva was officially informed by an Order in
Council dated the 27th of June, 1922, that we
had already legislated to the same end.
Hon. RODOLPHE LEMIEUX: Honourable
members, perhaps it would be well to mention
that even thougi the Lord's Day Act was
passed by the Federal Parliament, it contained
a provision which placed the kernel of the
whole matter in the hands of the attorneysgeneral of the provinces. No action could be
taken in court without the fiat of the attorneygeneral of the province in which the alleged
infraction occurred.
This shows that to a
large extent the principle underlying the
British North America Act is respect for the
views held by the various provinces. I remember that when the Lord's Day Bill was introduced in the House of Commons and in thi
House representatives of certain provinces
strongly upheld strict Stnday observance,
whilst the people of the province of Quebec

FEBRUARY 19, 1935
were desirous of doing on Sunday what their
forefathers had dýonc before them-that is,
afler service at the church, to enioy quietly
some little pleasure. It was because of the
diifferent practices in the different provinces
that Parliament provided no action could be
taken undier the law unless the appyroval of
the attorney-general of the province in question had first been obtained.
I must say that that law had the effeet of
broadening the view in provinces where Sunday observance had always been sternly
adhered to. Until two or three years ago I
was a resident of Ottawa, and on Sundays 1
used to see numbers of my friends crossing
the Ottawa river to enjoy a littie game of
golf, which was denied them on this side of
the river. That law has made Sunday more
elastie.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Nous avons changé
tout cela.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: I rose merely to point
out to the right honourable leader that this
special provision in the Lord's Day Act shows
that the intentions of the framers of our Constitution were that attention should be paid to
the peculiar views--and may I say prejudices?
-of the various provinces.
Rîght Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That is evolution.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIIIKN: Honoura'b½- memnbtrs, I have no doubt at all that
the spirit aod malter of the Lord's Day Act
are vcry much as deflned by the hionourable
senator wlio hais just sat down. 1 want tc0 use
the occasion only to say a few words as 10 the
significance of the passiog of that Act in~ relation to the prob!em which is now before us,
and e.specially in relation to the next resolution. The honourable senator who leads the
other side (Hon. :Mr. Dandurand) has stated
that although this draft convention was bel ore
the Goverument of Cana-da shortly af 1er it
was issued from the general conference of the
International Labour Organization of the
League of Nations, il was not submitted for
approval by Parliament, and subsequent ratification, because of the faet that we already
had on our Statute (Book a law going as far
as this draft convention called upon us 10 go.
1 hope honourable mnembers have cauaght the
effeet of that statement by the honouTable
senator. The reason we were not asked to,
approve this draft convention respecting a
weekly day of rest was that we already had in
effect the Lord's Day Act, which went so0 far
in providing a weeklýy day of rest, and in other
requirements, as the draft convention ilseif
went. This Lord's Day Act has been on our

59

Statute Book for many years, and I cail attention to the fact that in its essence and constitutional features il takes the form and bas
all the lineaments of the forty--eigbt-bour week
draft convention.
In a word, for years the Dominion has been
legislating under ils trade and commerce jurisdiction, or under sucb other jurisdiction as
honourable members may seek as a basis for
this legisiation. Il is not criminal legisiation.
It may be quasi criminal legislation, but no
one can read the termis of this convention,
which. as the honourabie member says, are
already complied with in our Lord's Day Act,
and say tbat it is criminal legislation and that
our right 10 pass it depends upon clauses in
the British North America Act wbich give us
jurisdiction in criminal law. I should say without further study-for my tboughb bias been
given chiefly to bbe next Tesolution-that the
base of our Lord's Day Act jurisdliction is the
trade and commerce provision in section 91
of the British North America Act. Wben we
are dealing with trade and commerce in a
broad and general way-not with merely local
and individual rights in trade and commerce,
but witb the subjeet in ils relation 10 the
whole Dominion-our jurisdiction is unchallenged. And that is the jurisd'iction we are
exercising biere now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Under clause 91.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIOHEN: Under section
91, bbchtrade and commerce section. And if
there were no other rock upon whicb at Ibis
time we could put our feet in dealing witb -the
subsequent resolution, we have a sufficiently
soun(l one righit there, namnely, that upon
which we rested when the Lord's Day Act was
passed. So far as I can recall, the Act was
once ohalleoged, but not with respect 10 ils
general features. Consequently Ihose who say
that for xnany years we have validly legislated
in respect of a weekly day of rest are flot in a
very strong position when tbey urge now that
we cannot legislate in respect of the hours of
work per day. Only 10 empliasize this do I
rise at the moment.
Hon. Mr. DAINDURAND: Do I undeTstand
from the remarks of my right bonourable
friand that with respect to the convention
whîcb is before us, he dlaims that this Parliament could legisiate to fix an eight-hour day
or a forty-eight-hour week?
Ri-ght Hon. Mr. IMEIGiHEN: I purpose s0
to argue. I only say now that the fact of
our having legislated with respect 10 a weekly
day of rest is very strong fortification for the
position that, irrespectàdve entireiy of treaty
obligations and of our rights founded thereon,

certain skeleton remarks in its support on
Wednesday last, and I hope to speak later
in the dabate, when I have the rîght to reply.
I tbink the remarks I made on Wednesday
f orm a basis, and constitute pretty completely.
though flot in as full detail as I should like.
the argument I intend to make. I suggest
that any others wbo care to speak sbould do
so now. There is not much use in my speaking three times on this subjeet.
HonourHon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
able members of the Sanata, the draft convention which is now offered to us covers
both the federal and the provincial fields. As
will be seen from the remarks that I shall
address to the Chamber, it can apply to
federal works, to territories under federal
control and to faderaI employees,' and as
a matter of fact legislation to that effeet has
been passed by this Parliament.
Consequently I would not demur to the presentation to us of this draft convention if it
were not for the fact that the intention has
been expressed to use it as a basis for what
I regard as an invasion of provincial jurisdiction.
This draft convention was the first one
passed by the Washington Labour Conference,
which comprised employers and employees
of the nations adhering to the League of
Nations and to the International Labour

Organization. The question may well be
asked: wby is it that the federal authorities
have waited sixteen years befora bringing
this convention to Parliament? I think the
answar is obvious. The reason is that up to
the lst of January of this year it was generally-I should say unanimously-recognizad
that it covered a provincial matter.
The first to express an opinion on this very
draft convention and to state in unmistakable
terms that it belonged to provincial jurisdiction was my right honourable friend himself (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), whose Government, in November, 1920, passed P.C

63

3722, which was based on a recommendation
brought to Council by the then Minister of
Justice, the Right Hon. Mr. Doherty, a
gentleman who was in a particularly favour.
able position to be familiar with the whole
machinery of the League of Nations and the
International Labour Office, as it was he who
with the authorization of bis Government,
had signed the Treaty of Versailles in conjunction with Mr. Arthur Sifton, then a
minister in the Government. That Order in
Council, which, as I have said, emanated from
the Government of my right honourable
friend, speaks for itself. It reads as folîows:
The Minister further states that he is of

opinion that the provisions of the labour part
of the Treaty of Versailles do flot impose any
obligation on the Dominion of Canada to enact
into law the different; draft conventions or
recominendations w-hieh may froin time to time
be adopted by the conference. The obligation
as set forth is simply in the nature of an
undcrtaking on t.he part of each member within
the period of one year at mogt f rom the elosing
of the session of the conference, or if it is
impossible owing to exceptional circumstances
to do go within a per-iod of one year, then at
the earliest practicable moment, and in any case
not later than eighteen months from the closing:
of the conference "to bring the recommendations
or draft conventions before the authority or
authorities within whose competence the matter
lies&for the eobactment of legislation or other
action."ý The treaty engagement being of this
character, it is not such as to justify legislation
on the part of Parliament under the aut-hority
of section 132 of the British North America
Act, 1867, to give effect to any of the proposals
of the said drafc conventions and recommendations, which must be held, as between the
Dominion and the provinces, to ha within the
legislative competence of the latter. The Government's obligation will, in the opinion of the
Minister, be fully carried out if the different
conventions and recommendations are brought
before the competent authority, Dominion or
provincial, accordingly as it may appear, having
regard to the scope and objects, the true nature
and character of the legislation required to give
effect to the proposaIs of the conventions and
reconimendations respectively, that they fal
nithin the legislative conipetence of the one or
the ,jther.
A debate, in wbich my right honourable
friend participated, took place in the Bouse
of Commons over the advisability of submitting the question to the Supreme Court,
and wjth the unanimous approval of the
Commons the whole subject was referred to
that Court. I may say that the right honourable gentleman concurred in the idea that
it was a provincial matter, and so expressed
himself.
Here are the questions which were put to
the Supreme Court with the full conncurrene
of the House of Commons. The first question was:

SENATE
What is the nature of the obligation of the
Dominion of Canada as a iemiber of the International Labour Conference. under the provisions of the labour part (Part XIII) of the
'ieasty of Versailles and of the corresponding
provisions of the other treaties of peace, with
relation to such draft conventions and recomimendations

as

may

be

from

time

to

time

adopted by the said conference under the
auitlority of and pursuant to the aforesaid
provisions?
The answer to the first question was:
Tie obligation is simply in the nature of
an undertaking to bring the recommendation
or draft convention before the authority or
autiorities within whose eonpetence the matter
lies, for the enactment of legislation or other
action.
The second question was:
Are the legislatures of the provinces the
authorities within whose competence the subject-natter of the said draft convention (copy
of which is herewith submitted) in whole or in
part lies and before whom such draft convention should le brougbt, under the provisions of
Article 405 of the treaty of peace with
Germany, for the enactment of legislation or
other action?
The answer was:
Yes, in part.
The third question was:
If the subject-matter of the said draft convention be, in part only. within the conpetence
of the legislatures of the provinces, then in
what particular or particulars, or to what
extent. is the subject-matter of the draft convention within the coipetence of the legislatures?
To this question the answer of the Supreme
Court was:
The subject-matter is generally within the
conpetence of the legislatures of the provinces,
but the authority vested in these legislatures
does not enable them to give ithe force of law
to provisions such as those eontained in the
draft convention in relation to servants of the
Dominion Governient, or to legislate for those
parts of Canada which are not within the
bouindaries of a province.

The fourth question was:
If the subject-matter of the said draft convention be, in part only, within the competence
of the legislatures of the provinces, then in
what particular or particulars, or to what
extent, is the subject-matter of the draft convention within the competence of the Parliament of Canada?

And to that question the answer was:
The Parliament of Canada has exclusive
legislative authority in those parts cf Canada
not within the bioundaries of any province. and
also upon the subjects deailt with in the draft
convention in relation to the servants of the
Dominion Goverînment.
lion.

Mr.

DANDURAND.

As will be observed, the Supreme Court
supports the opinion of the right honourable
gentlemanssi,
as cxpresed in the Order in Council I have just read, and it says:
The obligation is sinply in the nature of an
und'ertaking to bring the recommendation or
draft convention before the authority or
authorities within whose conspetence the matter
lies, for the enactment of legislation or other
action.
This was the unchallenged interpretation of
the subject-matter of this convention and of
the duties whics lay upon the federal authorities.
As I have said, my right honourable friend
(Riglht Hon. Mr. Meighen) was the first to
express this opinion. The last person to express the same opinion-and lae did so in
terms that were lucid-was the present Prime
Minister of Canada, who, on the 31st of
August, 1934. wrote a letter to the premiers
of the provinces in the following terms:
As I indicated at the meeting with the
provincial premiers in July last, it is my purpose to call a conference of representatives of
the governments of all the provinces tc meet
at Ottawa before the end of ,the year to discuss
with the Federal Government the following
questions and such other matters ýas may be
placed upon the agenda after I have been
advised of the views of the premiers of the
several provinces:
1. What steps cen be taken to reduce the
evils of duplicate taxation and provide a more
logical allocation of sources of revenue now
available to Dominion and provinces?
2. Are the provinces prepared to surrender
their exclusive jurisdiction over legislation
dealing with such social probleims as old age
pensions, unemployment and social insurance,
hours and conditions for work, minimum wages,
etc.. to the Dominion Parliament? If so, on
what ternis and conditions?
3. Is it desirable to endeavour more clearly
to define the respective jurisdiction of the
Dominion Parlianent and provincial legislatures with respect to health and agricultural
and other natters in which there is a duplication of effort by federal and provincial authorities?
Although I an net an English scholar, I
think these expressions can call for no two
interpretations.
They are a complete admission by the Prime Minister of this country.
He asks the provinces if they will surrender
their exclusive jurisdiction upon certain matters, one of which covers the present convention, and if so, on what terms and conditions.
I believe the Prime Minister is too good a
negotiator to have made such a statement as
that if he had any doubt as to the jurisdiction of the provinces in the matters which
ie enumerated, because by recognizing their
exclusive jurisdiction in these matters he
would clearly be giving his whole case away.

FEBRUARY 19, 1935
But in the month of December the right
honourable the Prime Minister changed his
attitude and recalled the conference, which
had been postponed. He apparently had seen
new light. When he got on the road to
Damascus, I do not know. The oracle had
spoken-late, it is true. The Prime Minister,
who in August fully recognized the rights of
the provinces in certain matters, just as the
right honourable leader of this House had
recognized them, changed his mind.
And
the right honourable leader of this House
has done likewise, for we heard himi say a
few moments ago that the Parliament of
Canada could legislate on the matters which
are dealt with in the present convention. It
goes to show that we should never claim
infallibility for ourselves-that we are all apt
to err.
The question now is, whiclh opinion of my
right honourable friend is the right one? Is
it his opinion of 1920, when he sent these
draft conventions in the form of recommendations to the provinces, or his opinion of today, when lie claims the Federal Parliament
bas full jurisdiction in the matter? Late it
is that the country is informed that our
national Constitution, as formerly interpreted,
has been considerably altered or transformed
by two judgments of the Privy Council-one
of the 22nd of October, 1931, with respect to
aeronautics, and the other, of the 9th of
February, 1932, with respect to wireless and
radio broadcasting. Honourable members will
notice it took three years for the light which
emanated from the Privy Council to reacli
the present Government, for as recently as
last year the Prime Minister believed that
the Constitution had not been altered in the
least; that section 92 of the British North
America Act, which gives certain powers to
the provinces, was still intact.
The Privy Council's decision in the aeronauties case was based upon an interpretation
of sections 91, 92 and 132 of the British North
America Act. I have read the decision, but
I can find no new doctrine whatever in it.
Sections 91 and 92 are so well known by all
honourable members that I will not take the
time to read them here, but section 132 has
not been brought to our attention so often.
It reads:
The Parliament and Government of Canada
shall have all powers necessary or proper for
performing the obligations of Canada or any
province thereof, as part of the British Empire,
towards foreign countries, arising under treaties
between the Empire and such foreign countries.
I will now read from the judgment of Lord
Chancellor Sankey:

65

The Supreme Court of Canada has decided
the question in its several branches adversely
to the claims of the Dominion, and has held in
effect that while the Dominion has a considerable field of jurisdiction in the matter under
varions heads of section 91 of the British North
America Act, 1867, there is also a local field
of jurisdiction for the provinces, and that the
Dominion jurisdiction does not extend so far
as to permit it to deal with the subjeot in the
broad way in which it has attempted to deal
with it in the legislation under consideration.
During the sittings of the Peace Conference
in Paris, at the close of the European war, a
convention relating to the regulation of aerial
navigation, dated the 13th October, 1919, was
drawn up by a commission constituted by the
Supreme Council of the Peace Conference. That
convention was signed by the representatives
of the allied and associated powers, ineluding
Canada, and was ratified by His Majesty on
behalf of the British Empire on the lst June,
1922. It is now in force between the British
Empire and seventeen other states.
With a view to performing lier obligations
as part of the British Empire under this convention, which was then in course of preparation, the Parliament of Canada enacted the
Air Board Act, c. 11, Statutes of Canada 1919
(first session), which, with an amendeent
thereto, was consolidated in the Revised
Statutes of Canada, 1927, under the title of the
Aeronautics Act, c. 3. It is to be noted, however, that the Act does not by reason of its
reproduction in the Revised Statutes take effect
as a new law. The Governor General in
Council, on the 31st December, 1919, pursuant
to the Air Board Act, issued detailed "Air
Regulations" which, with certain amendments,
are now in force. By the National Defence
Act, 1922, the Minister of National Defence
thereafter exercised the duties and functions of
the air board.
The determnination of these questions depends
upon the true construction of sections 91, 92
and 132 of the British North America Act.
Section 132 provides as follows.
That is the section I read a few moments
ago.
It is not necessary to set out at length the
familiar sections 91 and 92, which deal with the
distribution of legislative powers. Section 91
tabulates the subjects to be dealt with by the
Dominion, and section 92 the subjects to be
dealt with exclusively by the provincial legislatures, but it will not be forgotten that section 91, in addition, authorizes the King by and
with the advice and consent of the Senate and
House of Commons of Canada to make laws
for the peace, order and good government of ,
Canada in relation to all matters not coming
within the classes of subjects by this Act
assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the
provinces, and further provides that any matter
coming within 'any of the classes of subjects
enumerated in the section shall not be deemed to
come within the classes of matters of a local
and private nature comprised in the enumeration of classes of subjects assigned by section 92
exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces.
The four questions addressed to the court are
as follows.

They dealt with the right of the Dominion
Parliament to enact that legislation.
With regard to sections 91 and 92 the cases
which have been decided on the provisions of
these sections ýare legion. Many inquests have
been held upon them, and nany great lawyers
have from time to time dissected them.
Under our system, decid'ed cases effectively
construe the words of an Act of Parliament and
establislied

principles

and

rules

whereby

its

scope and effect may be interpreted. But there
is always a danger that in the course of this
process the ternis of the statute may come to be
unduly extended and attention nay be diverted
from what bas been enacted to what bas been
judically said abolit the enactment.
To borrow an analogy; there may be a range
of sixty colours, each of which is so little
different from its neighbouîr that it is difficult
to make any distinction between the two, and

yet at the one end of the range the colour may
be white, and at the other end of the range
black.

Great care must therefore be taken to

consider each decision in the light of the circumstances of the case in view of which it

was

which was a great constitutional charter,

and

pronouncedi, especially in the interpretation of
an Act such as the British North America Act,
not to allow general phrases to obscure the

underlying object of the Act, which was to
establish a system of government upon essentially federal principles. Useful as decided cases
are, it is always advisable to get back to the
words of the Act itself and te remember the
object with which it was passed. . . .
Inasmuch as the Act embodies a compromise
under which the original provinces agreed te
federate, it is important to keep in mind' that
the preservation of the rights of minorities was
a condition on which such minorities entered
into the federation. and the foundation upon
which the whole structure was subsequently
The process of interpretation as the

years go on ought not to be allowed to dim
or to whittle down the provisions of the
original contract upon which the federation
was founded, nor is it legitimate that any
judicial construction of the provisions of sections 91 and 92 should enforce a new and a
different contract upon the federating bodies.
But while the courts should be jealous in
upholfing the charter of the provinces as
enacted in section 92. it must no less be borne

in mind that the real object of the Act was to
give the central Governnent those bigh funetions and alnost sovereign powers by which
uniformity of legislation iniglit bc secured on

all questions which were of conmnon concern to
all the provinces as niembers of a constituent
whole.
It is therefore obvions that the Dominion
Parlianient. in order duly and fully to "performi
the obligations of Canada or of any province
thereof" under the convention, must make pro-

vision for a great variety of subjects.

Indeed,

the terms of the convention include almost every

conceivable matter relating to aerial navigation, and we think that the Dominion Parliament not only bas the right, but also the
obligation, te provide by statute and by regu-

lation that the ternis of the convention shall
be duly carried out. With regard to some of
then no doubt it would appear to be clear that
the Dominion has power to legislate, for
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

example, under section 91, subsection 2, for
the regulation of trade and commerce, and
under subsection 5, for the postal services,
but it is net necessary for the Dominion to
piece together its powers under section 91 in
an endeavour to render them co-extensive with
its duty under the convention when section 132
confers upon it full power to do all that is
legislatively necessary for the purpose.
It must net be forgotten that section 132
imposes upon the provinces, as well as upon
the whole of Canada, as part of the British
Empire, obligations arising under treaties between the Empire and foreign countries; so
that whatever may be the conditions prevailing and whatever the division of jurisdiction
between the provinces and the Dominion.
when a treaty has to be enforced, section
132 supersedes the authority of the Dominion
as well as of the provinces.
Then the Lord Chancellor summed up the
judgment in these words:
To sun up, having regard (a) to the ternis
of section 132; (b) to the ternis of the convention, which covers almost every conceivable
matter relating te aerial navigation; and (c)
to the fact that further legislative powers in
relation to aerial navigation reside in the Parliament of Canada by virtue of section 91,
subseotions 2, 5, and 7, it would appear
that substantially the whole field of legislation in regard te aerial navigation belongs to
the Dominion. There may be a small portion
of the field which is net by virtue of specific
words in the British North America Act
vested in the Dominion; but neither is it
vested by specific words in the provinces. As
to such small portion it appears to the board
that it must necessarily belong to the Dominion
under its power to make laws for the peace,
order and good government of Canada. Further,
their lordships are influenced by the facts that
the subject of aerial navigation and the fulfilment of Canadian obligations under section 132
are matters of national interest and inportance; and that aerial navigation is a class of
subject which bas attained such dimensions as
to affect the body politic of the Dominion.
I need only read the opening lines of setion 91, to which reference is made by His
Lordship, and whiclh deals with the powers
of this Parliament:
It shall bc lawful for the Queen, by and ith
the advice and consent of the Senate and House
of Commons, to iake laws for the peace, order,
and good government of Canada, in relation
to ail matters not coming within the classes
of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to
the legislatures of the provinces.
The Lord Chancellor begins bis judgmnî ut
h stating that some matters do not expe--y
fall within section 91, neither are they to
be found in section 92. Then he directs attention to the additional authority contained in
section 91. that Parliament may "make laws
for the peace. order and good goverenmcut oi
Canada in relation to all matters not coming
within the cla-sse s of subjects by this A;

FEBRUARY 19, 1935
assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the
provinces." I think anyone who reads the
judgment will come to the conclusion which
I have reached, that the judgment is based
purely and simply upon a fair interpretation
of the division of powers between- the provinces and the Dominion, and also upon section 132, which binds the federal authority
to perform treaty obligations of Canada towards foreign countries when the treaty
emanates from the British Empire. I think
I shall be able to establish that we are under
no such obligation with respect to this convention.
Now as to the radio case. Again we are
dealing with a convention binding Canada. It
is not a convention under section 132, because it does not emanate from Great Britain;
it is a convention made by Canada herself.
The convention concerns wireless and radio
broadcasting. These subjects are. not expressly mentioned in sections 91 and 92, yet in
their main aspects they are linked with the
subjeets covered by section 91. The province claimed the residue under property and
civil rights, although acknowledging that in
most instances some or most of the classes
of subjects were germane to those enumerated
in section 91.
The judgment of the Privy Council was
delivered by Lord Dunedin. Ater referring
to the aeronautics case be proceeds:
And it is said with trutlh that, while as

regards aviation there was a treaty, the convention here is not a treaty between the Empire

as such and foreign countries, for Great Britain

does not sign as representing the colonies and
Dominions. She only confirme the assent which
had been signified by the colonies and Dominions who were separately represented at
the meetings which drafted the convention.
But while this is so, the aviation case in
their lordships' judgment cannot be put on one
side. Counsel for the province felt this and
sought to avoid any general deduction by
admitting that many of the things provided by
the convention and the regulations thereof fell
within various special heads of section 91. For
example, provisions as to beacon signais he
would refer to article 10 of section 91-navigation and shipping. It is unnecessary to multiply
instances, because the real point to be considered is this manner of dea-ling with the subject.
In other words, the argument of the province
cornes to this: Go through all the stipulations
of the convention and each one you can pick
out which fairly falls within one of the enumerated heads of section 91, that can be held to
be appropriate for Dominion legislation; but
the residue belongs to the province under the
head either of article 13 of section 92-property and civil rights, or article 16--matters of
a merely local or private nature in the province. Their lordships cannot agree that the
matter should be so dealt with. Canada as a
Dominion is one of the signatories to the convention. In a question with foreign powers the
persons who might infringe some of the stipu92584,1

67

lations in the convention would not be the
Dominion of Canada as a whole but would be
individual persons residing in Canada. These
persons muet, so to speak, be kept in order by
legislation and the only legislation that can deal
with them all at once is Dominion legielation.
This idea of Canada as a Dominion being bound.
by a convention equivalent to a treaty with
foreign powers was quite unthought of in 1867.
It is the outeome of the gradual development
of the position of Canada vis-à-vis to the
mother country Great Britain, which is found
in these later days expressed in the Statute
of Westminster. It is not therefore to be
expected that such a matter should be dealt
with in explicit worde in either section 91 or
section 92. The only class of treaty which
would bind Canada was thought of as a treaty
by Great Britain, and that was provided for
by section 132.
Being, therefore, not mentioned explicitly in either section 91 or section
92, such legislation falls within the general
words at the opening of section 91 which
assigned to the Government of the Dominion the
power to make laws "for the peace, order and
good government of Oanada in relation to all
matters not coming within the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the
legislatures of the provinces." In fine, though
agreeing that the convention was not such a
treaty as is defined in section 132, thieir lordships think that it comes to the same thing.
On the Llth August, 1927, the Privy Councit
of Canada, with the approval of the Governor
General, chose a body to attend the meeting
of all the powers to settle international agreements as ta wireless.
The Canadian body
attended and took part in deliberations. The
deliberations ended in the convention with general regulations appended being signed at Washington on the 25th November, 1927, by the
representatives of all the powers who had takenî
part in the conference, and this convention was
ratified by the Canadian Government on the
12th July, 1928. The result is in their lordships' opinion clear. It is Canada as a whole
which is anenable to the other powers for the
proper carrying out of the convention; and to
prevent individuals in Canada infringing the
stipulations of the convention it is necessary
that the Dominion should pass legielation which
should apply to al the dwellers in Canada.
The judgment declares that the subjectmatter was new. Wireless and radio broadcasting were unknown in 1867, and of course
are not to be found either in section 91 or
section 92. Consequently His Lordship applies
the general powers contained in the first
part of section 91. This does not do violence
to the powers of the provinces as contained
in section 92, since those powers were not
affected. The judgment, I believe, cannot
be taken exception to by the most ardent
provincialist in this Chamber or outside.
But this is not the whole of the judgment.
The province claimed that wireless and radio
broadcasting could be local, and that anything of a local nature belonged to provincial
jurisdiction. But the learned judge answered
that section 92 contained exceptions to the
provincial jurisdiction over local works and

SENATE

68

undlertakings. For instance, paragraph 10 of
the section:
Local works and undertakings other than
such as are of the following classes:
(a) Lines of steam or other ships, railways,
canais telegraphs, and other works and undertaikings connecting the province vith any other
or others of the provinces, or extend ing beyond
the lii]mits of the province.
The judgment points out that although you
may have a radio receiver within the province, there must be a transmitter, which may
be operated from any other province or from
a foreign country. So if there was any
analogy to be found in the question of telegraphs, the conclusion would bo in faveur of
the exception which is made in clause 10,
wherein it is stated that "telegraphs, and
other works and undertakings connecting the
province with any other or others ai the
provinces, or extending beyond the limits of
the province," belong to the federal authority.
I believe that I arn right in asserting that this
finding of Lord Dunedin in no wise whittles
kown any of the riglts of the provinces as
embodied in section 92. His Lordship applies
the general powers which are to be found in
the opening part of section 91.
But that opinion goes somewhat further.
It seems to adapt section 132 to the new
status of the Dominion under the Statute of
Westminster. Canada as a wbole is amenable to foreign powers under that convention,
the judgment declares, because, first, it is
a convention that cavers matters which are
not ta be found under section 91 or 92, and
which know no frontiers, either interprovincial
or international.
Are we justified in concluding that these
pronouncements have in the least modified our
Constitution in such a way as ta give the
Dominion the right to make treaties concerning powers exclusively assigned ta the
provinces, and thereby to annex those powers
unto itself? Section 132 was issposed upon
the provinces of Canasi for tlie purpose of
protecting treaties macle by Great Britain.
The provinces were on a parity with the
Dominion as reagards the obligation to respect
tis-e

treaties:

the provincs .

wil

s thcs

Dominion, had to subit to the exigencies
of that section. Now that authority is gone.
Great Britain no longer legislates as contracis
for Canada, unless Canada decides ta join
Great Britain in legislating or contracting.
Great Britain could claims authority and by
treaty or convention arbitrarilv invade the
provincial field; but can the Dominion of
Canada claim that same authority, and by
treaty or convention arbitrarily invade the
provincial field because the subject-matter
of general interest to the whole

ILis. Mr. DANDURAND.

Dominion? That it can is one of the arguments advanced. My answer is that most
questions are of general interest. There are
in this country those who advocate national
education-we have heard their voices raised
even in this very Chamber, and there are
others who favour legislative union.
In the matter of radio, as well as in the
matter of

aeronautics, we

were

bound

by

treaty or convention. Are we to-day in the
presence of a treaty or convention? Clearly
and certainly we are not. This is a draft
convention. What is its origin? It had its
origin in the Treaty of Versailles, article 23,
and I draw the attention of honourable members of this Chamber to the first part of
that article, because it has been alleged that,
inasmuch as we have signed that treaty, anything flowing from it, and especially from
the International Labour Organization and
its conferences, becomes a part of our solemn
obligation undertaken in Paris in 1919. Here
is what article 23 says:
Subject to and in accordance w-ith the provisions of international conventions existing or
hereafter to bo agreed upon, the Members of
the League:
(a) will endeavour to secuire and maintain
fair and humane conditions of labour for men,
swomien and children, both in tieir own countries and in all countries to whieh their commereial and industrial relations extend, and for
that purpose will establish and maintain the
nseces-y international organizations;
(b) undertake ta secure just treatment of
the native inhabitants of territories under
their control;
(c) will entrust the League with the general
supervision over the execution of agreements
with regard to the trafBc in wonsen and
children, and the traffic in opium and other
dangerous drugs;

Ithe

League w-ith the general
(d) will entrust
supervision of the trade in arms andi anmnition w ith the countries in whici the control af this traffic is necessary in the cosmmon
interest;
(e) will smake provisison to secure and maintain freedom of communications and of transit
and equitable treatmsent for the commerce of
all ssesbsers of the Leagse. In this connection,
the special necessities of the regions devastated
during the war of 1914-1918 salisl be borne in
mind:
(f) will endeavour to take steps in imatters
of intornational concern for the prevention and
control of disease.
I would point out that these are all matters
that concern us, that bind us, but that they
are "suîbject te and in accordance with the
provisions of international conventions existing or hereafter to be agreed upon. I contend that this draft convention was nat an
international convention eixsting in 1919, and
it is net one to-day. It is what they call
in French a projet de convention-a draft
convention-to be submitted to the League
of Nations.

FEBRUARY 19, 1935
Now, Part XIII of the Treaty of Peace
deals with labour. It is a magnificent instrument, which we all should admire and
strive to support. It is the Magna Charta
of labour. I draw the attention of honourable senators to the matters covered by the
preamble, which reads as follows:
Whereas the League of Nations has for its
object the establishment of universal peace,
-and such a peace can be established only if it
is based on social justice;
And whereas conditions of labour exist involving such injustice, hardship and privation
to large numbers of people as te produce
unrest so great that the peace and harmony
of the world are imperilled; and an improvement of those conditions is urgently required;
as, for example, by the regulation of the
hours of work, including the establishment of
a maximum working day and week, the regulation of the labour supply, the prevention of
unemployment, the provision of an adequate
living wage, the protection of the worker
against sickness, disease and injury arising out
cf his employment, the protection of children,
young persons and women, provision for old
age and injury, protection of the înterests of
workers when employed in countries other than
their own, recognition of the principle of
freedom of association, the organization of
vocational and teclinical education and other
measures;
Whereas also the failure of any nation te
adopt humane conditions of labour is an obstacle
in the way of other nations which desire te
improve the conditions in their own countries;
The high contracting parties, moved by
sentiments of justice and humanity, as well as
by the desire te secure the permanent peace
of the world, agree te the following:
A permanent organization is hereby established for the promotion of the objects set
forth in the preamble.
The original members of the League of
Nations shall be the original members of this
organization, and hereafter membership in the
League of Nations shall carry with it membership of the said organizatiop.
The permanent organization shall consist of:
(1) a general conference of representatives
of the members and,
(2) an International Labour Office controlled
by the governing body described in Article 393.
The procedure for the conferences that
are to take place is to be found in article 405.
I mention' this because it is from these conferences that the draft conventions and
recommendations that are made to the
varions adhering nations flow.
When the Conference bas decided on the
adoption of proposals with regard te an item
in the agenda, it will rest with the Conference
te determine whether these proposals shall take
the ferme: (a) of a recommendation to be submitted te the Members for consideration with
a view te effect being given to it by national
legislation or otherwise, or (b) of a draft international convention for ratification by the
Members.

69

In either case a majority of two-thirds of
the votes cast by the delegates present will be
necessary on the final vote for the adoption of
the recommendation or draft convention, as the
case may be, by the Conference.
In framing any recommendation or draft
convention of general application the Conference shall have due regard te those countriese
in which climatic conditions, the imperfect.
development of industrial organization or otherspecial circumstances make the industrial conditions substantially different and shall suggest
the modifications, if any, which it considers may
he required to meet the case of such countries.
A copy of the recommendation or draft convention shall be authenticated by the signature
of the President of the Conference and of the.
Director and shall be deposited with the.
Secretary-General of the League of Nations,
The Secretary-General will communicate a certified copy of the recommendation or draft
convention te each of the Members,
These are the important clauses:
Each of the Members undertakes that it will,
within the period of one year at most from the
closing of the session of the Conference, or
if it is impossible owing to exceptional circumstances to do se within the period of one year,
then at the earliest practicable moment and in
no case later than eighteen months from the
closing of the session of the Conference, bring
the recommendation or draft convention before
the authority or authorities within whose comapetence the matter lies, for the enactment of
legislation or other action.
In the case of a recommendation, the Members will inform the Secretary-General of theaction taken.
Ir rne 2ase of a draft convention, the Member will, if it obtains the consent of the
authority or authorities within whose conpetence the matter lies, communicate the formai
ratification of the convention to the SecretaryGeneral and wiil take such action as may be
necessary te make effective the provisions of
such convention.
If on a recommendation no legislative or
other action is taken te make a recommendation
effective, or if the draft convention fails te
obtain the consent of the authority or authorities within whose competence the matter lies,
no further obligation shall rest upon the
member.
In the case of a federal state-Now we are coming near to Canada.
In the case of a federal state, the power of
which te enter into conventions on labour
matters is subject te limitations, it shall be in
the discretion of that Government te treat a
draft convention te which such limitations
apply as a recommendation- only, and the provisions of this article with respect te recommendations shall apply in such case.
The above article shall be interpreted in
accordance with the following principle:
In no case shall any Member be asked or
required, as a result of the adoption of any
recommendajtion or draft convention by the
Conference, te lessen the protection afforded by
its existing legislation te the workers concerned.
I desire to emphasize the words:

70

SENATE

Eaeh of the Members undertakes that it
will bring the recornendation or draft convention before the authority or authorities within
wchose conipetence the matter lies, for the
enactment of legislation or other action.
Now, I ask, under the terms of the Treaty
of Versailles what are Canada's obligations?
Canada undertakes to bring that recommendation or draft convention before the authority within whose competence the matter lies.
The proposed convention reached Ottawa in
1920. It was but a draft, which could be
turned into a recommendation. It could have
no value until it was adopted, or ratified, or
laid before the Federal Government. What
was the authority which had the competence
at that moment?
The right honourable
gentleman (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) gave
the answer. He said it was the provinces
andi he sent the document to them. The
Supreme Court also bas given the answer, and
it is the same: the provinces. So wben this
draft convention reached Canada the right
honourable gentleman, the leader of this
House, could do nothing but turn to the
competent authority, and he quite properly
said, "This must go to the provinces." At
that moment, according to the very terms of
article 405 of the Treaty of Versailles-which
is as sacred as any of the other clauses of
the treaty-the sole obligation of the Dominion ended.
Therefore, when we ar?
asked to support and approve the convention because of some obligation under
the Treaty of Versailles, I should like to
be shown where that obligation exists.
Section 132 of the British North America
Act, which I have mentioned more than once,
cannot avail in this case, because we are
bound by no treaty nor convention. We are
simply bound, upon receipt of that document,
to deliver it to the proper authority. Not
only is there no treaty nor convention, but
there is no obligation towards a foreign country. The draft convention is but a unilateral
document which does not call for reciprocity.
A member may simply comply with it and
notify the International Labour Organization
that it has done so; or, for reasons of its
own, it may refrain from complying.
It seems strange to be told that with respect to these matters we are obligated by
the Versailles Treaty because we signed that
treaty as a part of the British Empire. I
think we signed it as the Dominion of Canada, and that we entered the League as a
full-fledged autonomous country. However,
this is not entirely relevant. The argument
eppears all the more strange when we find
that after sixteen years India is the only
British country that bas signed this draft

convention.
Our great competitors in industrial pursuits and in foreign trades-Great
Britain, the United States, Japan and Germany
-along
with thirty other nations, have so
far not signed this draft convention of 1919.
Yet Great Britain and Japan are legislative
units, whereas Canada is a federal state.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Will the
honourable gentleman permit a question?
Has India any right to sign this convention?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The only reason
I mentioned India was that when I looked
through the list of countries which the Prime
Minister stated had signed this draft convention, I noticed that India was included. The
list comprised only 17 or 18 out of the 54
members of the League. I am not prepared
to discuss the constitution of India, or the
question of how it came to sign this convention.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Would the
honourable gentleman mind if I asked a
question on the point he bas been discussing?
Entirely aside from the .constitutional issue,
is the honourable gentleman opposed to the
terms of the convention, to the adoption of
them by Canada, because other countries have
not adopted them?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
not.

No, certainly

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
mention the other countries?

Then why

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Because I am
discussing the constitutional issue.
I am
simply answering the argument that because
we signed the Treaty of Versailles we are
bound to accept these conventions. I say
that is not the view of the majority of the
countries which signed that treaty. It is not
the view of Great Britain, which within the
League of Nations speaks for the British
Empire with the exception of the autonomous
Dominions. As we all know, Great Britain
has a number of colonies, and on this account
it is able to speak as an empire at the
League. I may say that I have always been
favourable to a reduction of hours of labour
by the day and week, and to legislation tending to bring that about. But the question
facing us now is: who has the power to pass
such legislation in this country? That is the
question to which I am addresing myself.
As I have stated, Canada's only obligation
was to transmit this draft convention to the
provinces, and that was done by the Government of the right honourable leader of
this House.
But the present Government
claims another procedure can be adopted. It

FEBRUARY 19, 1935
contends that by assuming an international
obligation, that is, by accepting a convention
and legislating thereon, it creates a federal
jurisdiction. It pretends te find discretionary
power in article 405 of the Covenant of the
League of Nations. That article says:
In the case of a federal state, the power of
which to enter into conventions on labour
matters is subject to limitationsI agree with my honourable friend's opinion
in 1920 that this is our case.
-it shall be in the discretion of that government
to treat a draft convention te which such limitations apply .as a recommendation only, and the
provisions of this article with respect to recommendations shall apply in such case.
This simply means that when a federal
state-whether the United States, Canada,
Germany before the advent of Hitler, or any
other federal state-receives such a draft
convention, it has te determine te what
authority the jurisdiction belongs. If it belongs te provinces, as in our case, then the
federal state can transform the draft convention into a recommendation, in order to
allow the provinces--and we have nine-to
take cognizance of it and te act upon it by
legislation.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Does the
honourable gentleman say that the German
Government with the Kaiser and his council
or parliament, had no power to bind the
whole empire?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will not enter
into a discussion of that. I was simply giving instances of federal states, and I mentioned Germany because I fully believe that
a matter such as the one now before us could
be dealt with not by the Reichstag, but only
by the various component parts of Germany.
The
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
German Empire was a federation, was it not?
I am simply
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
mentioning some federated states. And now
I am in Canada.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Hitler does
not rule here.
I say that the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
discretion mentioned in this clause simply
has the effect of allowing the federal state
te transform a draft convention into a
recommendation, and send it as such te the
component parts of the federation-to the
provinces in our case-because it is they who
will have te pass the necessary legislation, if
they decide to take action at all. And of
course provinces are not able to sign a convention with outside countries; they are

71

limited in this respect. The treaty-making
power belongs to the Dominion, and the
Dominion has the discretion of transforming
a draft convention into a recommendation
and sending it on to the provinces, for the
purpose of ascertaining whether they are
agreeable that the Federal Parliament should
bind them by signing it.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Does the
honourable gentleman say that is the law?
No; I say
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
that could be done. I say that the provinces
could agree by resolution or by act of their
legislatures to allow the federal authority to
sign a draft convention.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Where
does the honourable gentleman get authority
for saying that the provinces can empower
the Dominion te do anything?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That would not
transfer the authority from the provinces to
the Dominion, but the provinces could support a draft convention. This question has
often been debated in the Senate. A general
conference of the International Labour Organization does not know exactly what conditions
prevail in every one of the 54 countries, and
so every federal state is given the discretion
of transforming draft conventions into recommendations and sending them forward as such
te the component parts of the state. But
surely there is nothing in this provision that
can vest a federal authority with any power
that it does not already possess.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: That is
right.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think that is
clear. It eannot be maintained that article
405, giving discretion to federal states, empowers them te violate their own constitutions. A draft convention cannot be used
as a means o building up a jurisdiction which
does not exist.
The Goviernment wants to acquire and
exercise federal jurisdiction because a draft
convention has been agreed to. But are we
te understand that a mere deliberation by
employers and employees at Geneva, or
Washington--as in this case-will modify
the British North America Act and mutilate
the rights and powers of the provinces? Tf
that were the case, it would be necessary only
to resort te a draft convention, un projet de
convention, whenever further constitutional
authority was required. This phenomena-1
proposition reminde me of a statement made
by the right honourable leader of this House
when there was a similar display of doubtful

loyalty to the Constitution, and an abuse of
authority by declaring work to be for the
general advantage o-f Canada. It was a statement made in July, 1924, on a motion by the
then Prime Minister, Right Hon. Mr. King,
to refer this very draft convention to a committee of the other House. In the course of
the debate the right honourable gentleman
who now leads this House said, as reported at
pages 4764 and 4765 of the House of Commons Hansard for that year:
We have no right in the world to invade
jurisdiction where provincial jurisdiction is
clear, and (o so under the guise of declaring
this work or that for the general advantage of
Canada. To do so would be the grossest abuse
of the powers of this House, and I would not
for one moment consider any such suggestion,
no matter from what side of the House it
emanated. This expresses my general idea of

not in any spirit of criticism, but merely as

well of what we are pledged to keep away

contract of confederation.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEiN:
sense, that.

Very good

Right Hon. Mr. GRAIIAM: It still ought
to hold.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It does, too.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: A few minutes
ago my right honourable friend asked if I was
opposed to the terms of this convention.
Certainly I am not. But the procedure that
is proposed to us brings about a grave question, because, if it is agreed to, it will create
a momentous precedent. The Prime Minister and his Government are looking to
labour coniferences as sources of further jurisdiction. But think of the list of resolutions
and draft conventions which could be used to
whittle down the provisions of the original
contract upon which the federation was
founded-to use the words of Lord Chancellor
Sankey. The Government claims that it
acquires jurisdiction from the moment an
international coniference makes a decision.
I recall that Part XIII of the Treaty of
Versailles, dealing with the organization of
labour, recites that an improvement of labour
conditions was urgently required:
as, for example, by the regulation of the hours
of work, including the establishment of a
maximum working day and week, the regulation of the labour supply, the prevention of
unemployment, the provision of an adequate
living wage, the protection of the worker

against sickness, disease and injury arising out
of his employument, the protection of children,
young persons and women, provision for old

age and injury, protection of the interests of
Hon Mr. DANDURAND.

workers when employed in countries other than

their own, recognition of the principle of
freedom of association, the organization of
vocational and technical education and other
ineasures.
All these things I approve, but I submit that
most of them come within provincial jurisdiction. Yet, according to the principles
enunciated by my right honourable friend,
the simple fact of an international conference
deciding upon any of these matters would
entitle Parliament te legislate by approving
the convention and upon it basing its jurisdiction.
We find in the list I have quoted vocational
and technical education. In 1931 Parliament
voted to the provinces an annual grant of
$750,000 for a period of fifteen years. Thereby we recognized that this work was essentially under the jurisdiction of the provinces,
and that all we could do was to assist them
financially. If this Parliament approved the
draft convention in favour of vocational
education, could nothing prevent it from
appropriating the subject-matter on the plea
that it came under federal jurisdiction?
Whatever may be our opinion as to the
necessity for enlarging the powers of the
Dominion, its treaty-making power, I suggest, is limited by the form of our institutions. This power can be enlarged only by
mutual consent or by amendment et the
Constitution.
The foreign countries which
drafted and signed the Treaty of Versailles
have shown respect for our form of government by recognizing our constitutional limitations. Should it net be our common duty
to do likewise?
In spite of our gradual
development in all directions, our original
Constitution stands inviolate until, by legal
means, we decide to alter it. Let us never
forget that the British North America Act
is our Magna Charta.
Why not build on solid ground? A reference to the Supreme Court would settle the
question of constitutionality. Shall we not
be forced to take this step when we attempt
to apply the law against an unwilling party?
It has been well said-and these are my
closing words-that assertion of jurisdiction
deos not confer jurisdiction.
Hon. G. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Honourable members, it is net my intention to enter
into an elaborate argument, because in my
opinion, except in so far as it may ease our
consciences when we give our votes, any
argument made here is in vain. The decision
on this question, if the constitutionality of
our action is ever disputed, will be made by
the courts.

FEBRUARY 19, 1935
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That is right.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Anything we may say in this Chamber wilil not
sway the courts, for it will never be brought
to their notice.
It is acknowledged on all sides that until
this session all parties were under the impression that the subject-matter of the resolution, the regulation of the hours of labour,
was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the
provinces. That was the opinion of former
Governments, and therefore they acted upon
it, and quite properly so. I humbly submit
that they were not correct.
Let us take an elementary view of the
question. What is a treaty? It is an instrument made between sovereign states by their
duly accredited representatives. Until within
the last few years of the history of the
British Empire, treaties were made by the
Sovereign alone. They were not referred to
Parliament for amendment or ratification. In
fact treaties were often unknown to Parliament until long after they had become
effective. However, the custom-and I speak
under correction-grew up of having Parliament ratify treaties, but I know of no statutory
provision embodying the principle that a
treaty is not binding on the nation until
ratified by Parliament.
Now, inherent in every sovereign nation is
the treaty-making power. I submit that our
Sovereign has power to make a treaty with
any foreign nation, and that its validity does
not depend upon parliamentary ratification.
His Majesty is King of Canada, as well as
King of the British Empire, and as such he
has the power to make a treaty for Canada.
If he has not that power, who has?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Canadian
authorities.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Yes, the
Canadian authority. The Canadian authority
has the power to make the treaty. Who is
the Canadian authority? It is the King.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As advised by
his Ministers.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: No, I
submit not. It is the King's right to make
treaties, and that right has not been taken
away from him. He is the head of the State
-our Sovereign Lord the King.
But assuming that the sovereign has not
absolute power-which I do n.ot admit-then
I subimit that the Dominion Parliament, with
the assent of the Sovereign, has the power.
The treaty-making power must reside somewhere. It resides either with His Majesty
the King or with the Government of Canada.

73

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Will my honourable
friend permit a question? As I have not the
honour to belong to the enlightened fraternity
of the law, I should like him to define for
me and for our humble friends who do not
belong to the profession, what we are to
understand by the term constitutional monarchy as opposed to an autocracy.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
I do
not understand the honourable gentleman's
question.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I emphasize the word
"constitutional" in opposition to the word
"autocracy."
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: The King
is a constitutional monarch. In the government of this country lie is subject to all the
statutes to which lie has assented that control
his actions; but to no others.
Now, lias the Sovereign the treaty-making
power? If he has not, the power must reside
somewhere in Ottawa. Then if the Canadian
Government-taking it collectively as meaning the Governor-General, the Cabinet and
Parliament-if that has the right to make a
treaty, it has the right to enforce it.
Surely if the Dominion Government had
the power to make the Treaty of Versailles.
it has inherently the power to do everything
which is necessary to carry out the terms of
that treaty. If it has not, then we have no
power to enter into a treaty at all. We
have no right to make a treaty with the
United States, with Germany, or with any
other nation, unless we have the necessary
power to enforce it.
I submit for the consideration of honourable members that if this treaty-making power
resides with the Government of Canada, then
it has an inherent right to enforce the terms
of any treaty it may enter into. It would
be ridiculous to say that we could not enforce its terms. And who can enforce them
if the Dominion Government cannot? The
provinces have no treaty-making power;
therefore they have no power to enforce the
terms of a treaty. I submit, without considering the authorities which have been cited
in another place and here, that as to Canada,
His Majesty the King has the treaty-making
authority under the British North America
Act; but if His Majesty cannot make a
treaty on behalf of Canada, then under the
Statute of Westminster we have a right, such
as all nations possess, to enter into treaties
with foreign governments.
We signed the Treaty of Versailles. We
assented to this convention and we undertook to submit it to the proper authority
for enforcement. There is no authority in

SENATE
Canada but the Dominion Government to
enforce the convention. The authority that
enforces the convention must act for Canada.
We undertook to submit the convention to
the authority which can bind Canada, not
the authority which can bind the County of
Wentworth or the Province of Ontario.
If we have the treaty-making power, then it
goes without saying that we have the right
to pass legislation to compel the provinces
to carry out the terms of the convention.
Treatv-making and treaty enforcement are
now the exclusive prerogative of the Dominion.
Wlien we pass legislation we are acting on
behalf of Canada, not on behalf of the provinces. If the argument is well founded that
the British Empire bas been split up into a
number of nations, then we eannot have any
more British Empire treaties, for the treatymaking power has been lodged in each of the
component Dominions. I contend that if we
have split up the Empire we need not refer
to the British North America Act at all. I
-'uggest the Privv Council will hold that it is
a power inherent in every state to force its
subjects to observe the terms of any treaties
which it may enter into.
The honourable leader on the other side
bas, either in earnest or histrionically, waxed
indignant and claimed that we are whittling
down the powers of the provinces. I submit
that we are not. In fact we cannot whittle
down provincial powers. We can in no way
interfcre with those powers. We can in no
tvay limit the provinces in the exercise of
tho-e powers. If we have a right to pass
this proposed legislation it is a right inherent
in the Dominion Parliament, and net a right
filched from the provinces. The provincial
powers are limited by the wording of the
British North America Act. For instance, in
matters ifinsolvency it has been decided that
where there is no Dominion legislation the
provinces can pass legislation for the benefit
of creditors. In Ontario we had an excellent
Act. which never should have been super.eded.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In Quebec also.
Under
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
that Act insolvent estates were assigned to
the sberiff, and he wound them up and paid
over the proceeds ta the credýitors. Parliament passed the Bankruptcy Act. I never
heard any person say that that was a trenching on the rigbts of the province. The Dominion was exercising one oif its own rights.
Nvow, if the exercise of a Dominion jurisdiction results. in putting one of the provinces' rights into cold storage, the Dominion's

Mr.

LYNCH-STAUNTON.

action cannot b said to be trenching on provincial rights, because such rights are subordinate to those of the Dominion. By this
proposed legislation we are simply asserting
our jurisdiction for what we think is the
benefit of the whole country. In a word,
I contend that Parliament bas ample power
to pass this proposed legislation.
Now, I suggest that the statute which is
to come can be sustained on another ground,
and that is that it is "for the good governWhat can that phrase

lation. It is otherwise provided in the B.N.A.
Act that we are to pass all criminal legislation. What is the meaning of "the good
government of Canada"?
We must not
assume that those words in the statute are
surplusage.
It seems to me reasonable to
say that the regulation of hours of labour
is a subject which comes within the good
government of Canada. If it does not, can
it come within "order "-the maintenance
of order in Canada, the regulation of our
daily actions? I do not see that this word

law keeps the peace. To my mind the word
" peace " can relate only to the prevention
of disturbances of the peace in Canada by
external forces. The words in our statute
can reasonably be interpreted, I submit, as
covering the intended legislation.
Another point and I am donc. The honourable gentleman opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) has been stressing the words "recommend to the proper authority," and making
the argument that we undertake, in a federated state, to recommend to the proper
authority. I submit that we have no right
to make any recommendation, because there
is nobody to whom we can make it. I submit that the proper authority is not the
province. What is the subject-matter of this
agreement? It is the regulation of the hours
of labour for Canada; not for the province
of Ontario, the city of Hamilton, or the
city of Montreal, but for Canada. When we
come to look about to sec who in Canada
has the authority to regulate hours of labour,
what do we find? Some people seerm to think
it is the provinces; but the provinces have
no authority in that regard, and they have
no authority to enter into an agreement with
a foreign state to do anything. If you send
this recommendation on to Quebec or to
Ontario, what can they do? Can they send
word to the Secretary of the League of
Nations that they, on behalf of Canada, agree
to this convention?

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
We

would be an outrageous thing for the authority to say, "The province of Quebec shall Jo
sa and sa, and the province of Ontario shall
flot." And the province of Ontario could
not eut down the hours of labour, for then
people would move into Quebec.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Then the
Fathers of Confederation have been ail wrang.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: The whole
subj ect predicates that there is no authority
ta enter into this proposed agreement unless
it be the Dominion. The provinces have no
.authority ta write a letter to the League of
'Nations, no authority ta do anything in that
respect. Then, why make the recommendation
ta them? If there is any federation in the
ivorld where such authority is ini the separate
states, and they are joined together only for
ýsome illusory purpose, eaeh might deal with
the matter; but I cannot see how that is
possible. If Germany signed that con tract,
haw in the warld could she recammend it ta
Prussia?
Prussia is not a party ta it;
Prussia cannat be made a party to it. The
Dominion Government cannot give authority
ta a province to en-ter into that agreement,
:and the province cannat give the Dominion
Government authority ta enter into, it.
Neither of them. can delegate its power ta
the other; each must act of itseif. This prov.ision does nat say "recommend ta a province"; it says "recommend ta the praper
.authority," and it is put in only because there
inay be an authoirity. In the United States,
for example, a great many powers are vested
in the Senate alane. IL might be that the
siguatories of the document would agree that
it be referred ta the Senate, because the
Senate can bind the United States. The
-agreement must refer ta some authority which
can bind Canada, and the only authority
wvhich can do that is the Dominion Covernnient. Therefore 1 say there is no condition
of law, constitutional or damestic, which can.
miake that pracedure of recommendation apply
.effectively in this country ta any legislature
~except the Parliament of Canada.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Article 16:
Eaeh member of the International Labour

and passessions which are not fully self-governing:

I do not think t-his article was intended
ta apply ta a Dominion. IL is only when a
persan wants ta make a finesse that hie
tries ta apply it in that way. If iL were
intended s0 ta apply, however, the argument
could lie made-which might appeal ta samebody, but probably wouJd appeal ta nohody
-that iL meant a Dominion if it possessed
provinces. But as we are a lang way from.
convincing anybady that we possess the provinces, 1 think the article can apply only ta
what, under aur law, are referred ta as Crown
colonies. That is my view, and until the

just as good as anyhody else's.

PREGIGUS METALS MARKING BILL
THIRD R~EADING

Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGOHEN maved the
third reading of BiU 2, an Act ta amend the
Preciaus Metals 'Marking Act, 1928.
Han. Mr. DANDURAND:
I think the
right honourable gentleman lias a statement

Riglit Han. Mr. MEI 3GHEN: I have, but
it differs veryr little framn the statement 1
made the oCher day, which I think sank in
fairly well. The officers wha are responsible
for the administration of this Act are very
desirous that the Bill go through withaut
modificatian. That is ta say, they do not

SENATE
want any limitation of the time within which
offenders may be punished.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAiND:
no prescription?

They

want

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. And the
reasons they give are rather impressive. The
practices of the trade, including frequently
holding in stock for long periods, make it
impracticable for the administering department to suggest a period of extension likely
to prove of practical value. As I sought to
explain the other day, when an article is
purchased it probably bas already lain in the
store for months, if not for years. There may
be a defect, in violation nf the law, and the
article may remain in the purchaser's hands for
a number of years longer before that defect
is discovered. Now, if a time limit is placed
on the bringing of prosecutions, it will provide one way out for the offender. The only
argument for a limitation is that without it
the law would be unfair to an accused person,
since be might be compelled to defend himself many years after the commission of the
alleged offence, when evidence that could
have been adduced on his behalf within
a shorter period has perhaps disappeared.
Witnesses may die. documents may vanish.
Consequently the law usually, though not
always, provides that prosecutions must take
place within a certain period aSter the alleged
violation. But the reasons for a limitation
do not apply here, because if a person is
accused under thS law he is able to defend
himself equally well, regardless of whether
the alleged offence dates back fifteen years or
a few months. His evidence would consist
not of documents nor the testimony of
witnesses, but of the article itself. The law
as it existed at the time o-f the alleged offence
would of course have to be proved.
In other words, if the defendant's evidence
had disappeared, there could be no case
against him, for the prosecution also would
have no evidencc. The accused would in no
way be handicapped bccause of the interval
which had elapsed. regardless of the length
of that interval. This is the reason behind
the attitude of the administering officials.
Thcy feel that to have any limitation at all
of the period within which a prosecution may
be brought would seriously impair the
efficiency of the Act. The department states
that a prosecution of great importance to the
trade was recently dismissed because there
was no chance to bring the action within the
statutory limit. Six months is a short period.
I suppose the honourable senator would not
object to six years. But ev"en that term would
Bght Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

prove too short, in many cases. Once it is
made clear that no injustice can be donc to
anyone by reason of the lateness of the
prosecution, the reason for a limitation
vanishes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAiND: Perhaps if a
person discovers a defect in a piece of jewelry
which be bas been wearing for fifteen years
he may think that by that time be bas had
his money's worth in enjoyment of te
article.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
may be no prosecution brought.

1. What was the date of the arrival of the
first ocean ship in 1934 at Churchill?
2. How many tons of freight, if any, did it
land?
3. Were there any duties paid on this first
cargo; if so, how much?

on this first arrival?
5. What -n'as the date of the departure of the
last ocean ship sailing from Churchill?
6. How many tons of cargo and how many
bushels of wheat or other grains did the last

7. How many bushels of grain were shipped
from Churchill in the 1934 season?
S. How many cattle, if any, were shipped
during the same season?
9. What was the price per head for ocean
freight?
10. What was the cost for maintenance,
repairs, etc., to the Government elevators?
11. Hov many men were employed during the

INTERNATIONAL LABOUR

HOURS

OF

WORK

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen:
That it is expedient that Parliament do
approve of the Convention Limiting the Hours
of Work in Industrial Undertakings to Eight
in the Day and Forty-eight in the Week
adopted as a draft convention by the General
Conference of the International Labour Organization of the League of Nations at its First
Session in Washington on the 28th day of
November, 1919.
Hon.

JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
someone has said that all things
come to those who wait. To-day, in respect
to this question that we have before us, I
feel happier and more assured than I have
felt for many years. I am going to undertake to discuss this question from the viewpoint of a layman, of course. Some laymen
have very pronounced views, which may be
unsound legally, and they very often hold
to those views even in disregard of being
set right by eminent legal gentlemen.
I
have read more than once the very exhaustive
discussion that developed on this question
in another place on the Sth day of the
present month. Some parts of that discussion
I have read as often as three or four times,
and I rejoice in the belief that in the matter
of determining the length of day for the
workingmen of Canada we are nearer to the
point where we should have been these many
years past.
It may not be improper for me to digress
for a moment to indicate when and where
the question of an eight-hour day was first
dealt with on this North American continent.
I go back in retrospect to August 17, 1916.
More than 700 general chairmen, representing
the four large railway transportation organizations, assembled in Washington and met
the Chief Citizen of the United States. Before the conclusion of the conference he
assured them that the eight-hour day would
be made effective on the railroads of that
cointry. If the walls of this Chamber could
speak, I am quite sure they would bear
witness to the fact that many distinguished
senators have from time to time shown
marked exception to the McAdoo Award,
which was published two years later. That
Award specifically provided for the establishment of an eight-hour day on the railroads of
the United States. I think the record will
show that several honourable members ohjected--yes, and possibly some of them, who

senators,

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

may not be in their seats at the moment,
would still most earnestly object by word
of mouth and by other means at their disposal for the promulgation of their views.
But at last, in 1935, Canada is seriously discussing the eight-hour day, with, I hope,
every prospect of its being establisbed by
statutory enactment.
As a matter of fact the eight-hour day
is now out of date, in view of the pressing
necessity facing the nations of the world to,
secure work for their unemployed. Still, it
will be all to the good if in this Parliament
we can find authority to put into effect what
is contemplated by the motion now before us.
As a layman, and without the slightest
intention of causing offence to the distinguished and capable gentlemen of this
House who are members of the legal profession, may I say that I have always held
the view-and I hold it more firmly now
than ever-that some of these distinguished
world courts, when dealing with the welfare
of humanity, have only too often been
guided by the suggestions or desires of the
powers that happened to be in control in
the various countries where the question of
an eight-hour day was under discussion.
To sustain this view, may I quote an
editorial in last night's Ottawa Journal.
Within the past few weeks we have been
either edified or horrified by the thought that
the Supreme Court of the United States
might hand down a decision which would
make certain industries and railroads and the
Government of that country pay $1.69 on
the dollar. I am quite sure that all citizens
of the two great nations on this North
American continent heaved a sigh of relief
when, a few days ago, that tribunal decided
by five to four that the action taken by the
United States Administration in regard to
the devaluation of the dollar was entitled
to support, and that the dollar was worth
only 100 cents. The Ottawa Journal of last
night, in referring to the United States gold
decision, conveys what has been my view
for many years. It states:
Actually, there never was miieli chance of the
Supreme Court doing anything else.
That is, anything other than sustaining the
Government.
To have donc anything else would have meanit
financial chaos in the United States, would have
crushed practically all of the New Deal policies.
And the next paragraph is the one that I
want particularly to bring to the attention
of the Senate:
That is not the task of the United States
Supreie Court. A branch of the United States

FEBRUARY 20, 1935
Goeernment, its task is flot so much to abide

laterIn this respect it is on ail fours with the
Judicial Committee of the Imperial Privy
Council.
I shall undertake to show by reference and
quotation that that statement is absolutely
correct, and as a layman I arn going to express the view that the lImperial Privv
Council is guided somewhat by the reai
necessities.
Some will say that conditions have
materiaily changed. 0f course they have.
But to me the question bas always seemed to
be this: why should this Parliament, dorninating and determining the rights of Canadian
citizens, have held for one moment, or been
content to say, that it had no right to de5il
with conditions affecting mankind and womankind that were unknown and undreamed of
in 1867, when the British North America Act
was formulated? Nobody at that time had
ever dreamed of the necessity of bringing
about an eight-hour day. No one had dreamed
of the necessity of estahiishing minimum

sections coveired; so, witb the indulgence of
honourable gentlemen, I should like to place
them on record. To save time I shall refrain
from reading them, but I want to discuss
two or three phases of these sections as they
appeal to me as an ordinary citizen not
possessed of legal knowledge. I therefore ask

permission to place on Hansard sections 91

Mr.

YIURDOCK.

16. Generally all matters of a merely local
or private nature in the province.
Looking at the matter from the standpoint
of a layman, we find that at the commencement of section 91 it is stated:
It shall be lawful for the Queen, by and
witi the advice and consent of the Senate
and House of Commons, to make laws for the
peace, order, and good government of Canada,
in relation to all matters not coming within
the classes of subjects by this Act assigned
exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces.
Will any lonourable gentleman, wltcther of
the legaýl profession or net, tell me that when
that language was incorporated in the British
North America Act there was any thought of
minimum wages, thte eight-hour day, or many
of the various other questions that to-day
affect the rigits and welfare of the men and
women of 'Canada? Can anyone possibly
argue that any of these questions now before
us were before the Fathers of Confederation
when they formulated and laid down this
language for our guidance in the ycars to
come? The answer must be no. It seems
to me, therefore-of course I am speaking as
a layman, but I know this appeals to thonsands of other laymen in this Canada of ours
-that we have the absolute right to legislate
n relation to matters not assigned exclusively te the legislatures of the provinces by
section 92.
Then why is it that there lias been all this
trouble in the past few years? Why lias the
eigit-hour day not become an accomplished
fact between the time w-lien it was enunciated
and laid down in Washington, in 1919, and
1935? Well, as regards that great country
to the south, we know why; and, without
intending the slighttest particle of offence, may
I say liat in my humble judgment the sanme
reasons apply equally on this side of the line.
Who was it wlo propounded and first made
effective on the North American continent
an eiglit-hour day? It was that great statesman of the neigihbouring republic who, within
less than a year after tlie
17th day of August,
1916, when ie conceded the eight-hour day,
led his country into the great World War that
was expected to bring about better conditions
for hiimanity gencrally. What followed? We
fmid that a little better than a year afterward-thirten months, to be exact-the eiglthour day vas further enunciated in the socalled MeAdoo Award, to which I referred
a few moments ago. And thien what happened? Political obstinacy, rivalry, and all
that is detrimental to the rights and the
intei(sts of the common citizen prevented
that great statesian from putting further

FEBRUARY 20, 1935
into effect the principles he had assisted in
laying down in Part XIII of the Treaty of
Versailles. The principles for which he had
contended from one end of the nation to
the other were bored from within and
Borahed from without, so that it was impossible for the lawmakers of that country to
do what he had hoped would be done for
the common people.
Within less than eight months after the
signing of the Treaty of Versailles the United
States Government invited the International
Labour Organization, which had been set up
by the treaty, to hold its first meeting in the
city of Washington. It met there, and the
first thing it did was to take up the question of hours of labour and recommend the
eight-hour day to the nations of the world.
Yet the two nations of this North American
continent have so far not adopted that
recommendation. For some years I have
endeavoured to observe the developments on
this question and on similar and just as important questions, and to me the situation
is a tragie one. Personally I blame political
ambition and rivalry for the condition in
which these two North American nations find
themselves in respect to these questions affecting the social welfare of their citizens. I do
not blame any one party or person more
than another, because I happen to know that
no good thing can come out of Nazarethmeaning the other party. That is held first,
last and all the time.
I happened to be in the unfortunate position
of holding office as a Minister of the Crown
when this same general question came up,
in relation not particularly to the eight-hour
day, but to certain matters affecting the
powers of Canada to deal with the rights,
interests and welfare of her workmen, and I
know that the contentions of the Dominion
were on more than one occasion rejected.
I have reference to what happened in connection with the Industrial Disputes Investigation Act and the Combines Investigation
Act. J do not know that I am altogether
competent to discuss specifically all the whys
and wherefores of these matters, but as a
la.yman I have some ideas with respect to
them too. Let me read to you certain views
as expressed by Viscount Haldane, Lord
Chancellor, when rendering the judgment of
the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council,
in 1925, with reference to the validity of the
Industrial Disputes Investigation Act. He
said:
It was pointed out that the Dominion had
exclusive legislative power to create new crimes
"where the subject-matter is one which, by its
very nature, belongs to the domain of criminal

81

jurisprudence." But "it is quite another thing,
first to attempt to interfere with a class of
subject committed exclusively to the provincial
legislature, and then to justify this by enacting
ancillary provisions d'esignated as new phases of
Dominion criminal law, which require a title to
so interfere as the basis of ,their application."
Their Lordships are of opinion that, on
authority as well as on principle, they are today precluded from accepting the arguments
thait the Dominion Act in controversy can be
justified as being an exercise of the Dominion
power under section 91 in relation to criminal
law.
And a little further on he stated:
Nor does the invocation of the specific power
in section 91 to regulate trade and commerce
assist the Dominion contention.
Environment and heredity, precept and
example govern all of us, I think, to a
greater or lesser extent. For instance, I
believe it would be difficult to take a young
person who had been brought up as a devout
Methodist and convert him to some different
religious viewpoint. Of course such a thing
can be done, for there are exceptions to all
rules, but it would be an unusual occurrence.
Now, it seems to me that in considering this
judgment of Viscount Haldane we should
ask ourselves some questions about him.
This is not a new opinion with me, for I
have held it since 1925. It is, again, only
the opinion of a layman, and I give it for
what it is worth. I think we should inquire
under what conditions he acquired the views
which are partially, and only partially, enunciated in the words I have read. If you look
up the record of his career you will find
that one of his early assignments in the legal
profession was as an associate counsel for
the province of New Brunswick, in a case
in which he argued directly in opposition to
the view that we are now going to hold, that
the Dominion has some authority in certain
of these matters. That important argument
was made three thousand miles away from
the scene which showed the necessity of the
Dominion's having the right to deal with
certain matters not even dreamed of in 1867,
and I have long felt that the early training
and conviction that were necessary to make
him an acceptable and capable associate
counsel in that case had played a large part
in the denial to Canada for some years of
the authority and right which unquestionably
she should have had, and should now have.
Now let us take a different point of view,
one that apparently has resulted from neither
environment nor teaching, but from the application of sheer co«mmon sense to modern
conditions. Lord Chancellor Sankey, in rendering a judicial decision of the Privy Council
in October, 1931, appears to have recognized
the materially changed and changing world

conditions affecting Canada, as well as other
countries, and necessitating what ordinary
layman might term a more constructive and
more effective plan of dealing with presentday issues.
When laying down certain
principles he stated:
The general

power

of legislation

conferred

upon the Parliament of the Dominion by section 91 of the Act in supplement of the power
to legislate upon the subjects expressly ennumerated must ba strictly confined to such matters
as are unquestionably of national interest and
importance, and must not trench on any of the
subjects enumerated in section 92, as within the
scope of provincial legislation, unless these
matters have attained such dimensions as ta
affect the body politie of the Dominion.
It is within the competence of the Dominion
Parliament to provide for matters which,
though otherwise within the legislative competence of the provincial legislature, are
necessarily incidental to effective legislation by
the Parliament of the Dominion upon a subject
of legislation expressly enumerated in section
91.
There can be a domain in which provincial
and Dominion legislation may overlap, in which
case, neither legislation will bea ultra vires if
the field is clear, but if the field is not clear
and the two legislations ineet, the Dominion
legislation must prevail.
In the name of common sense and justice,
what more do we want? What more could
we have asked for or been given in years
that have gone by? To my mind it is a
standing disgrace to those who assume to
legislate for the people of Canada that in
this day and age we have been passing the
buck from one authority to the other, and
at the same time denying to the ordinary
citizen the relief to which he possibly was
entitled, not only with respect to this measure,
but also to many others which I hope will be
adopted before long.
Now, one further word about the absurditics of section 91, as I view the section.
Among the specific powers assigned to the
Dominion I find, in paragraph 26, marriage
and divorce. I hope some honourable member will not tell me that section 92 also deals
with the same subject; I know it does. My
point is this. Is it possible in our sane and
humane civilization that although this Parliament has the right to deal with marriage
and divorce, yet it has no right to protect
the woman who is about to be married
against sweat-shop conditions, under which
she is sewing on buttons for two cents a
hundred or some such miserable rate of pay,
and must go without sufficient food and confort in this land of plenty? Can it be seriously suggested that Parliament has no right
to deal with such conditions, that it has no
authority to ensure that she and her prospecHon. Mr

MURDOCK.

tive husband shall be decently and properly
treated as Canadian citizens up to the time
they decide to marry? In the humble opinion
of this layman it is utterly absurd that since
the enactment of the British North America
Act we have been passing the buck as to
whether the province or the Dominion has
authority in relation to this or that matter
affecting the welfare of the people.
I hope no word of mine will convey the
impression that I favour scrapping the British
North America Act. No! not by any means.
I stand for minority rights under the Constitution. But for goodness' sake, in deference
to the hopes, the aspirations and the rights
of the common citizens of Canada, let us not
hide behind the flimsy excuse that we have
no right to deal with the eight-hour day or
other important social questions because they
were not spelled out in the British North

specified in 1867 is that they were not
dreamed of in those days.
In my judgment it is a happy day for
Canada when we find ourselves throwing to
one side all the subterfuge that many of us
on both sides have resorted to in the years
gone by. To-day we are ready to get down
to brass tacks and, as representatives of the
people, to assume our responsibility and so
discharge our duty as to be worthy of the
trust reposed in us.
Hon. RODOLPHE LEMIEUX: Honoerable gentleman, I do not intend to dilate at
any length on the very important issue now
before us. Last week, when the right honourable leader of the House introduced this
resolution, J had the privilege of saing a
few words. Perhaps I may n'ot he in ordecr

I promise that I will not detain honourable

Speaking as an old-time Liberal-although
in this debate I may part company with some
of my Liberal friends-I think that yesterday

vincial rights. It is surprising-I made the
remark last night to a friend of mine after
listening to my honourable friend from
Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton)-it is
surprising how some words which at one time
had a strong appeal for the Canadian people,
such words as "autonomy" and "provincial
rights," have now become obsolete. I recall
in the famous Naval debate-my right
honourable friend will remenmber it too-in
the course cf an address delivered by one of
our colleagues in the other Chamber, as we
were arguing autonomy, he exclaimed, "Oh!
I arn tired cf hearing about autonomy." In
the present debate in both Chambers, and in
the publie press, provincial rights have apparently been disregarded.
Now. much as I respect the opinion of my
honourable friend from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock), who speaks so eloquently on behalf of those whom he has wbly represented
for almost twenty years past, I must say that
I do not agree with him. He speaks slightingly of the Fathers of Confederation and of
the British North America Act. I take issue
with him at once. I stand for the British
North America Act, for the Constitution as
it was given to us by the Fathers of Confederation.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: In his admirable
history of Canada under the Union our colleague the honourable senator from Grandville (Hon. Mr. Chapais) gives us a very
graphie account of the gigantic battle for
Confederation. I notice that he is a very
fair exponent of the theories of those who
favoured Conifederation and of those who
opposed it. In his concluding pages he states
that the whole instrument cf Confederation
was the result of a series of compromises
which, brought together, partly eliminated,
and finally consolidated, made up the Magna
Charta of Canada. For this charter I stand
firmly and,-may I say-patriotically. I resent any adverse comment on the Constitution.
To appreciate the work of the Fathers of

in securing the support of George Brown and
a large section cf the Liberal party in the
province of Ontario.
Now, to speak lightly of those great men
is, to my mind, lamentable. In Roman law,
as my right honourable friend knows, certain
things are called res sacrae-things to be respected, to be held in veneration. I look
upon the Confederation pact as a res sacra
for Canadians of ail creeds and of every racial
extraction.
! 1
I may be termed a provincialist or a "little
Canadian." I shall not complain, but during
these times of agitation when one does not
know whether a Liberal or a Conservative
Goviernment, or perhaps, some day, a Socialist
Government, will control this Dominion, I
think we should be very prudent in dealing
with the Ark of the Covenant. For my part
I do not agree that we should lay sacrilegious
hands on this pact.
Now, the Prime Minister himself recognized
the sanctity of that covenant with respect to
minorities. I speak for the minority because
I represent the old district of Rougemont,
which for many years was represented here
by that grand old centenarian, Senator Dessaulles. The Prime (Minister a few years
ago, discussing a certain resolution adopted
at a Liberal convention in Ontario, a resolution with which I do not wholly agree-and
I regret to have been unable to attend the
convention-said:
The document I have before me is not
entitled "the policy of the Liberal party," but
at the end I find the words: "The League for
Social Reconstruction."
"The present capitalist system bas showxr
itself
unjust and inhuman,
economically
wasteful and a standing threat to peace and
dernocratic government."
The fourth and fifth paragraphs of the document read:
Social legislation to secure ,to the worker
adequate income and leisure, freedom of association, insurance against illness, accident, old
age, and unemployment, and an effective voice
in the management of his industry.
The vesting in Canada of the power to amend
and interpret the Canadian Constitution se as
to give the Federal Government power to
control the national economic development.
Then the Prime Minister said:
I commend that to the members from Quebec.
There go your provincial rights, there goes your
provincial constitution.
I am not sure that the Prime Minister did
not exaggerate a little when he made that
statement, but at al events I for one will
not relinquish the provincial rights to which
we in the province of Quebec are entitled,

FEBRUARY 20, 1935
by reason of a passing frenzy caused by an
approaching election. I am only supposing;
I do not know. There may be, for all that,
another extension of Parliament. It happened
in 1917. But I should be sorry to see the
leaders of our Parliament deal lightly with
our Constitution under the pretence that this
social legislation would be popular with the
labouring element of Canada.
In this Senate of Canada we are far away
from the masses, and we can speak our minds
freely and openly in regard to this matter.
I am a conservative in the sense that I do
not want the Canadian Constitution to be
ridden over roughshod. I want the Canadian Constitution to be respected.
Moreover, after hearing legal men of the
standing of the Secretary of State, admittedly
a distinguished lawyer, a man whose opinion
I prize, and men like the right honourable
the leader of this House, the Premier of
Canada and the Minister of Justice, stating
openly and clearly that the matters covered
by the resolution we are discussing cannot
come under the purview of the federal power,
I ask how can they so rapidly change that
view, which they held a year or two ago,
and even last fall. Let me quote what
my friend the Secretary of State said when
addressing the Young Men's Canadian Club
at the Queen's Hotel in Montreal last November. He took the stand that social legislation
came exclusively under the jurisdiction of

hope it was not my good friend from ParkdaleHon. Mr. MURDOCK: I think lie referred
to both of us.
Oh, no, because I
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX:
realize that, contrary to the general consensus of opinion that this resolution should be
adopted and that we should bless it, I am in
a hopeless minority.
He said:

social propagandists-blind leaders of the

-who are persistent in their efforts to procure
the Dominion Parliament to pretend to appropriate and illegally to exercise powers which
are exclusively vested in the provincial government. One of these, to whom I recently
suggested that a certain course of action was
unconstitutional, made reply: "To hell with the
Constitution!"
I apologize to you, Mr. Speaker.

85

In these days of social unrest, when people
who are suffering are insistent on reform, and
impatient of delay, those who believe that
evolution is more effective than revolutionI ask the right honourable gentleman (Right
Hon. Mr. iMeighen) to follow this.
-that evolution is more effective* than revolution must again and again and persistentlydemand that municipal authorities assume theirfull responsibilities in municipal matters,
provincial authorities assume their full responsibilities in provincial matters, and Dominion
authorities their full responsibility in Dominion
matters.
I think that is very clearly put.
Now, being a provincialist and speaking
for a minority, I must not risk what our
forefathers achieved for us. I therefore
defend the work accomplished by Sir George
Etienne Cartier, Sir John A. Macdonald and
Hon. George Brown. Speaking more specifically for Quebec, I support the work of Sir
George Etienne Cartier, and I do not care
to see any unholy hands even touch the
Ark of the Covenant.
Further, the Secretary of State said:
Until the Britisli North America Act is
amended by constitutional methods, no good
puipose oan be served by either the Domninion
Parliament or the provincial legislatures
attempting illegally to exercise powers now
fully vested in the other or others of them.
The present Minister of Justice made this
statement on July 18, 1924:
I do not think there is any doubt as to the
jurisdiction of this Parliament in regard to.
Dominion labour. But there is more than a
doubt in regard to our jurisdiction ,to applythe eight-hour day principle generally throughout the Dominion. I have not a doubt upon
the subject; I am satisfied that the ruling of
the Department of Justice is right in that
respect, and that the provincial legislatures
have jurisdiction in such matters; but I am
just as sure that this Parliament has jurisdiction in regard to Dominion works, and if
Parliament or the Government is in sympathy
with the proposal of the eight-hour day as

proposal should not be supported.

yesterday. He explained that this draft convention was net binding on Canada. Surely
all honourable senators, whether members of
the legal profession or laymen-and I have
almost as much confidence in lay minds as
in legal minds-must agree that that argument was sound. Now, it was suggested yesterday that we should go ahead and pass
legislation, and that if we are acting beyond
our powers the courts will put us right in the

the other day, submit the question of our
constitutional powers to the Supreme Court
of Canada now? I an ready to abidi by the
verdict of that court. If it is desired te take
the question farfier, go to the Privy Council.
Shsould ihat be done, Labour, to whom a
special appeal is being made by the proposed legislation, would understand that the
Government was in earnest, that the desire
was to enaet real law and not a shan
measure which afterwards might be destroyed
by a court judgment. Surely the Government does not believe that the matter will
be allowed to rest if the proposed legislation
is passed. An attack will be made upon it,
as was done in the Licence case, the Streams
case and the Insurance case. Everywhere in
Canada people who in former days heard the
rigit bonourable the Prime Ministir, the

the lionourable the Secretary of State, the

others, will still believe that such proposed

Why should I waste time in defining a

not a treaty. Notwithstanding what my lionourable friend from Hamilton (Hon. Mr.

Parliament only after the views of the provincial legislatures have been ascertained,
because at the time of Confederation there
was a pact between the four provinces and
the Dominion authority which they created.
The provinces divested themselves of certain
powers and conferred them on the Federal
Parliament. Much as I respect the League
of Nations, I say that none of its decisions or
recommendations are to be binding on us
until they have been approved by Parliament and, if they concern matters of purely
provincial jurisdiction, by the legislatures.
That is se with respect to the eight-hour

place by the Prime Minister, the Secretary
of State, the. Minister of Justice, and the

all. they are a constituent part of Canada
and we cannot ignore them. They were the
makers of the Dominion; it was due to their
collective will that the Parliament of Canada was created and a federal constitution
e.nacted.
I repeat that whatever power
belongs to these legislatures should be
adhered to, and we should not hesitate to
refer to them all such matters as come within their purview.
I repeat that a draft convention is not a
treaty, and the honourable senator from
Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) knows
that. Some years ago I accepted the chair of
International Law at Montreal University,
and I took pains to explain te my students
that neither a convention nor an armistice
is a treaty. Either of these may precede a
treaty, but if the draft of the convention or
of the armistice is not accepted by the competent powers, then there is no treaty.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Will the
honourable gentleman permit a question?
Does he contend that a convention which
grows out of and is mentioned in a treaty
is not a part of the treaty?
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Well, net in the
sense that the honourable gentleman thinks.
As was pointed out last night by the honourable leader on this side, the Treaty of Versailles provides that the League of Nations
may refer certain matters te a committee,
such as the Labour Council at Geneva. If
that committee passes on a question, a draft
convention is sent te the nations interested,
and they can either accept or reject it. But
nobody is bound by it until it is adopted.
If the theory that we are bound by a draft
convention were right, what an insult it
would have been to the League of Nations
te leave this one in abeyance se long instead
of giving immediate effect te it. But no,

87

a draft convention is net a treaty; it is only
a memorandum sent te the parties concerned,
who can accept it or not, as they please. It
is like a draft contract, which is submitted
te private parties. If one party does net
accept it, there is no contract.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: If a contract is made between two parties and contains a provision that something else shall
be done if somebody else assents te it, is net
that provision a part of the contract?
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Well, that may be
very ingenious, but it does net convince me.
A bona fide contract must be accepted by
both parties.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And the terms
suggested by the honourable senator are net
the terms of the treaty.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: No. A bona fide
contract between nations, as between private
persons, must be accepted by all the parties
te it, or else it falls.
I cannot consent te the Dominion Government riding roughshod over the British North
America Act. I want to be quite sure that
we are efectually right before we make any
changes or modifications, for, as I have already
stated, our Constitution is the outcome of a
series of compromises among the provinces
at the time of Confederation. Take for
instance the educational section, or the sectien dealing with the ten English counties in
the province of Quebec which were specially
assigned te the English-speaking minority.
Would you deal lightly with those two
sections without getting the consent of the
provincial legislatures? And if you were te
attempt te break faith with the Englishspeaking minority in Quebec would you net
have almost a revolution? There are some
counties in the Eastern Townships that you
cannot rearrange for electoral purposes, that
you cannot, se te speak, gerrymander,
because Sir A. T. Galt, in the negotiations
preceding Confederation, insisted on the provision contained in section 80 of the British
North America Act. It reads:
Provided · hat it shall not be lawful to
t
present to the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec
for assent any Bill for altering the limits
of any of the electoral divisions or districts
mentioned in the second schedule to this Act,
unless the second and third readings of such
Bill have been passed in the Legislative
Assembly with the concurrence of the majority
of the members representing all those electoral
divisions or districts, and the assent shall not
be given to sueh Bill unhess an address has
been presented by the Legislative Assembly to
the Lieutenant Governor stating that it has
been so passed.

And so, too, with respect to section 93, covering education. This section was intended
primarily to protelct the English-speaking
minority in Queibec. Would you deal lightly

of the British North America Act, for instance, the educational section, section 93,
and the ten-county section, section 80, without raising at once a great deal of trouble,
perhaps a revolution.
And, if you amend the British North
America Act, be certain that you are right.
Let me give a familiar illustration. Detachï a
brick from a structure, and you create a
weakness that eventually may bring about
collapse of the whole edifice. Weli, tiat is
what I want to prevent if possible-any
change in the British North America Act
which would insidiously bring about its
ultimate impairment.

is far greater urgency ta bring about ecenomie
recovery. This would be encouraged by a
sane trade policy, by a reduction in aur higb
tariff, by a sound reciprocity treaty with the
'United States. 1 submit that when,. last

I was appalled when early this year I read

They dealt withf the present econlomic conditions ai Canada, and they recommende ta

They were airaid af the cost ai this social

forget that our ecanomnie situation is very

The ather day a friend of the Government,
a man whomn I happen ta know, as does my
right honourable friend from Tarronto, Mr.
C. H. Carlisle, president ai the Dominion
Bank and ai the Goodyear Tire and Rubber
Company, addressed the Board of Trade Club
ai Toronto. I quote from the newspaper
repart af his speech:
Canada, one ai the richest and most intelligent countries in the world, had a debt af
seven billions, one af the largest per capita
delits in the world. Unleas steps were taken
ta curh the ever-mounting total ai federal,
provincial and municipal debt, insolvency
would inevitably i ollow, lie declared. In this
connection Mr. Carlisle painted ta the four
western provinces and the financial assistance
given them ta prevent bankruptcy.
"The grand total ai seven billion dollars
is more than the total of aur iarm and urban
niortgage debt, aur corparate debt, aur bank

cipalities whose tax levy of 198 millions was
two-thirds ai the Canadian urban total, had.
at the end ai the year, uncollected taxes of
aver 100 millions, or 51 per cent ai the total
levy. That is where anc group of your represent-atives are leading you."
I have quoted Mr-. Carlisle's remarks hecause,

as I say, I happen ta know hi-m personally.
My right honourable friend knows that Mr.
Carlisle is anc ai the mast prominent citizens
of Torcto-I might say oi Canada.

Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX:

The activities ai

the 'Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company
are not confined ta Ontario and Quebec;
they extend thraughout the whole Dominion.
I am also. impressed by his language because
Mr. Carlisle is American-born. He bas made

Canada lis home and is deeply interested in
the future af his adopted country. When he
speaks lie speaks as a frîend.
At the annual meeting ai the Bank of Commerce last month the general manager, Mr.
Logan, in the course ai bis address deait with
unemployment and world trade and quoted
the Director ai the International Labour
Organization at Geneva, than whom, lie said
there is nane so genuinely interested iii thE
welf are ai labour. This is the Director's
opinion:
Practically all the measures (for recovery)
so f ar taken have been national measures.
Whatever degree of success they may have
achieved, the ultimate question remains whether
these national units, however satisfactorily and
efficiently reorganized ta ensure the best internaI production and distribution ai their
national wealth, can avoid being severally and
collectively impoverished unless they can work
out same comprehensive method ai restaring the
general ecanamie lii e ai the world from which
they have aIl derived a large part ai their
past riches.
Sir John Aird also addressed the -meeting.
He, I think, is a friend ai the Government.
He said:
If, however. this desire ta unsbackle trade,
ansi thereby ta widjen the avenue ai empioyment , is ta be implemented, some positive
measures should be taken, such as a general
reduction in tariffs, as I suggested in 1933,
accompanied by exchange stabilization (at

resuniption ai sound iareign lending.

residing in Montreal, as I am-and my right
honourable friend knows the situation in Toronto is about the same-they would know
that a comparatively few men are paying for
the maintenance of the unemployed.
This eight-hour-day legislation will not

available for thom.
Let the Government

away with the idea that the more it ruises
the tariff tlie sooner will the country become

rich. but ftie rnasses will suffer. Let the Governient begin by doing away with our
economic ills. Let it be bold in that work,
as I hope it will be when the rcciprocity pact
is undcer negotiation.
In what I have said I have been animated
by good faith and by a patriotic desire te
see the British North America Act maintained unimpaired. In conclusion. I ask the
right honourable gentleman to devote all bis
ability to preserving it, and net to treat it as
an cia stic Constitution. Those who framed
tie British North America Act had regard to
the susceptibilities and the honest prejudices
of the various groups in the different provinces; and, I repeat, if you take out a brick
the whole edifice may ev entually collapse.
Hon. H. C. HOCIKN: Honourable members. I hesitate to ruplyv in a few sentences
to the Demiosthnes of Parliament, but I
think lie las the wrong view on this
question. Like him, I have been a stickler
for the prucservxation o the Constitution, but
I am firmI yv convinced that if the Fathers of
Confederation wer'e lere to-day, or could
give us their views in the present crisis. they
would not hesitate to interfere with provincial rights so far as they are concerned
with this piece of social legislation.
What Parliament is trying to do, as I
understand it, is to pass a law for the improvement of the conditions of the working
people in this country. That law cannot
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX.

be passed by one province alone; to be
effective it must be a federal matter; and,
knowing the logical mind of my French
Canadian friends from the province of Quebec, I find it difficult to believe that they
will feel that they are suffering any deprivation by reason of the Constitution being interpreted in the way that is proposed. If
there were anything in this to interfere with
the cherished rights of the rminority, conditions would be quite different. But there is
not. What it is proposed to interfere with
is the right of a province to say that the
Dominion shall net pass an Act covering the
whole country, for the amelioration of the
conditions of the working people of Canada.
I think my honourable friend has gone a
little too far in adhering to the Constitution
so rigidly as to oppose a general minimum
wage law and a general eight-hour-day law.
I cannot believe, honourable gentlemen, that
the people of this country want us to bo
splitting hairs on a constitutional point of
this kind when there is something offered
which gives promise of much better conditions than those under which we are living
to-day. So I would advise my honourable
friend, for whom I have a great admiration,
not to press this point of provincial rights
in respect to social legislation at this tinie.
We are to-day in a crisis as great as. or
grceatcr tihan, the one confronting Canada at
Confederation. We cannot go along in this
wa y. We must nike new laws and pass
new measures to reform our econoicne and
industrial systen in such a way as to provide
for the workers better conditions than they
now have.
If we followed the advice of my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Lemieux) we should
leave it open to one province to pass an
Act of one kind while another province
passed an Act of another kind, and thus
industry would bo placed on a competitive
basis within the Dominion. Surely that is
net wise. Surely that is net what mcîy honourable friend would like. Nevertheless, that
is what would result, and suci Acts eould
not wxork out satisfactorily to anyone. It
is bad enough for us, with an eight-hour day
and a minimum wage. to be in competition

with the whole world. lut to lae
the provinces of this country enacting different kinds
of legislition on the question would, to ny
mind, he an absurdîity.
I have no desire, and never did have any,
that the Constitution should be amended te
the detriment of the minority of this country. I do not think this legislation can be
regardcd as having any such effect. What
the people of Canada want is action. They

FEBRUARY 20, 1935
do flot want us to be splitting haire an a
constitutional question. They want some
action that will assure to thern better conditions of labour 'and a better chance ta earn
a livelihood for therneelves and their families;
and those are the things which are conteraplated and which, I think, w-ill be effected to
a very high degree.
I arn unable ta believe that aur friends the
working men af Quebec would agree ta the
blocking of this legislation by an insisteqice
upon the letter ai the bond of Confederation. Surely the British North Arnerica Act
s not like the laws of the Medes and Persiens. Conditions in this oountry have
changed, mnust change, and will change. If
we preserve ta the minorities the things they
cherish most, are we not keeping aur contract? Are we not honouring aur bond? If
wve vary it ta the extent ai passing a law
which. will be of benefit ta all the people,
regardlese af minorities, majorities, -or anything ai that sort, surely everyone will he
satisfied; and I do not think aur friends in
the province of Quebec would approve of any
action that would prevent this legislation
from gaing througb. As a rnatter ai fact,
the Government is cornmitted ta it, and I
do nat think the people cen be aroused by
eny appeel on a constitutional issue of this
kind. I think we have got past that stage,
honourable gentlemen.

Hon. Mr. DANDJRAJND: Then I suppose

of the Senate ta that feet.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The debate
an this resolution might reaeonably revolve
around two features, the merits oi the resolution itself, and the competence af Parliament ta eneet legislation contemplated by it.
As ta the first feature, until a iew moments
ega I hcd thought the-re wus no cause for
seriaus discussion. The morits of the resolutien, aside fromn the campetence ai Parliement. seemeci ta be universally ackawledgedi. But the honourable senatar fram

v'ersions~ whieh seemed to me ta disclose an
innate hostility to the resolution itself and ta
the state of social law which will resuit if
legisiation follows thereon. While 1 do flot
et ail doubt the sincerity of his apposition
to Parliament's assurning power te, pass that
law, I fear that his constitutional difficulties
are sarnewhat of a curtain to caver his
opposition to the law itself.
I arn not one of those who feel that we
should casually, cheerfully and lightly plunge
into this social legisiation, aside from its constitutional features. The step we are taking
is undoubtedly a seriaus one.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Hear, hear.
Right Ilon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: At the same
tirne I arn convineed. and have been for sorne
years, as evidenoed by speeches made in this
liau.s, that it is a necessary step, forced upon
us by an age of mechanization and the depressed sttec of vast masses of our peoplea condition common ta virtually ail the
world.
The honourable member says: "Do flot
bring upon us the new debt that wîll necesserily be incident to the creation of the
organization to put this law in effeet. Do
flot add that to our hardships. The proposed
law is no goad anyway for the man who is
out of wark. Go to it and cure our economie
ills. Give our people work. That~ is what
will help our country." It is easy ta say,
"Cure our econornic ills;" but it is inconsistent, and I think ebsurd, ta say that and
thon stand in the road of a cure as soon as
it is offered--to be general in your demand for
Elysiurn in the near future, but ta offer noa
means et ail ai reaching t-hat happy state.
The honourablýe member says that what is
proposed will not make work for anyibody,
but if a man who now works for twelve
hours will work for anly eight efter the Bill is
passedc, will there not be a half-day's work
lef t for enother man? How is work to be
secured for the idie twenty per cent cf our
people except by a reduction of hours of
laibour of the eighty per cent who are now
employed? The difficulty in the way is
that if one country takes this stoep ahead of
another. that other country has an edvantege
in competing in world markets. This, to
rny mind, is the difficulty, and this clone.
Canada's duty at this tirne is ta take ber
place in the rnarch af nations towards securing a social necessity. Canada bas been slow
ta take the step; other countries have been
slower still. Even Britain has not aeceded
ta this convention, and there are other countries, parts af the Empire, which have not
done so. I admit that we are taking a

92

SENATE

courageous, possibly a bold, step in walking
ahead of them; but if by our so doing they
are encouraged or induced to join the general
march toward lower hours of labour and a
shorter working week, surely we shall be helping toward employment of the many who
are to-day in the throes of distress resulting from idleness. I have no more to say
on the merits of the resolution itself. I
do not want to invite any opposition whatever, even though it miglit be of political
advantage to do so.
I know that the main difficulties surrounding the question are constitutional. They are
legal, and to honourable senators not trained
in the legal profession they may not be of
much interest and are perhaps difficult to
understand. Nevertheless, they are capable
of being understood by any honourable member of this House. They involve no legal
question beyond the comprehension of any
member.
With the assistance of honourable senators
who have preceded me, I am going to address
myself to the task of making plain this constitutional path. I approach it with a full
knowledge that it is difficult; that it is strewn
with decisions, some of them apparently conflicting; that it is clouded with doubts that
never should have existed; that shadows have
been cast across it-some of them unnecessarily, and in this debate-that never should
have been cast. So I commence by seeking
to remove encumbrances that litter our path.
The honourable senator from Rougemont
(Hon. Mr. Lemieux) is very fearful that the
compact of Confederation is to be broken,
the rights of minorities to bo impinged upon,
and generally that we are going to play fast
and loose with the terms of our Constitution
and the solemn compact it embodies. I want
to assure the honourable gentleman that there
is no thought farther from the mind of the
Government, and there is no possibility of a
precedent being created which could ever be
used for the purpose of invading those rights
and sacred privilceges he seeks to protect. He
says there are righits of race, of language, of
religion and of education upon which the
Fathers of Confederation compromised and
agreed, and that tihe compromise is now
embodied in the ,British North America Act.
He say s that if you seck to do what is proposed in the present instance under the guise
of treaty-making you sct a precedent under
which rights as between races, and minority
rights in respect of religion and education,
may some day also be impaired.
There is no reason for any such apprehension. Is it conceivable that rights of the
minority of Quebec, or rights of the minerRight Hon. Mr. MEIGIHEN.

ity of Ontario. should ever be madei
the
subject of a treaty between Canada and other
nations? What have other nations to Io with
these matters? How are they concerned in
them at all? These rights are nor proper
subjects for negotiation between nation-. and
they could not come within the four corners
of any treaty witi other powers.
A similar problem has been under discussion
in the United States. There is in the Constitution of that country a clause which says
thsat the United States of America may make
a treatv, and that this treaty, baving been
sanctioned by the Senate of the United States,
becomes the supreme law of the land. But
the courts of that country have held that
such matters as the constitution of a state
or the constitution of the country are essentially domestic matters, and cannot be
brought under the treaty-making power.
Only matters which are fit and proper subjects of treaty-making negotiations between
the United States and other powers caon b
brougit under the treaty-making power.
So my honourable friend's fears in this very
important regard are entirely without foundation.
Anotler enoumbrance-for I consider it no
more than that--which I would like to remove
is this. We are told: "You are inconsistent.
You, Mr. Meighen, were the head of a
Government which in 1920 accepted an Order
in Couniil recornmended by your Minister of
Justice, declaring that we in Canada were
not under obligation to do more than pass
on a convention to the heads of our provinces.
N ow you say we ougit to do more than
that. You also were in the House of Commons when it was determined to send this
question to the Supreme Court of Canada
and ask that court whether, with respect to
this draft convention, we were under obligation
to do more than submit it to the heads of
the provinces in this country. The Supreme
Court answered that that was the only obligation resting upon the Federal Covernment."
The honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Danduîrand) faces me with these two autioritics, the Supreme Court of Canada and my3self.
I have the highest regard for the eminence
of both authorities, but I am not going to
allow my frecdom of thought and determinalion to be impeded, at this time or an other
lime, even by them. Asssming that the
Supreme Court and I were rigit, that Parliament at that time was right, and that the
succeeding Prime Minister was right, the stand
taken to-day is not in the faintest degree
inconsistent wilth that taken in the past.
We are still right to-day, even if we were
riglt thon. But I do not want the House to

FEBRUARY 20, 1935
understand that after the much fuller consideration I have been able to give this
matter in the meantime, and especially in
the light of great intervening decisions
which have come to us, I am now of the
same opinion as in 1920. Frankly I want to
state that I am not. There is no reversal
of opinion necessary to justify the course
we are taking now. It is quite consistent
with the opinion prevailing then. I do not
believe I was right in 1920, nor do I believeand I say it with all diffidence and all respect
-that the Supreme Court was right in 1925;
but I intend to assume throughout virtually
the entire discussion that we both were right.
Ordinarily and historically matters concerning
hours of labour have been considered as within
provincial jurisdiction. That ordinarily and
primarily they are within that jurisdiction I
do not think tlhere is a question even yet;
but with the contention that in all respects
and from all, angles they are within it I am
in direct disagreement.
Now let us look at what happened. At the
Conference of Paris, which resulted in the
Treaty of Versailles, certain agreements were
concluded on the part of the aldied and associated powers, of which the British Empire was
one. France another, and so on. Among these
agreements, which are binding on all parties
who were signatory thereto, there was one
to create a League of Nations, and the
Covenant of the League formed the first
article of the Treaty of Versailles. In that
Covenant of the League these allied and
associated powers, including the British
Empire, made this declaration:
Subject to and in accordance with the provisions of international conventions existing or
liereafter to be agreed upon, the members of
the League will endeavour to secure and maintain fair and humane conditions of labour for
men, womuen and children, both in their own
countries and in all countries to which their
commercial and industrial relations extend.
As I say, this is part of the Covenant of
the League. The British Empire is a pa-rty
to the Treaty of Versailles. To the Covenant of the League the parties are the members of the British Empire and various other
nations. Canada is a member of the League
of Nations; so is Australia, and so is Great
Britain.
But it was the British Empire
which signed the Treaty of Versailles, and
the covenants of that treaty are binding
upon it.
Will my right
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX:
honourable friend permit a question? When,
the Right Hon. Mr. Doherty and the Hon.
Mr. Sifton signed in Paris in 1918, did they
sign as representatives of the Dominion of
Canada or as -members of the British Empire?

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They signed
as representatives of the Dominion of Canada. Others signed as representatives of the
other parts of the Empire, and the treaty
became binding on the Empire. The honourable gentleman will find that clearly
established in the judgment of Lord Sankey
in the aviation case. Among the provisions
of the treaty was one that the Supreme
Council would draft a convention on aviation
for signature by ail who would subscribe
thereto, parties to the treaty; and the conclusion is definitely stated by Lord Sankey
that the Treaty of Versailles is binding on
the British Empire. It becomes a treaty
binding on the British Empire because all
British countries authorized execution on
behalf of the Empire. Individually we are
members of the League of Nations, we take
our part independently there; but the covenants of the Treaty of Versailles bind the
British Empire, and of course bind Canada
as a part thereof.
Now I come to Part XIII of the Treaty of
Versailles, which has to do with labour. It
consists of forty articles, and is prefaced by
a preamble which reads:
Whereas the League of Nations has for its
object the establishment of universal peace,
and such a peace can be established only if it
is based on social justice;

And whereas

conditions

of labour

exist

involving such injustice, hardship and privation
to large numbers of people as to produce unrest
so great that the peace and harmony of the
world are imperilled; and an improvement of
those conditions is urgently required; as, for
example, by the regulation of the hours of
work, including the establishment of a maximum
working day and week, the regulation of the
labour supply, the prevention of unemployment,
the provision of an adequate living wage, the
protection of the worker against sickness,
disease and injury arising out of his employment, the protection of children, young persons
and women, provision for old age and injury,
protection of the interests of workers when
employed in countries other than their own,
recognition of the principle of freedom of association, the organization of vocational and
technical education and other measures;
Whereas also the failure of any nation to
adopt humane conditions of labour is an
obstacle in the way of other nations which
desire to improve the conditions in their own
countries;
The high contracting parties, moved by
sentiments of justice and humanity, as well as
by the desire to secure the permanent peace
t
of the world, agree · o the following.
There the British Empire agreed, and Canada was a full party to its decision, that
social injustices, the first named of which
were too long hours of labour, were such as
to impe-ril the contentment of masses of

94

SENATE

people and world peace. Such was in 1919
the stature of the problern now dealt with
by this resolution that it involved even the
highest of known subjects, the peace of the
world.
Then the Treaty of Versailles goes on to
say, in articles 387 to about 410, just how
these objectives are to be attained. Machinery is to be provided by way of an International Labour Organization, and definite
rights are given to members of the League
of Nations as constituent parts of that
Labour Organization.
It is provided in
article 405 that recommendations or conventions may be drawn up, passed by twothirds of a labour conference, and submitted by the members represented at that conference to the authorities competent to deal
with those conventions, in their respective
countries; then, if adopted by them, notification is to be made to the League of Nations,
and the pact is completed.
I shall deal no further with the contents
of the Treaty of Versailles at tiis monient,
but shall now st ek to relate what bas take n
place in this Dominion. The Department of
Justice set to work to decide just what had
to be done in respect of a convention which
was arrived at in Washington a few months
after the Treaty of Versailles was signed, and
in the same year. The treaty contained a
provision that the first conference of the
International Labour Organization should be
held at Washington, and that the first subject to be dealt witb. as specified in an annex,
should be that of hours of labour. The
treaty bad set out that all nations ouglit to
get together to attain the great goal of an
eight-bour day and a forty-eight-our week.
At this conference in Washington a draft
convention was framed and passed. Under
the provisions of article 405, to wbich I have
just referred, it had to be turned over by
the constituent members of the Labour Organization to those authorities competent to deal
with it in their respective countries. At the
moment, I am not going to debate what in
Canada is the authority competent to deal
with the convention.
Later I shall argue
tîat that authority is the Dominion Parliament, but just now I wish to say only that
the draft convention came to us from the
Washington conference, and it then became
the duty of the Federal Government to submit it to the authority or authorities competent to deal with it in our country. The
Justice Department submitted a memorandum
to the effect that ina-nuch as hours of labour
were provincial matters the authorities comRight Hton. Mr. MESGHEN.

petent to deal with the convention were the
provincial authoritiesSome Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:-and tha our
only obligation was to pass on this draft
convention to the provincial authorities. This
view was accepted by the Government of
the day, of which I was the head. Tbe convention was passed on to the Lieutenant
Governors of our provinces, and it bas lain
in the pockets of those Lieutenant Covernors
ever snce.
The next event occurred in 1925. when tle
Government of Mr. Mackenzie King referred
to the Supreme Court of Canada a series of
questions. I am sorry the questions were
drafted in that particular form. I was a
member of tbe House of Commons. and if I
was not favourable to the form of the questions then submitted to us, as I presume they
were, I should oif course have said se.
The first question took this form: when this
draft convention, made at Washington pursuant to the Treaty of Versailles. came into
the hands of our Government, what blization was it under with respect therete? The
Supreme Court answercd: it was under eblition only to send it to the autoitritie competent to deal vith the matters terIanin (ontained.
The niext quesi:on was: if thoe mate
are provineial, to what extent are they provincial? The Court answered: they are provincial except as to the emuployees on Dominion public works antd as to territoe
of
Canada not wilhin the boundaries of tie
provinces. In brief, the Supreme Court said:
"You are not under obligation to do more
than -ubittit the convention to the provincial
authorities. except in respect to your publie
works and your teritories."
Now, I ask the House to note the Supreme
Court answered, "That is the only obligation
you are under." The Supreme Court was
never asked whether under any circunmstances
the provinces of Canada could deal with the
matter. That, I think, it should have bnen
asked. It was not, and therefore that question was never dealt with.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Only the quetien of jurisdiction was submitted to the
Supreme Court.
Rigltt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
No; the
question of jurisciction in its fullest or useful
sense was not put at 'all. The only question
put was, wvhat is the obligation?
The
Supreme Court said, "The obligation is to

FEBRUARY 20, 1935
pass the convention on to the authorities."
The fair inference from its findings is that
the competent authorities are provincial. So
in effect the Suprame Court said, "Pass if on
to the authorities, and, having done that, you
do flot have to do anything more."
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Is the right honourable gentleman going to deal with section
132 of the British North Amarica Acf?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I arn cartainly coming to that.
Assume the Supreme Court was right. I
assume we were right in 1920 and that the
Governmenf of Mr. Mackenzie King was right
in 1925, and I arn going to argue whether we
have power to pass this resolution and introduce legislation to give if effeet.
I take the fint ground in respect of section
91, the trade and commerce provision. My
second ground will be under section 132, just
menfioned by the honourable senator from
Parkdale. Involved in the latter will be t.he
powers, general and residuary, stated as halonginig to the Dominion, in the firsf part of
section 91.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
invade exclusive privileges.

They do not

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am flot
arguing if yef; I amn only giving the headings
under which I purpose to argue this question.
First, I believa there is power under the
trade and commerce part of section 91. The
section gives the Dominion jurisdiction over
trade and commerce (paragraph 2), postal
service (paragraph 5), and so on.
Now, I know that commencing in 1881 with
the Citizens' Insurance case mentioned by
my honourable friand from Rougemont (Hon.
Mr. Lamieux), the Privy Council for nearly
forty years decided every question in respect
of trade and commerce in favour of the
provinces. But in those years the question
decided was not whether the Dominion might
properly have legislated in a general way on
It was
matters of trade and commerce
always specifically a question whefher a
province was within ifs rights in legislating
on some matter affecting trade and commerce.
Counsel for the Dominion argued: "Why,
no, the provinces were not within their rights;
trade and commerce is within our j urisdiction."
,But the Privy Council said: "They are quit a
within their rights. Thýey are d-ealing 'with
civil rights, wifh something local and private,*
tiherecfore it comas within paragrapL 13 or
16 of section 92."
Then two cases of another character carni
befora the Privy Council. These involved

95

the powe.r of tihe Dominion in respect of trade
an.d commerce. Again, I adimit, both cases
were decided against the Dominion. One was
the Board of Commerce case; the other
was the Insurance casa. In bath cases the
Dominiion had soughf to deal with particular
trades, and not with al frades alika
in a Canadian-wide rathar than in a parochial
fashion. Neyer yet has a case coma before
the Privy Council of the Empire in which the
Dominion's righf was challenged where the
Dominion had dealt with trade and commerce
in a general Canadian-wide foirm.
The words "trade and commerce" in paragraph 2 of section 91 mean either something
or nothing. I affirmn that the inference to ha
drawn from. every judgment of the Privy
Council is that if the Dominion Parliament
seaks to legislate on trade and commerce ii
a Canadian-wide fashion it is within its powax.
In the vary case so much in evidence here,
thaf of aviation, Lord Sankey said, "Take
the trade and commerce provisions of section
91, and aven there you have virtually evarything that the Dominion of Canada has
sought to do under its aviation law." Lord
Sankey could not say that as respects the
aviation law if hae could not also say it with
respect fa a general law affecting hours of
labour, and therafore affecting trade and commerce as a whole. Traated in tihe spirit of
that language, it is a Dominion power.
Trade and commerce is, I submit, treafed
in the spirit of that language in the most
general way in the world hy the legislation
contemplated hy this resolution. This resolotion deals witih hours of labour. 'Nofhing
more ganerally affectes trade and commerce
than hours of labour. Nothing could ha more
genaral in its affect on trade and com3merce
than a general eut in thse hours of labour in
Canada. Consequently 1 say it is within
our power undar that provision, and if
wa deal with it as we proposa to do here,
we ýcan r'xn the gauntlet of the Privy Couneil.
But now I corne to a section of thse argument in which wa are less encumbered by
decisions of the past, in respect of which
îndeed 1 can find no decîsion that blocks aur
way af all. And I assume that honourable
gentlemen are desirous not of seeing thse way
hlocked, but of finding a passage through.
I assume also that honourable gentlemen are
agreed that when we said there was a tremendous reform to be achiaved, and f0 that
end signed tIsa Treaty of Versailles, we meant
what we said. Wa wanf to find a passage
through if we can, and do not feel happy when
obstructions are placed in our pafJh.

96

SENATE

I come, then, to what seems to me a clear
road through the difficulty-a road which
is neither encumbered nor clouded by
any decision in all the jurisprudence of this
country. Section 132 of the British North
America Act, which honourable gentlemen will
note is a long way from sections 91 and 92,
is even geographically distant from them, says
that the Dominion shall have power to perform the obligations of Canada under any
treaty of the British Empire, and to perform
any obligation that may be binding on any
province under any treaty, the provinces having previously been self-governing colonies.
The power to effect the performance of any
Empire treaty, in so far as Canada was concerned, was thus vested in the Parliament of
Canada. Possibly the British Government
in 1867 might have retained that power to
carry out treaties, which it alone at that time
could make. But section 132 provides rather
-probably at the instance of representatives
of our country-that the performance should
be binding upon us. It always was binding
upon us, no matter how it was to be performed ; hut lhe performance of it should
rest with us.
Hon. :Mr.
The right bonTLEMIEUX:
ourable gentlian will pardon me if I interrupt him. Does lie contend that Canada can
legislate for the Empire?
Right ion. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Oh, no. The
bonourable gentleman has not followed me.
I an now dealing with section 132 of the
British North America Act, which gives the
Parli:nient of Ca-ida power to see to the
perfornance, so far as it concerns Canada,
of any obligation resting on the Empire.
Whethrr hitherto it had been a provincial
obligation or not, the responsibility for
its performance thereafter was to be the
Dominion's responsibility. The honourable
erntieman follows me. J know. In so far a,
there was an Empire obligation affecting Cauacla. the Dominion was chargeci witb carrying
it out as respects the Dominion, and ther-'
was no charge on any province at al], even
though the province up to that time had been
a party charged with the performance of the
obligation.
Now J couie to the point, how does this
help us in the present instance. At this stage
it does not lelp us at all if we assume the
Supremie Court was riglht in 1925 and tbat our
only obligation was to pass this draft convention on to the Lieutenant Governors of our
provinces. But there can be another stage,
and that stage will be reached just as soon as
this resolution is passed and ratification beRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

comes complete. Once there is a complete
ratification of the subconvention, then it becomes a treaty and the obligation is upon us.
It is a treaty arising out of an Empire obligation made under the Treaty of Versailles.
The language used in section 132 is that
Canada is charged with the performance of
any obligation arising out of a treaty to which
the Empire is a party. The Empire is a
party to the Treaty of Versailles This subconvention arises out of it, and by virtue of
the treaty and of our ratification of the subconvention the Parliament of Canada is under
132 charged with the carrying out of the
obligations there assumed.
Let me repeat. As soon as we approve of
the subconvention submittcd to us, then that
subconvention becomes a treaty and we are
bound to carry it througi. That treaty arises
out of the Treaty of Versailles, to which the
Empire is a party, and under section 132 not
only are we empowered to carry it out, but
xe are charged with the responsibility, the
obligation that we took upon ourselves to
carry it out. I ask honourable members if
it could very well have been otherwise. Do
honourable members really and sincerely suggest-ieaving the Empire aside, now that
Canada has reached the stature of nationhood
-that obligations that rest on Canada as a
whole, to carry out what we bind ourselves to
do, should be left to the individual eccentricities and the different and conflicting opinions
of nine provinces? Or do they suggest that
hereafter, though we are a nation, we cannot
enter into an obligation with respect to something that ordinarily is a provincial prerogative? If that is the case, we are not a
nation at all; we are an underprivileged
lefective in the family of nations, we are a
pcople without the essence of nationhood in
eur blood.
Unless we are able to make
treaties on ail matters which are properly the
-ubjcict of treaty-making with other poxvers,
wiat is the use of our boasting that we are
a nation?
That brings me to another point. If you
assume that we cannot come under section 132
at all, it really does not matter in the least,
as was disclosecd and made abundantly clear
in the radio case. In the radio case the

with regard to the subjects stated in section
91. And, secondly, in legislating on matters
covered by section 91 we can bring in other
matters ancillary or necessarily incidental to
them; because wherever the end is declared
justifiable, the means are implied.
Now I come to the third proposition, which
is perhaps of the greatest consequence. This,
like the previous one, was cited by the honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock). It reads:
The general power of legislation conferred
upon the Parliament of the Dominion by section
91 of the Act in supplement of the power to
subjects expressly enulegislate upon the
merated must be strictly confined to such matters
as are unquestionably of national interest and
importance, and must not trench on any of the
subjects enumerated in section 92, as within
the scope of provincial legislation, unless these
matters have attained such dimensions as to
affect the body politic of the Dominion.
This interpretation was not new in 1931.
These four propositions have evolved from
a long series of findings over forty years.
They are interpretations deemed essential in
order that the great purposes of the pact of
Confederation might be kept in view in the
light of advancing and expanding circumstances and conditions. Under the third proposition which I read, though a subject may
come within the exclusively provincial purview of section 92, if it lias attained such
consequence and stature as to affect the body
politic of the Dominion, then the Federal
Parliament bas power to legislate upon it.
Now I ask honourable members to reflect
upon this question. Docs that third proposition a'pply in the present instance or does it
not? Has this matter of hours of labour
reached sucli a stature that it affects the
body politie of the Dominion? Regardless
of whether I am wrong as to trade and commerce, and as to other points, does the matter
come within that proposition? Is it of such
consequence, or is it a local and private
matter, affecting perhaps civil rights and
nothing more? It is fifteen years since we
became a party to the Treaty of Versailles
and declared that this question of hours of
labour was of such magnitude as to throw
the world into unrest and imperil international peace. What is the importance of that
subject to-day? Are we to go before the
Privy Council and say that even though we
signed that solemn Treaty of Versailles we
are afraid to legislate upon this matter of
hours of labour because it is of merely private
and local character and bas not attained such
a stature that under the findings of the Privy
Council we can deal with it as a matter for
Riglt Hon. MIr. MEIGHEN.

the Dominion? Surely we cannot take tlat
position.
Most infallibly, under the determination of
Lord Sankey in 1931, approved by Lord
Dunedin in 1932, even though we assume we
are wrong in respect to trade and commerce,
even thougli we assume that the Supreme
Court was right in 1925 and I was riglt in
1920, and even though we assume that because there is no antecedent Empire treaty
we cannot come in under section 132, we still
have power under the general and residuary
clauses of section 91. Althougli it may trench
upon provincial jurisdiction, we may still
legislate, because the matter, baving reached
the magnitude of Canadian interest and
Canadian importance, must be determined by
the Canadian people. You are bound all the
more to come to that conclusion because we
have already said for a decade and a half
that the matter was not only national, it was
international and of so great consequence
that unless early dealt with it would imperil
the peace of the world.
This is the position we are in. Under the
trade and commerce provision I claim we
have the power. Not with more confidence,
but because we are impeded by no decisions
of the past, I claim that we undoubtedly have
the power under section 132, especially as
that section is interpreted in the radio case.
There it was held we had all the powers
incident to nationhood, and therefore the
power to enforce our treaties, and that those
powers were ours even had there been no
antecedent Empire treaty behind as a background for our action.
Before I close I should like to discuss the
question that I introduced early in this
address. whether we have been rigbt all along
in our conclusion that, so far as our obligations went, we had only to refer this matter
to the Lieutenant Governors of the provinces.
I think I have shown that immediately we
pass this resolution and ratify this subconvention we bring upon ourselves more obligations. But I do not think we were rigbt in
that conclusion. Let honourable members
reflect where we should be if that were the
case.
The League of ýNations says to us:
"You signed the Treaty of Versailles. You
declared this matter was vital and pressing
for the solution of the social unrest of the
world and the fortification of the world against
war, and now you tell us that though you
believed that was essential, a-Il you have to
do is just to pass on this subconvention to
the Lieutenant Governors of your provinces.
Then you come to us and say, 'We have done

FEBRUARY 20, 1935
everything we have to do. We received the
subconvention into our hands, we mailed it
to the Lieutenant Governors, we paid the
postage, and that ends all our duties. We
are done."' Would honourable members like
their country to be placed in that position?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But has not
Canada done more in the execution of the
obligation than Great Britain herself?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Perhaps so.
I am not saying there is not some obligation
on Britain. I believe there is. I certainly
could not stand up in the British Parliament
and defend the, dilatoriness with which this
matter has been treated there. But I am
not the custodian of Britain's duties. I am
the custodian, in part, of Canada's duties,
and I am proud that Canada is going ta lead
the way in the vindication of ber position
and the redemption of her pledges. I shall
not be ashamed if I find myself confronted
with the decision I came to years ago, after
less deliberation than I have taken to come
to this decision to-day.
Let honourable members not think I am in
conflict with what I stated on another phase
in 1924. The, honourable member from Rougemont quoted me as having said at that time,
"You must not use one power in order to
bring another power under your prerogative."
I said that you could not, and you should not,
pass a law declaring a work to be for the general advantage of Canada just to obtain jurisdiction over it. I have said in this House
repeatedly, and also in the other House, that
you must not make something a subject of
criminal legislat-ion just to get jurisdiction
over it. That conduct is unworthy of any
country. When we in this Parliament sought
to get jurisdiction over insurance by declaring
any violation of our law to be a criminal
offence, the Privy Council rightly answered:
"No, we will not permit you to adopt any
subterfuge, any circuities or any angularities
in order to invade the sacred provisions of
the British North America Act. This contemplated violation of your law is not essentially criminal. You are making it criminal
only in order to bring to yourselves jurisdiction. We say you nay." Similarly, if we
declared something to be for the general
advantage of Canada merely for the obvious
purpose of invading the jurisdiction of the
provinces, the Privy Council would again
say nay to us. That is what I declared in
1925. We will not do that. And if we ever
go a step further and, in the guise of our
treaty-making power, make some arrangement, say with Austria, under which we
would take away the language rights of the
province of Quebec, the Privy Council will
92584-7j

99

tell us, "You are making this a treaty obligation only in order to assume a power that
you do not possess, and we will not let you
do it." They will answer us in that matter
in just the same way as they did in respect
of our alleged criminal legislation in 1923.
They will answer us in just the same way
that I said I should answer, when I made
the speech to which the honourable member
has referred. They will see to it that we
have regard to our real rights under the Act.
They always have done so, and always will.
Now I ask honourable members for permission to adjourn the debate until we meet
again to-morrow, when I shall discuss one
question, and one only, namely, whether we
have been right in dealing with this subject
as we have done. Maybe it would have been
better to invite the provinces to act, to give
them at least a reasonable time, and be
patient. But I am going to argue, and I shall
do so with great confidence, that this country
never had the right to look to the provinces
at all with respect to any matter involving
the discharge of a treaty obligation; and that
under article 405 we never were expected to
do so. Under the provisions of that article
the authorities to whom we should have submitted that subconvention were the authorities competent to deal with it. That is
exactly what the language calls for. Does
anybody for a moment suggest that the
authorities competent to deal with the subconvention submitted to Canada are the provincial authorities? They may be competent
to deal with matters dealt with in the subconvention, but obviously, manifestly and
finally, they are not the authorities competent
to deal with and approve of the subconvention
itself. This, article 405 says, is to be submitted to "the authority or authorities within
whose competence the matter lies"; and, if
those authorities approve, the Secretary-General is to be informed.

So under that clause the authority or authorities must be surb as is or are able to

it is communicated to the Secretary-General.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am net
afraid of having been wrong long ago, but
I am afraid te be wrong now. I have had
some time to think over this question and
some light bas been tbrown upon it. The
honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
said yesterday that the light had been a
long time reaching us, because the last judgment on federal jurisdiction was given in
1932. That statement does not come with
the best of grace froin one of those who are
still in darkness bound. The ligbt has not
reached them yet.
Hon. Mr. POPE: No, and it never will.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is not what
I said in 1920 or 1925 that matters. If I was
wrong, the succeeding Government was wrong
also. I believe that we both were sincerely
wrong. But it does net follow that the Government of to-day is wrong. On the contrary,
it is right.
The clause which I was reading states:
In the case of a federal state, the power of
which to enter into conventions on labour
matters is subject 'to limitations, it shall be in
the discretion of that Government to treat a
draft convention to which such limitations apply
as a recommendation only. and the provisions of
this article with respect to recommendations
shail apply in such case.
It is true that Canada is a federal state,
but it is not a federal state whose power to
enter into conventions on labour matters is
Its
subject to any limitations whatever.
power in this respect is certainly not subject
to any limitation whcn the-se matters are of
such importance as to affect the body politic
of the Dominion. Manîifestly we cannot hide
under the provisions of article 405. J do not
want to crawl in the dark under that provision. nor do I think it would give shselter to
anyone. for we are not suci a federal state
as is described there. But the Empire is
such a iederal state, for its powcrs to deal
with conventions on labour matters for the
whole Empire are subject to limitations.
Canada, fer instance, would have to pass

Possibly Germany was another suci fideral

the convention, as a convention, is the Parliaiment of Canada. The brwo branches of
Parliament were the authorities to whom that
convention should have been suhmitted.
And 1 arn proud it is so. This country
having made a treaty, we do not want it to
stand by in trernbling impotence and say:
"We are sorry, but unless the conflicting
interests of our provinces are ail brought jnto
ha.rrony we cannot do anything about it.
Our wings are clipped. We are really not
a nation. We are only a pretence. It is truc
we oan make and sign any arrangement, but
we cannot carry it out. We cannot ratify it
-we cannot make it binding."
*According to some of my honourable
friends opposite we have Vo submit the convention, not Vo the competent authority, the
whole country, but Vo the 'long range of nine
provinces. We have done that. We have
waited flfteen years for action by one provinice, and no action has corne. How long
should we have Vo wait for action by the
'whole nine?
This is the position honourable members
argue we have Vo stay in. If we try Vo geV
out of it we are Vold that we are challenging the sacred pact of 'Confederation. But
we are only utilizing that great instrument.
I plead with honourable members, let us hold
the British North America Act in the reverence Vo whieh its age, its genius and it.s great
authority entitie it. But let -us realize that it

On the motion Vo adjourn:
Hon. G. LYNCH-STAUNTON : I should
like Vo direct the attention of hon ourable
members Vo a paragraph in the Ottawa
Journal of to-day, and Vo ask a question
thereon. This is the paragraph:

102

SENATE

Somebody has discovered that something like
a billion dollars of debt charged to the Canadial National Railways is duplicated in the
debt of the Dominion. that we are thus made
to seemi to ow-e a billion more than we do owe.
The matter. of course, isn't as solemn as it
seemns, seeing that we don't pay any interest
on the extra billion we charge ourselves. On
the other hand. it is often bad to have a
thing merely look bad; certainly it is not going
to do us any good to be imagining that we owe
a billion dollars more than we do owe, or to
have others imagining it.
I have always understood that we were
paying interest on 85,0W000.000 between the
Dominion and the railway, and I should like
to ask the -Government this question: What
is the amount of the combined Dominion and
Canadian National Railways debts which
either or both have contracted to repay, or
on which either or both are liable to pay
interest?
I think it is of great importance that it
should be shown, if it is so. that the Canadian
National Railways debt and the debt of Canada combined are a billion dollars less than
public opinion seems to think they are.

INQUIRY FOR RETURN

Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I had an inquiry
on the Order Paper, but it was changed into

an order for a return.

It is said that on a

certain occasion when the widow of the Duke

of Marlborough asked her sister if she saw
anything coming, she answered, "No, I do
not see anything coming." Neither do I see
anything coming in the shape of an answer
to my inquiry. The right honourable leader
of the House has told me that three departments are concerned in the preparation of
the answer. If lie will only give me the

names of the departments in question I will
go to each and find out who is holding up
the answer.
I gave

Honourable
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK:
senators, I feel somewhat embarrassed in
speaking to this motion. Its sponsor asked
me if I would second it, and of course I
said I would. I think there is sufficient in
the motion to warrant its earnest consideration by every honourable member, but, remembering the old adage about the ostrich
hiding its head when danger threatens, and
remembering also that human nature is pretty
much the same in Canada as elsewhere, I
realize that we frequently act on the principle
that sufficient unto the day is the evil
thereof.
If this motion had been before the Parliament of Canada, let us say, in June or
July, 1914, and had been adopted, I do not
think it is unfair to suggest that Canada
to-day would be in a very different position.
I do not suggest for one moment that there
would not have been as great a rallying to
the standard in support of the British Empire
and, as was believed at the time, the hopes
of the peoples of the world. However, I
realize that probably honourable members da
not want to discuss this motion. When,
some few days ago, I moved the adjournment
of the debate I did so because it seemed to
me the motion was going to fall without
further discussion, although in my opinion
it raises some of the most important questions confronting Canada to-day.
The honourable senator from Rougemont
(Hon. Mr. Lemieux), who is not in his seat
to-day, in discussing the eight-hour resolution
that was before us the 'other day-which was
adopted in Washington some sixteen years
ago and was submitted for our consideration
fifteen years after it should have reached ussaid:
I wonder whether my right honourable
friendreferring to the leader of the Senate (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen)
-realizes that when those social reforms have
1hall
been in operation a' very short time we
have about 25 per cent of the populution maintaining the other 75 Ver cent.
That was a frank and honest recognition,
backed by facts, of conditions as they exist
in Canada to-day. All right; carrying that
percentage and that comparison a little
further, to the resolution now before us, is
it unfair for us to assume that if this motion
in its entirety were submitted to the people
of Canada by means of a referendum, 85 per
cent of them would vote in favour of it?
That the other 15 per cent could hardly be
expected to do so would be, I think, admitted.
Why? Because in many cases they might
hope to profit out of a war in the future, if

lua

SENATE

it should come, as they have done in the past.
Some of the fortunes of men in this Canada
of ours have been made through the bloodshed and suffering of fellow Canadians, or by
reason of conditions that brought about that
blioodshed and suffering.
I have undertaken to divide this motion,
which I think is of great importance to the
people of Canada, into the seven paragraphs
which appear in it.
The first paragraph
reads:
That in the opinion of this House, should
Canada ever again be at war with one or more
nations she shall wage it with every ounce of
her strength in man and material power.
As a Canadian who knows as much, I think,
as any other member of this House about
the meaning of the misfortunes of war, and as
one who bas been handicapped by them since
babyhood, I venture the opinion that we,
one and all, would subscribe to that first
paragraph. Of course Canada would rally,
in a just cau'e, with every ounce of ber
strength in men and material power to the
defence of Canada or of the Empire. I think
that goes without saying. We ncd no furbher
evidence of what we would do than the
results that came to Canada and the suffering
that was visited upon Canadians as a consequence of the last war.
The next paragraph reads:
That the declaration of war or the beginning
of hostilities shall be folloiwed immediately by
the mobilization and the conscription of all the
human power and all the inaterial wealth of the
nation.
As a very ordinary citizen I ask myself why
this should net be so, and I think that 85
per cent of the Canadian people, if thev had
an opportunity to express themselves by
means of a referendum, would subscribe to
that second paragraph and say: "Yes, that is
the proper thing to do. Play no faviourites."
Then we come to the third paragraph:
That a War Council representing all the
provinces and the Government shall b fo rmed
and shall have supreme control of all war
activities and orders.
I do not particularly subscribe to that. I
am not sure that it would be the best way
to maintain the timely supervision that would
be necessary in order te wage war equitably
and properly on behalf of Canada. I did not
help to prepare the resolution, and I think
that possibly the third paragraph might have
been considerably improved. The thought
contained in it is all to the good-that a
War Council, representative of all classes of
Canadian citizenship, should be formed to
assume supreme control over all war activities
and orders.

Nou.

Mr. MURDOCK.

Then we come to the fourth paragraph:
That said Council shall have the poiwer to
assign every man and woman in Canada to
whatever position it thinks they are best
qualified te fill, but making as few changes as
possible in the daily occupations of the people.
That is quite logical and sensible, I think, and
would have been extremely helpful to this
Canada of ours if it had been adopted and put
into effect in the first part of 1914.
The fifth paragraph says:
That the wages, salary or incomeAnd this, by the way, is a touching paragraph,
and I know some of the distinguished niembers
of this House would not agree with it.
That the wages, salary or income for personal

use or retention of no person in the Dominion

from the Governor General dow, including the
officers of the Army, shall be greater than the
pay of the comnion soldier in the field. plus a
reasonable amount for dependents.
May I as a Canadian ask why this should not
be so? I say again that if such a proposal
were submitted to the people of Canada 85 per
cent of them would subscribe to it. I realize
that it would make impossible the creation
and maintenance of the more or less highclass officers' mess as distinguished from the
canteen of the common soldier. I realize that
some honourable gentlemen sitting on the
other side of the House, in looking across at
the picture on the wall behind me, would be
able to visualize officers in the surroundings
in which they see the poorer private soldiers.
I know that such a condition would be a
radical departure from what heretofore has
been regarded as proper, and I know there
are distinguished gentlemen who will say that
it would be contrary to all rules of discipline.
I know that a hundred and one fairly good
and logical arguments can be made against
such a proposal, but to my mind the question
is: what would the people of Canada think
about it in the light of the knowledge which
they now have with respect to the 600.000
Canadians who, out of a population of 10,000,000, went overseas, 60,000 of them never
to come back, and with respect to the couple
of billions of dollars of debt that we are now
told is hanging around the necks of our people? What would the people of Canada say
about this proposal? Would they not, after
taking into careful consideration all the objections that could be produced against such a
proposal, say: "It is playing the game fairly
as between Canadians, and this is what we
should do."
I have not got to the time of life wien I
expect a substantial number of honourable
members of this House to accept my vierws

I tiiink they would. And whom are we repre-' nting?
For whom are we speaking? Whence
comes the money that pays the indemnity

While I am speaking, may I digress for a
moment to touch upon a question that we
were talking about last week, the eight-hour
day. I think, though I hope I am mistaken,
thliat possibly some distinguisled gentlemen
lC just as much opposed to the cight-hour
day now as I know they were a few years ago.
What about the eight-hour day? And what
about the people of Canada, who are paying

first month the Senate was sitting, in the
present session, we worked seven hours and
tlirty-two minutes? Cheek up and see how
iar to the fact I am. Yet there are some
Sentlemen who think t.hat is all right, because we are of the elect, of the chosen few.
But some of those very gentlemen would say,
a they have been saying for many years:
"Never mind the eight-hour day. We are
not going to subscribe to that. Labour is
liappier and better off when it is working."
Let us pass along to the seventh and last
paragraph of the resolution:
That all the expenses of the war and of
leiobilization shall be met by taxation and
capital levies, so that at the end of the war
and of demobilization the debt of the country
woul(

J am net sure that that could be done, but
ii it is at all possible if should be done, and
I felu quite confidlent that, given the opport unity, 85 per cent of our people would vote
to try it out.
Some few months ago I was talking to a
very distinguished and wealthy citizen, one
whlo, I am satisfied, made his money honestly,
judged by the standards we apply to the
making of money. He told me that he was
paying income tax on about $250,000 a year,
and he assured me positively-I could hardly
credit bis statement-that if every income
tixpayer were " on the level " with his conscience and the Government the debt of
Canada would be wiped out. Honourable
members will take the statement for what
it may be worth, but that was his positive
deelaration to me; and he repeated it. He
indicated the various methods resorted to
to evade the payment of income tax. I
believe there is a great deal in the contention
that the financial condition of the Dominion
would net be what it is to-day if every
Canadian in the higher walks of life had
played the game as unselfishly and as willHion. Mr. MURDOCK.

ingly as the tens of thousands of our soldiers
who died in the mud and blood of Flanders.
When we come to consider whether this
motion should take up the time of the Senate,
can we for a moment doubt what would be
the viewpoint of the mothers of the 60,000
men who gave up their lives in the last war,
and the mothers of the tens of thousands
who returned to them crippled and in many
cases useless for the rest of their lives? How
would they vote if they were passing judgment upon this motion? What would be
the vote of our boys who when eiglit, ten
and twelve years of age saw their fathers
go away to the last war, never to return;
boys who now have reached manhood, and
liad hoped to carry on as reputable citizens,
but find themselves denied the opportunities
of work--find Canada loaded down with
debt? How, I ask, would those who have
now come to the voting age deal with this
motion? I do net think the youth of Canada
are one whit less courageous to-day than were
their brothers in 1914 when they rallied to
the support of Canada and the Empire in
a just war. But I think those young men
would like, before they start in on what
might bc termed "the last round-up," an
opportunity to apportion responsibility for
the bloodsied and the distress and all the
other horrors that follow in the train of
war. Then how would the votes be recorded
of the thousands of young people, now
almost at the voting age, who only hazily
remember their fathers, who went te France
and never came back? And the thousands
of widows, in many cases left te plead for
an opportunity te do some little remunerative work, to which they would not have
liad to resort liad the bread-winner not been
sacrificed in the service of his country-how
would they vote?
Would it not be a splendid tonie for
humanity for Canadians te subsoribe to the
principle outlined in this motion, the maintenance of a common lot for the highest and
the lowest? Would it not place them on a
pedestal in the estimation of the world? In
flic siglit of Heaven we are all made of the
same flesh and blood. Were this principle
adopted, there would bc no favouritism, no
discrimination in war-time, such as has obtained in the past under our present system.
Further, I submit that by adopting this
motion we should, as Canadians, be sub
scribing 100 per cent to the principles underlying the Treaty of Versailles, which treaty
was signed by the representatives of Canada.
This is one of those principles:

FEBRUARY 27, 1935

Conditions of labour exist involving such
injustice. hardship and privation to large
inmbers of people as to produce unrest s0
great that the peace and harmony of the world
are imperilled.
Such was the condition in 1919. We migbt
reasonably have anticipated that within a
reasonable time after the signing of the
treaty that condition would cease. But today in various parts of the worlid, yes, in
this Canada of ours, it stili persists. The
acceptanco o!f this motion would, it seems to
,in, give a Practical demonstration of the
sinceritv o.f our adherence to, the Treaty of
Peace.
That treaty also contained this proposai:
The prevention of unemploymient, the provision of an adequate living wage, the protection of the worker against sickness, disease
and injuir. arising out of bis employment. the
protection of children, young persons and
wIeN,
provision for old age and injury, protection of the in-terests of workers when

eiployed in countries other than their own.
Almost sixt-een years have gone by since the

trcaty wvas signed, but nothing substantiai
lias been donc to make effective the principles
there laid down. I ar n ot seeking in the
siightest degree to disparage the social legislation no'w bof ore Parliament. 1 hope we
shall ho aible to go the limit to acoomplish
what we shouid have accomplisbed fifteen
years ago. I shail flot worry very much

whence cornes just, decent and fair treatment
for the workers of Canada, so long as it cornes
in full measure.
In expressing these few thoughts I fear I
have digressed somewhat from the motion
before us. 1t, is my earnest hope that some
of the distinguished members of this House,
far more aible than I amn, will discuas this
motion l'ogieally and consistently, with due
regard for the rights of Canada's citizens.

should again befaîl this country. 1 shall not
discuss the motion paragraph by paragrapb
as my honourable friend bias done, but shall

10

simply content myýsoîf with indicatîng tbe
particular paragrapbs with whicb I do flot

agree. The remainder will ho agreeable to
me.
Wben the bonourable senator from. Kings
(Hon. Mr. Hughes), the mýover of the resolution, asks that, a War Council representing ail
the provinces sbould be called into 'being for
the purpose of directing our war activities,
I cannot agree with him. I have in vain
searched- bis address to find some reasons wby
sucb a proposal should ho ýcarried into effect.
We bave in this democratie country of ours
a Govornment which i.s drawn drom the ranks
of the members elected hy the people. The
Government is fully and complietely representative of the nation. Why, thon, should
my bonourable friend in bis motion dlai-m
that a War Council should ho oonstituted?
We as a country bave, unfortunately, experionced war. From 1914 to 1918 tihe direction of our armed forces ongaged in the conflict overseas was consigned to the Government

of the day, and, apart from a few crîticismns
such as are bound to arise, it seems tbat the
Government of the day properly disoharged
the duties whicb, it was called upon to perf orm. So I repeat that I do not agree witb
my honourable friend as to that paragraph.
Paragraph 4 is only a corollary of paragraph 3. It deals witb the power that this
War Coun-cil should bave.
One paragraph with whicb I agree partieularly is that wbich sets out that no person
in Canada shahl receive as a reward more
than any other person. If there is, honourable
senators, a duty that is sacred by its very
nature, it is the duty of protecting tthe firesides and maintaining the integrity of a
country. In such a case no man should receive a greater reward or recompense than
anotber.
If is stated in the first paragraph of my
bonourable friend's motion that in case of
war Canada wiil have recourse f0 ail bier
resources in order f0 discharge the responsibilities incurred by the war thon in progress.
This seems to hoe a superfluous paragraph. If
a person is in the centre of a bouse in flames,
does hie require any special direction or guidance as to wbat to do? The first instinct
of that person will be scîf-preservation. The
love of life itself is a light that hurns in every
man's bosom, and if this country were
suddenly drawn inýto the vortex of war, who
doubts for one moment that it would have recourse to ail its resourcos in men and money

and ail ifs other resources in order to protect
its territory and its citizens? I repeat that I
do not fbink this first paragraph is of importance.

SENATE

That Canada is a peaceful country is well
known. Her longing for peace has been proclaimed in international gatherings in London,
Paris and Geneva. Thanks to the representatives of Canada at · hese various conferences,
t
our country enjoys throughout the wide world
the reputation of being a leader on the path
of peace. But love of one's country or love
of peace does not preclude a reasonable preparation for war.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: My honourable friend
from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) a moment
ago made allusion to the amount of money
spent annually by Canada for war purposes.
To many people it may appear large. It may
not be too much. The prime duty of a Government is to protect its citizens and its territory. The Romans, even at the height of
their power, had an adage-and as my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Murdock) referred
to an adage a moment ago, I may be permitted to refer to this: si vis pacem, para
bellum.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Si vis pacem, para
bellum.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: I am very glad to
have my honourable friend belp me along.
Translated, this means, if you desire peace,
prepare for war.
Canada, thanks to her geographical situation, is likely to enjoy peace for ever. On
the north, on the east and on the west our
neighbours are very remote, and to the south
there lies a country which bas demonstrated
its love for peace. The United States of
America have been at peace, with the exception of the World War, for well-nigh a
century. The love of peace in that country
has penetrated not only the halls of government, one might say, but every household and
the heart of every citizen of the great republic.
The only barrier, if I may use the expression,
existing between that great republic and ourselves is a line drawn on the map.
However, the history of the world during
the last twenty-five years contains a very
powerful lesson and a very serious warning. If
you take the first fourteen or fifteen years of
this century what do you find? If it bad
been the privilege of honourable members of
the Senate to travel through the continent of
Europe, say in the years from 1905 to 1912,
what spectacle would they have been called
upon to behold? They would have seen a
very strenuous preparation for war in most
of the countries of Europe, particularly in
Germany, where one could not travel without hearing the clanking of swords on
Hon. Mr. BELAND.

the
sides
of hundreds
and
thousands
of officers, and the dreary thud of the
goose-step of millions of men on the sod.
It was evident then that Germany was
feverishly preparing for war, and one could
not belp coming to the conclusion that the
sixty millions of people in Germany, for
that was the population of that country,
appeared determined to subject the whole
world to their domination.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. BELAND: One could not belp
reaching the conclusion that the most futile
pretext would let loose on Europe the demon
of war. A spark was bound to set the
continent ablaze. That pretext, or that spark,
occurred in a little incident in Serbia.
Perhaps, with the permission of honourable
senators, I might endeavour to relate in a
few words what came to pass at that moment.
An Austrian Archduke was assassinated in
the street of Serajevo, a town in Serbia.
That, of course, created a commotion in
Europe. Austria was immediately determined
to wage war on Serbia. Serbia fell on her
knees. ready to apologize or (1o anything at
all compatible with her honour to atone for
the crime that had been committed. Austria
at the moment appeared quite willing to
accept the apologies of Serbia; but, if I
remember aright, honourable senators, there
was behind the old and decrepit Emperor
of Austria a certain Kaiser in the city of
Berlin. The German Kaiser was the one
who was inspiring the demands of Austria
upon Serbia. S rbia promised to halr before
the Serbian courts the man supposci to be
responsible for the assassination. That was
a reasonable proposal, but Austria, under
the inspiration of the German Kaiser, insisted that Austria herself should judge.
That demand, not being compatible with the
honour of Serbia, was refused, and there you
have the cause of the War. As the liberty
of the European continent was threatened,
one country after the other entered the conflict. In spite oif the efforts of England,
France and other countries towards the maintenance of peace, Germany and Austria were
de termined upon having a war. May I zay,
if it is permissible to make a personal reference. that is, to expeditions beyond the sas.
the eastern part of Belgium, close to the
and Belgium.
border between Germany
Honourable senators can take my word for
it that German armies had invaded the territory of Belgium before any declaration of
war had been made known.

FEBRUARY 27. 1935
This smail imbroglio was the prelude to
a conflagration which involved alrnost the
whole continent of Europe. One powerful
country after another-4England, France, Italy,
Roumania--came in on the side off Serbia.
Throughout the war these countries were
known as the Allies. The war lasted four
long years. [t was a gigantie struggle. Thewhole continent 0of Europe was, as it were,
ro'wned in its deluge off blood. Seven
million men sacrificed tiheir lives. To this
diuman 'holocaust there were added the ruins
off hundreds ocgcities and towns, and, huntihousands of homes. It would take
dreds ocd
days, indeed weeks, Vo depict the horrors of
that war as t.hey deserve to be depicted.
But what bas been tihe resuît off tihis feanful
confliet? Let us for a moment enter quietly
thie littIe country in the northwestern part
of Europe known as Holland, and proceed
to the city off Doorn. There is Vo. be found
Ühe former German Emiperor, once all po-wer,ful. tihe sovereign who had unohained the
4emon off war, who deserted bis own armies
when they were facing defeat, and like a
poltroon ran for refuge to Holland, which
is ruled by a very charming queen. H1e still
is there.
My honourable ffriend (Hon. Mr. Murdock)
referred a few moments ago to the horrors off
war. At no time has the world ever been
more determined than at present that peace
must prevail. That ia because the horrors off
war are so well known. 1V will be a long
time indeed beffore any other sovereign or
ruler undertakes to bring out.side nations under
bis dominion. Honourable senators, when one
ponders upon the events of the lest twentyfive years hie off necessity comes Vo the conclusion that there is an immanent justice
in this world. The terrifie punishment, off
apostles off wa-r, dreamers off aggrandizement
and universal domination, the much-dreaded
oblivion-and we know that oblivion is the
grave off the hauglity and proud4--into wthieh
ambitious would4be conquerors have fallen,
the re-establisîhment off old boundaries, the
humiliation tlhat bas been meted out to war
mongers and trafflekers, ail these Vhing confirm one in Vhe thought Vhat off ensive war is,
in the ruiing off divine justice, Vo be stamped
out off civilized and, Christian countries. The
most drcadful laVe, it seems, awaits the peacebreaker.
The will for peace is Vo-day on a par with
the longing for liberty. The desire Vo achieve
hoth is paramount, and no obstacle will be
allowed Vo prevent that achievement. In countries like ours, where democracy is flourishing,
there is a determination th-at aIl differences

109

arising as between government and government mnust seek their adjustment in arbitration or throvugh established international tribunals. Yes, peace with honour has come Vo
be as precious as life itsef. On one
memorable occasion Robert Emmet said,
"Give me liberty or give me death."
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Patrick Hlenry.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: Robert Emmet also.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN:- Patrick Henry.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: Robert Emmet, 1 mean
H1e is the one 1 have in minci. Robert Emmet
said, at the end off a speech before bis judges,
"Give me liberty or give me death." To-day
we say, give us peace or give us death.
Hon. J. LEWIS: Honourable senators, I have
no intention off going Vhrough the whole
resolution and saying how far 1 agree with
tihis or that. 1 desire merely Vo mnake my
stand cle-ar on one or Vwo points. Briefly, 1
am in favour off putting a heavier burden upon
wealth and property and a ligh Ver burden upon
flesh and blood. And when I speak off wealth
and property I refer flot only Vo great
ffortunes, such as we are inclined Vo envyand 1I should noV thave the slightest objection
Vo seeing them mulcted-but Vo all wealth
and ail property. For instance, I think that a
man with a moderate income, who in peace
ime is pâying an income Vax off $70 a year,
would have no grounci off complaint if that Vax
were increased Vo $300 or $400 in the event off
a war which hie considereci a just one. Such a
sacrifice could noV be mentioned in the same
breath as the sacrifice off if e or limb.
As Vo profits, I am quite in favour off preventing as fax as possible the taking off profits
on munitions, provisions, clothing, and other
war-time necessities. But one off the effects
off war is Vo make the whole country appear
prosperous, however ffallacious that appearance may ýbe, because prices and wages go up.
The condition is aggravated by the extensive
issue off bonds. During the last War a man
was told that hie woul be performing a
bighly patriotic act if he took money out
off the bank, where it was earning 3 per cent,
and invested it in gilt-edged securities, many
of them Vax-ffree, vohich were paying 5 or
54 per cent-I have forgotten which. ThaV
was certainly a very profitable f orm of
patriotism. I agree with the resolution so far
at least as Vo say that during a war we
should borrow as littie money as possible, and
at the lowest possible rate off interest. Then a
man could show his patriotism by taking
anoney that was earning 6 per cent and lenciing it Vo, the ýGovernment at 2 or 3 per cent.

[10

SENATE

As to the u-se of man-power, I am not quite
in agreement with the first part of the resolution. I am o.pposed not only tie conscriptien, but to high-pressure recruiting such as
in the last War inevitably led to conscription.
If adventurous young men want te fight, let
them go of their oVn accord and not be
hounded into the blood and slime of the
trenches by men living safely at home. Of
courŽe. in this I refer to the only kind of
warfare of whieh we have had any experience, that at the time I happened to be in
I think our experience of the last War and
its consequences ought to make us very careful about going into another. Despite all the
sacrifices that were made by Canada, Great
Britain and other countries. a large part of
the continent of Europe seems to be the
same old slaughter-house and lunatic asylum
that it was before 1914. So we should think
a long time before we ever decided to repeat
what we did in the last War. Of course, if
Canadian soil were invaded, the picture
would be entirely different. In that case we
might have to resort to measures such as my
lionourable friend the mover of the resolution (Hon. Mr. Hughes) refers te. But that
may b rcgarded, as extremely unlikely, and
thorefore II do net propose to discuss at the
present time the part of the resolution having to do with it. I wanted to make myself
clear on this point, tihat in the eVent of another war I should like to see a heavier burden upon wealth and property andt a lighter
burden uîpon flesh and blood.
Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH: Honourable
senators, I have very few observations to
offer with respect to this matter. I suppose no
student of history would deny the general
proposition that wars are milestones marking
the roads which nations must travel, either
to greatness or to decadence. The resolutien introduced by the honourable gentleman
from King's (Hon. Mr. Hughes) is therefore
of great interest. I think alsc ho is performing a considerably useful service if le introduced it with the singlc object of providing
for the effiency of this country when next
it find- itselif involved in war. The subject
is worthy cf calta and dispassionate discussien, with none of what is commonly known
as sob stuff.
The first paragraph of the resolution reads:
That in the opinion of this House, should
Canada ever again be at war with one or more
nations, s shshall wage il with every ounce of
her strength in man and material power.
That seems to me to 1)e a very sound proposition. I cannot concive o.f any reasonable
people getting into a war with ansy other
Hlon. Mr. LEWIS.

obiect in view than the winning of it. Having
regard te the terrible consequences to thoe
who l-ose a war, I should think that any country that entered into a conflict would wage
it outright, with all its strength.
The next paragraph is:
That the declaration of war or the beginning
of hostilities shall be followed immediately by
the mobilization and the conscription of all the
human power and all the material wealth of
the nation.
I thin.k that that paragraph hangs on the
first one, and I have no objection to it at
all. Just here may I say that if you are
going to wait until war breaks out before you
make plans for mobilization and conscription,
you will probably make a very bad job of
them. But I am in sympathy with the general ýprinciple as it is here put. After all,
if you go into a war you do so with the
object cf winning. and yo-u will conscript your
man power and your wealth and take every
possible step, reasonably of course, te bring
about the desired result.
Then the resolution says:
That a War Council representing all the
provinces and the Government shall be forned
and shall have suprene control of all war
activities and orders.
I consider that proposal perfectly absurd. in
the light of the history of war. The honourable gentleman from Lauzon (Hon. Mr.
Béland) bas stated the case very well. He
points out that we already have in Canada a
Government which is charged with looking
aifter this aspect of national rights. Furthermore, I can imagine nothing that would have
such disastrous results as the bringing in of
a lot of people from the provinces, with their
sectional and local notions of how thin-s
should be done. The whole histery of war
teaches the necessity of reducing the numbers of those who have control.
The next sentence is:
That said Council shall have the power to
assign every man and woman in Canada to
wbatever position it thinks they are best
qualified to fill, but making as few changes as
Possible in the daily occupations of the people.
That scems to flow from the first and second
paragraphs. If you are going to make war
with every once of your strength you are
going to utilize all the material vou possess,
including your men and woenn. One would
say that some authority, probably the Government, should have the power to assign
people to their respective tasks.
The resolution goes on:
That the wages. salary or income for personal
use or retention of no person in the Dominion

from the Governor General down, inchiding the

FEBRUARY 27, 1935
of the Army, shall be greater than the
pay of the common soldier in the field, plus a
reasonable amount for dependents.
This proposal offers some scope for the
demagogue. It suggests bringing everybody
down to a common level. The idea does not
bother me in the least, but I can imagine
that our western farmers, the employees of
our great railway system, end in fact the
workers in scores of classes, would very
strongly oppose it. I should have no objection to what was done on the home front,
if it were necessary for the winning of the
war.
Let me deal now with that part of the
proposal which refers to army organization.
Down through the ages the great empires of
the past, Persian, Assyrian, Egyptian, Grecian,
Roman, have organized their armies on the
basis of hierarchy, with pay and privileges
carresponding to rank and responsibility. In
the history of the last 3,000 years there will
be found no record of any other basis, and,
human nature being what it is, I venture to
assert that it would not be possible to
organize an army except on a hierarchical
basis.
Curiously enough, when the organization of
the warlike Zulus was inquired into about
fifty years ago it was found that their military
unit, the impi, numbered 3,000 men, and that
there was a leader for every seven men.
The organization of the army of the Roman
Empire, in common with that of the armies
of the other powerful nations of the past,
approximated closely to the basis of our
modern battalion, with its four companies,
sixteen platoons, and sixty-four sections, each
numbering seven or eight men. There you
have the hierarchy of command, with increased pay and greater privileges in proportion to ascending rank and heavier responsibilities.
It may be a very attractive idea to have
an army in which there is absolute equalityeverybody enjoying the same rank, carrying
the same responsibility, receiving the same
pay. But I shudder to think that certain
honourable members of this House, who
might at some future time be' controlling the
destinies of our country, hold such an utterly
absurd and impossible view.
I happened at one time to serve in a
regiment in South Africa. The non-commissioned officers were men of private means,
for whom the prospect of increased pay had
no attraction, and they refused to take promotion. Finally the regiment came home
practically in a state of mutiny. In short,
the impossibility of preserving the bierarchy
of command had a disastrous effect on
discipline and organization.

officers

111

Whatever might be possible in dealing with
civilians, I warn the House against the folly
of attempting to place soldiers on any such
basis as that contemplated by the sponsor of
the motion. The recorded history of the
world gives no example of an army that wasnot organized, controlled and led by a hierarchy of command, with increased pay and
greater privileges accompanying higher rank
and heavier responsibilities.
The sixth and seventh paragraphs read:
That no money be borrowed or debts incurred
for the prosecution of the war or for demobilization;
That all the expenses of the war and of
demobilization shall be met by taxation and
capital levies, so that at the end of the war
and of demobilization the debt of the country
would be no larger than it was at the beginning
of the war.
This is inconsistent with the first paragraph.
of the motion, that we are to wage war with
all our strength for the purpose of achieving victory. We cannot know what conditions will govern the next war, and were we
to adopt these financial proposals we should
be hamstringing the nation financially and
economically, thus destroying its whole
organization.
I say again, I welcome this motion to the
extent that its purpose is to promote efficiency in war. It creates an opportunity to
discuss what at the present time is being
done in the United States to prepare for
war industrially, economically, and financially.
Under the leadership of the War Department the authorities have taken a census of
industry and of war material; they have
ascertained what is needed and what the
country itself can produce; they have brought
about a systematization of gauges and
standards; they have prepared, on paper, an
organization of personnel and a system of
inspection, accounting and assessment with
respect to orders for war materials, deliveries,
prices, and profits-all designed to put the
nation into the next struggle with carefu'lly
thought-out plans, in order to avoid waste,
extravagance, and misapplied energy. That
work has been carried out at no very great
expense, it has created no alarm, and yet
I am sure it will enable the United States
to wage war very much more efficiently and
economically.
A similar plan should receive consideration
at the hands of our own people. We were
pitchforked into the War of 1914 without
plan or preparation for its conduct. True,
there were plans on paper, but they were
ruthlessly brushed aside at the outbreak of
war to permit certain individuals to carry
on operations in their own fashion.

112

SENATE

In that connection I may make this
observation. At least 25 per cent of our
war expenditure was utterly wasted because
of our unwillingness to give the matter some
thought beforehand.
There was lack of
preparation, both mental and physical. I go
further and declare that a substantial proportion of our casualties were due to lack
of training and equipment; that is, lack of
preparation. A sad reflection twenty years
after the event, but I believe I am absolutely
correct. For example, our system of recruiting was exactly the same as that which prevailed in the reign of Queen Anne. We got
more or less well known men to raise a
battalion and take it over to England. There
it was broken up, and we soon had a number

of officers without commands. In the 17th
century the British Government retired their
surplus officers on half-pay. Wealthy men
took advantage of this to provide for their
sons. Young men would secure a commission,
raise a company of 100 men and bring them
into barracks, whereupon, having discharged
their duty to their country, they retired on
half-pay. There is a case on record of a
man who lived to be 120 and drew his halfpay for 100 years!
Then I direct the attention of the House
to another weakness of our system in 1914.
No doubt several honourable gentlemen are
familiar with the numerous instances of
rivalry between two commanders each raising
a battalion in the same town. Naturally
there was keen competition for recruits, and
if the strength of one battalion was ten or
fifteen men ahead of the other, the commander of the apparently less popular
battalion would tell his medical officer that
he was a little too severe. Immediately he
lowered the physical standard the battalion
gained strength rapidly, and soon it was
twenty ahead of the rival battalion, whose
commander in turn would remonstrate with
his medical officer; and so the competition
would become keener and keener, and the
physical standard lower and lower. As a
result of this laxity of medical examination
we took thousands of men over to England
only to have them rejected there. Hundreds
of men are pensioners to-day without having
made any useful contribution to our war
effort. They were known in the service as
King's bad bargains to start with.
All this comes about because you will net
face the situation, you will net admit the
likelihood of war, you refuse to discuss it
and you will net plan for it. Very well, you
pay the price. That is what you had to do
lon. NIr. GRIESBACH.

in the last war. and vou will have to do the
same in the next war so far as I can see.
Let me cite other instances of unwise war
expenditures. Faulty Oliver equipment cost
the country a great deal of money; so did
the Ross rifle; so did the hundreds of wagons
that could net be used on European roads
-all honestly purchased no doubt. Because
of laick cf thought and planning, enormous
expenditures were made on what turned out
to be utterly worthless equipment. Another
instance of misdirected energy was the vast
amount of money and time lost on the establishment of the Valcartier camp-perhaps our
first and biggest mistake.
I have no patience with people who think
that some curious change has come over
human nature and there will be no more
war. I know there is going to be more war.
I might correct my honourable friend from
Lauzon (Hon. Mr. Béland). He told us that
prior to the Great War the United States had
been at peace for 100 years.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: I made a mistake.
I should, of course, have mentioned the
Spanish-American War.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: You should have
mentioned also the greatest civil war in the
last 500 years-the American Civil War of
1860-1865.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: That was a civil
war.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Yes, but it does
not make very much difference to the soldiers
whether they are killed in a civil war or a
foreign war.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: They are dead just
the same.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Yes. Prior to
that, in 1840, the American army crossed the
boundary and captured Mexico City. There
was also the war with France, which many
people have forgotten, and also the war with
Tripoli, at one time an independent state,
on the north coast of Africa.
I repeat, I have no patience with those
who say that some curious change has happened in human nature, and consequently
there will be no more war. I know there is
going to be more war, and I know every
country is likely to be involved. To-day
there are four centres of potential warJapan, Russia, Germany, Italy. These great
powers, by virtue of their form of government and their outlook on life, are likely te
declare war on the slightest provocation,
even without any provocation at all.

FEBRUARY 27, 1935
Now, believing that ta be so, it isim
possible for me ta understand why men wîll
not devote somne thouglit ta the efficient
wagirlg of war whenever we may be driven
ta it, in order that we may conserve aur
financial resources and the lives of our peaple.
I charge those whao refuse to discue war
preparations with responsibility for the needless waste of public money anid of manpower that must ensue. I warn yau wha
dismiss any discussion af these mattera as
a waste of time that yau will ha responsible
for the money that will be needlessly wasted
in the next war, and for the hurnan livea that
will be needlessly thrown away because of
inefficient le.adership, lack of training, anid
lack of equipment.
I welcome this opportunity ta discharge a
duty ta my cauntry in the interest of the
generations that are ta corne, which, like
my own generatian, will be pitcliforked
inta the next war tatally unprepared and
lacking everything necessary ta ensure success. The only thing yau may be grateful
for is that the character and the apirit af aur
people during the past four or five centuries
have enabled the country ta triumph over
the obstacles which our governrnents have
put in aur way.
I have ta thank the honourable gentleman
who moved this motion (Hon. Mr. Hughes).
Again I express the hope that ha lias done sa
witli an honest desire ta bring about the
efficiency of aur nation in tirne of war, and
not, as sorna paragraphe of hie motion wauld
seern to, suggest, for the purpoee of propoeing
the adoption of principles which, if transasted
into practice, would hamstring aur nation.
Perhaps it is his desire ta make the waging
of war so0 difficult as thareby ta, support the
cause of peaoe. I have no objection, for I
believe it is desirable to strive for peace;
but I do object Vo proposaIs which, if adopted,
would prevent us frorn waging war fully and
effectually ta defend aurselves frarn aggressian,
or create a situation which miglit harnpoe us

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I arn quite
certain that is the fact, and I accept the
honourable member's statement. 1 will add,
thougli, that 1 do not know what the abject
of the observation is. He found fault with
being agked to defer hie addrees when lie was
ready to speak the other day, and hie seemed
to feel that in consequence a sacrifice lied
been made. Some criticism, perhaps, came
fromn a part of the press, iii informed of the
situation. As a matter of fact, hie observations were just as appropriate to-day as they
would have been then. Consequently, there
wae notihing bast, and nobody wae to blamne
f or anything.
This House, as I interpret its functians,
does not exiet in order to be a duplicate of
the House of Cammons in the matter of long
discussions of political events and tendencies
in Canada. If we were to be merely a replica
of the oCher Chamber, debating ail and sundry matters, as we should if we were responsible to individual constituencies, then we
should. lose our value to the people of the
country. We do not exist for that purpose
at ail. We cannot measure aur usefuiness by
the hours we sit ini this Chamber, nor by the
length of our speeches, nor, indieed, by the
acrirnony of our debate. If we were flot debating this afternoon, but were engaged in
anotiher chamjber of this Hause wrestling with
the practical and intricate problemes of the
Patent Bill, we miglit not be paraded in the
press ta such an extent, but we ehauld,
probably be serving Canada the better.
Sorne Hon. SENATIMRS: Hear, hear.

9258"EEVISED
EDITIeS

SENATE
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have no
apologies at all to make for the remuneration I draw as a member of this House. I
am in favour of shorter hours of labour in
this and all other countries; and not only
am I in favour of the eight-hour day, but
I am convinced that we are stepping far
behind in the trend of events in limiting the
day to eight hours. I believe we shall have
to come to six-five perhaps; possibly in our
own lifetime. Only when other countries will
march with us in that direction can we proceed, because only then can we afford to take
steps to that end. I know no eight-hour day
during any session of Parliament, nor in my
life. I rejoice that I have the privilege of
working longer hours and of assuming special
responsibilities.
Addressing myself for just a moment to
the articles of the motion, I wish to say that
while I welcome this motion as a means of
elucidating the subject and placing ourselves
on record in regard to something that is of
consequence, I am opposed to everything in
the motion except its aspirations. The aspirations are contained in the first two paragraphs. The first paragraph calls upon this
country to devotc itself whole-heartedly and
without reservation to war.
It proposes,
should that ghastly event occur, and should
we find ourselves in its toils again, that
Canada shall wage war with every ounce of
her strength in man and material power, and
then:
That the declaration of war or the beginning
of hostilities shall be followed immediately by
the mobilization and the conscription of all the
human power and all the material wealth of
the nation.
Well, that the subject of the first proposal
is sound and, indeed, is an essential feature
of a declaration of war, goes without saying.
As to the second, which in spirit is right,
that the energies and capacities of all should
be the property of the State, and that the
property of all, for the purposes of war,
sho'i be at the disposal of the State-if this
is what it means-I agree. But when the
word " conscription " is used, and used in precisely the same way with reference to men
as to money, I do not know that I quite
understand the paragraph. When we conscript a man for war we make him and his
time the property of the State, and put
them under the supervision of the State. We
do so because we believe it is essential. Now,
if conscription has the same meaning with
respect to property and wealth, it means that
they immediately become the property of the
State. In a word, it means a socialistie
existence at once. I do not know whether
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

the honourable member intended that or
not. I do not think he could have intended
it. If such were the case, and all property
were immediately turned over to the management and ownership of the State, what would
there be to tax, as called for by the fourth
paragraph?
We should have everything.
The fourth paragraph has no meaning unless
the proposal goes only so far as to say that
to the extent necessary for the prosecution
of war the State shall be able to seize property and may use it as much as it can, to the
end of winning the conflict. Therefore, as
to the remaining axioms of this resolution,
we have to assume that this is the extent
of the meaning of the honourable member.
It then becomes a question as to how the
State can best use the property of the nation
for the purpose of bringing about a victorious
termination of the conflict.
The honourable member says we must so
conduct ourselves that there shall be co dcbt.
We will not borrow money, we will just take
it, and we will end the war without any
more debt than we had when we began it.
Well, that is a consummation devoutly te
be wished, and if it were attainable one
would wonder how it is that the intelligent
countries of the world never hit upon it
before. How is it that we are the first to
think of such a glorious achievemnm-w
o
find out that by doing a certain thing we
can go through a war, such as heretofore lias
cost billions, and have it cost us nothing at
all? I put this to the honourable member
seriously.
Say that war is upon us, and tbat in a
group of citizens of Canada the first man, A,
owns a farm. It is clear, and he is working it
and raising grain. The next man, B. lid
own a farm. but he lias retired and has $5.000
in the bank. The third man, C, owns a factory whici is producing somcthing essential
for the people of this country and the men
at the front. All he as is that factcry.
How is the honourable member going to get
the money with vhich to wage the war? Is
he going to takc the farm? That is the only
way in which he can get anything from the
first man. Is he going to take the factory?
He will not get any money that way. So. as
he cannot get any moncy, and as that is all
that is of any use in the prosecution of a war,
he leaves A and C out entirely. But B, who
bas retired and bas $5,000, pays the whole
cost.
Hon. Mr. LYNCHSTAUNTON: Is net the
right
honiourable
gentleman
taking
the
honourable member too literally? Does he
net mean that we pay as we go?

FEBRUARY 27, 1935
Right Hon. -Mr. MEIGHEN: But we cannot pay as we go. The honourable member
says he does not mean that. I am taking
the words to mean what they say. But suppose the honourable member from Hamilton
(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) is right, and that
this does not mean to take the property at
all, then "conscription" in the second paragraph does not make common sense. If this
means that you take only money, then of
course you can get it only from those who
have it. But by the time you have it ail,
you will not have enough to carry on the war.
There is not enough currency in the country
for that, even if you call currency money.
The fact is that in order to be equitable to
all concerned you have ta spread the burden;
and you can spread it only by national borrowings. Does anyone in his senses believe
that at a time when we need money to the
extent, say, of 500,000,000 a year we can
raise it by taxation alone, whether equitable
or not? By no method of taxation in the
world can you raise the money required to
carry on a war. It is because of this hard,
practical fact that nations have resorted to
the plan always followed, and have never, in
the halcyon days of the past, found this fine
Elysium tu which the bonourable member
must refer.
Ilf the honourable gentleman were the head
of a Government in time of war, he would
no more dream of doing the things he proposes than lie dreams of suicide to-day.
They cannot be done. What we have to
do is to address ourselves to discovering the
most equitable form of taxation-the highest
which can be levied-and to maintaining our
industries and the morale of our people.
Then, finally, we must tax the people. That
is what we addressed ourselves to in the last
War. Possibly we did not wholly succeed.
The wisdom that is displayed after fifteen
years is wonderful. One would think that
bonds were made tax-free only because we
were desirous of developing a rich and lazy
leisure class in Canada. The Government
of that day had to get the money in any
way possible; it could not take the risk of
failure; so in its wisdom, or its folly, it issued
tax-frea bonds. And every bond sold for
more money because it was tax-free.
An Hon. SENATOR: There was nu income tax then.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There was no
income tax then, nor was one contemplated.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Could you not
conscript it?
9284-8i

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I thought
I had dealt with that. Why conscript the
fellow who has 50 cents in cash and leave
alone the fellow who has $50 in property?
That is the only way you can conscript
wealth. Money is all that is of any use.
This is what honourable members have not
thought of. You have to get pretty close
to these things in order to realize fully the
true state of affairs. In all this talk of conscripting wealth it seems to be assumed that
all wealth is in the form of cash and cheques.
Wealth takes a thousand forms: it is the
accumulations of the human mind and the
human act. But the only thing with which
you can carry on a war is money; and when
you conscript wealth, if you confine it to
money, you throw the burden on only a few,
and in the end you do not have half enough
money to carry on the war.
So much for this feature. I think I have
said enough. My honourable friend behind
me (Hon. Mr. Griesbach), whose experience
in these matters is worth something to this
House and to this country, has put his case
with wonderful lucidity and force. I cannot
sit down, however, without making some
reference to a remark of the honourable
senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Lewis).
He is not in favour of what I might describe
as the significant feature of this resolution.
He is not even in favour of putting at the
disposal of the Government the whole of
the armed strength of the country to the
extent that is necessary to win. He says
that if the war is outside of Canada he is
altogether opposed to conscription. He flies
right in the face of the first paragraph of
the resolution, with which we all agree.
According to him, if the battle is to be
fought in Europe it is to be regarded as in
the nature of an adventure, and if any young
fellows like to go they may, but no pressure
will be brought on the others. In his view
such a conflict is not serious enough to
warrant us in adopting conscription of life
to carry it on.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:

Limited liability.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There can
be no limited liability. If any war is serious
enough for us to be engaged in it, it is a
matter of life and death. Nobody, after
reflection, cean think that there is any possïbility of our sending men to Europe, or anywhere else, to do battle unless the life of this
country depends upon the result. We should
never dream of doing that unless we thought
it was a matter of life and death for our-

SENATE
selves; and we never did do it-certainly not
in the last War.
But suppose a great army in Europe is
headed for its neighbours, as was the case
twenty years ago. Are we to say we will
send men over if they are ready to go, but
that we will not take it seriously? Are we
to say we will not join with France and
Britain to turn back the march of the enemy
on the banks of the Marne, and will only let
our boys go if they want to go? Are we
to say that though we will not fight seriously
to resist the enemy on the banks of the
Marne, we will do battle with all our life
if he cornes to the banks of the St. Lawrence? Once the enemy reaches the ba.nks
of the St. Lawrence, then the inch-long
taper will be burned and donc; it will be a
case of "the bright day is o'er, and we are
Who can imagine an
for the darkness."
enemy that can overcome the resistance on
the Marne being met with any opposition
worthy of the name when he reaches the
St. Lawrence? We cannot defend this country within our own borders.
There is no one in this House more ready
and more eager to sacrifice in order to improve
conditions in his country than I am. I
do not know whether it can be donc or not.
I do not know whether or not a war is
eoming. I certainly do not know that one
is not coming. The events of the last three
years have been discouraging in the extreme;
the last twelve months have been heartbreaking. I do not know of any who are
more certain to lose by war than we are.
One thing I do know, however, and that is
that if we have any brains, and have the
means to defend our country, we are going to
do so; and we must notyield to the fatuity
that we can do it alone at the doors of our
own homes.
So, as far as the resolution calls upon us
to concentrate upon victory, I am in favour
of it; but when it sets out the paths by
which we are to reach this goal I say that
they are false, and the principles upon w'hich
the honourable member seeks to have us
act are vain and valueless, and, never will
be followed in this country or in any other.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Honourable members,
never for one moment did it occur to me that
on a question of such importance as this
I eould draft a resolution which would not
be open to criticism. Much les's did it occur
to me that I could draw up a plan of campaign for the next war if, unhappily, we
should have one. Therefore I am not at all
surprised or disa.ppointed at the criticism I
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

have heard. In fact. I welome it, and I
think the country also will welcome it.
The honourable member from Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. Griesbach) spoke from the wealth
of his experience, and made what I conceive
to be some very valuable statements.
If the right honourable leader of the House
wishes to criticize any person he can do it
well-and I have already said that I know
my resolution is open to oriticism.
I will say at once that one of my hopes
was that if unifortunately we were ever again
engaged in war we should at least take steps
in advance to eli-minate profiteering.
Perhaps by doing so we should be able to conduct the war with greater efficien.cy.
The fact that the resolution bas been
favourably commented upon by a number of
Canadian newspapers which are conducted
by men of some knowledge and experiencenot in war, perhaps, -but in practical affairgives me reason to think that in substance it

the matter was first brought before the House
I have received letters and telegrams from a

and also from institutions and organizations.
They all said they approved of the step I
was taking. Even the discussion of to-day
goes to show, I think, that there wasHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Something in it.
there was
Hon. Mr. HIUGHES: -that
something in it, as my honourable friend says.
It bas received greater consideration and
publicity than I expected, and probably it
will serve a useful purpose.
I do not find fault with the numerous mistakes that we made in the last War, because, as I stated in *my remarks of a few
days ago, the business was new to us. We
made many deplorable errors, but perhaps
not more than were made by other and more
experienced nations. In the United States
Senate there bas been going on an investigation whici has revealed that organizations
tiat provided materials and supplies for the
army and the navy of that country, after it
entered the War-and it had some years to
prepare itself-made profits of several hundred per cent. A few days ago I read that a
stili more discreditable fact was brought to
light: organizations providing badly needed
supplics to the military forres withheld those
supplies until the prices advanced to fabulons
levels. The ordinary people of the world
are now suffering because of such profiteering.
I should like to see the Parliament of Canada

FEBRUARY 27, 1935
take steps, while we are at peace, to make
things like Vhat impossible in this country
if we should have another war. We shouîd
flot be able effectiveiy to prevent thein if a
war were to break upon us before we had
ta.ken any such steps.
Notwithstanding what the right honourable
leader of the House says, I think we could
raise a great deal of rnoney by rnethods that
wouid flot make millionaires of a few persons
and paupers of the masses, who wiii be paying
the cost of the last War f or rnany years to
corne. I shouid like to do everything I can
towards the discovery of some such method,
and to direct the minds of the Canadian
people to the probiem.
I think some useful purpose has been served
by this resolution and discussion. As~ I have
aiready stated, 1 have received a number of
letters and teiegrams fromn individuais and
organizations. Some of the writers express the
wish that action be postponed, so as to give
time, particuiariy to the organizations, for the
study of the whoie matter and the official expression of their opinions upon it. Therefore
I believe it to be my duty to withdraw the
resolution for the present, with the consent
of the seconder and of the Flouse. By next
session we shall no doubt have had an expression of opinion from various sources. Further
action can then be taken, if the country so
desires, and perhaps a proposai will he presented in a forrn more acceptable to this
honourable House.
The motion was withdrawn.

CANABIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
REFUNDING BILL
SECOND

READING

Right Hon. ARTHURi MEIGHEN moved
the second reading of Bill 19, an Act respecting the Canadian National Railhways and toý
provide for the refunding of maturing and
cailable financiai obligations.

SENATE
He said: Honourable members, this is an
important measure and should have some
explanation at this stage. There matures this
year only one obligation of the Canadian
National Railways guaranteed by the Government of Canada. It amounts, I think, to
seventeen and a half million dollars, or very
close to that figure, and it matured on the
15th of this month. It was taken care of
temporarily by a short-term loan at 2 per cent.
Previously, obligations aggregating twenty and
a half millions, which matured last December,
were provided for by way of refunding at a
rate which saved the National Railways, and
therefore the Dominion, more than $200,000
a year. I think no further obligations fall due
in 1935, but a large number of Canadian
National loans guaranteed by the Government
of Canada become callable this year. Perhaps
I should give the House a list of those callable, and the terms.
There is an issue of 44 per cent thirtyyear bonds due on September 15, 1954,
amounting to $26,000,000, callable this year
at 102.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That is optional, is
it?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is optional,
but the Government is being empowered by
this Bill to recall and refund.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
can turn them in if he desires?

The holder

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No; the
Government lias the option.
There is a Canadian National issue of 41
per cent forty-year bonds, due December 1,
1968. amounting to 835,000,000 and callable
this year at 103.
An issue of $60,833,333.33 of Grand Trunk
4 per cent perpetuals is callable this year
at 100.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: When is that due?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is due at a
time when the honourable member will not
be interested. It bas no maturity-it is perpetual; but it is callable.
The next is $2,541,000 of National Transcontinental first mortgage bonds at 41 per cent,
due on the lst of October, 1935, and callable
at par.
Then tliere are the Mount Royal Tunnel
and Terminal Company Limited 6 per cent
first imortgage bonds due April 15, 1970.
anounting to $952,893.33, and callable at 105.
Rigit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

An issue of the Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada 7 per cent debentures due
October 1, 1940, amounting to $23,.740,000, is
callable at 1021. It would appear to be the
part of wisdom to call that.
Then, Canadian Northern Railway Company 7 per cent debenture bond issue, due December 1, 1940, amounting to $23,779.000, callable at 1024.
The total of these is 8172,846.226.66. Should
all he called, as would seem probable. and refunding arrangements be made on the basis
of present rates dependably obtainable, the
saving in interest would be somewhere over
two and a half millions of dollars.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Where are the obligations payable?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Unfortunately
-it is not unfortunate now, but it would have
been-.they are wliat we call three-way payments. I think they are all, or nearly all, payable in London. New York and Canada. This
means that the bearer bas three choices,
depending on the exchange, and he picks the
market that suits him. The new issues, needless to say, will be payable in Canada.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: The holder lias three
options?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. By this
measure the Canadian National Railways are
enabled to provide for refunding and to issue
securities, and the Governor in Council is
empowered to guarantee the securities on
behalf of Canada and to provide for the
deposit of proceeds in the Consolidated Revenue Fund or with the Minister of Finance,
for the advancement of money from those
proceeds to the railway company, and for
the cremation of discharged bonds, stocks or
other securities. as and when discharged.
Hon. Mr. COPP: They are all guaranteed
now. are they?
Riglht Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: All guaranteed.
I think it is not contemplated that any other
than those that are guaranteed shall be taken
care of. So far as I know there are no unguaranteed or non-callable obligations maturing this year.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Will those railway
bonds sell at as high a price as Dominion
bonds?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They have
not sold at quite as high prices in the past,
even though guaranteed, one reason being

FEBRUARY 28, 1935
that it took some time for that class of bond
to reach its proper level in the market. Another reason was that the trustee laws of
different countries, including our own for a
time.' were sucli that a government-guaranteed
bond was flot included in the highest classifications. But that has been changed here, and I
think government-guaranteed bonds may now
almost universally be purchased by trustees
whose restrictions are the most rigid. Consequently this class of bond now selis at
virtually the saine price as bonds of a direct
issue.
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Have the
negotiations proceeded far enough for the
riglit honourable gentleman to be able to tell
us on what ternis the Government expects to
arrange this loan of $20,000,000?

thought possibly the negotiations had reached
sucli a point that the information could be
made public as soon as tbe Bill went tlirougli,
or thereabouts. Of course the market is in
a peculiar state just now, and, as my right
honourable friend says, present conditions
bave brought about a reversal in the relative
prices of long and sbort termi bonds. I neyer
heard of any person givîng advance information except perhaps once, and I am not sure
it was given then. I once went to New York
to negotiate a boan, and found very peculiar
conditions there. They were caused, not by
the Government, but by somebody wlio had
been there and who made my work a little
difficult. For various reasons I think tlie
Government is taking a wise step in baving

I would mildly and inoffensively suggest that

anything to do with looking after that.

AGREEMENT BILL

SECOND READING

Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEICHEN movedi the
second reading of Bill 23, an Act to authiorize
an agreement between Ris Majesty the King
and the Corporation of the City of Ottawa.
He said: Honourable members, I yesterday
gave ail the explanation that I think this
Bill requires.
You will recali that under
the last comploted agreement the sum of
$75,000 a year was f0 be paid to the Cifv of
Ottawa for services usually covered by taxes.
In 1925 the agreement was extended f0 the
lst of July, 1930, and the amount authorized
was increased to $100,000.
The payment of
this annual sum wvas authorized up to the
lst of July, 1934. The purpose of the prosent
Bill is to enablo payment to ho made this
year, and to extend the operation. of flic
agreement till the first day of July, 1935.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I am fairly
familiar with this proposaI, because we haveo
been making this payment to the City of
Ottawa for a number of years. The last
time I had anything to do with suclh a
measure if was my duty f0 ask for a threeyear vote, and I remember thaf at that timo
I had considerablo difficulfy in convincing the
Sonate that the vote should be for throe
years insfead of one. However, as I secured
the sanction of the principle of paymonf for
three years, I have no objection f0 this
extension for one year.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Even with the passage of this Bill the agreement will terminaf e
on the 1sf of July.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I beg to
move that when the Senate adjourns to-day
it do stand adjourned until Tuesday next at
3 o'clock.
I may say that the Committee on Banking
and Commerce is far fron having completed
its labours on the Patent Bill, and one reason
for calling the Senate together at the hour of
3 o'clock on Tuesday is that the committee
may have a quorum and be able to start
work in the morning. The nature and importance of a number of Bills introduced
from the other House to-day are such that
the Senate undoubtedly will have sufficient
work ahead of it next week. Whether it
has or not, the Committee on Banking and
Commerce will certainly have plenty to do.
That committee meets again at the close of
this session.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday,

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Stand.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: May I point out to
the right honourable gentleman that most of
the information asked for by this inquiry can
be found in the Auditor General's report, and
I fail to see why it takes such a long time
to get an official answer.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
know just what the reason is, but no doubt it
is sufficient, for I have not as yet been able
to make a well-founded complaint with respect to delay. I will have the answer hastened.
The inquiry stands.

amends in four 'particulars a very important
Act passed by Parliament liast session, constituting a mechinism for the rearrangement
of the debts of distressed 'farmers throughout
the Dominion. It perhaps is fitting that I
g'ive a brief account of the operations of the
Act, but beforo doing so I will indicate the
character of the amendmcnts sought to bc
made by tihe present measure.
The first amendment provides that where
a 'farmer makes a proposal to an official rereiver for a rearrangement of his debts, there
shall be a stay of 90 days from the date of
his making the proposal, instead of 60 days
as under the present law, of all proceedings
by persons who have claims against him. The
reason for the change is this. The official
receivers, who have been very busy because
of the large number of applications, have
found it necessary to apply for extension of
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

the stay in many cases, and this has interfered
with their chief work. In other words, the
stay of 60 days has ýproved too short. considering the pressure under which the receivers have to work. Moreover, the present
law permits only one application for extension of the stay, and it is thought advisable to
provide for more tran one sucli application.
Of course, under the law as it stands, and as
it will stand if this Bill passes, a judge, after
hearing representations by a oreditor and the
reply of the farmer thereto, may if he thinks
fit make an order that the stay be terminated
at any time, or that there be no stay at all.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: A county court judge?
Riglt Hon. Mr. MEJIGHEN: Yes, I think
so. The next clause of the Bill is to cover the
case in which one of the three members of
the Board of Rcvuiew is unable to act. It wvil
be recalied that in each province there is a
Board oif Review which sits and deteriines
cases where it has been impossible for the
official receivers to effect settlements. The
Board lias powcr to amend, and power to
make the finding of the court binding on al]
the credit.ors and the debtor.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: How are the services
of that Board made available to farmers?
Riglit Hon. Mr. M\IEIGHEN: By tie Act.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: But in the province
of Quebec, for instance, does the Board sit
in every judicial district or in Quebec, Moitiral and Sherbrooke only?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

The 13oar i of

Review lias sat in every province except Prince

Edward Island, Britislh Columbia, Nova Scoria
and New Brunswick. I will later give the
honourable senator these particulars.
I was explaining the provision covxeriiig the
event of one of the meibers of the Board of
Review net being able to act. The chairmin
must be a judge having jurisdiction ordinarily
in bankruptcy. The other two memhers are
chosen in accordance with the provisioný of
the Act. one of thein representing the creditors
and the other the debtor. The amending
provision is to the effect that if one of these
two menbers cannot act someone can be summoned to do so ad hoc hy the other comzîmissioners. If the Chief Commissioner canot
act, then an ad lioc chief conmissioner e:an
be appointed by the Minister. It is considered that, the Chief Commissioner being
a judge of the standing I have described. it
would hardly bc riglht to enable the other
two comiîssioners to choose a substitute.
The fourth clause changes the words -approved by" to "filed in." These word haId

MARCH 12, 1935
and have respectively application to a Board
of Review finding. In the Act the finding is
described as being the approval of a proposai.
Now the finding is to be filed in the court,
and therefore sets at rest any doubt as to
whether or flot a judge could alter a finding.
It was neyer the intention that hie could. The
finding of the Board of Review is final.
The last clause provides that the Board may
delegate one of its members to deal witb and
make a report upon the circumstances of any
particular case. This is found necessary also
because of the multiplicity of applications.
Only the full Board can deal with it, but the
members can apportion the work among themselves in this way. One of them makes a
report to the fuît Board, and thereby expedites
the decisions in ahl this long range of cases.
This Act was called into effect in September, but it did not get well under way until,
say, November of last year. To the end of
February about 2,000 arrangements bave been
made.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: In ail Canada?
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEýN: Yes. I believe the figure given in the other House wau
1,000, but the month of February buis been
very prolific, and up to the beginning of this
inonth the number of cases had risen to 2,000.
There bave been over 16,000 consultations
between officiai receivers and farmers. Up
to thc present there have been approximately
4,500 specific proposais. Many settiemients
have been effected voluntarily. After consultation with officiai receivers creditors and
farmers have been able to agree witbout going
through the formality laid down by thbe Act.
Ini Quebec 763 eases were reported to the
Board, 97 of wbich were heard by the Board.
I Ontario 228 were reported and 106 heard.
In Manitoba 141 we-re reported and 51 heard.
In Saskatchewan 222 were reported anjd 90
beard. In Alberta 27d6 were reported and 102
heard. Honouroble senators will note (that 1
use the wordLs "iheard by the Boa-rd." These
are -the cases that did flotcorne to final isettiement bef ore the officiai receiver; tbey had to
go to the Board. Up to the time this computation was made 446 cases had been settled
by the Board out of 1,650 reported to them.
The nuinber of proposais received as o£f
March 2 is given me as 3,585. 1 have since
learned that that number is considerably increased by later reports. Then a certain
number of assignments bave been effected
under the Act. Honourable senators will
recaiil that in addition to providing the
meehanism. for arranging sett.lements the Act
provided that in a desperate case the farmer
could use the officiai. receiver as assignee and
make an assignment.

127

Hon. Mr. GILLIS: There were many cases
where settlenments were arrived at between
debtor and creditors witbout appeal to the
Board at ai.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Yes, a great
many cases.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: There is no record of
the number of those cases?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No.
How many
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
aasignments were made?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Only 102.
There werc 26 made in Albeita, 40 in Saskatcobewan, 17 in Manitoba, 9 in Ontario, 5
in Quebec and 5 in New Brunswick.
Parentheticaliy, I might etate there seems
to be some question whether or no.t this Act
goes so far as to dispiace the present
bankruptcy law in Quebec, or even oui own
bank-ruptcy law, to the extent of enabling a
farmer to resort to 'bankruptcy. The Quebec
la.w does not 60 enable him. We may bave
to consider in committee whether it wou'ld
not be we!1 to ýmake it plain that the Dominion
is exercising its jurisdiction in bankruptcy,
wbich is a jurisdiction concurrent with provincial judisdiction, but displacing it wbere
the Dominion seeks to oocupy the field. The
committee m.ay have to take into accounit the
wisdom of making clear tihat this Ac~t biecomes
the paramount law, enabling the farmer in
Québec, as eisewbere, subject to such conditions as may be deemed wise, to avail bimself of bankruptcy proceedings.
The Act came into effect on September 1 in
Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta; on
October 1 in Quebec and Ontario; on November 1 in Prince Edward Isl'and, Nova Scotia,
New Brunsw'ick and British Columbia.
Tbe numbers -of officiai receivers are as
foliows: Prince Edward Island, 3; Nova
Scotia, 7; New Brunswick, 7; Quebec, 38;
Ontario, 49; Manitoba, 9; Saskatchewan, 22;
Alberta, 20; British Columubia, 13;-total 168.
The remuneration of officiai receivers is at
the rate of $150 per month, with the exception
of the chief officiai. receiver in Quebec,
Saskatchewan and Alberta respectîvely, where
tihe remuneration is $250 per montb.
One officiai receiver in Quebec bas as many
as 25 settiements now before bim; one in
Alberta baq 30.
1 bave here a list of the receivers and
the places of sitting; but at the moment I
do not appear to bave before me a iist of the
places wbere the Board of Review sat-which
is what the bonourable senator (Hon. Mr.
Béiand) wanted to know witb reference to
tbe province of Quebec. I shahl give that

128

SENATE

:nformation later.
Meantime I may give
ome further data.
The 16.000 interviews between receivers
and farmers have been distributed as follows:
British Columbia, 340; Alberta, 3,230; Saskatchewan, 3,900; Manitoba, 1,250; Ontario,
2.700; Quebec, 4,500; New Brunswick, 420;
Nova Scotia, 75, and Prince Edward Island,
300. It would seem that Mairitime rights
had met with some success. at all events in
Nova. SIcotia. where there is a very marked
minimum of proposals under this Act.
Perhaps it will save the time of the House
if I conclude my remarks for the present,
and leave until later the information regarding the places where the Board has sat.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: It is somewhat early to express an opinion with regard
to the value of the Act, as it is hardly six
months since it went into operation. I have
heard some criticism from the province of
Quebec as to the damaging effect this legislation may have on the farming community
as a whole, but I have no special data to offer
this Chamber.
My right honourable friend speaks of the
possible necessity of enlarging the scope of
the Act in order to make sure that the
farmers of the province of Quebec may use
its mechanism to settle their difficulties.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Only with
respect to bankruptey. There is no doubt
that the farmer of Quebec, like the farmer
of any other province, can utilize the Act
for the rearrangement of his debts.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
voluntarily.

If he does it

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
In that
respect the machinery is complete, and that
power is not doubted. The doubt is as to
whether he can avail himself of the special
provision for bankruptcy in making an
assignment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
He is debarred
from coming under the Bankruptcy Act.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

In Quebec.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I think we
eliminated him some years ago at the general
request of the authorities of Quebec, and
before he is restored I should like to obtain
some information from that province.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
I can give
the information asked for by the honourable
gentleman (Hon. Mr. Béland) now. In the
province of Quebec the Board of Review has
sat in Montreal, Hull, Quebec City, Joliet
and Sherbrooke; in Ontario it apparently
Rglt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

sat only at Toronto; in Manitoba it sat at
Hamiota, Souris, Melita, Dauphin and Winnipeg; in Saskatchewan at Saskatoon, Regina
and Yorkton; in Alberta at Calgary, Edmonton, Lethbridge and Medicine Hat.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I understand
the Bill will go to the Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
and Commerce.

On Banking

Hon. RODOLPHE LEMIEUX:
Honourable senators, before it receives its second
reading I wish to register my protest against
this legislation. It is, in my humble judgment, only an invitation to farmers generally
to secure arrangements with their creditors,
and, in many instances, to refuse to meet
the interest on their mortgages although they
can well afford to pay. This means the
destruction of valid contracts which have
been made between creditors and debtors.
According to information
that I have
received, in certain districts some farmers
have simply refused to have anything to
do with their creditors; they are awaiting
the bounty of this law in order to escape
their just responsibilities. It seems to me,
and I say it v'ery sincerely, that the best
way to remedy the ills of the farmer is not
to destroy his credit-and that will be the
final result of this legislationHon. Mr. BELAND:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: -but that the best
way to help him-and we are all agreed on
doing that-is to give him a tariff under
which he can live, and which will make it
easier for him to reach markets for his products, markets which at the present time are
not available to him.
I am not opposed to the farmers; far from
it. We in our old province are all the
descendants of farmers. Our forefathers were
all tillers of the soil and growers of wheat,
as are the people of the West. I am not
saying anything against the honesty of the
farmers; far be it from my mind to do
so; but I say this Bill is an invitation to them
to avail themselves of a law which will
deprive some persons of their honest due. I
have information in this regard. I happen
to be a member of a loan company. We hear
from some of the debtors that they cannot
afford to pay, but a little investigation by the
judges, as we call them-I think that in the
West justices of the peace or judges of the
county court generally preside over this
arrangement-discloses the fact that the
debtors could pay part, at least, of the
amounut owing, and that with a moratorium
of some kind they could afford to pay the

MARCH 12, 1935
whole of it. Surely the farmers throughout
Canada are not so wholly ruined as to have
the right to claim that they should not pay.
I say that by this legislation we are giving
the Canadian farmer a bad name, and are
encouraging him to destroy his credit-a
very unfortunate thing, not only for him but
for the whole country. The only solution of
the whole difficulty in which we find ourselves to-day is a sound fiscal policy. Why
do you raise your tariffs? Why do you
restrict the markets of the farmer?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Who restricted them?
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: The fiscal policy of
the Government.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIIGHEN: The restrictions all took place five years ago. There
have been none since.

Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Oh, if I were to
cite the latest tariff increases my right
honourable friend would be surprised at the
ingenuity he exercised when he sat in the
Governmenit which restricted markets and
raised the tarif. The Ottawa accords with
London are replete with evidences that the
tariff has been raised and markets have been
restricted.
The cure of the ills of the farmer is a return to a sane tariff policy and a restoration
of markets. In that way, and that way only,
will the farmers become prosperous, and freed
of the necessity of invoking a law which, to
my mind, permits confiscation and is detrimental to a very important class of our
people.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable members, as the leader on the other side of the
House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) has said, this
legislation is of such a character that time
atone can -make known the benefits that wiJl
flow from it. No doubt it is entirely new
legislation, and one cannot tell at the present
time what the general effect of it will eventually be.
I am not going to agree with my honourable friend who has just pointed out certain
dangers. We had in Canada a situation that
had to be met. The farmer is not a dishonest man. The very fact that hundreds, probably thousands, have reached
voluntary agreement with their creditors is
evidence of the practical working out of this
Act. What has been the situation? I will
speak only for my own province. We have
thousands uipon thousands of farmers who, in
the ordinary sense, are absolutely bankrupt,
not by reason of the tariff, but simply in
consequence of grasshoppers, frost and drought.

The tariff hias had nothing to do with the
situation at ail. I say that thousands of
those people, if they put their assets on one
side and their liabiliities on the other, would
be shown to be absolutely bankrupt. W'hat
good would it do a loan company or anybody
to insist upon the fuli pound of flesh? The
farmer cannot pay it. And more than that,
if the farmer is required to pay be cannot stay on the land. If the creditor insists
upon his principal or interest, there is only
one thing to do, and thet is to put the sheriff
in and throw the farmer off the farm. Well,
I am sure my 'honourable friend does not
desire that to be donc. What would become
of Canada if we tried to deal with this situation under laws of the past? The result would
not be very good for this country, as everybody knows. Coneequently this legislation
was passed last session, with the object of
meeting a most difficult situation, one that
had to be faced if our farmers as a whole
were to have a chanoe to live in the future.
I shoulcd like to say a few words about the
tarif, which has been referred to by my
honourable friend from Rougemont (Hon. Mr.
Lemieux). He probably has not been following recently the activities of his good old
friend Lloyd George. What did Lloyd George
say lately, on two occasions? About a month
or six weeks ago he intimated that Great
Britain should raise her tariff, and the other
day he came out with the declaration that
Great Britain shouid adopt the highest tarif
she possibly can, as a weapon with which to
fight countries that will not trade freely with
her. That is his view of to-day.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: But not of yesterday.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: No, of to-day. Why?
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Because he wants to

join the Government.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Simply because he
realizes the situation that exists throughout
the world. Every country has put up a high
tarif. Great Britain was not in a position to
trade freeiy with any other country; consequently she has changed her tarif policy.
She has done so in order to have a weapon
for use against any country that uses a tarif
against her. The fact is not that Lloyd
George is not a free trader. Nor are the
people in Canada unwilling to trade more freely
with other countries. But are we going to
iower our tariffs and let every other nation
ship their goods here, when we cannot ship
ours to them? I say no.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: What country is going
to be the first to do away with its tarif?

SENATE

Hon. Mr. CALDER: I suppose the vîiew of
my honourable friend is that we should be
made the dumping ground of the entire world.
I do not agree with that view. The situation
that we have in Canada has nothing at all te
do with tariffs. It is the resuit, in the first
place, of a world-wide -depression, and, in the
second place, of peculiar conditions that have
existed in Canada. This legislation is experimental. There is no question at all as to its
necessity. I do not know that we all would
agree on its terms, but something had to be
done to meet a very difficult situation. The
fact that the Act has been operating so
smoothly thus far is an indication that it
points in the right direction.
Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH: Honourable
senators, I wish to say just a few words on
the operation of the Act in the province of
Alberta. It may be said that the result of the
compromises that have been brought about
in the last six months and to which the parties
concerned agreed, though probably with wry
faces, is that the situation is no worse now
than it was under the conditions to which
reference has been made. That is to say,
drought, grasshoppers, frost, hail and other
factors left the farmer with liabilities in excess
of his assets, and a man who had a mortgage
on a farm would have been delighted to get
50 cents on the dollar.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I do net know of
any mortgogee. of any lender of money, in the
province of A'lberta who would not be glad
t get 50 cents on the dollar for his principal
and accumulated interest. Many a creditor
would be glad to wipe out the interest and
take half the principal in full settlement. The
official receivers and the board have brought
about settilements which are no worse than
the situation resulting from conditions to
which I have referred. When this legislation
came down last year I agreed to it, because I
thought it probably would work out that way.
It is having its effect of freeing farmers whose
liabilities are greater than their assets, and
who did not know what was to become of
themselves. They have been heartened, they
are taking a brighter view of things and deciding te stay on the land; and on the other
hand, through adjustments made under the
Act, creditors are getting as much as they
could hope to get in any event. I think that
among debtors and creditors who have been
concerned in these settlements, or who expect
to be, and indeed among alI classes in the
province. including business men, there is a
general feeling that the Act is working as well
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

as it can be expected to work, and that under
present conditions it is sound legislation.
Hon. A. B. GILLIS: Honourable senators,
I should like to endorse the statements of the
honourable senator from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr.
Calder) in connection with this legislation.
While unfavourable conditions in regard to
mortgages probably exist throughout Canada,
the situation in the Prairie Provinces is a
little more serious than in other parts of the
country. This Act was received by the people
of Western Canada with great enthusiasm.
They felt that it would give a chance to hundreds and thousands of farmers who had
given up hope of ever being able to succeed,
or ever being able to pay off their liabilities;
that it would bring them relief and enable
them to sec daylight ahead. This has proved
to be the case.
As I mentioned a moment ago, there are
hundreds and probably thousands of cases
where a settlement has been arrived at between a debtor and creditors without an appeal to any board. The mortgage companies
are eager to have settlements made even at 50
cents on the dollar, and probably less, because
they have very little hope of ever being able
to obtain payment of the total indebtedness
to them. Interest Lad been piling up year
after year, and many accounts were absoliutely
hopeless. This Act will, I think, relieve the
situation considerablv.
The Government is
to be complimented upon the action it has
taken in cntering into what is really a new
field of lugislation. Some people say it is
more or les Socialist legislation, but I do not
care what it is called so long as it relieves the
situation, particularly in Western Canada.
My honourable friend from Rougemont
(Hon. Mr. Lemieux) refcrred to the tariff.
What in the world lias the tariff to do with
the ordinary farce mortgage? The honourble
gentleman urges us to throw off protection
and open up our country to producers of the
world. But where should we find markets
for Canadian products?

What country would

lower its tariff to permit the entry of our
goods? No country at all would do that. The
only possible chance of benefiting our farmers
is through legislation of this character, for
it wilI assist the people who are engaged in
our basic industry. This is one of those Acts
that will materially help Canadiaýn farmers
to remain on their land, pay off their
liabilities, and develop and prosper as they
ought.
Hon. LUCIEN MORAUD (official translaticn) : Honourable senators, as a representative of the province of Quebec, I
should like to add a few words to what

MARCH 12, 1935
bas alreadyr been said in this respect by
same of my hanourable colleagues. This does
not represent a new step in that direction for
us, because the Quebec Government lias
already passed a similar law, which allaws a
debtor ta delay the payment of the principal
he owes bis creditar, notwithstanding any
agreement between them, on the debtor applying informally ta a judge of the Superior
Court. We caîl it the Moratorium Act.
In respect ta the legislatian now before us,
it may nat be perfect, but we should nevertheless greet it with open arms. It allows aur
farmers to escape freim the disgrace of bankruptcy, as well as the heavy expenditure involved in aur province in bankruptcy proceedings. It affords aur farmers, who, unlike their
brethren frein the cities, oannat easily came
inta contact with their creditors, a chance to
meet the latter before an arbiter called the
registrar, ta explain their situation ta the
creditors, ta talk- matters over together and
try ta obtaîn. a settlement advantageaus all
around, which will allow the farmer ta remain on bis farm. with bis numeraus children.
Il the creditars are too exacting, or the debtorfarmer's offers aire tcao low, and, an arrangement is impassible, the case is referred ta
wbat is called a Board of Review. This court,
in the province of Quebc, bas been most
happily chosen. 'The presiding judge is a man
ad wide experience and is gifted with a mast
desira'ble quality: lie is humane. The creditars'
representative i.s a merchant who bas deaît al
bis life witb the farming community and still
does. The farmers' repre-sentative is especially
well qualified for the post. Not only iýslie a
farmeýr bimself, fromn a calanization district,
but, moreover, bis industry and talent have
earned for himi the title of doctar in agriculture freim one of the most reputable calleges in the province af Quebec. Sa far, this
court lias given entire satisfaction to the
farmers.
Consequently, this Act will allaw aur f armers
ta escape frein the diisgrace of bankruptcy, for
aur peaple still consider bankruptcy as a disgrace; it will allow them. ta save their farm,
wbich, in many cases, came ta thern frein
their ancestors, and ta keep there their large
family, by giving them a chance ta meet their
creditars freely and ta arrive at a compromise
that is mutually advantageaus. Therefore I
repeat that this Act, although it is nat yet perfect, should be cordially welcomed by all the
representatives of aur province in this House.
May I ask the
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR:
right honourable leader a question? It bas
been stated in the press that the Farm. Lan
Bill is a campanion measure ta the one now
under cansideration. I shauld like to in92ffl-gi

13!

quire if under the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act debts are ta be so adjusted that
they can be met by boans whicb wiIl be made
available to farmers by the Farm Loan Board.
If that is nlot so, I do nlot know where farmers
will get any new loans.
Right Hon. Mr. MEJIGRIEN: They are
companion Actes, of course. But su-rely the
honourable gentleman is not serious in suggesting that the Farmi ban Board should in
every case provide sufficient money to enable
a farmer to pay bis debts.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: No, I did not suggest that.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: There is a
suggestion involved in the question. Thrý
honourable senator should know that no Bil
could possibly make such a provision. Bik
15 provides for a certain measure of assistant~
ta farmers by way of loan. This Bill providtr
for adjustment of debts. Necessarily ont
Bill assists the other, but the measure before
us merely contains four important, but by
no means very important, amendments.
I have more sympathy with the honourable
senator from Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Lemieux)
than perhaps would be indicated by some of
my speeches up to now. in respect of bis
solicitude for the maintenance of a proper
psychology in this country tawards the meaning of a contractual obligation. One would
little have thought even ten years ago that
we in this country should corne ta that casual,
unanchored attitude which seems to be only
too preva lent to-day towards the sacredness
of an obligation. When we see what is taking
place in more parts than one of this Dominion, we -begin to wonder just what is thi
basis of civilized society.
We begin tý
wonder whether, after aIl, when a man en,
gages ta do something, he ougbt not to bt
compel]ed ta do it ta the utmost of hii.
power, or whetber hie should be put in a
position ta say: "Well, it is more convenient
for me not ta do so. I shaîl have ta deprive
mysclf of something if I do my utmost.
inasmuch as there is a new doctrine thal
human rights are above property rights, why
shouldn't I have my hunian rights and let
property rights go?" That is a very prevalent
attitude to-day, and we ought to be very
careful that we do not by any legislation
give encouragement to it in the mind of the
individual. Once we eut adrift from the
anchorage of an honest endeavour ta secure
the utmost in the power of every single
debtar te discharge his just obligations, tiben
we are maving towards the disintegration of
Society.

sonator from F.ganville (Rigbt Hon. Mr.
Grahanm), was not a member of a Governmont so provocabive in ib.s tariffs as to raise
flbc Hatxley-Smoot tariff againsf tbe farmers
of Canada!
Stîrely thbe bonourable senaf or
îtnmediatelY opposite me (Hon. Mr. Dandnrand) did 00f 10 raise Canadian tariffs as
to provoke the United Stafes to ebut fbe
cattle of Quebec ouf of tbe American markef!

MARCH 12, 1935
That is exactly what the United States did.
When was 42 cents a bushel put on Canadian
wheat going into the United States? It was
during the regime of my honourable friends
opposite. Now, what provocative action were
they guilty of? Surely sometbing lies on their
conscience! It is not, apparently on the conscience of the bonouriable member, for hie
says it is our provocative tariffs that have
done this tbing. They were not our tariffs;
they were his: hie and his party were in office.
When was the tariff in France raised against
Canadian wheat? When the honourable member and bis friends were in office. When was
the tariff in Germany raised against our
wheat, virtually, indeed entirely, shutting it
out? When the honourable gentleman and
lis friends were in office.
When was the
Australian tariff raised against our farm products? When the bonourable gentleman and
bis friends were in office.
Now ýdoes be like to be arraigned and
found guilty of being the persecutor of the
farmers of Canada because hie bad provocative
tariffs put into effeet which resulted in virtually every country in the world shutting its
door to the Canadian farmer?
I do not
know of any country where tariffs have been
raised since 1930, but I do know of some
countries where tbey have heen
lowered.'
And I know why they were lowered, and why
we have bad greatly extended markets whicb
have benefited the Canadian farmer, not
trivially, but to the extent of tens of millions
of dollars. I have in mind particularly the
bacon market in England for the Canadian
farmer. This was provided by the Ottawa
agreements, which the bonourable gentleman
seems to deplore. It is a bacon market of
280,000,000 pound-s, of whicb even yet we
bave ahsorbed only about a third. Two-thirds
are still to be absorbed, and will be just as
soon as we producoe bacon of a quality to
attract that market. As a consequence of
that outlet for Canadian bacon, accentuated
by the polîcy of the British Government in
raising bacon prices, our farmers are getting
to-day 7-75 cents a pound for bacon; and
in the past, year and a quarter they have
got as high as 9 cents a pound for their pork.
That bias meant tens of millions of dollars in
the pockets of the farmers of this country.
Is it not better to get something when you
give something? That is what we got when
we gav.e-and what we gave was flot at the
expense of the farmers of Canada. I could
go mucb further. What is the condition of
our apple market to-day?
1 do not think
my honourable friends had provocative tariffs
in that connectioti. Is that market 110W contracted by provocative tariffs?
It lias ex-

133

panded. Wïe get aocess for our fruit produets
to-day to a far greater extent than we have
had for a generation.
The apple growers
benefit accordingly.
The honourable gentleman opposite says we
ought to provide a marketing mecbanismmachinery to get our produets to market.
Why, this Parliament juLst a year ago erected
sucb machinery. Our Marketing Act is that
macbinery.
What bas been the test of
time in re.gard to ýit? To-day, by voluntary
action on the part of the producers in seven
different lines of farm produets, the mnaehinery of that Aict is in vogue, and the
general verd-ict is that it is henefiting the
farmers of Canada. Thi6 is practical. legislation. This is not barking 'back to the old
fetish that bas been exploded again and again,
until we are ail tired of tariff discussions.
It is sornething done for the farmers. Tbey
are reaping tbe benefit, and tbey know it.
So in tbese respects we have not been
negligent of their interests; there bias been.
more accomplished than in a long period of
years previously. The preseot Bill gives to
the farmer, at a low cost, some of the facilities that have long been given to other citizens
of -our country.
Right *Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAMHonourable members, I think my right honourab-le friend's enthusiasm indicates that bis
action of some yeurs ago on the reciprocity
proposals is still bothering bis conscience. One
of our difficulties with the United States arose
over bbc conduet of the electors of Canada
when tbey denied a vast number of people the
benefit of securing markets that were offered
to them, not by tariffs, as my rigbt bonourabae
friend almost said, used as bludgeons to bring
better ternis, but by a treaty between Canada
and the UJnited States, which this country
turned down for party purposce solely, to my
mimd.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, bear.

Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That is wben
we had most trouble about tariffs. If my rigbt

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: My rigbt
honourable friend defended higb tariffs.

134

SENATE

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Ijo, he did
not.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Honourable
gentlemen around him thumped their desksand they are all high tariff men. If they be
right, every leading economist in the world
must be wrong. We read that the ýleading
bank presidents and bank managers, the leading economists throughout the world, and the
outstanding men of the churches are all of
the opinion that until the countries of the
worl.d outgrow their national conscience and
cultivate an international conscience, and are
ready to adopt the golden rule, to traýde with
one another for mutual benefit, we cannot expect any great recovery in our trade and commerce. I did not intend to say a word about
this, but my right honourable friend be'came
so enthusiastic that I had to. I am Jed to
think back to the time when I was told on the
platform that I was disloyal if I wanted to
trade with the United States, and was asked
under what flag I wanted to be, and all that
sort of thing.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Of course the
younger mon do net remember that, and
some of those who do would like to forget
it. Even the Govornment itself would like
to forget it, because it is trying to make a
reciprocity trcatv, and only a few yoars ago
that was disloyal.
I do not wish to say anything more. Like
the right honourable gentleman. I could talk
at great length along this line, but I want te
bring him back te the realities of life, and
to get away from theoretical mysticisms.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Like the price
of pork.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: What really
injured the price of pork and bacon in the
Old Land cwasz tut fact that those who had the
conduct of the War allowed our bacon, whiclh
was of a uperior quality, to be cla-sed wit'h
inferior bacn, and prieed accordingly. I
know from experience that you
could net
buv a pouid of Canadian bacon in London
unless you bouglht witl it a pound and a lialf
of thr inferior bacon. Tiat did more to hurt
our bacon market tban any tariff, bucause at
that time there was very little tariff.
Now, to get away from the tariff for a
moment. One of the difficulties that lenders
of money cncounter just now is this. Thîere
was a time when. if a cian took a mortgage
on a farm, lie could recover approximat.elv
the amount of his loan; but to-day th valuie
of the farm is not sufficient to make that
possible. because the farm is not producing,
Riglt Hon.

Mr. GRAHAM.

in cash, at least. To-day, if the farmer cannet pay the loan, the lender of the money
dare net take over the farm, because it is a
liability instead of an asset. If he did, he
would at once discover that part of the indebtedness is made up of arrears of taxes, and
further, that he is liable to heavy taxation by
the mun-iipality or district in which the
farm is situated.
Just because a thing is new I do not despise
it; but neither do I grasp at it. I have a
good deal of sympathy with what lias been
said by my right honourable friend (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighon) and my bon.ourable friend
to my left (Hon. Mr. Lemieux), namely, that
we must be careful in our efforts te help
under specially difficult conditions.
I am
sufflcicntly old-fashioned to believe that a
contract is a contract, and that, if at all
possible, it should bo respected and h-onoured.
I hope that our people will net get into the
habit-I do net think they will-of endtavouring te evade their responsibilities. The fact
that a mac bas made a bad bargain is no
reason why he should net kce-p it. It is his

about the deal. that is a matter for adjudication. I say that if a man makes a legal
contract he ought te be compel.led to carry
it out as far as lie possibly can.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear. hear.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: If wîe do not
keeti
our contracts-I am speaking now not
of farm loans. but of the general principleour own personal credit wild disappoar. and
whecn the credit of the people is gone the
credit of the country will be gone also.
Hon. R. B. HiORNER: There is just one
phase of this matter that bas net been taken
into consideration. The right honourable
gentleman (Right Hon. Mr. Graham) speaks
as though every dollar of this credit that is
being dealt with in the Bill were mortgage
money, or money actually loaned on land.
In the province of Saskatchewan a great
part of the land bas been sold by one farmer
to another under agreement of sale, often
at vry high prices and on long terms, without one dollar being paid out. When the
farmer finds that what the land is protducing
is not sufficient to enable him te meet bis
rcsponsibilitics he goes before the receiver,
with the other party te the sale, and the
matter is adjusted to the satisfaction of both
parties. When that is donc the farmer's
credit is much botter than it would have been
otherwise.
The majority of the cases in
Saskatchewan are of that kind. I have in
nmind some transactions in which I sold land
without receiving one dollar in cash. I am

135

MARCH 12, 1935
flot iosing, because I sold the land fer a
higher price than I paid for it. The arrangement is perfectly fair. Tha matter cornes
before the Board of Review, at the head of
which there is a vary efficient man, and no
one is forced to accapt an agreament that
is flot satisfactory. This is first-class legisiation, and will flot injure anyone's credit.

CANADIAN

FAR'M LOAN BILL

SECOND RADING

Right Hon. ARTHIUR MEIGIIEN moved
the second- reading of Bill 15, an Act ta
amend the 'Canadian Farm Loan Act.
Ha said: Honourabie sanatars, the amendments to the Farmn Loan Act as proposed by
this Bill are considerabiy more significant
than wera the amandments ta the Farmers'
Creditors Arrangement Act proposed by the
previous Bill. I can give the flouse the
abjects af the 'Bill, item by item, without
refarance to the special sections. I think
that may be the claarest way ta put its purposes before the flouse. They are as follows:
First, ta strengthen the Canadian Farm
Loan Board by incraasing its membership.
It should be notad that three additional
provinces will now be inciuded within the
scope of its operations.
Second, to give the board complete control
of and responsibility for the administration
of the Act in ail provinces. This is to be
accompiished by giving the board contrai
over the selection and appointment of ail
provincial administrative officiais and lcal,
advisory boards.
Third, ta enabLe the board' ta initiate
loaning operations in any province withaut
waiting for the passage af provincial enabiing legisiation as a condition precedent
thereto.
Fourth, ta relieve borrowers and provincial
governments of the nacessity af subscribîng
ta capital stock of the board with respect
ta loans made by the board.
Fifth, to increase the amount of funds
available ta the board for loaning purposes.
Sixth, ta, enable the board ta make
additional advances ta farmers obtaining firstmortgaga boans in province-s where chattel
security for such additional advances cannot
be taken; for axampla, the province ai
Quebec.
The flouse will see at a glanca that the
affect af these amendments is ta, open considerabiy wider the door ta farmn bans.
Under the original schema, before the board
couid operate in a province the Act had ta be
adopted by that province, and the province

had to subscrihe ta the capital stock. In
addition, the borrowar made a subscription
af, 1 think, five per cent of his borrowings,
ta the stock af tha Farmn Lan Board. The
present Bill anables the board ta initiate
boans in provinces which have nat accepted
the Act, simpiy becausa they have been
unable ta do so, and it empowers the Government ta advance by way ai subscription nat
oniy the $5,000,000 originally provided, but
five par cent ai the boans made, the restraint
baing that at no time shahl the amount of
securities held by way of mortgage be mare
than twanty timas the amount of this suhscription. The Bill provides also for the
turning in ta the Govarnmant af the stock
alraady subscrihad for by borrowers under
the aid provisions af the Act, and the
crediting by the Government of the subscription price on the indebtedness oi the borrower.
Then it provides for an extension af the
borrowing powers of the Farmn Loan Board
up ta $50.000,000. The Government can in
the firat instance take the debentures, and
aiterwards ha rahiavad by a public issue. The
Govarnment can guarantee the debentures,
as was the case under the Act. In ganeral,
tha affect ai this is ta ramova restrictions
which. appear ta have been impossible ta
apply in operation, though intended by way
ai safeguards, and as ta this there can certainiy be no criticism.
As regards the power ta boan, whare chattel
mortgaga sacurity ca.nnot be obtainad the
Bill permits af Iending up ta sixty par cent
af value; where chattel mortgage sacurity
can ha obtained, up ta sixty-six par cent.

The clause respecting the extent ta which

SENATE

improved. I think I had better read it verbatin to the House. It is clause 19, and it
is as follows:
(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in
Part 1 of this Act, the Board may in any case
where it Iends on the security of a first
mortgage, make a further loanThis is the further loan provision which is
specially intended to be co-operative with the
provision of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act.
-for
a period of not more than six years,
repayable on such terms as the Board mnay
determine, on the security of a second mortgage
on the farm lands and in those provinces of
Canada where chattel security may be taken
by the Board, of a charge on live stock and
other personal property.
(2) The aggregate of loans made to any one
borrower under the provisions of Parts I and
Il of this Act shall not exceed, in those provinces of Canada where chiattel security may be
taken by the Board. two-thirds of the appraised
vaile of the land and buildings in respect of

which security is taken, and in any province
where chattel security may not bu taken sixty
per cent of the said value and shall not exceed
at any one time the sum of seven thousand five
hundred dollars. The amount advanced under
this section shall not exceed one-half the
amount advanced on the security of the first
mortgage.
There are three limitations: first, that where
a chattel mortgage can be taken the total
amount of the two securities shall not bu
more than sixty-six per cent, and where a
chattel mortgage cannot be taken, sixty per
cent; second, that the amnount loaned to any
one farmer shall not exceed $7,500; and,
third. that the amount of the second mortgage
shall not exceed half the amount of the first.
These are, I think I can say, all the important features of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Was not the amount
involved in the old Act 840.000,000?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX:

NATIONAL RAILWAYS AUDITORS BILL
SEOOND READING

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN moved
the second reading of Bill 20, an Act respecting the appointment of Auditors for National
Railways.
He said: Honourable members, the Canadian National-Canadian Pacifie Act, passed
two sessions ago, provided that auditors
should be appointed by Parliament year by
year. I think the Act said they were to be
appointed by resolution, but apparently it
has been decided to make the appointment
by way of a Bill. This undoubtedly is a
compliance with the Act.
The auditors for, 1 t'hink, twelve years back
have been George A. Touche and Company,
a highly reputable firm. as exvery honourable
member knows, of long standing. Its head
office is in Great Britain, but it operates all
over Canada.
Prior to that time, if my
memory is right-the rigit ionourable gentleman opposite xvill know about this-tthe auditors we Peat. Marwick. Mitchell and Company. The purpose oif the present Bill is to
appoint the firm of Cliarkson, Gordon, Dilwortlh, Cuilfoyle and Nash for the year 1935.
It is needless to say that this is not in any
way intended as a reflectioni on George A.
Touche and Company.
In suggesting the
appointmenit of another firn the Government
iî actuated bv the view that it is better to
change auditors periodically, and certainly
a1fter surh a length of time as twelve years.
The principle of changing auditors is embedded in our Bank Act. That statute requires t-hat there shall- be two independent
atditors for each bank, and in no case can
the same tvo auiltors hold their appointment
for longer than two years. One may remain
bevond that time. but not both.

We are of course not discussing the writing

can see it, no financial gain would result to
the country through a writing down. The
only advantage would be that a governmentowned institution would be given a better
chance to show its ability to manage itself
in a business way. If its capitalization is
beyond anything that can be imagined as
just, of course it never can make as good a
showing as if it is fairly capitalized. But the

brought down. Now, it seems to me that
there is a debt of a billion dollars and by
a method of book-keeping it has been made
to appear as a double liability. The only
way J can imagine that came about is that
it was charged in the first place to the Canadian National, that it is included in the total
of its debts, for which the Government is
responsible, and is included also in the
country's total debt. I am suggesting that
merely as a plausible explanation.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is the
explanation. If the Government loans the
Canadian National a million dollars, that
becomes part of the national debt. It also
becones part of the debt of the Canadian
National to the Government. If it is counted
twice. it appears as one million more than
it actually is.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: May I ask the right
lonourable gentleman who is going to provide for the renuneration of the Canadian
National auditors?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The same
people who provided for the remuneration
of the old ones.

LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOR COMMITTEE
ON BANKING AND COMMERCE
Hon. F. B. BLACK presented, and moved
concurrence in. the following report of the
Standing Committee on Banking and ComIerce:
The conunittee reconmmends that it be provided with legal assistance.
He said: Honourable senators, ior the
benefit of those whio are not members of
the Banking and Commerce Committee I
may say that it bas to do a great deal
of work which requires expert legal attention. Sinre the death of our old friend
Mr. Crigihtion the Senate las had no regular
Law Clerk. It will be remembered that last
seýssion the committee had before it such
ncasires as the Shipping Bill, the Admiralty
Bill and the Conpanies Bill. Legislation of
that charactir demands a great deal of thought
and care, espeially by legally trained minds.
As a result, the right honourable leader of the
Hoise and the honourable leader on the other
side had imposed upon tlien a lot of hard
wrork whih

it was

unfair that they should

have had to aitend to at all. The committee

we haive bad a large number of sittings in

COMBINES INVESTIGATION ACT AND
oRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT BILL
SECOND READING POSTPONED

On the Order:
Second reading of Bill G, an Act to amend
the Combines Investigation Act and the Criminal Code.-Hon. Mr. Casgrain.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Honourable members, some kind friends have informed me
that this Bill is not properly printed according to the rules. in that it contains no explanatory notes. Therefore I move that the
order be discharged and put on the Order
Paper for Tuesday next.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: How is this Bill not
properly printed? The copy in my hand contains explanatory notes opposite each section.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The Bill has only
just now been placed before us. Surely the
purpose of the rules is to give honourable
senators reasonable time in which to compare the proposed amendments with the
original sections.

Hon. Mr. BLACK: That does not answer
my question. I ask how the Bill is not
properly printed.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The reprint has
just been placed before us.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Copies of the
reprinted Bill have just come from the Distribution Office.
The motion was agreed to.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I understood
that the Unemployment Insurance Bill had
come over from the other House. If so, we
could give it first reading to-day.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: May I remind honourable senators that yesterday two Bills were
referred to the Banking and Commerce Committee, and suggest that the committee sit
this afternoon to deal with those Bills.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I suggest that
the statement of the chairman be taken as
notice to all members of the Banking and
Commerce Committee that we meet immediately after adjournment of the Senate,
to sea what progress we can make with the
two bills to which he refers.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: Do I understand that
the committee has finished taking evidence
from lawyers and patent attorneys with respect
to the Patent Bill?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We are to
meet to-morrow morning to complete the work
on the Patent Bill. Thereupon it is intended
to have the Bill thoroughly reviewed by myself and someone who can stay here over the
week-end, and put into a form which I hope
will be verbally and phraseologically better
than the form it is in now. It is also important to see there is no conflict between the
various sections and all their parts. This is
the more important because nearly the whole
Bill has been revamped and rowritten. The
purpose of the old Act has been kept in mind
thoroughly, but the Bill is new in its methods,
and so on, and I should not like it to go to
the other House until it has been given a
thorough verbal overhauling. I hope the Bill
in its amended form will be brought before us
next Tuesday' morning, because it is desired
by the Minister in charge that it be reported
to the other House without unnecessary delay.
This afternoon. after adjournrment, the Banking and Commerce Committee can address
itself. for the first time, to the task that has
been allotted to it of considering the Farm
Loan Bill and the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Bill.

of Canada what I feed susre is thc intent of
those who prcpared the record. I thought it
ws atetr
a mistake te show the picture,
and next day I draftc-d myv precrint inquiry.
Thcn, re-alizing that nsany wouid diffez frein
rny iiwN, 1 deubted whcther it was werth
wshile to precet d fuirtier.
Man v Canadians secing "Lest We Forget'
conccivalirnight fail to recaîl the sareastic
refcrences to the great republic te the seuth.
in dcri-ien of the dlaims of tnanv ef its
citizens thiat their country "wvon the war,' and
htcomic iindmtt withi the idesa that Canada
hiad heen irnsinly instrumental in bringing,
vietorxv te the Allies. Tric, in "Lest We

Canadian soldiers lying, here and there, of
our men gning ever'the top and drepping in
their tracks, prcsumahly shiot dcad, and I amn
sure the at rage person would say, "What
greater w-arning couiti 3'os give te thc young
peeple of Canada thian te, show thesa such
gruesomne sighits?'
But te offet those harrowing scenes of the
mud and blýond of Fiandtrs, there le another
sido dcpictcd: the asscsnhiing of the first great
and giorious Canadian contingent in September. 1914, and ite embarkation at Qcebec. I
iras at Quebec at the time and witnessed the
event, and while viewing the picture I could

MARCH 19, 1935
not help wondering if this pictorial record
was going to have a beneficial influence on
our youth. Then the picture showed the
arrival of the transports on the other side and
the entraining of the solidiers for camp. I
thought one serious omission was made in
the failure to show the awful conditions, as I
am informed, under which in many cases our
soldiers were trained in the Motherland. Then
were depicted the movements of our troops
to various sectors of the fighting front. There
was also shown the meeting of the great men
of the allied countries in their efforts to
create pride and enthusiasm in the minds of
the fighting men. And so the picture unfolded its record of the war.
One incident I thought could not but
appeal te every Canadian, more especially to
our young men from 18 to 28 years of age.
We saw a number of happy, care-free, laughing aviators, presumably on parade to be
photographed. Probably a few minutes later
many of those young men would be engaged
in a "dog fighrt" in the air and spiral to
their death. That part was not shown. I
khow something of the sentiments of our
young men, and I wonder if many of the
scenes in "Lest We Forget" would not appeal
to them. For several years past, in this Canada of ours-yes. and elsewhere in the world,
I hasten to add, for I want every honourable senator to believe me when I affirm
there is no shade nor shadow of politics in
any references that I may now make-young
fellows have been denied the opportunity to
earn a living and have been hanging around
pool rooms or similar places. I wonder if
suci young men would net, to use a very
apt expression, feel "fed up" wiith this frustration and say: "Me for that. Anything to
break the monotony and get away from this
life of doing nothing and going nowhere."
Recently I received a letter from a young
fellow, and it describes se well what I am
sure is in the minds of many of our young
men that I am going to read it for t'he benefit
of honourable members. The letter is undated, but the envelope beurs the stamp of
Toronto, March 16:
Dear Sir:
I read in the paper where you were going
to oppose the showing of the picture "Lest We
Forget." Is this true or false? If it is true,
why do you oppose it? Is it because you have
shares in the "Canadian Nickel Company" and
in some munition factory which makes arms to
kill us?
That picture is not fit to be shown, you say!
Why not? That picture is helping to get the
glory of war out of our minds. "Glory of
War," bah! slaughter, killing, murder, that's all
it is. Murdering men, women and children to
satisfy the greed of armament manufacturers,

143

and yet when a picture comes along you oppose
it, a picture whieh may help to defeat "war"!
You would rather see us killed and maimed.
I know that I am echoing the sentiments of the
majority of the boys, and coming men, that war
should not be.
Age 13 years, but old enough to bark.
Yours truly,
Bill Story.
I say, more power to Bill Story for giving
us an expression of his views. But please do
not forget that Bill says he is thirteen years
of age. Carrying my mind back to July, 1914,
when I was in somewhat close contact with a
considerable number of boys, I rememiber
two, aged fifteen and sixteen, whom I knew
fairly well. If the opinion of those two boys,
or either of them, had been placed on
record at that time, it would have been just
as strongly against war as that expressed by
Bill Story. They would have opposed the
murder, the bloodshed and the futility of
war with all their hearts. But what happened? Recruiting officers and others were
going up and down throughout the land saying to the well set up young fellows, even
though they had net attained their full
growth: "Why aren't you enlisting? Why
don't you join up?" As a result, many boys
wh'o had been absolutely and unalterably
opposed to war "got into the game for shame's
sake," as they said. Those two boys with
whom I was in particularly close contact
were pestered by this woman, that man and
the other fellow, until finally they begged
for a chance to line up and do their bit; and
when they got permission they lined up and
did their bit.
One of them sleeps in a
soldier's grave to-day. I do not think those
two boys were a bit different from any other
red-blooded young Canadian in this Canada
of ours. iSo, with all due respect te Bill
Story and the thousands of other young fellows who, I am sure, feel as he does, I ask
where this glorification of war-,because in
my opinion that is all the picture is, a glorification of Canada's part in the Great Waris going to lead us.
If I could have my way in this matter,
which I realize I cannot have, I would demand
that every man and woman in the Dominion
of Canada who is over thirty years of age
see this picture; and I would be just as insistent that every person of less than thirty
years of age should be prevented from seeing
it. I know that in this respect many distinguished senators and others will disagree
with me; but I think the picture will d'o far
more harm than good, so far as the purpose that we all have in mind is concerned.

144

SENATE

Let us analyse this matter a little further.
Canada is spending about $13,000,000 a year
in connection with war, or in maintaining
a status which will enable her to enter upon
war with a reasonably prepared skeleton
army, a nucleus around which to build an
army such as Canada was proud of from
1914 to 1918. It seems somewhat absurd,
therefore, that at the same time this country should be spending about $300,000 a year
towards securing peace, and in connection
with the League of Nations. The expenditure of some of that money is inconsistent.
But that is net the point we are discussing
just now. The fact is that we have been
making those expenditures for a number of
years, and I do not think they are likely
to be stopped by reason of anything I may
say. Press reports to-day indicate that war
and rumours of war are more than ever in
the minds of some of the peoples of the
world, and I have more sympathy to-day
with whiat was said by the honourable senator from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach)
a few weeks ago than I had when bu spoke.
At that time I did not believe he was nearly
as accurate in his remarks with respect to
war as I now believe him te have been.
Those who are behind the showing of this
motion picture "'Lest We Forget" argue
that it will do a great deal to prevent war,
and war enthusiasm in the minds of the
young people of Canada. That is the point
I want te talk about.
On March 9, two days after the first showing of this picture "Lest We Forget," there
appeared in the Ottawa Journal, as there
frequently does, a splendid editorial. Parts
of it are so good and so apt that I am going
Among other things, the
to read them.
editorial says:
This is not a picture to pander to the morbid
or the sensational, nor is it compounded of
that mere emphasis upon horror and beastliness which have marred cinema versions of so
many war books. What is shown here is an
actual and faithful photographie record of
things that were done

and endured by Canada's

own flesh and blood in those four dread years
in France-a mingling of human heroism and
sacrifice with acts and scenes so terrible as te
bu almost beyond belief.
Then it concludes:
Those who believe in war, those who hate
war, those who think of war as socmething
glamorous, those who wish to know what our
own endured for us in the world's Calvaryall should see "Lest We Forget."
That sounds splendid. I do net disagree
with what I know to be the intent, but I
wonder whether the person who wrote it has
seen his own or other people's boys changed
by the glamour of war and the enthusiasm
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

and the "Come on" of their fellows. I wonder
if he bas seen the things that some of the
rest of us have seen.
On the same date there appeared in the
Journal another article describing a scene that
most certainly should have been made a part
of this picture "Lest We Forget." This article,
appearing on the first page, reads as follows:
Veteran Dies on His Way to Ottawa

To Claim Renewal of His Pension
Died in Quebec Police Station After Being
Picked up Unconscious on Street in City

Kentville, N.S., March 9.-Daniel Marven,
48-year-old veteran who died in a Quebec police
station, left Kentville over a week ago for
Ottawa to clai
a renewal of his pension,
discontinued' in January.
To-day his griof-stricken widoxv declared "be
was a good husband and a wonderful father.
I don't believe be took his own life and there
is no reason why any person should take his

life."
Then she implored "all Canadian mothers, all
English mothers, all Scottish inothers, and all
other mothers in the Empire" to unite to stop
war.
"War is hell. It gives nothing for thousands
upon thousands of fine young men and women
and countless fathers and mothers," she said.
"My husband enlisted in the lst Canadian
Contingent to go overseas. He was grievously
wounded in the head in 1917. He never asked
for a pension, despite the urging of his many
friends. However, be was eventually given a
pension, whichi was discontinued in January of
this year."
An inquest into the death is to be held at
Quebec to-day. Marven was picked up unconscious, on a Quebec street Thursday night.
What a regrettable thing it is that "Lest
We Forget" did net show the movements of
Daniel Marven from 1914, when e left his
loved ones as a member of the First Contingent, down to the time when, in seeking a
renewal of his pension at Ottawa, he reached
Quebec after, presumably, "bumming" his
way on the drawbars of a freight train. Such
a scene would have been wonderfully convincing, and would do more than anything
else to abate enthusiasm of young Canadians
to "get into the great parade" with their
fellows.
Now I am going to quote, again from the
Ottawa Journal, what purport to bu the words
of one of the most distinguished citizens of
the British Empire; one who, as a soldier
and as a man, is loved throughout the length
and breadth of Canada. Let us see what the
Ottawa Journal of March 14 says. This article
is captioned, "Byng gives his opinion as to
what causes war." It is dated from Pasadena,
California, March 14, and reads as follows:
Viscount Byng, former Governor General of
Canada and here of Vimy Ridge, had recovered
sufficiently to-day from a heart attack to give
an opinion as to what causes war.

MARCH 19, 1935
"One of the main causes of war is the constant talk about it," he said. "If we concentrated on creating better human relations and
complimented our neighbouring countries more
there would be fewer conflicts."
He said he would return to England about
April 1. He has been here several weeks for
his health.
So the opinion of one of the greatest
soldiers who participated in the last WarI think we all will agree he was that-and
whose naine and person are loved from one
end of Canada to the other, is that talking
about war creates war. Well, it is my point
that looking at the picture "Lest We Forget,"
which undertakes to show and to eulogize
before the eyes of young and old Canadians
the wonderful accomplishments of Canada in
the Great War, is far worse than talking
about war. It will do far more to inculcate
an enthusiasm in the minds of the young
throughout the towns and villages of Canada
than any other thing that has been done these
many years. Again let me say I am quite
sure that many honourable senators will
disagree with me, as they have a right to do,
but I thought I should be doing less than
my duty if I did not express my views upon
this matter.
Certainly I think that that war picture
should have been put together. Certainly I
think there should be a chronological record
such as we have in that picture. But I think
it is a crime against young humanity to show
the picture as it is throughout Canada. Let
me ask, what is the underlying reason for
showing it? What was the underlying reason
two or three years ago for the case of kidnapping that startled and shocked the world
-- one of the worst crimes ever committed
against humanity? What is the underlying
reason for burglary? What is the underlying
reason for forgery? What actuates the minds
of those who deal in the degradation of
women and set up in certain of our ci-ties
places that should no>t be mentioned? Money,
nothing but money, is the underlying reason
in ail these cases. Am I correct? ,Am I
exaggerating or giving an explanation that is
far-fetched when I say that no single motive
except the making of money is responsible
for the showing of this picture "Lest We
Forget" throughout the length and breadth
of Canada? It will be a money-maker. Tens
of thousands of Canada's citizens will, I am
sure, undertake to see that picture, and will
feel that they have been amply repaid for
the money they spent to see it. But it is
the aftermath that I am thinking and talking
about. What effect will it have on our young
people wbo think it is wonderful, who become

imbued with the idea that we won the War,
who see what Canada and Canadians did in
that struggle? What effect will it have on
their decisions later on if the time should
come, as it may, when there is another
demonstration of international aggression and
resistance by force of arms, with humanity
being killed, maimed and sacrificed to perhaps a greater extent than in the last War?
Since I gave notice of this inquiry a gentleman whom I do not know, who signs hinself
A. T. McFarlane, has written an article which
appears on the last page of the Ottawa Citizen
of Mareh 16. In that article he has expressed
some of the views that I should like to present to honourable senators here, andl ho bas
done so in a more concrete and better form.
than I could. It is entitled, "Soliloquy of a
Dead Soldier," and this is how it reads:
A dead soldier happens to be in front of
a film camera in Flanders and becomes thus
projected onto the public screen in the picture
"Lest We Forget."
He meditates on the
audience at the premier showing in Ottawa:
Uniforms!
They
still
wear
military
uniforms!
Why I am lying here dead, I never knew,
I believed it was to end wars; but they still
wear uniforms.
Was it not enough then that I gave my
young life for Canada to no purpose, without
now having my torn and broken corpse made
a subject for public entertainment? And such
a gala entertainment!
Nobody but the elite
here to-night! And a brilliant military band
with stirring military music.
The film narrator says I must be shown to
these people (like a circus freak) in order that
the horrible example and exhibition of my
dead' body may help to prevent future wars.
Is that, then, why they all still wear military
uniforma, to prevent future wars? And why
are they made to sing those songs which were
used to enthuse me, and those like me lying
here? Why "Tipperary" and "Pack Up Your
Troubles" and "The Long, Long Trail"?
Is
it not to enthuse with patriotie fervor? If
this is not the real aim of my exhibition, would
they not either be singing some .peaceful song
or hymn? It all reminds me of the Indian
medicine-man working up the tribe into a
frenzy by incantations before a scalping
expedition.
Why are those fellows sitting out there
proud and arrogant in those radiant uniforms?
Is it not that they feel pride in military pomp
and vanity? If they sincerely wanted peace
would they not have come to see my Calvary
in peaceful attire?
Why do some wear medals and bright ribbons
so conspicuously displayed on their breasts? Is
it not that people shall say "He fought!" and
so glorify them as heroes of war? If not they
would have left those gay ribbons and medals
securely hidden away at home. I also fought,
but I received death. I can flaunt no medals,
neither would I wish to. I should be satisfied
to sit with my people watching the show as
they are.

SENATE

I sec young fellows out there not yet out
of their teens. The uniform fits then ill, but
their heart eau hardly be filled with peace
with a tunic on their back. They are probably longing for the day, as indeed I did myself,
w-lien the adventure of war will take them and
thrill them-to death.
And the Colonel sitting ont there in his snug
and well-fitting mess jacket. Why, in his old
age and wisdons, has lie net placed aside his
"geegaws" and sought out the real causes of
my lying here with dead and sightless eyes
turned to heaven? Is it that his own eyes are
sightless as mine and lie does not wish te see
the real cause, or is he still flattered to be
callei Colonel?
The young officers I see seated with their
bedecked and resplendent ladies. Is net glory
and prestige and the opportunity for promotion largely in their minds as they watch this
picture, with their admiring companions comparing them to those heroes on the screen and
their own luck in having such escort?
And the officials in evening dress ("soup
and fisli" we used to eall it), are they not
more concerned with the social amenities and
opportunities to fawn on those of superior
status to-niglt than with peace?
And those others who have come to revel
in a picture of war from mere curiosity. Why
do they now, look npon my tortured and pain
wrecked body? They have had twenty years to
arrive at some conclusion as to the real cause
of msy untimely death. What conclusion have
they arrived at for my being exhibited for
their entertainment this evening?
I don't mind death. This way I am better
off than many who fought and still live. Mine
was a sudden death. Many of my living ehums
have a lingering death, some from starvation.
They seeml to have paid more attention te us
tiat died than to those who really need attention; the living. Perhaps this is because dead
soldiers require no material thing of life.
Peace and the prevention of another war
is the last thing many here have in their
minds.
If the exhibition of my dead body
lying in the mud can really turn their minds
into channels of real peace and the sincere
study of the causes and the prevention of war.
I shall counit the cost small, but msy exhibition
before .thes to-niglit is, I fear, intended only
to glorify soldiers and the military art.
Indeed the narrator's themue all through the
picture will strike this note which is but badly
caniouflaged by sone shopworn platitudes on
the questionable efficacy of my death and the
death of others like me.
I sec no reason,
threefore.. why I should now becomse a public
exhibit for morbid curiosity.
J hope they do net allow the very young
and inpressionable to come and see nie, but J
fear it is a vain hope, for the young were ever
tauglit to love military display.
I gave msy life trusting that the reason for
my so doing would ultimately be discovered,

and other lives never again sacrificed on the
altar of Mars. Perhaps I hoped' for too much!
Who knows? The uniforms and army trappings I sec before me are none too reassuring.
or do somue really know the truth of my being
here and are afraid to speak out?
J gave up mv life in this war. What have
these people given up to prevent the next?
Not even their pride.-A. T. McFarlane.
Hon.

Ir. MURDOCK.

I

do not know, and I care less, who Mr.

MeFarlane is, but he has expressed, in a form
better than I am capable

of, some thoughts

that I should like to convey te honourable
senators. In my opinion it will stand as a
lasting disgrace to Canada if the picture "Lest
We Forget" is sent fromn one end of the
country to the other to glorify war. For that
is what it will do. And of course it will make
"easy money" for some people. I know some
honourable members will say, "That is too
strong." But, do not forget, we are told in
Holy Writ that money is the root of all evil.
I would respectfully suggest to honourable
members that they ask themselves whether
this picture would be shown were it net for

the fact that it will draw large crowds, crowds
such as we had here in Ottawa on March 7,
and be a money-making film.
My only apology for having taken so long
te state my views is that I felt it was my duty
to bring them to your attention. I do not
expect that anything I may say will prevent
the triumphant showing of "Lest We Forget"
frorm the Atlantic to the Pacifie ocean; I do
not expect it will prevent full houses from
witnessing the picture; I do not expect it will
diminish the profits of the promoters. I
should like to add that while I have nothing
but the higliest praise for those who have
produced the picture as a chronological record
of what was done by Canadians during the war
years. still I think it is a very grave mistake
for a peace-loving country to permit such a
picture to be shown te its impressionable

youth.
Riglit
Hon.
ARTHUR
MEIGHEN:
Honourale senators, the ionourable member who has just sat down (Hon. Mr. Murdock) has a very important advantage over
me in the discussion he lias launched. He
saw the picture, to the exhibition of which le
takes exception; I have not seen it.
My
knowledge of it is derived from those who
have, and particularly from those who originated the idea whicli
as now taken tangible
and presentable form in the picture.
J tIo not for a moment question the sincerity
of the lionourable senator; not even his
sin-cerity in expressing admiration of the letter
whici lie read. In that admiration I cannot
share at all. I cannot follow the reasoning
by which men bring tiemseolves to the state
of mind displayed in that letter and-I fear
I must say-in the speech of the honourable
senator.
First. we have seriously to make inquiry as
to what is our position in relation to world
facts to-day, and from the solid rock of those

MARCH 19, 1935
faets try to adjust ourselves to sound principles of expression and conduet. I do not
think, even the senator frorn Parkdale would
suggest there is really any war spirit in Canada,
in the sense of a hope that some time we shall
be embroiled in another world conflict. if hie
does, I take strong exception to such an
assumption. I take even stronger exception to
any conduct, governmental or other, designcd
to foster the hope. I take no second place to
the honourable senator in this firrn formula
of conduct: ail our policy, aIl our teaching,
should be that Canada's influence in thie world
shail be towards settiernent of disputes without war, and we should lose no opportunity
whntever of pressing home that policy and
that teaching and taking practical stcps
designed to that end, whatevcr sacrifice of
pride or position it rnay entail.
Now, what are these world facts that not
only relate to but imrnediatcly surround what
we are trying to decide? Is it true, or is
it, not, that there neyer can be a timie when
Canada will have to put on its armour once
m-ore, when no option or no point of decision
at ail will remain with us, when we shaîl
not be able to help ourselves?
I should
like te hear frorn the honourable senator
again if hie is convinccd that such a tirne
neyer can corne.
Hon. Mr. M'UBDOCK: Most ernphatically,
no. I think the tirne will corne; but I do
flot know why we should take any part in
hastening it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGiIEN:
Ah!
have neyer suggested that we take any part
in, hastening it. I have urged we should do
our part and leave nothing undone to prevent it. and that alI our policy should be
directed to this purpose. But is any honourable senator ready to assume that that time
wiil not come?
Sorne

Hlon. SENATORS:

No.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIG¶iEN:
I take it
that alI honourable inembers are ready to
assume that unfortunately, terribly, unfortunately, it may corne. Arn I safe in such
an assumption? I do not feel sure that, it will
come; I have not given up ho-pe that it will
not; but I do hope I arn not overstcpping
bounds by the breadth of a hair when I say
we have to assume that it may corne.
Then what is the next step in the reasoning?
If such is the case, is it the duty
of our people-Ganadian fathers and Canadian mothers--to train their children that
under no circumstanoeýs .must they ever face
war again; to drill into them that war is
horrible, and that anyone who puts on a
92584-IO1

14-8

uniforrn or dares to volunteer for rnilitary
training is trying to, bring war about; to
tell them they rnust, shun the recruiting sergeant, mnust steel thernselves against preparing to take part in any future conflict? We
cannot take that position.
It is unreasonable, it is irrational. We sh-ould like to, be
in a world wherc we could take it, but we
are not in such a world.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. ME]IGHEN:
I can picture the situation of a man who to-day
would stand on the castcrn boundaries of
France, or indeed anywhere within that
country, and teli bier youth that war can
neyer be undertaken by thern, it is their duty
to turn their backs on war under all conditions, and a motion picture that tends, however slightly. to revive memories of the
valiant part France played in the Great War
is horrible and to bc shunned.
In the serious world situation existiog today where do we find the profeasional paciflst? I do not refer to the honourable scnator frorn Parkdalc. Wc find the professional
pacifist in Canada, in Australia, in every
country where there- is no need of him at
aH. We do not find him in the danger zonýes
where the world's troubles are beiog browed,
whore treaties arc being tomn in tatters and
thrown to the winds of heaven: there is
not a nucleus of pacifist sentiment there.
. If wc assume thero is at least a possibility
of confliet, while we ought neyer to divert
Canada from the aimi of peace, still it is our
duty to tell our youth the facts and open
thoir eyos to the truth. We cannot perform.
this dut v by r-nerely picturing the horryrs,
and nýothing but the horrors. of war and teiling them to run from it under all conditions
and at aIl times.
Now, let us corne to this picturo " Lest
We Forget."
Canada was the possessor of
sorne sixty positive and forty negative films,
descriptive of the part we took in the great
cootest from 1914 to 1918. I do flot think
anyone knows as little about motion pictures
as I do: I nover go to see thern. However,
it appears that the only way in which this
historical record couid be made available for
the future was to put these into picture form.
It may be there are conditions under which
truth should not, be divulged. At all eveýnts,
even in the presentation of truth, good judgment has to ho used. But I do not think,
truth should ho suppressed for ever. To allow
those films to pass into oblivion was to make
just that election. The Canadian Legion was
called in. A committee was set up under
Dr. Doughty. It decidod that the way tQ

SENATE
get the best out of the films was to preserve
them in the form of this motion picture.
The idea behind the decision was not money
at all. Canada cannot make a cent out of
I do not know whether
the undertaking.
anybody will make any money out of it.
The purpose had no more relation to money
than it bad to death. Finally on the recommendation of the Legion, which sponsored
and executed it, a contract was made for
the production of a moving picture on the
basis of the sixty positives and forty negatives-whatever they mean-which the Government possessed.
Under the contract
twenty-five per cent of the total revenues
goes to the distributors, and seventy-five per
cent to the producers, until the costs of production have been met; the division then is
on the basis of fifty per cent to the distributors, twenty-five per cent to the Canadian Legion, and twenty-five per cent to the
producers.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
profit?

If there is a

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, if such
a profit exists. I have a letter from General
Ross, President of the Canadian Legion. I
do not intend to read the whole of it, but
I shall be pleased to show the letter to any
honourable member who may wish to peruse
t. The only object in disclosing the con,ents of the letter is to show that the picture
s not of such a nature as to violate the
principle which I sought to expound as I
rose to address the House. It is not the
purpose of the picture to glorify war, to
paint it as something to be desired, a sort of
paradise for youth, something in the nature
of the heroic, and that alone. In order that
the picture may be defended, it is necessary
that such should not be its purpose or its
nature, for it is the first great duty of Canadians to turn their course from the direction
of war and to influence all others to do
likewise. I shall read part of the letter from
General Ross, because it bears most directly
on the purpose. He says:
Our organization has been selected by the

have been awarc of the fact that
be
<ears w
Juring the War the Canadian Government
accnumlated a great many pictures of war
conditions whbich were in danger of being lost
to posterity by reason of lark of care. We
have, therefore, for many years been pressing
that steps shofld be taken to preserve a
historical narrative of the d'ays of the War and
as a resiut of oi
efforts the Government at
last agreed to auethorize the preparation of a
>icture

iceepted

piature-t Ho.n. Mr. NEIGHEN.

I ask honourable gentlemen to note this.
-as a result of our efforts the Government at
last agreed to authorize the preparation of a
picture which would be a complete historical
narrative of the War. In so doing they laid
down definite restrictions, namely, that there
should be no glorification of war, and that the
pictre nuîst have a definite appeal for peace.
This was entirely in conformity with our views.
The House will note tiat the Government
laid down two conditions: first, that there
should be no glorification of war, and, second,
that the picture must have a definito appeal
for peace.
Then Generil Ross says:
We (lesired,
1st. That this very important historical
narrative should be preserved;
2nd. That it should be made available to
the people of Canada, but when made available it should preach a definite lesson of peace.
To prove that it conforms to those two
conditions, he cites the approval of tao very
prominent persons in this country, both of
whom are well known to everyone in this
House as being irrevocably, pronouncedly and
e.mphatically, if not violently, opposed to
war. Then he gives his own opinion:
Personally I believe that the exhibition of
this pictuire thronghout Canada would be
definite propaganda for peace and we are very
happy indeed to have the opportunity of so
presenting it.

I make these observations so that -whenyoc
have to answer the question, you will understand exactly our position in regard to the
matter.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Is the writer of the
letter the present member of Parliament for
Kingston?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, no. General Ross is a judge at Yorkton, Saskatchewan, and Presidemnt of the Canadian Legion
of the British Empire Service League. He
was the representative of the Canadian
Legion in Australia, and I think he went in
another capacity also, at the time of Vietoria's Centennial last fall.
In a rnemorandum from the department the
central purpose of the picture as propagand'a
for peace is emphasized again. I have spoken
to several who saw the pi'cture, and all to
whom I have spoken agree that it meets and
fulfils that central purpose, and that in it
there is no glorification of war. A picture is
not a glorification of war just because it
discloses the beroism of Canadian forces.
The fact that it depicts a tradition of selfforgetfuilness and scelif-sacrifice does not make
it a glorification o-f war.
The bonourable
senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock)
says tbat it shows boys preparing for a
conte-r in the air, but fails to show one of

MARCH 19, 1935
th.em falling from the clouds. Truc. UnfortunateIy, perhaps, the picture cannot present ail the horrors of war. It would be very
hard for the manl who took the picture to
know just where that boy would fali. But
it does; disclose borrors in the very worst
form; sucli horrors as could be pictured.
Now tihat I have given the purpose of the
picture, I think it is ýmore important than the
mere question of the picture itself that we
should make up our minds, once for ail, that
we are flot going to turn the eye of scorn
upon the men who are in our permanent
forces to-day, and who, if war has to corne,
are prepared to do their duty beside the flag
of this country, as they have done in the
past. We have to make up our minds that
by that act those men are flot proclai-ming
themseives the propagandists of war. They
are simply saying, 'Until the armament
monger is suppressed, as he eventually.will be,
should the utrnost efforts and wisdomn of the
hast men of the world fail, and the worst
corne to the worst, and the sword flash again,
much as we deplore the necessity for it, we
are prepared to do our duty."

EMPLOYMENT AND SOCIAL INSORANCE BILL
MOTION FOR

SECOND

READING

Right Hon. ARTHUJR MEIGREN moved
the second reading of Bill 8, an Act to establish an Employment and Social Insurance
Commission, to provide for a National Emnployrnent Service, for Insurance against Unemployment, for aid to Unernployed Persans,
and for other forms of Social Insurance and
Security, and for purposes related thereto.
Be said: Honourable members, in moving
the second reading of this Bill I presumne I
sbould outiline its purposes. My rernarks will
be exceptionally brief, because every honourable member already knows its purposes frorn
reading discussions appearing in the press of
late weeks, and probably from sorne perusal
of the Bill. Further, the objectives sought are
set out in detail in the titde of the Bill. The
measure, therefore, beccores in the main a
question, first, of principle, and, second, of
almost endless detail. The principle is as to
whether or flot we should have in Canada a
contributory unemploymnent insuranýce system,
the contributoýrs being the employer, the cmployee and the State.
There may be also some subsidiary principies involrved in the measure; namnely, as
to whether such a system, if we are to have
it, should be operatcd by a commission, and,
secondly, as to whether there should be a
nniforrn assessment on ail ernployees in, al
industries, whatever rnay Le the measure of
the danger of unemployment in the individual
indus-tries, or whether tibe insurance premium
should be adjusted and made proportionate
to the danger of unemployment in the industries in question. Another subsidiary principle rnay possibly he as to whether or not
there should be exceptions. There are nlcmerous exceptions in this Bill, and th-ere is room.
for the argument that, in. the initial stages
at least, th-ere sbould Le m-ore.
The measure is comprehensive, the detail
almost infinite. In the other Bouse. the Bill

and I know the House wili
be onlx too glad ta afford them such an
opportunity.
There is no need ta go further into the
various clauses of the ineasurc which is very
extensive. One of our chief duities during
the wee-ks ahead will be to give it the close
attention that the Senate likes to give to
sucb legislation when the opportunity offers.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will the right
hourabie gentleman inform the House as
to the basis upon which be relies for the jurisdiction of Parliament ta enact such legislation?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am not certain that I can make the general statement
that the rea-oning given in my remarks on
the eigit-hour Bill would apply in toto ta
this measure. Personally I am disposed ta
think it would, but I have nat considered
the constitutional phase carefully enough to
be able to make a final pronouncement.
Certainly an argument based upon trade and
commerce would be equally relevant in this
case, and there seems to be no reason to
doubt that under either section 132 or the
cauconitant decision of the Privy Council
in the radio case, we should have power by
virtue of treaty obligations. I notice in the
preamble to the Bill a reference ta those
treaty obligations; consequently I do not
think I am overstepping the bounds of accuracy when I say that xve could rest our constitutional right to legislate upon that ground
as well as upon our power relating to trade
and commerce.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am at the disposal of the right honourable gentleman. I
am prepared to go on now with this discussion. more especially on the point I have
just raised. or. in the interest of good administration, to postpone it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I understand the honourable gentleman would like
to debate the constitutional features of this
measure. That being the case, I move the
adjournment of the debate. and shall feel
it my duty in the meantime to make further
study of tlat phase of the subject. T thought
Rigtht Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

we had, perhaps. ended the
discusion. but I make no

PATENT BILL
REPORT

0F

COMMITTEE

Hon. F. B. BLACK presented the report of
the Standing Comrnittee on Banking and
Commerce on Bull A, an Act to amend and
consolidate the Acts relating to Patents of
Invention.
He said: Honourable senators, the coinmîttee has in oybedience to the order of the
Senate considered this Bill and now submits
it with numerous amendments. It would nlot
be reasonable to expect one to give a complete analysis of such a measure. As can he
2een, it is voluminous. Without going into it
in detail, perhaps 1 may make a few comments for the benefit of honourable senators
who have nlot attended the hearings on it.
The committee has bee-n dealing with it since
the l4th of February. Nineteen sittings have
been held and between sixty and seventy persons have ap.peared and given testimony wîth
regard to the Bill and its changes. The principal changes occur in sections 3, 6, 26, 34,
43, 47, 63 and 64. Amendinents or corrections
of some kind were made to virtuaily every
section.
Section 3 attaches the Patent Office
deflnitely to the Department of the Secretary
of State, of which it has been a part for a
f ew years. This section also fixes a limait to
the salary that may be paid to the Commissioner of Patents. Section 6 deflnitely provides .for the appointment of an Aieistant
Commissioner, who *must be an experienced
technical officer. Section 26 restricts the time
in which nationals of other countries than
Canada may file application ini Canada, te
twelve mnonthe instead of two years, as now
provided in the Act. Honourable senators

151

will understand that I am touching upon these
sections only briefly and not at ail in detail.
Section 34 requires more details and particulars in the description of patents applied for,
whether by our own nationals or others. Section 43 is intended to clarify action in cases of
confli.cting applications. Section 47 reduces
the life of a patent fromn eighteen years, as
at present, to seventeen years from the date
of the granting thereof. Section 63 is well
explained in the explanatory note printcd
opposite that clause of the Bill. The objeet
of this section is to have articles that in
future are patented in Canada manufactured
as far as possible in Canada. Section 64 has
been amplified and appears in the form. of
five or six separate sections.
I think this covers the varions amendments.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shaîl these
amendments he taken into consideration?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If honourable
members desire the amendments before them
in an understanda-ble feom, it will be necessary
to take steps to have the Bill reprinted. It
has to be reprinted for third reading. I presume the only way to proceed is to consider
the amendments now and have the Bill
printed as amcndeýd.
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: Yes. On third
reading any senator can take whatever stand
hie likes.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. PANDURAND: We could hardly
go through the varions amendments intelligibly without having the amended Bill before
US.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: As a matter
of fact the Bill has been practically rewritten
from beginning to end.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: It is to be reprinted?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN moved concurrence in the amendments.
The motion was agreed to.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shaîl this
Biil be .read a third time?
Rit
Hon. Mr. M'EIGHEN: I should like
to have it read a third time at the very
flrst opportunity, but it would be tmfair to
have that done before the Bill has been
printed and distributed. How long will it
take Vo print it?
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It may be ready
for to-morrow.

152

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Then I would
ask that it be put on the Order Paper for
to-morrow. If we find then it has not been
printed and distributed, we shall have to
adjourn the third reading, but I sincerely
hope it will be possible to dispose of the
measure to-morrow.
FARMERS'

CREDITORS ARRANGEMENT BILL

REPORT OI' COMMITTEE
Hon. F. B. BLACK presented the report
of the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce on Bill 10, an Act to amend the
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934.
He said: Honourable senators, the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce
has considered the Bill, and I submit it herewith with n<umerous amendments. It is
likely that the right honourable leader of the
House may want to make some comment
on the last amendment.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shahI
these amendments be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: By leave of the Senate,
now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would suggest
to the riglit honourable the leader that consideration of tliese amcndments be postponed
unPil to-morrow, so that we may have an
opportunity of reading them in the Minutes
of the Senate.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEJGHEN: I am quite
agrecable to that. It miglit be well also,
this matter not haviniig bcen bel'fore us for
anything like as long as the Patent Bill lias
been, that I should explain to honourable
memibers who may not bc familiar with them
the sections which have been amended.
On second reading I fully outlined to the
House the extent to which the Bill amends
the present law; consequently there is no
need of traversing that ground again. I shall
refer only to the amcndments made in the
committee. as read from the Clerk's Table.
The first one is a proviso rcserving the
obligation of a guarantor or endorser when
the obligation of the principal debtor is reduced by order of the Board of Review, or by
amicable arrangement with all the creditors.
The amendment provides that notwithstanding suclh reduction, either by agreement before the primary tribunal, which is the Officiai
Receiver, or in virtue of an order of the
court of appeal. which is the Board of Review.
the guarantor is not relieved unless in the
event of bankruptcy he would have been
The Hon. Mr. SPEAKER.

relieved by an order of discharge in bankruptey. The practical effect o? this is that
the guarantor or endorser is not relieved. The
general opinion scemed to prevail that this
was the present law, but as there was some
question on the point, the committee thought
it wise to make it indisputable law that the
guarantor should not be reiieved.
There are some who adhere to the view
that the guarantor should be granted relief,
at least to the same extent as the principal
debtor. I am open to conviction, but I cannot at al! follow the reasoning by which this
view is arrived at. If the guarantor or
endorser is to be relieved to the extent to
which the principal debtor is relieved-that
is to say, if the guarantor is only responsible
for what the principal debtor is able to paywhat is the good of the guarantee?
The
principal debtor is left liable for all he is
able te pay. Such is the principle of the
Bill. Well, if he is able to pay, the guarantor's
function does not amount to much.
The
endorser's name is taken by a banker or
some other payee just because of the fear
that the principal debtor is net strong and
may go before the tribunal to get his debt
reduced. The lender says, "I will net lend
you anything unless you get a good endorser."
Such being the case, would this Parliament
wish afterwards to take this attitude? "True,
you were unwilling to lendt te that man because you feared that lie was net a good
debtor. or because lie already had so many
debts vou thought he might have to compromise; so you insisted on an endorser whom
you regarded as responsible. But we are now
declaring that because the principal debtor
is good for, say, only 880 instead of 8100,
the guarantor aiso shall be liable for only the
smallcr amount." That seems to me to be
equity of the worst kind.
Were our legislation of another character,
such, for example. as to relieve the principal
debtor on some ground other than inability
to pay, it would then be equitable to relieve
the endorser too. But where the relief of the
principal debtor is granted only on the one
grouind that he cannot pay-thie very ground
whicli lias necessitated an endorser-I cannot
follow at all the reasoning which says that
Parliament should relieve Phe endorser to the
extent that it relieves the principal debtor.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
If the Government choose to release one altogether, why
not release the other? I think they are all
wrong.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yeu release
one because he is net able to pay, and in

MARCH 20, 1935
order that he may get a new start for the
benefit of both himself and his creditors.
You cannot release the other for that reason,
because in his case it is not true.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: When that man
gave the endorsement he did not know of
this law.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The endorser
knew he would have to pay if the debtor
could not, and it turns out that the debtor
is not able to pay.
I have given the reason which actuated the
committee in adopting that first amendment.
The second clause read was to the effect
that a farmer in the province of Quebec
might, where a Board of Review in dealing with his affairs had recommended that
he be allowed to make an assignment in
bankruptcy, make such assignment and have
his estate go through bankruptcy, the Official
Receiver being the bankrupt. Honourable
members will note that the clause is unusual,
for it refers only to the farmer in Quebec.
Let me explain why this is so. Under the
Bankruptcy Act of Canada even a farmer
may make a voluntary assignment in bankruptcy, but the province of Quebec is excepted from this provision. When the Act
was before Parliament objection was taken
on behalf of that province, which did not
want to open the door of bankruptcy to the
farmer.
And ruin his
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
credit.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: So the Act
was amended to provide an exception for the
farmer of Quebec, that he should not have
the privilege of voluntary assignment. In
view of that exception in our federal bankruptey law, it was very questionable whether
in any case the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, being itself a new piece of bankruptcy legislation, displaced the former law
to the extent of enabling the farmer in Quebec
to go through bankruptcy. The Farmers'
Creditors Arrangement Act did provide that
where the affairs of a farmer were in such a
state that it was deemed advisable he should
make an assignment, he could be put through
bankruptcy, but it did not contain any special
provision in relation to the province of Quebec. Therefore this amendment is proposed
in order to make clear that, notwithstanding
the exception in the Bankruptcy Act, if the
Board of Review for Quebec is of opinion
that the affairs of any farmer are so bad that
rehabilitation is hopeless, and feels that he
should .go through bankruptcy, it may recommend accordingly and that avenue will be

153

open to him. In defence of this, and in
answer to those who do not want the
psychology of bankruptcy to pervade the
agricultural sections of that province, it can
be affirmed that under the amendment there
will be no incentive for professional assignees,
whose real objective is fees, to tramp through
the country districts getting farmers to assign.
That abuse appears to have been practised at
one time. No fees will be payable to any
such persons if a farmer assigns under this
legislation, because the Official Receiver will
be the assignee. Another fact in favour of
this amendment is that there will be no
case of an assignment except on the recommendation of the Board of Review, which is
headed by a judge of the Superior Court.
The present head of the Board of Review in
the province of Quebec is Mr. Justice Loranger.
Consequently, the safeguards seem quite
ample.
The third amendment made by the committee is the only other thing I need refer
to now. It provides that the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, as amended, shall not
apply to any debt incurred after the first day
of May, 1935, except with the consent of the
creditor. If this amendment is passed it will
be beyond the power of any Board of Review
to impose upon the creditors of any debtor
a reduction in a debt incurred after the first
day of May. The committee felt this amendment was necessary in order that the credit
of farmers from this time on might not be
subject to a cloud. And it was considered
advisable to make the effective date six
weeks from now rather than, say, last fall
or the first of January, se that there will be
time for everybody to have notice of the
change.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
I have
followed closely the statement of the right
honourable leader of the House, and I think
he has fairly explained the purport of the
amendments made in committee. Towards
the close of the com.mittee's discussion. and
in this Chamber, concern was expressed that
the endorser should be held responsible for
the debt of a farmer at its face value, notwithstanding that the farmer had obtained
a reduction. Under our civil law in the
province of Quebec there are a considerable
number of provisions for the protection of
the endorser, and he is relieved of liability
if these are not strictly observed by the
holder of the note. The question now arises
whether under the whole machinery of this
legislation these safeguards in favour of the
endorser are not being invaded. I should not
be ready to give an opinion on this point
now, and that is why I have asked that the

REFERRED

TO

COMMITTEE

Right Hon. Me. MEIGHlEN: It had flot
been .my intention ta move that the Bill be
referred ta committee, but in deference ta
the suggestion of the honourable senator
opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) that there
may be those who wish to make representation in regard ta it, although I cannot recaîl
that I have had notice af any such desire,
I move that the Bill be referred ta the Standing ýCommittee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The right honourable gentleman wiIl pardon me. We have in
this House a committee which, it seems ta
me, would be more appropriate.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGiHEN: Maybe so.
What committee is it?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: :Surely the question of industrial relations is involved here.
I can imagine no committee that would be
more interested in a measure ai this kind
than the committee ta which I refer , and
which, incidentally, has flot met for some
years.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: I think the honourable senator fromn Parkdale is quite right.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHE.N: I had not
intended ta, move that the Bill be referred ta
any committee, and so0 had nat given much
thought ta that matter. I do flot recal] the
composition af the committee on industrial
relations.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The honourabie
senator fromn Winnipeg (Hon. M.r. McMeans)
is chairman of the committee.
Right lion. Mr. MEIGHEN: lie is Chairman of the Divorce Committee.
Hon. Mr. GIILLIS: Why do you not refer
it ta Cammittee af the Whole?
Right lion. Mr. MEIGHEN: That was my
senator
intention
until the honourable
opposite (lon. Mr. Dandu-rand) indicated
that there might be ýsome who desired ta
make representations.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Representations
were made with reference ta, the Unemployment Insurance Bill, and I was wondering if
some ai the clauses in this Bill were not
germane ta that measure.
lion. Mr. MURDOCK: I find t-hat I made
a mistake in suggesting we had a committee
on industrial relations. What 1 had in mmnd
was the Committee on Immigration and
Labour.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is ail
right. I accept the honourable gentleman's
suggestion, and xnove that the Bill be referred ta the Committee on Immigration and
Labour. I may express the hope that if the
question af validity is ever taken ta the
Privy Council the fact that the Bill was referred ta the Committee on Immigration and
Labour instead ai the Cammittee an Banking and Commerce will flot be used as a
ground fer arguing that it really does naýt
came within the sphe-re af trade and commerce.
lion. Mr. DANDURAND: I may say that
it was a great surprise ta me ta hear the
statement made elsewher-e that if any af
these measures were tao be tested by reference
ta tihe Supreme Court a concrete case would
be very desirable, and would bring out the
fact that a certain measure had been adopted
unanimously in the Hoiuse af Commons. I
have yet ta learn that any tribunal will go
behind the text of the law and look into the
discussion which bas taken place -upon it in
Parliament in order ta decide what course
ta follow.
Right lion. Mr. MEIG11EN: They do.

information ai the House that the Coinmittee on Immigration and Labour bas not

The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill was

THIRD READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
third reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I did not hear the
explanation given by the right honourable
leader of the House.
Would he be good
enough to repeat it?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIEN: The Minister
of Fisheries. where he has licensed fishermen
to do certain kinds of fishing in the various
parts of the country under his jurisdiction,
has been charging fees for the licences. I
presume that not many have been issued in
Prince Edward Island, the fisheries being away
from the shore; but in New Brunswick and
British Columbia fees have been charged.
The law as it stands permits the Minister
to forbid fishing except by licence, but it
does not say that he can charge for the
licence. This is to make certain that he can
do so, and to legalize what has been the
practice.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.
SUPPLEMENTARY CANADA-FRANCE
TRADE AGREEMENT BIL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN moved
the second reading of Bill 32, an Act respecting the Additional Protocol of 1935 to The
Canada-France Trade Agreement of 1933.
He said: Honourable senators, this measure
is of considerable importance and the House
is entitled to an explanation of its terms. A
treaty of trade, bearing date the 12th of
May, 1933, was made with France. In the
summer and fall of 1934, when the Prime
Minister was at Geneva attending the League
of Nations, he took occasion to renew negotiations that had been in contemplation when
the treaty was made, looking to an expansion
of its terms. As a consequence, a supplementary agreement was arrived at between
France and Canada and was consummated
by exchange of notes on the 29th of September, 1934. The supplementary agreement
itself does not come directly before Parliament. because it was later amplified and
expanded into the form of this additional
protocol. Therefore what we are now asked
Right lon.Mr. IMEIGHEN.

to ratify is inclusive of and more extensive
than that supplementary agreement. The
protocol now before us was adopted 'by Order
in Council of the l1th of March this year,
but really was completed on the 26th of
February.
All
these later negotiations,
resulting as I have described, were necessitated by the placing upon Canadian exportations ta France of successive restrictions
in the nature of quotas, exchange surtaxes
and additional general import duties made
specially applicable. It was felt that it would
be to the advantage of both countries to
have these serious restrictions very much
relieved, and the treaty is an instrument of
relief.
The treaty deals not only with the general,
minimum and favoured-nation tariffs, but
also with quotas and the exciange surtaxes.
To it there are appended four schedules.
All that the Bill does is provide for ratification of the treaty and for the admission into
this country of French goods under the duties
set forth in the schedule and supplementary
schedules. The schedule, which is the treaty
itse4f, is the main factor for our consideration. There are four supplementary schedules,
known as A, C, E and F. The first two
cover respectively goods which, going from
Canada to France, obtain the benefit of the
French minimum tariff, and goods coming
from France to ýCanada under our intermediate tariff. Schedule E specifies the percentages of basic global quotas accorded to
Canadian products by France, the percentage
in respect of each article being stated.
Schedule F provides some additional quotas
nhich are expressed in definite quantities.
Honourable members will of course be
concerned chiefly as to the classes of goods
which appear in these schedules and the
effect of the treaty upon our trade. The
principal goods with respect to which we give
a conc"ssion to France are wines and liqueurs
in the category or family of wines, laces and
embroideries, and ladies' fine gloves. There
is a fairly long list of articles, but these are
the most important.
The advantage in
respect of wines is one which it appears we
are non' able to give in full conformity with
the Ottawa agreements, and by way of compensation we get certain privileges with
respect to important exports of this country.
The chief Canadian goods which come under
the treaty are potatoes destined to the
French Indies, and wheat, under quotas. I
will try to make clear at this point just what
the provision with respect to wheat is. There
was a time when our wheat exports to France
were important, but that period was terminated quite a while ago by prohibitions applic-

MARCH 20, 1935
able to us. There are now to be admissions
of our wheat to France under certain temporary conditions. . In respect of the wheat se
admitted the duties or charges are to be lifted
provided we purchase from that country an
equivalent quantity of flour. There are a
series of provisions referring"to the French
Protectorates and mandated countries and
colonies, as well as to the territory of France
itself.
I have reviewed the provisions of this Bill
and treaty in a brieff way. I cannot say they
are of a sweeping character, but I think they
are just as sweeping as it was possible te
make them under the circumstances. They are
undoubtedly of importance to us, especially in
relation to some of our products. They are
equally of importance to France. I feel sure
the House will offer very little opposition to
this relatively slight reduction of tariff barriers.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: May I ask the
right honourable gentleman whether brandy
is included in the treaty?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. And I
know that our exports cf whisky to France
are affected favourably.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Item 156 of schedule C
covers Cognac brandy and Armagnac brandy.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, in
schedule C.
Our most important goods that are affected
as coming under the minimum tariff of France
are lobsters preserved or prepared, wheat,
barley, oats, rye, potatoes when destined to
the French West Indies, rolled oats, resinous
products, wood-pulip, whisky, lead, zinc, synthetic resins produced by the condensation
of aldehydes with vinyl alcohel, vinyl acetate,
derivatives cf glycol, casks (empty, serviceable, staves fitted together or not), builders'
and cartiwrights' wood, wood planed, grooved
and/or tongued, canoe paddles, other wares
of wood, river boats, footwear of all kinds
with uppers of rubber or other material, single
or double,Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is important.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: -collapsible
canoes with hull of rubberized tissues, veneer
sheets, pen nibs of gold, and insulating boards.
I have mentioned nearly all the articles, but
I see I omitted frozen pig livers.
The French products coming to this country and reiferred to in schedule C are with one
exception admitted under our intermediate
tariff less a discount which is stated in every
case, and which in some instances represents
a very large reduction. These goods include
cheese of various kinds, pepper, canned mush-

159

rooms, candied chestnuts, liqueurs, Cognac
brandy and Armagnac brandy, alcoholie perfumes and perfumed spirits when in bottles or
flasks containing not more than four ounces
each, wines of the fresh grape of all kinds, not
sparkling, imported in barrels or in bottles,
containing not more than 23 per cent proof
spirit, or for sacramental purposes, containing not more than 26 per cent proof spirit.
These wines get the benefit of the intermediate tariff less the very heavy reduction
of 63-63 per cent.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: Can the right honourable gentleman tell us what the intermediate
tariff is on wines of this class?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That information is not given in the treaty. I might state
to the honourable gentleman that we also
covenant that during the life of the treaty
we will keep the intermediate tariff on these
French goods at as low a rate as we fix for
the goods of any other foreign country, that
is, any country outside the British Empire.
lon. Mr. SMITH: And there is a discount
of 63-63 per cent off that?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. POPE: Is there anything about
whisky blanc coloured with wine?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No; at least
not so described. Champagne and all other
sparkling wines come under the intermediate
tariff less 20 per cent. Advertising and
printed matter, on paper or cardboard, printed
in France, in the French language, describing
and accompanying French products, is given
the same rate as the British preferential
tariff, and cigarette paperHon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Will the right
honourable gentleman excuse me? I should
like a little more explanation of that item
of advertising and printed matter. Does that
refer to books and pamphlets?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: "Describing
and accompanying French products."
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: It is only advertising
matter.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Advertising
and explanatory matter accompanying the
products. The other products admitted under
schedule C are: lace, nettings and bobinet,
n.o.p., wholly of cotton, intermediate tariff
less a discount of 20 per cent; lace and
embroideries, wholly of cotton, coloured, imported by manufacturers for use exclusively in
the manufacture of clothing in their own
factories, intermediate tariff, 17j per cent;

160

SENATE

lice and embroideries. wholly of cotton, not
coloured, imported by manufacturers for use
exclusively in the manufacture of clothing in
their own factories. intermediate tariff less a
discount of 15 per cent; fibres of ,affia or of
sisal, n.o.p., intermediate tariff less a discount
of 20 per cent; lace and embroideries, wholly
of flax, or of hemp, or of flax, hemp and
cotton, not coloured, imported by manufacturers for use exeli-sively in the manufacture of clothing in their own factories, intermediate tariff less a discount of 20 per cent;
enibroideries and lace, whether containing
tinsel or not, nettings and bobinet. n.o.p.,
intermediate tariff less a discount of 15 per
cent; women's dress gloves of kid, elbow
length, intermediate tariff less a discount of
35 per cent. It will be observed that in the
earlier part of what I had to say I gave
these various classes in groups.
To illustrate the last two schedules, E and F,
to which I have already referred-lobsters are
on a quota basis of 9-82 per cent of France's
basic global quota.
That is to say, as I
understand the term. if France puts into effect
a global quota-as she has donc-for the
admission of so many tons of lobsters. then
Canada's proportion is 9-82 per cent. Our
proportion of other products is: barley, 1 per
cent; salmonoids, other than trout, 15 per
cent; fresh apples and pears, 3-3 per cent in
the fourth quarter and 4.7 per cent in the
first quarter; tomatoes, 1-72 per cent; lead,
3-25 per cent; insulating board, 5 per cent;
patent leather, 5-42 per cent; calf and other
small skins, 1-80 per cent; agricultural
machinery, cultivators, spring harrows, horse
rakes, 11.58 per cent; barvesters, binders,
reapers, 8-28 per cent; other agricultural
machinery, 3-86 per cent; builders' and cartwrights' wood, 9 per cent; veneer sheets and
leaves, 4-27 per cent; veneers and counterveneers, 1-60 per cent; passenger automobiles,
12-55 per cent; ice skates, 5-68 per cent.
The list of items under schedule F, on which
we get an absolute quota, is short. Porcelain
insulators without parts of metal, 30 quintals.
I believe a quintal is 220 pounds.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is the French
measure. A quintal is 112 pounds.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The metrical
quintal is 220 pounds. These are the other
items under schedule F: porcelain insulators
with parts of metal, 50 quintals; electrie
heating apparatus, including electric stoves,
100 quintals; vacuum cleaners and parts
thereof, 10 quintals.

Hon. Mr. BELAND: Will my right honcurable friend explain again the meaning of
the figures in the column headed "percentages,"
and state whether it is competent for this
House to amend any of the sehedules?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I will answer
the second question first, because it is the
casier. It is not competent for this House
to amend an y of the schedules; nor is it competent for the other House to do so. This
is a treaty; we have to accept or reject it.
As to the first question, I shall endeavour to
make myself clear.
Let me take lobsters
again. We seek a market for lobsters in
France. France has a quota system applicable
to a long range of articles. Global means
total.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: A quota of the total
imports into France?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. We get
in respect of lobsters 9 per cent of that
global quota, whatever it may be.
Hon. Mr CASGRAIN: Let me again call
My right bonourable friend's attention to
the word "quintal." It is a very common
measure and represents 112 pounds.
The
220 pounds is really 100 kilos, not quintals.
The wrong word has been used.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In my notes
received from the Department I find this
notation twice: metrie quintal, 220 pounds.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: In the English language
a quintal is 112 pounds.
Hon. RODOLPHE LEMIEUX:
I am
very mueh interested in the remarks of the
riglt bonourable gentleman (Right Hon. Mr.

In glancing at random over the

"tariff" between two friendly nations.
Hon. Mr. POPE:

Do you want to make

Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX:
Hon. Mr. POPE:

Yes.

Go to it!

Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX:
It is rather sad
for both France and Canada that there should
be so many tariff restrictions against commercial intercourse. Of course, I appreciate
what was donc by the right honourable the
Prime Minister when he visited France and
obtained these slight reductions in the tariff.
We have gained something in so far as wheat
and a few other commodities are concerned.
On the other hand, we shall have the benefit

MARCH 20, 1935
of a freer importation of French wines. The
wines of France are considered the best in
the world. Even our good friends the wine
producers of the fertile Niagara Peninsula
adopi; French namnes for their products: they
advertise their burgundies, their champagnes,
their clarets. But there is as much difference
between. these wines and the choice vintages
of France as there is between night and day.
Rîglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
of Canada!

In favour

Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Yes-excuse me.
Do not divert my thoughts. However, I
think in the long i-un it may be quite possible
for our frîends in the Niagara Peninsula te
equal the notable resuits obtained by the
wine growers of California, who in the last
twenty-five yea.rs have sucepMpd in putting
on the market some excellent wines. I know
the Australian and the South African wines.
They too are excellent, but, again I say,
none of the Canadian, the Australian or the
South African are comparable to the French
wines.
Now, for the tariff concessions secured from
the French Government I thank the right
honourable the Prime Minister, and this
House should thank him. But there are some
omissions in the protocol. Under present
conditions there is a greater importation of
French books than of French wines. This
is borne out by the reports of the various
provincial liquor commissions. For instance,
I notice that the sales of the Quebec Liquor
Commission have substantially decreased.
This is because the people of Quebec have
not the means te buy French wines;, they
have become expensive luxuries. But we
are purchasing more and more French books,
and I amn surprised that the Prime Minister,
with his love of literature, did net try to
persuade the French Government to facilitate
this business. 1 appeal for help te the right
honourable leader of this House (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen), who during the past ten years
has set a very good example to the youth
of Canada. I remember when he could not
speak many words in French, yet now hie has
a good command of the language. How did
he accomplish it? By reading French books.
Igut net onîy do our English-speaking friends
need French books; French Canadians themselves need their elevating influence. 1 arn
not speaking of the cheap and sordid novels
that throughout the world are branded as
French books. We ahl know that many such
novels have been falsely represented as
originating in France. As a matter of fact
this falsification was part of the propaganda

161

instigated in certain quarters against France.
Many scientific, medical, engineering and
other technical treatises, hîstorical works, dic.
tionaries, and literary productions of eutstanding menit are published in France. There
should be no bar te their free entry into
Canada. Yet the only exception in this
protocol is in favour of printed matter ini
conneetion with French advertisements.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What is the
tariff on French books?
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: I forget at the
moment, but I know by what we pay the
ýCustoms in Montreal the duty is very high.
AIl we ask-and I caîl the right honourable
gentleman's attention to this--is that the samne
rate be charged on French books from. France
as is charged on English books from Engla.nd.
I can assure the right honourable gentleman
that some of the librarians in Montreal tell
me that they cannot afford te provide the
public with French literature on account of
the high customs duties. I suppose the rate
is the same as that against German and other
books front foreign countries, but surely if
an exception is te be made it should be ini
faveur ef English and French books. 1 again
appeal to the right honeurable gentleman,
who is a French scholar, and whose son aise
is a French scholar, te facilitate the amendment of our Tariff Act and of this treaty in
faveur of French books.
I regret that to-day tariff barriers restrict
world trade, but particularly do I regret that
such barriers should exist between France and
Canada. True, France is a highiy protected
country, but I ask honourable menters net
te forget that besfore, the War France was the
leading nation as regards wealth. It was said
that she was the creditor of ahl nations and
the debtor of none. During the War she had
te forge many of hier credits, and yet to-day
she still leads the natdons of the world in gold
reserves., The Bank of France ie repiete w.ith
gold ceins and ýgold ingots. The day may
corne when Canada, France, Great Britain and
the ether Allies during the late War may have
te, pull to-gether once more in order to preserve world -civilization. I do net prediet
that day as coming seon, but, judging from
current events on the other sîde of the
Atlantic, a sterm is brewing somewhere.
An Hon. SENATOR: Turkey.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Yes, near the
Balkans. Perhaps it miýght be well te have
dloser commercial relations with France.
Before and during the War a large business
developed between the twe countries, and it

to restore that period of commercial enterprise between ourselves and France. I am
thankful for what the treaty gives us, but it is
very little, and I hope we shall get much more
in the way of tariff concessions.
I regret another omission in the treaty:
there is no mention of surgical instruments.
Our young medical students attend schools
of medicine in Paris. The Government of
Quebec every year sends thirty or forty young
men abroad to complete their medical and
surgical studies. Some of them go to London, but the majority proceed to Paris.
Those medical students use French surgical
instruments and study French technical
treatises. In Montsouris park we have our
Canadian building, erected under the tutelage
of the University of Paris. Many Canadians
contributed towards the cost of its erection,
and one of our fellow-members, the honourable senator from Sorel (Hon. Mr. Wilson)I regret he is absent on account of ill-healthmade a very handsome subscription. A large
number of students from Ontario, British
Columbia, the Western Provinces, Quebec and
the Maritime Provinces are studying there.
When those young men return to Canada they
should be encouraged to imiplement their
studies, and again I appeal to the right
honourable gentlemen to see to it that, if
possible, amendments be made to our Tariff
Act in order to facilitate the admission of
French books.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
gentlemen, I have tried to ascertain the tariff
rate on French books under the trade agreement of 1933 and under this supplementary
agreement. This additional protocol is a considerable improvement on the provisional
agreement made in 1933, and I hope it will
benefit both countries. I had something to
do with negotiating the treaty of 1907. We
had to put it under the anvil again in 1908
and agree upon amendments. I was present
in Paris with the late Hon. Mr. Fielding, and
I know the difficulties of making tariff adjustments.
Although the primary object of a country
in tariff negotiations is to further its own
export trade, there is the secondary purpose
of facilitating importations, and sometimes the
imported products are not only important but
essential to the importing country.
I intend to limit my remarks to the question raised by my honourable friend from
Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Lemieux).
Canada
can settle that question without in the least
amending the present treaty. The importation of French novels is absolutely within
our own control. I need net dilate upon the
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX.

importance of French literature reaching our
shores, for one-third of our people rely for
the most part on French literary productions.
The honourable gentleman's coraplaint concerns the tariff on French books when imported unbound and described as novels.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What is the
tariff now?
Hon. Mr. DAiNDURAND: It is 15 per
cent, but I do net see it in the schedule.
Under the provisional agreement of 1933 the
rate was 25 per cent. There would appear
to be less reason for complaint under this
protocol than under the 1933 agreement. I
refer only to novels, for nder the temporary
trade agreement of 1933 textbooks, historical
works, and philosophical publications-literary works in general, bound or unbound, have
been admitted free.

Now, how does this work an injury to the
readers of French novels? Remember, English and French novels, if unbound, come in
under the tariff at 25 per cent, and under this

Being

novel, on the other hand, is unbound or in
paper covers. It pays 15 per cent. In order
to show the effect of the treaty I place on
record the following illustrations and comparisons, which have been handed to me by
persons who are in the trade. Here are the

Mïter 1933, under the nciw trade agreement which confirmas the temporary agreement, the same figure of 825 being taken as
a hasis, the figures would be as follows:
English Novels
Custom duty...
......
(free)
Sales tax 6 per cent on $25..
$1 50
Excise tax 3 per cent on $25..
0 75
Total............
$2 25
French Novels
Customn duty, 15 per cent on $25. .
Sales tax 6 per cent on $28.75..
Excise tax 3 per cent on $28.75..
Total...........

$3 75
1 72
0 86
$6 33

It would appear, therefore, if the situation
is as I state it, that under the protocol, whieh
I do not see in the schedules, the importer of
the French novel would benefit, because under
the 1933 agreemnent he paid 89.05, and he now
pays 86.33. But as againat that, the importer
of the English novel pays *only 82.25. The
payment of duty on the Frenchi novel increases the sales and excise taxes, because
these are based on the priýce of the goods plus
the amount of duty. The sales tax and the
excise tax on the English consign.rnent amaunt
to $225, and on the French consigunent ta
$2.58. This abnormal situation inicreases the
prioe of the French books, just because they
are unbound. It also places a handicap on
Canadian hinders, whose foreign competitors
are favoured hy the application of the duty on
unbound novels.
The French novel comprises literary productions of a very high order, and includes
quite an array of classical works. In fact,
many classical books frorn the heginning of the
eighteenth century to the present day, books
which any rnan with a desire for culture must
have on his sheif, corne unbound. We have
in this country an ever-increasing desire ta
raise the intellectual level of our people. I
92ffl-.llj

shahl fot repeat what the honourable gentleman froma Rougernont (Hon. Mr. Lemieux)
has said. My right honourable friend (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) well knows the advsiitages
of a hig-h culture in hoth French and Englieh,
because he is an apt scholar in hoth lan guages.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, noa.
Hon. Mr. DANDURLAND: It would be
unfair, of course, to drop the tax on French
novels and leave it on English novels. The
French novel and the English novel, unbound, are on a parity, each being subject to
15per cent. But usually the English novel,
heing bound, pays nothing, whereas the French
novel, which is unhound, pays 15 per cent
That is the crux of the difficulty. I repeat
that it 'would be quite unfair ta suggest that
the French novel should corne in free while
the English novel continued, spparentjy, to,
be subject ta the 15 pe.r cent. But the reply
is easy. We need only drop the tax on bath.
Great Britain and France need flot be consulted, because they would 'be quite willing
that the tax an their unbound novels should
be wiped out. As to the sacrifice on the part
of the Dominion treasury I unm quite sure that
it would not be great, and that a wel.corne
boon would be conferred on the intellectual
people of aur country.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Cannot this be doue
by -customs regulations?
Hon. Mr. ])ANDURAND: It couki be dane,
I arn quite sure; but I amn gaing ta ask the
right honourable gentleman (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) ta inquire into the matter. The
intellectual nourishment of the En-glish.speaking readers of this country does not corne exclusively fromn England-some of it cames
frorn the United States; but that of the
French reader cornes excluaively from France.
I feel quitp certain that my right honourable
friend, with the vigour which characterizes
hImn in ail lie undertakes, can find a way ef
remedying a difficulty which has been tihe
cause of recriminations in every French paper
in the province of Québec.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Ia it flot a fact that the
binding of Frenchi books is more and more
closely approxirnating to the English type?
Hlon. Mr. DANDURAND: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: And that very soon Vhey
will corne under the same classification?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Oh, no. Ninetyfive per cent, or perhaps more, of the Frenchi
books corne in unbound.
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: A soft cover.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And the cost ta
the importer is heavy.

Hon. Mr. BLACK: I know that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It works a hardship which cannot be justi6ied when the facts
are known.

wbo are memnbers of the Committee on
Tourist Traffic, knew that there is in Canada
a Frencb press outside of the province of
Quebec. It consists of one French daily and
about six or eight weeklies.

As 1 said in opening, under a trade agreement we look for advantages in other markets.
But this is a vital matter for the reading
public, intellectuals and others, who are seeking te obtain as cheap a product as possible.

I may inform
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
my bonourable f riend that I was speakings
of things that 1 know about personally. I
cannot read ail the French publications.

Hon. Mr. B'LACK: I tbink perhaps the
bonourable gentleman misunderstood me. I
have been told that the type of binding used
for low-priced French books is becoming
more and more like that of the English
books; and if that type of binding is adopted
by the Frencb publishers their books will
comne in duty free.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As my honourable friend will see, there will be a nice
question there as to wbat sort of hinding
makes it possible for a book to come in
free. It is rather amusing to think that a
mere cover sbould make such a difference.

I shahl

My main object in rising is to emphasize
the point raised by the honourable senator
froma Rougemont in regard to surgical instruments--I migbt also mention medical books-and to express the hope tbat the Government
wîil have no besitation in remedying the
situation whicb bas been alluded te. We al
know that protection, as the word implies, is
for the purpose of protecting national or
Canadian industries. I may say at tbis point
that I amn not aware of any flrm in Canada

So I think that if the duties on sncb articles
were reduced ne industry in Canada would

It is true that we bave industries

Right Han. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is a
different thing.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Quite sa. I have

himself in the past. particularly in reference
ta high tariffs, and sharter hours of labour; so
I may be allowed some indulgence to-day.
R.ight Han. Mr. MEIGIIEN: A gaad example to follaw.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: A great example to
f ollow, yes, and I hope political history will
record it. I want to emphasize that in sa far
as protection for Canadian industries is concerned there is nothing to prevent the Governnient from giving some privileges to France
with respect ta surgical instruments. I hope
I bave made myseif clear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAIND: I think the difficulty with respect ta, surgical instruments is
that they came under the Ottawa agreements.
Therefore instruments comýing fram Great
Britain are given favoured treatment, while
those fram France are flot.
Right Han. Mr. MERIGHEN: That is quite
true. Dealing first with the questian ad giving France preference in respect of surgical
instruments, I am afraid I am not convinced
that the hanourable gentleman bas made a
case. Apparently France gets the same treatment as is given ta ail cauntries except thase
within the Empire, which receive preferences
under the Ottawa agreements. But euceh
preferences were part of the price we paid
for cancessions ta, us, wh-ich have proven tremendously valIuable ta this country. We
should be glad ta pay a corresponding price
for similar cancessions from France. Seeing
that we do not give favours ta coumtries
within the Empire without exacting compensation, I do not know why we shoud act
In the

Chamber oi Deputies or the Senate of France,
50 far as I am aware, Canada is not placed
in any specially favaurable categary. We
make, treaties with France on a friendly basis,
but it exacts compensatian from us. I do not
think that when dealing with business matters
in terms of dollars and cents or francs it has
any regard for the fact that the French
language is spoken so widely in this country.
As ta wine and wheat and other goods, the
French Government makes as hard a bargain
as it can. We treat it in the same way and
do nat complain. I repeat that even within

165

the Empire we exact a quid pro quo, and I
cannot see why we shauld act more favourably towards any outside country than towards
one within our own circle. It would not
require a very important concession on the
part af France ta enable us ta put into effeet
a preference an French surgical instruments.
Hon. Mr. LACASeE: I shauld like to, be
informed whether books and ahl kinds of
lîterary warks were i different classes.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, ycs. We

I was treating of the hanourable gentleman~s
remarks as revolving anly araund the question
of surgical instruments. On the subject of
books, I am not disputing what was said by
the honourable leader on the ather side as
ta the bound and the unbound novel. I neyer

Hon. Mr. DANDURA;ND: When they are
bound they came in free from either country.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIG-HEN: And wben

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: As I understand fram the bonaurable gentleman's statement, baund novels from bath cauntries are
free, but the common practice of France is
nat ta bind novels, within the meaning of aur
Act; so, a duty af 15 per cent is payable.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

Right Han. Mr. MEIGHFiN: I arn nat disputing that, but it could neyer be argued
that it is a matter of discrimination.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

I

have not

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: When the
honourable senator from Rougemont (Hon.
Mr. Lemieux) was speaking I feared we had
made a grave mistake. For it would be a
grave mistake to impose high duties against
any literature worthy of the name, and
especially against French literature, in view
of the fact that French is one of the languages
of this country. If a concession were given to
any literature, it should be to that of France.
I understood the honourable senator's statement that high duties were imposed against
French literature was confirmed by the honourable gentleman from Kennebec (Hon. Mr.
Parent).
Hon. Mr. PARENT:

Because I was under

that impression.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have a
copy of the Canadian tariff, revised up to
November, 1934, and I will quote the rates
applying to different classes of books. Bibles,
prayer books, psalm and hymn books, religious
tracts and Sunday school lesson pictures, come
in free froin all countries. Account books
bear duties of varying rates, the highest of
which is 35 per cent. There is no reason why
such books. which are for commercial uses,
should be admitted free. Then books, dialogue
and recitation, paper covered-I do not know
just what kind this refers to--are subject to
certain rates, the highest being 25 per cent.
but in respect of them there is a special
provision. If they are printed in France in
the French language they come under the
French treaty and a rate of 15 per cent, which
is still in effect. So there is no high tariff
against them. The next class of books referred to is very important, that is, books
on the application of science to industries
of all kinds, including books on agriculture,
horticulture, forestry, fish and fishing, mining,
metallurgy, architecture, electric and other
engineering., carpentry, shipbuilding, mechanism, dyeing, bleaching, tanning, weaving, and
other mechanical arts, and similar industrial
books. They all come in free. Books, embossed, and grooved cards for the blind, and
books for the instruction of the deaf and
dumb and blind, as well as maps and charts
for the use of schools for the blind, come
in free, as do books left by bequest. The
next item is "books, fly, and parts thereof."
But I do not know what that means. Then
books. not printed or reprinted in Canada,
which are included and used as textbooks in
the curriculum of any university, college or

school in Canada, and books specially imported for the bona fide use of incorporated
mechanies institutes, public libraries, libraries
of universities, colleges and schools, or for
the library of any incorporated medical, law,
literary, scientific or art association or society,
and being the property of the organized
authorities of such library, and not in any
case the property of individuals, are all free.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Books for all public
libraries are free.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Naturally
there is a reservation for such of them as are
printed in Canada. If they were printed in
this country in French the work would most
likely be done in French districts, and whatever measure of protection is imposed would
be an advantage there. The next item in the
tariff is novels or works of fiction, or literature
of a similar character, unbound or paper
bound or in sheets, but not to include Christmas annuals, or publications commonly known
as juvenile and toy books. These are subject
to duties of from 15 to 25 per cent, but if
printed in the French language in France
they come under the French treaty. These
are what were referred to by my honourable
friend who leads the other side. They pay
a duty of 15 per cent.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: When printed

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
There certainly is no discrimination, for the same rate
applies against English books.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

I said so.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Ye,, I know.
Books printed by any government or by any
association for the promotion of science or
letters. and official annual reports of religious
or benevolent associations, and issued in the
course of proceedings of the said associations,
to their members, and not for the purpose of
sale or trade, and college curriculums and
calendars, are all free. Printed periodicals
and pamphlets, or parts thereof, not including
blank account books, copy books or books
to be written or drawn upon, are free under
the British preferential tariff, and otherwise
subject to 10 per cent, but if printed in
France in the French language they corne in

ROYAL, CA-NADIAN lMOENTED POLICE
BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN moved
the second reading of Bili 9, an Act t.o arnend
the Royal Canadian Mouinteci Police Act.
He said: Honourable memibers, almost
cvery session we have a Bili to amend the
Mounted Police A'ct. In the present, Bill the
first section provides for the imposition of
pecuniary penalties on mcmbers of the force,
atnd for the collection o-f those fines, or penalties. by stoppage of pay.
The second section am.ends the laýw in
res~pe.ct of fun.ding of moncys received from
penalties. I presume the penalties rcferred
to are those imposed hy rcason of desertion
or other offences on the part of members of
the force, not penalties inflicted on persons
outside of the force. Hithierto thesze moneys
have been funded, under the management of
the Cornriss;ioncr. and have been used for
such purposes as rewarding good conduet and
establisliing liýbraries, recreation moirns and
the like. The amendmcnt in this Bill brings
about a reservation or exception in the case
of rnoney which should go to persons wvho
have suifered iojury. It provides that such
mooeys as arc received hy way of penalty
shaîl go to the credif of the Recciver General,
te he used by him for the purpose of cernpensating those who suifer. It seerns obvious
that such an exception should be made.
Sections 3 and 4 are, as far as I can sec, the
very sarne as two sections whieh were in a Biil
iast session. They provide that members of
the Mounted Police who served for any tirne
in the South African War may include that
time in their terni of service in the fore, for
pension puirposes.
Section 5 reduces from one year to eight
rnonths the period mithin which a constable
rna.y elect to corne within the pension provisiens. If hie does ot make his election within
that tirne he will flot have an opportunity to
do so later unless the Commissioner is s atisfied that bis health is such as wouid quaqlify
him for eniistrnent.
Section 6 provides for proportionate benefits
to widows and orphans in the event of the
death of constables w-ho have contributed less
than the full stipulated amount.
The I-on. the SPEAKER.

I do not know what will be the feeling of
hionourable members with respect to the
clauses whicha were rejeý,ted by this House
last year, and therefore I propose after the
second reading to move the House inte Comrnittee 'of the Whoie on the Bill.
The motion ivas agreed te, and the Bill was
read the second tirne.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Right Hon. Mr. Meighen, the
Senate went inte Committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Donnelly in the Chair.
On section 1-trial and punishment:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I have explained this section and section 2.
The section was agreed te.
Section 2 was aýgreed to.
On section 3--officers' pensions:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This provides
that tirne served in South Aýfrica mav be included.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Does týhis appiy only
te those who have been continuouslv in the
force since the South African War?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIýGHEN: No.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Also te thoec who
have joined the force since that war ended?
Righit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Tha.t is it.
'l'le honourable senator will remember that
when the Mounted Poli-ce Bill waýs under considcration forrncrly there was no exception to
the South African terni being included in the
case of a ma.n whio was a memiber of the force
and resigned or obtained leave in order to go
te the war. But this is different, for it inoludes the time served even in the case of a
ma~n who first enlisted in the force years alter
the war ended. AIl that can be said in favour
of it, at any rate ail I -have heard in faveur
of it, is t-bat there is a similar provision in
other ceuintries of the Empire, and, I believe,
also here in connectien withi t.he permanent
militia. That

I arn sponsoring the Bill, thou.gh I could net

for de I feel a bit more able te de se now.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Perhaps the right
honourable gentleman can tell us~ wvhê'her t.his
wvould apply te many members of the force.

MARCH 21, 1935
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am told that
it would apply to two and possibly, though
not likely, to as many as -five. The number
involved is a small matter, I admit. The
question is wholly one of principle.
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: Does this. mean that
a man who served, say, two years in South
Africa and enlisted in the Mounted Police
eight, ten or fifteen years afterwards, would
have his South Arican service counted?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: For purposes
of pension.
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: I say that is most
unfair. There is neither sense nor reason in
it. It is somewhat like a matter that was
brought up here last year in regard to a man
who Ift the force and afterwards came back.
If I have committed one sin sincI.I became
a memiber of this House, it is that I did not
oppose that measure. In defense of the proposal the honourable senator from Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. Griesbach) said the man in question had to send his children six miles to
school, or else move six miles from where he
was situated in order that his children might
attend school. As a matter of fact, my
five children had to go six miles to school,
whether by rail or auto, and I paid the cost
of their transportation. The other man reserves the right to have the Government pay
for his children.
So far as this amendment is concerned, I
say let a man's service date from the time he
joined the force. It is a credit to any man
to be able to enlist in the Mounted Police,
and a further credit to be able to remain in it.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Honourable senators, I looked up the discussion which we had
on the Mounted Police Bill in 1933, when the
same clauses came up and were rejected. It
is true that a man who had served in South
Africa and joined the Mounted Police fifteen
years afterwards would receive the benefit of
this clause. I have asked the Mounted Police
to supply me with the dates of enlistment of
the men who would be affected, and I shall
probably have that information to-morrow.
It is fairly obvious that as a matter of fact
it would be aknost impossible for a South
African veteran to join the force fifteen years
after the war ended; for lie would hardly
have been younger than twenty-three at the
time of his discharge, and fifteen years later
he would probably be at least thirty-eighttoo old to be accepted by the Mounted Police.
The figures would likely show that the men
affected became members of the Mounted
Police not later than four or five years after
the termination of their South African ser-

169

vice. While the section would include a man
who joined fifteen years after the war ended,
as a matter of fact it would be impossible for
him to do so.
The analogy upon which these clauses are
based is, first of all, the law which exists with
respect to the permanent militia. In that connection the law provides that a man who
served in the South African War and subsequently joined the permanent force shall be
credited with his war service in the computing
of his pension. Why not? In both cases he
has been engaged in the military service of
Canada.
For an examination of this question I would
take honourable members back from the
present phase of the discussion to the time
when men were being enlisted for war. The
situation had an entirely different face then.
Let us consider the case of enlistment in
the Mounted Police or any other force. Suppose a man joins the Mounted Police a few
years after. the termination of the South
African War. First of all, what happens te
him? He goes to Regina for a six-months
intensive course of training, and then a probationary period of six months or a year
elapses before he is considered fit to discharge
police duties. Let us assume that two, three,
four or five years after the South African War
five recruits present themselves at Regina, of
whom two have had two or three years' service
in the South African War and three have had
no service at all. The recruiting officer would
immediately select the two ex-soldiers. And
why? Because he knows that, the other three
men having had no military training, the
Government of Canada would have to maintain them for six months while they were
receiving preliminary training, and for a further six months or a year while they gained
the experience required to fit them to function
as Mounted Police constables. The two exsoldiers can be taken into the service and
almost immediately assigned to police duty.
Consequently the country is saved the expense
involved in training absolutely raw recruits.
It is obvious that the Mounted Police authorities are delighted to recruit men who have
already received the training necessary before
they can be turned loose as police constables.
Therefore, when it comes to a computation of
service for pension purposes, it is considered
a matter of fairness to those men that their
period of service in the South African War
should count.
Now, as the right honourable leader of the
House bas said, the number of men who would
benefit by this amendment will not exceed
half a dozen. To-morrow I should know

SENATE

oe's1 1-v liow manli ' xviii bo affected, and 1
sliould k-now aiso when they joined the
Moluntcd Police; in other words, the time
which elapsed between the termination of their
South African service and their enlistment in
the Mounted Police. 1 venture to assert that
those( men spent the intervening period in the
militarv serv ice of this country. I happon to
know thrce or four of them, and I think I
can say thiat aiso w ith respert to the others.
There i., also to be considered the value of
thiose men as trainers of other recruits by
precept and examipie-thie influence of their
prestige amiongst the otber members of the
force. Ail this ultimatcly redounds to the
lienefit of the country generally.
Thien I draw attention to anothor fact,
that wbatcver in the past may have been
the attitude towards pensions, there is teday a growing feeling throughout the Dominion thýat it chies fot make any difference
whether a man bas served in the Department
of Public Works. the Dopartment of the
Interior, or anv other department of Government; bis service to the Government is
what couints. Hence we have a provision in
the law with respect to civil service pensions
that a man w-ho lias se-rved in one department
of Governmont and thien is transferred to
another depariment shaîl have the two
periods of service comibined in the computing
of bis superannuation. This principle applies
aIs,, tu the muan whýo sorved, w-e will say, ten
years in the Mounted Police and thereafter
ontered another department of Government.
The Bill covers the case of a man who
served in the South African War. Truc, it is
military service, but it is also governmental
service. I hav e pointod out the value of
sueh a man to the Mounted Police and to
the couintry. Fiirther, 1 have pointed out the
sax ing of money involved in the recruiting
of a trained, experienced man. Upon these
grounds I submit w-e are justifled in passing
this legisiatiori.
My right honourable frieud stated that the
Mounted Police w-as a civil force and for
that reason its mnembers should not be permitted to count thieir military service in coinputing their pension riglits.
I admit that
the Mounted Police performs civil functions.
But the force w-as originally organized along
military lines, and it bias maintained its
military organization. At this very day the
officers of the Mounted Police hold commissions in the militia service of Canada, and
the Mouinted Police Act stipulates for their
corrosponding military rank as Mounted
Police officers. The connection between the
Mouinted Police and the military service hias
H n

M1. GRIESBACH.

always been verv close. and I submit that in
the interest of the Dominion this is desirable.
The Mounted Police constitutes the largest
armed force we have, and one of its advantages bas always been that while its primary
purpose is to diseharge civil duties, it can
overnight be turned into a military force.
I repoat, it is in the national interest to
maintain the connectiýon of the Mounted
Police with the military forces of Canada.
The amount involved is comparatively
small; about $800 a year, as far as can ho
ascertainod. 0f course, the amendment applies only to men of a certain age. These
men, not more than ton at most, are approaching the termination of their police service.
The amendment does not apply to fnrther
enlistmonts. The age limit is the dctermining
factor. The South Afi-ican War terminatod
in 1902. and none who saw service in that
campaign couid have been younger than 23
at that time. The age limit for joining the
Mounted Police is hetween 22 and 26 years.
Therefore what we are now discussing appiies
onlv to a numibor of men who have served
some thirty or more years in the Mounted
Police and are approaching the termination
of their engagement. As I say, the amount
of money invoived is smaii, and while the
matter miay not appeai to honourable miemabers, it does appeai to those members of the
force who served in the South African War.
Those in charge of the Mouinted Police perhaps understand much botter than do honourable senators tho exact value of those men
to the Mounted Police at the time they joined
the force. I wouid ask, thon, that honourabie
niembers adopt my suggestion not to look
at the matter from this end, but rather to
consider it in retrospect as it presented itself
when theso mon were welcomed to the force
because of their miiitary training and experience.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: May I ask the honourabie senator from Edmonton a pertinent
question? I have no douht many mon who
served in the Great War are now coming into
the Mountod Police force. If we pass this
mea.sure do w-e nlot estahiish a precedent
which automatically would appiy to any of
those war veterans who become members of
the Mounted Police?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACII:

No, not auto-

Hon. Mr. BLACK:

By thus opening the

impossible for the Government to close it

again? The principle of the Bill may be al
right, but ta rny mind it could be extended
to caover thase who served in the Great War.
Hon. Mr. GRElBSBACH: The answer is,
this proposed legisiatian deais specificaî'iy
with, at most, ten m'en wha se'rved in the
South African War, later joined the Mountcd
Police, and are naw completing some thirty
,odd years' service. Whether the principle involvod in this Bill might rbe subsequently
exte.nded ta an amendnent of the Maunted
Police Act fifteen ar twenty years hence I
cannot say. I shauld prefer that the Senate
deal with that questian at that time rather
than naw. This is the present situation. The
prcs&nt. age for eniistment in the Mounted
Police is between 22 and 26 years. Causequentiv if a man finished his Great War
service in, we will say, 1918, when he was
22 years af age, by 1924 he was taa aId
ta join the Mounted Police. That is a
matter flot af iaw, but of practice.
Han. Mr. 'GiULLIS: Is that always adhered ta?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBAC'HI: Il think Sa.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: I do nat think sa.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: It is not.
Hiou. Mr. GRLEISBACH: Officially the
range is 'from 18 ta 40 years of age, but for
the last four or five years, by reason of the
depressian and the. conisequent lack of employment. there bas been such a fine type of
men geeking cnlistment in the force that the
atîthorities are able ta pick their men betwecn
22 and 20 years of age. There are 6,000
on the waiting list. As a resuit the Mounted
Palice iutharities are exacting a very high
standard as ta height, weight and education. In fact applicants must have university
matriculatian.
Han. Mr. BELAND: And thase men are
in perfect physical condition.
Yes.
Neyer
Hon. Mr. GRIEIS1BACH:
before throughout its whole history has the
Mouintýed Police been aJble ta get such a high
ciass of recruits. That, of course, is a mere
aside. My hanourable friend raises the question of what we may do twenty years hence.
Hon. Mr. HUGIHES.- Or next year. ýMight
it nat necessariiy came up next year?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: No. Assuming
the maximum age at which a man can join
the Maunted Police to-day is 26 years, no
soldier wha served in the Great War would
be eligible after 1924. It may be that the
26-year age limit bas not been in effect ever
since 1924. but for the last two or three
years at least it bas been rigidly imposed.

171

Hon. Mr. H1UGHES: That would debar
a man from joining.
Han. Mr. QRIESBAOH: Exactiy. No man
who served iu the Great War wouid be able
ta join the Mounted Police to-day; he wouid
be too aid.
Right Han. Mr. MEGHEN: What about
those who have already joined?
Han. Mr. GRWSBACH: Ten or ftfteen
years hence the situation in retrospect wouid
be much the same as it is to-day. During
the 'Great War the Mounted Pol-ice Farce
had shrunk to about 700 men. In 1921 its
strength was brought up ta 1,900 mea. What
was the attitude 04f the officers of the Mounted
Police at that time with respect ta recruit-,
ing? It was this: "'Give us recruits who
served in the Great War and have had the
benefit af military training and discipline"
Accordingly, in every case preference was
given ta men who had served one, two or
three years at the front. Why? For the
very same reason that before 1914 they had
accepted men who had served in the South
African War. The recruits of 1921. men with
thorough miiitary training and war experienice, were put on police duty almost immediateiy on enlistment, and the country was
spared the expense of training same thousand men over a period of from six mouths
ta a year. If ten years fram now we have
before us a Bill providing that service in the
Great War shail be added ta the Moýunted
Police service in the computing of pension
rights, I shahl advance precisely the sarne
arguments as i arn advancing to-day in
support of such legisiation. I shahl support
that legislation when it cames. But I prefer
toa wait until that time before advancing al
the arguments I have in favour of it. Meanwhiie we are coxafined ta the Bill before us,
and 1 strongly support these proposais, for
the reasons I have given.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: How long have these
educational requirements been in effeet?
Han. Mr. GRIESBACH: About threc years.
14on. Mr. GILLIS: I know that during the
ps.st two years many men have been admitted
who have flot possessed, those qualifications.
They were admitted because they were
physicaily and in some other respects weii
quahi'lied.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBAiCH: I amn taking the
general qualifications. I know of tihe case of a
man who is likeiy ta be admitted shortiy. He
is grade 9; he speaks French, Eagiish and
Cree; he is a horseman, a matar mechanic,
and an experieuood boatman. I fancy they
wiii waive the university matriculation ta get
a man of that sort. I agree with that.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I do not quite understand the honourable gentleman's speech. If
his proposal is that in the matter of pension
the years spent by a man in the South
African War should count in his favour when
he is a member of the Mounted Police, I am
inclined to favour it. But if it is that the
years between the time when the man was a
soldier and the time when hc became a member of tihe Mounted Police be included, I have
some doubt about it.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: It is not.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Then I am inclined
to favour the legislation. I woulid also favour
legislation that would include the man who
served in the Great War.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I think we are losing
sight of the fact that in this section we are
asked to a.dopt a principle that may have a
very wide application, and that if we adopt
it in relation to one or two men, or half a
dozen, who are near the point of retiring, we
may be asked later on, from time to time, to
apply the same principle to men about to
retire who have served in the Great War.
Furthermore, the application of the principle
is not limited to that possibility alone. We
have in this country many civil servants, who,
for the purposes of retirement allowance, may
want their years of service in the Great War
added to the time they have spent in the
Civil Service.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: We have that now.
In the case of any civil servant who took part
in the Great War there is included in the
computation of bis civil pension the period
during which he served as a soldier in that
War.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Does my honourable friend refer to those who have joined the
Civil Service since the War?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Oh, no. I may
have misunderstood the honouraible gentleman. I thought he was suggesting that time
served in the Great War should be added in
the computing of the pension. I was drawing
attention to the fact that a man who was a
member of the Civil Service when the War
broke out, and who joined the military forces,
would be credited with the time spent with
those forces when it came to dealing with his
civil pension.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I quite understand
the explanation, and I thank the honourable
gentleman for it. I think the same thing was
true of those who were serving in the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police. The time they
Hon. Mr. GREISBACH,

spent in military service in the South African
War counted in their period of police service.
But under this Bill we are applying the principle to men who were not in the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police before the South
African War, and who did not come into it
for some years afterwards.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Only two or three
years.
Hon. Mr SINCLAIR: We are now giving
them the right, for pension purposes, to add
their war service to their service in the police,
I take it. Have we. not given an extra bonus
to South African veterans?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Land grants.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Yes, land grants. If
we adopt this principle now, the resuit will
be that when others, who may have joined
the police two years after the Great War,
ask that their war service be included in the
comlputing of their retiring allowance, there
will be no ground for refusing. The same
principle woukl be applicable to any branch
of the Government service. I do not see any
ground upon which we could say that it
shouki apply to one brandh and not to
another.
This legislation seems to me, to be of a
personal nature, to suit the purposes of one
or two men who want to retire; but as time
goes on we dhall continually find ourselves
confronted with cases of members of the force
who, perhaps because of sickness or sorne
other disability, want to retire before having
com'pleted the nurmber of years' service necessary to entitle therm to a pension. We are
inviting th6m to do this very thing. We
shouId be very careful.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I think the honourable
senator who 'bas just taken his seat has put
his finger on the real objection to this
measure. I do not know that I shall oppose
be Bill. but it seems to me that it is fraught
with danger. As the honourable gentleman
bas said. we have a Civil Service whose entire
membership
watches any move of this
character wihich may be made by Parliament.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Could it. by any possibility, be. applied to the Civil Service?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The point is not that
this particular provision of the present Bill
coul.d be apiplied to the Civil Service. But
under the provision for superannuation there
are many who are not entitled to receive
what others will receive, and every time Parliament nimakes a move of this kind to loosen
up. the, Civil Service will say: "This is our
chance; let us dig in."

MARCH 21, 1935
Hon. Mr. MOLILOY: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CA.LDER: Let me give an illustration. The other day 1I pioked up the
estimates and saw there an item providing
for the payment of M30each to six men of
the Mounted Police who h:ad served in the
Rebellion of 1885. To-day Parliament la
moving to pay to those men, who are still
living, $300 apiece for sometbing that occurred
flfty years ago, when 1 was a smali boy.
There must have been other men who served
umder the same conditions, end w-ho are now
dead. Why would not their heirs be entitled
to put in a claim? You can see at a glance
what ths sort of thing may iead ta.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBAOH:
There is no
residu.ary claima to a pension.
Hon..Mr. CAiLDER: There might, be. You
cannot tell what people wili dlaim in these
days.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: Does the boýnourabie
meniiber say that these men are being paid
$3 a day?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: A lump sain of SM0
ea cl.
Hon. 'Mr. PARENT: And they get food
and fuel and everytbing else?
Hon. Mr. CAILDER: T-hey took part in
the Rebellion of 1885, flfty years ago. Provision was made for tihose men by way od
scrip. Some of them took advantage of it;
some did not. In any event- Parliament at
the present session is making provision for
the payment of 3300 each to six men.
Lt is snid that only a very few men in the
force took part in the South African War and
woubd therefore be entitled to corne under
this provision. But, as has beexi remarkcd,
hundreds of men have corne into the force
since the Great War. M1 make t'his proviwe
sion at the present time there is no question
as to what Parliamrent will have to do in
the future so far as those who came into the
force after the Great War are concerned. In
other words, we miight as well make a blanket
provision now under which. any person who
lias served in any war would be entitled to
have his service counted.
Hon. Mr. HT3GIES: Is it not only the
time spent in the war that counlts?
Hon. Mr. 'CALDER: That is ail.
Hon. Mr. BELAIND: My honourable
friend overlooks the fact tihat there is a special Aet which deals with the men wbo served
in the Great War.

173

Right Hon. Mr. 'M'EIGRIEN: There is also
provision for those who served in the South
African War.
Hon. Mr. CALDYER: That is quite apart
from t.bis matter. A main who served iu the
Snuth African War or in the Great War may
he entitled to a certain pension, no matter
what he bas done afterwards. There ia provision for that. But this Bill declares that if
a man happens to join the Mounted Police
he is entitled to have included in his service
with that force the tîrne that he served in
the South African War. I say it is only fair
and reasonable, if we now make this provision for the man who took part in the South
African War, that wc should at the same time
take care of the mnan who served lu the Great
War, and not leave it to some future Parliament to do so.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: If we do leave it, I
do not think there is much question as to
what a future Parliament will do.
I say again that I appreciate the services of
the Mounted Police. I have lived near it
and with it in the West ail my life, and I
know its value. I know the kind of force it
is and what service it bas given to the people
of Canada. The passing otf this legislation
will not make any diff erence at ail as to
that force; I thin-k it will continue to serve
the people of Canada weIl. But the danger is
that we may do sometbing here wbich will
affect other branches of the public service.
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: We also have a Civil
Service, and on our Statute Book there are
certain iaws deaiing with what the members
of that service are entitled to in pensions,
aiiowances, superannuation and insurauce.
Once we begin to depart from the principles
upon which these thinge are founded, there is
danger.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: What are those pri'nciples?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I cannot say off-baud,
for I have not given the -matter consideration.
but I know that ail these iaws are founded on
principles. So far as I personaliy arn concerned I arn not goiug to oppose this provision in the Bull, but I think we should be
quite frank with one another and iuquire
where it is going ta lead. I should like to see
the matter more fully discussed. It is
probable that we should decide as a principle
tbat any man wbo served in the South African
War or the Great War, or who serves in any

SENATE
future war, and wbo is or becomes a member
of the Mounted Police, should have bis war
service counted for pension purposes. I dare
say we should do that, but I do flot know.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: I give credit to a man
who bas served in any war, but if such a man
obtains a wvell paying position witb a private
individual or company is hie stili to be dependent upon the Sfate? That is the question. Many men who are receiving a greator
salary than they ever earned bof ore are
coming and asking the country to help tbem.
Is it just that we as a country should pay tbem
a pension when from other sources they are
earning more than they ever dîd before?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Let us consider this
instance. Suppose two Canadians enlisted for
South Africa on the saine day, spent two or
three vears there and came back to Canada
immediately the war ended. Within a montb
one of them obtained a gond clerical position
in our Civil Service, and on the samne day
the other joined the Mounted Police. Under
the law the civil servant wilI be ent.itled to a
certain superannuation upon bis retirement
but the time ho spent in Soutb Africa cannot
be included for the purposes of computing
that superannuation. Yet under this Bill it
is provided that the man who enlisted in the
Mounted Police shall have his war service
counted for pension purposes. Do honourable
members think that, should this become law,
South African veterans who are in the Civil
Service will flot bc asking Parliament for a
similar concession?
Hon. Mr. BELAND: Very likely.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: The man who joined
the Mounted Police would bave been earning money in the interval after the war. His
tirne for pension purposes should ho counted
from the date that hie became a member of
the force. He should 'be given no privilege
that is flot extended to, other mon. The officiais responsible for bis admittance should
have known whether hie was properly qualified
or not; and once hoe was accepted he should
have becorno eligible for the same benefitsand only the sanie benefits-availa.ble to al
other mnembers. Hero let me pay my respects
to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, wbich
is a veîrv fine body of men.
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: Honourable senators,
I arn opposed to this clause on two grounds.
First of ail I objeot to it on principle. Secondly-and I want to be frank, honest and
aboveboard in saying this-I- objeot to it
because the honourable senator frorn Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbachi) is in favour of it.
Hon.

-Mi.

CALDER.

The honourable gentleman is, as I told bim
to bis face on one occasion, one of the most
inconsistont mon I bave ever known. Some
years ago hoe was tbe father od a Bill in this
House respecting sweepstakes, and bie asked
me to support it. I remember the matter
distinctly, and hoe romembers it botter tha-n
I do. I was in favour of the measure from
the ground up, and I did support it. Being
a somewbat sulent memýber of this House, I
did flot speak in favour of it, but I voted for
it in a straightforward, bonost and sincere way.
At a later date, when I did risc and express
my support of a similar measure, my honourable friend opposed it and voted against it.
I told him in the corridors that bie was the
most inconsistent man I had ever known.
" Well," hie said, " I had to support my own
sweepstakes." Wbat did that mean? 1 have
yet tu find the answer.
Now I corne to this clause under which
somo mon would receive certain benefits.
Well, they are not going te receive them
with my support. We have been told about
mon who served in South Africa and in the
Great War. Among those I knew were many
wbý,o were not spared to corne home again.
Here is a question. Did the mon who went
to South Africa or who onlisted in the Great
W'ar in defence of the Empire do sn for pay
or for patrintism? That is the point; that
is the millc in the coconut. If any of tbem
weont for pay, why should they bc recuguized
at ail? As I understand it, a real man goos
to, the defence of bis country for patriotism
and not for pay. Now it happons that we are
dealing with a clause that would affect a
number of mon-I do net care whether the
number ho small or large.
Every one of
them was cither a patriot or not a patriot.
This country did not force any man te go
to the South African War; any service that
wvas giv~en was entirely voluntary.
The honourable sonater froým Saltoats
(Hon. Mr. Calder) struck the nail on the
hpead when ho said, in effeot, that we are
likely te cause trouble if we fail to treat
aIl former soldiers alike in nur services-if
we make flesh of one and fish of another.
Take the case of a man who went te the
South African War in 1899 and came back
in 1902. First of ahl, hoe was lucky te ho able
te corne back, especially if ho ions as well as
before. Let us say hoe went into seie business which did net suit him and did not pay.
It appears ive aIl are materialistic. If we
would only admit it, we are aIl pretty much
eut for what ive can get. That ccrtainly is pertinent te Ibis rneasîîre. A mani dees his duty

MARCH 21, 1935
if hie serves in a war for patriotic purposes;
hie does not do lis duty if hie serves just
for pay. Suppose in the instance I arn giving
the man served just for pay. He carne hack,
and, as I say, went into sorne business which
did nlot make money. Then he looked towards the Mounted Police, which have a
record ail their own, and hie said: " I arn a
young man. I arn net very particular as to
what rnay happen in the future. I have no
fears and no responsibilities; so I will enlist
in the Mounted Police."
That force is the greatest one of its kind
the world has ever known. The honourable
senator frorn Edmonton need not tell rne anything ab>out the Royal North West Mounted
Police, as it was forrnerly known. I have
lived in the Northwest longer than hie has,
and longer than any other honourable member
of this House, and I arn proud of the fact
that I have known the North West Mounted
Police frorn the tirne I was se high. They
are a wonderful 'body of men, who have won
for thernselves the admiration of the whole
civilized world. Listen to the commentators
on the American radio programs. Almost
wee-kly something is said in praise of the men
who are known throughou.t the world as the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police. I take off
my hat to the living and the dead of that
force. I sat in Parliament for fifteen years
with a man who had been a member of the
Mounted Police. I knew hirn hetter than
anyone in this Chamber did, and I can say
that hie was a man frorn the ground up. I
will not consent to dishonouring the record
of the Mounted Police by allowing this
measure to pas without rny protest. Men
who enlisted in the North West Mounted
Police and rernained in the force until the
time of their retiremen.t, who followed the
dog train, the Indian, the crirninal, who
crossed the river in the course of their duty,
who gave their best at all tirnes, should be
treated as well as men who went to South
Africa and four, six, cight or ten years later
joined the Mounted Police. Those who remained on the force were prepared to sacrifice
their lives at any tirne, and in the early days
their pay was a mere pitýtance. Yet they
perforrned deeds that have neyer been equalled
by any other force in the world. They were
known and respected from the Atlantic to
the Pacifie, frorn the 49th parallel to the
Aretic regions. I say it is unfair to paas
this measure. It would be an insult to the
members of the force who served steadily
and neyer asked a favour of any man, white,
red or black.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I should like to ask
a question of the right honourable leader of
the House, who takes a sane view on nearly
every subject that cornes before him and
whose explanations are ustially very clear.
Is there any possibility that legislation along
the fine proposed here inay have the farreaching effects feared by the honourable
senator from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder)?
The matter is a serious one, for it would be
no ligh.t thing to open wide the door as hie
suggests we are in danger of doing. For rny
own part I cannot sec any possibility of such
danger in this measure.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Take, the illustration
1 gave you. Two men are in the employ
of the Government of Canada, one a rnounted
policeman, another a civil servant. We say to
the mounted policeman, "You will nlot be
required to serve the fuît length of time to
To the civil
qualify for superannuation."
servant we say, "You mnust serve the full
length of time."
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Because the mounted
policeman has performed a similar service
in another way, to the great advantage of
his country. As I see it, the civil servant has
flot done so.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The two men served
the saine length of time in the South African
War. They corne back to Canada. One
happens to go into the Mounted Police force,
the other into the Civil Service.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: The first man enters
a service similar to what hie has already been
engaged in. The other man is in an entirely
different position.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: You are placing it on
the ground of similar service?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Yes.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Why?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Because it is a similar
service.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: If we have both served
in the South African War, and I happen
to go into the Mounted Police force and you
into the Civil Service, why should I be treated
differently frorn you? 1 arn putting forwgrd
the honourable gentleman's own arguir.-nt.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I arn looking at it in
a different way. If I arn wrong I arn willing
to be corrected. The Mounted Police service
is to a large extent a similar service, performed
in Canada; the other is not. If I amn wrong in
that. I arn wrong altogether.

176

SENATE

Hon. Mr. CALDER: J cannot see any great
siiiarity in the service.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I should be glad if
right honourable leader of the House
could sec his way clear to explain this matter.
I want to give an honest vote; I want to do
what is right. From my point of view the
men who volunteered to serve their country
in the South African War or in the Great War
should be regarded as in a different classification altogether. That is the way I look at it.

lion. Mr.
Prosecutor.

GRIESBACH:

The

Crown

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: He is called
the Crown Prosecutor. As a matter of fact he
is not a prosecutor. He is merely representing the Crown in the presentation of facts.
Wlen a similar measure was before this
House two years ago I was unable to convince
imyself that it was justified. We declined to
pass that Bill. I can find in the records of
the other House and in the explanatory notes
of the Bill itself nothing at all in the way of
additional argument to that adduced two
years ago. I admit, and shall bring it in a
little later, that the senator from Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. Griesbach) has brouglit to our
attention a consideration of somo importance
and deserving our thought. I cannot say it is
of sufficient force to change my mind.
Now. what are the principles which should
govern? We are asked to be good enough to
allow a mounted policeman who served in the
South African War and who some time afterwe will assume one, two, three or four years-joined the force, to have the time he served in
South Africa counted with that served with
the Mounted Police in the computing of his
pension rights. We are given as a reason the
fact that already we have made a similar coneûsono to one who served in the South African
War and later joined the permanent militia.
The analogy is close. If we are to reason
onil
bv way of analogy, possily a case can
be made out. I do not think the analogy
Ion. Mr. HUGHES.

is exact, for while there is some similarity in
the two services, the Mounted Police is a civil
force. But presuming there is a close analogy,
are we sure an error was not made in the case
of the militia enlistment?
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Why should
we treat men who served in a war, if perchance after the war they join a certain kind
of service. differently from those who do not
join that certain kind of service? Should
not ail men who have served their counutry
in a war be put on precisely the saine footing? If they suffered injury they are put on
the same footiing. regard being had, of course,
to their status and their disability. But why
should their occupation after the war affect
the recognition the country gives them because of that war service?
What has the
occupation after the war to do with it at all,
whether in the militia or in any other governmental department? Why, as between those
who come there and those who do not, should
it create a distinction in the recognition the
country gives them for their war service? If
there is a reason I do not know of it.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Will my right
honourable friend allow me to interrupt him?
I should like to point out that those men
were welcomed into the Mounted Police because they were specially trained and thus
immediately qualified to discharge their
duties.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHIEN: I was just
reaching that point. Something approaching a
reason is advanced by the honourable senator
from Edmonton. He says: "Ah! they are
better qualified; their war service makes their
service in the Mounted Police a better service,
and it saves the Government the expense of
training the'm for police duty." If that is
the case there should be some reward due to
the saving of expense, and not attributable to
this irrational relationship of their war-time
service. They might have been in the war
for three years and yet be no good at all in
the Mounted Police-not worth a cent.
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: Hear, Hear.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: But the fact that
ithey have been in the Mounted Police service

1or the best part of thirty years would show
that they passed the tests satisfactorily.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. But
their service in the South African War is not
a reason for adding the time served there to
the period of their service in the Mounted
Police for the computation of pensions.

MARCH 21, 1935
Hon. Mr. HUJGHES: s flot that the whole
thing?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Mf they deserve compensation because tbey are better
qualified. tlîey should be compensated for
that reasokn, and in a difrent way; not
mereiy because of the ye-ars they served in
the South Mfrican War.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: May I suggest to
my rigbt honourable friend that this is provide-d for. If those men were better qu-alified
for Mounted Police duty they would receive
compensation by advance in rank and correspon-ding increase in remuneration.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I sb-ould
think that i.s correct. It had flot occurred to
me. They would be, better qualified, their
advance would be more ra-pid, and consequently their reward would be aecelerated.
But suppose the argument advanced by the
honourable senator fromn Edýmonton is to
hold-and it is the nearest approach to a
rea.son for making a distinction. For that
argument 1 am grat-eful to him. I have asked
honourabýle gentlemen who I thought were
competent to give me reasons to, help me
with this, Bill, but they ha.ve flot been 6o
resourceful as the senator from. Edmonton.
Let us pursue his argument further. Here
is a man back from the Great War. He was
a paymaster. He performed a good deal
of clerical service as su'ch, and perhaps neyer
got out of England. He had four years in
the systematic work df paymaster, which
would teach himi office organization. He returns to Canada and gets into the Civil
Service. and hecause of that cIerical service
overseas he is better qualified. ils thet a
reason for adding the whole time hie was overseas to bis time in the Civil Service for computing bis pension? Not at aIl. He gets an
initial advantage over other men in entering
the Civil Service, and later he gets a further
advantage because hie receives promotion
more rapidly .by reason of hie greater experience. It seems to me his overseas service is
already recognized to the full. I do flot like
making a distinction between men who have
served in a war on the- basis oê the occupation tbey get into after the war. There seems
to be no principle of right behind it. Conisequently my sympathies are with those who
oppose these two clauses.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: There is another
point we might consider with regard to adding
time for computing pension. Under the
Mount-ed Police Act, if I understand it rightly,
the ruemnbers of the force do not contribute
towards their pensions as do civil servants.

177

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do n.ot
know as to t-bat. I aI.ways thought they did.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: There are three
forms of pension. iCommissioned officers contribute to a superannuation fund by way of a
deduction fromn their pay of 5 per cent.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: That is similar to
Civil Service superannuation.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Yes, but it is a
separate f und. Non-commissioned officers and
other ranks have no pension fun-d which the'y
themselves subscribe to; their pension is
provided by the Government on the basis of
service. The third f orma of pension is provided
by the non-comanissîoned officers and men
tbemselves to take care of widows and orphans
of members of the force.
Hon. Mr. SIN-CLAIR: ls it voluntary or
statutory?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The administration
is provided for by statu-te. By section 5 of
the Bill a metsber of the force muet within
eight rnontbs elect wbether 'he wîll contribute
to tbis fund. So you are discussing: first, a
superannuation fund for comrnissioned officers
whidh is paid for on a contributory basis;
se;condly, a pension fund for non-coinmissioned
officers and men, which is provided by the
Government; thirdly, a fund for widows and
orph.ans, supported by the men.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Will the honourable
senator from Edmonton state how mucb will
be added to the retiring allowance by coun.ting
the time served in the South African War,
and hbow much will have to be contributed by
the officers?
Hon. Mr. ORIESBACH: A commissioned
officer wifl have to pay 'into the fund a sumn
of money sufficient -to cover the period which
hie dlaims on bis South African War service.
If two years, he wiil be required to contribute
5 per cent of his pay for that period in order
to put his contribution to, tbe fund on a
proper hasis.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Is i-t 5 per cent of bis
present rate of pay?
Hon. Mr. GRIESýBACH: It will be 5 per
cent on the rate of pay hie had at that time.
It is estimated that an officer will be required
to pay $54.75 per annum.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Le the honourable
senator referring to the rate of pay received
by the officer during bis service in South
Africa?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: It is the rate of
pay which hie received. et thul time. Assuming
hie served as a sergeant at ten shillings a day

and is now a commissioned officer in the
Mounted Police, he would pay $54.75 for
each year of service to place himself in proper
relation to the superannuation fund. Noncommissioned officers and men do not pay
anything; they come under the statute. For
eight officers, in the event of their being
pensioned, it would cost the Government
$863.80 per annum.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: For those who would
come under this measure?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Yes.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: How much wili they
have to pay in to entitle them to that?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: It depends on the
rank at which they retire. If a man retires
with the rank of a commissioned officer lie wil
have to pay into the superannuation fund; if
he retires with the rank of sergeant he will
not have to pay anything.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Honourable gentlemen, I think my honourable friend might well
have furnished the Committee more direct
information. He, knows who the men are and
their rank.
Hon. Mr. ORIESBACH: No, I do not know
who they are, and I cannot say now what
will be their rank when they retire, because
some may be promoted in the meantime.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Will the honourable
gentleman be able to give the amount of
money involved in the retirement allowances?
[ do not see how you can figure one without
'he ot>her.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Will my honourable friend repeat his question?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The point the honourable senator has made is simply this. We
have not sufficient information before us to
deal intelligently with these clauses. In fact
we do not know what we are dealing with.
Who are these men? How long have they
been in the service? How long did they
serve in South Africa? What salaries are
they getting? What remuneration did they
first get when they entered the force? In
a sense we are asked to vote in the dark.
We should have this information definitely
before us, so we may know exactly what we
are doing.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: All details.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The right honourable leader has had to leave the Chamber.
He suggested to me that the Committee

body of the Mounted Police are not looking

Hon. Mr. MOLLOY:

They are not.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: They are not looking for it at all. The agitation is largely
on the part of a few individuals. It is the
same in other departments of the publie

out of the 'Government.
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY:

Hon. Mr. CALDER: We should not lend
ourselves to this sort of thing. We should

than ever that when this thing is dealt with
it should be dealt with on a broad principle.
If we are to recognize war service for this
purpose, then let us deal with all war service and not wit'h a part. I would suggest
that the Committee rise and report progress

TARIFF ON FRENH BOOKS
Before the Orders of the Day:
Ion. RAOUL DANDURA'ND: Honourable
memibers of the Senate, 'before the Orders of
the Day are called 1l should like to, ask a
question which I have heard expressed on ail
sides. On Saturday Iast the press cd the
country announced that novels and similar
publications would henceiforth be adniitted
from Great Britýain and France free of cus,toms charge. The schedules accompanying
the 'budget speech indicate that novels and
such books are, admissible free oif duty only
under the British .preference. The query
arose as to the extension of it, to importations from. France. The explanation I have
been given is that under the French convention novels or works of similar character,
printed in France in the French language,
unbound or paper bound or in sheets, are
admitted at the samne rate as under the
British preferential tariff. So it was only
necessary to amend the item under the, British
prceference in order to give at the samne time
a similar preierence to importations from
France.
I take it for granted that th.is correctly explains the situation. Therefore I hasten Vo
express my thanks to the right honourable
leader o! the House (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) for the promptitude with which,
when the dacts were brouglit to bis attention
hast Wednesday, hie proceeded to redress
what seemed ta be an anomaly in the working out of the treaty. At that time he stated
that if the facts were such as I had laid before him. hie would at once bring the matter

180

SENATE

to the attention of the proper department.
The honourable the Minister cf Finance
brought down bis budget forty-eight hours
later with the desired amendment. I repeat
my thanks to the right honourable gentleman
and congratulate him on the expedition with
which lie acted.
The
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN:
honourable member's recital of the changes
in the tariff and in the French Treaty is
correct. Prior to 1930 paper-bound books
were dutiable under the British preferential,
the intermediate, and the general tariff at
the respective rates of 15, 221 and 25 per
cent, with a fixed rate to France of 15 per
cent. That gave France the same tariff rate
as Britain-a rate much lower than the rates
under the intermediate and the general tariff.
After the Ottawa Conference of 1932, bound
books were made free under the British
preference and subject to a duty of 10 and
10 per cent under the intermediate and the
general tariff. The practice appears to be to
bind books in England and to use paper
covers in France. Consequently importations
from England enter free. On importations
irom France, had the books been bound, the
rate would have been 10 per cent, but as they
were not bound they came in under the old
rate. Of course, it must be recalled that
considerable advantages by way of a quid
pro quo were secured by the Ottawa Agreements. In the negotiations preceding the
French Treaty of 1933 France requested and
was granted a concession applicable to these
items, reading as follows: "same rate as
This entitled
British preferential tariff."
France to free entry of bound books; unbound books were still subject to a tariff
of 15 per cent. That is the state of affairs
off which my honourable friend complained.
It should be emphasized again that the rate
is the same as respects both England and
France, but, as I have explained, the publishing practices were different.
Among the tariff changes announced in the
budget speech, item 169, which covers unbound or paper bound books, was made free
under the British preferential tariff. France,
by virtue of the treaty of 1933, being entitled
to the same rate, will now be able to export
unbound books to Canada free of duty. I
am very glad indeed that this result bas been
brought about, and I earnestly trust the books
now to come in free will all be good books
and of great advantage to honourable gentlemen.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

DISTURBANCE AT PORTSMOUTH
PENITENTIARY
Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. J. LEWIS:
Honourable members,
before the Orders of the Day are called, I
desire to direct attention to the recent disturbance at Portsmouth Penitentiary, and to
make a suggestion in regard thereto. This
disturbance, I believe, is the third which bas
occurred in the past three years.
Several attempts have been made within
the penitentiary to improve the situation;
the warden and other officials have been
changed, and the regulations have been
altered. The failure to bring about any improvement leads me to infer that the official
mind bas been found to be incapable of
coping with the situation. The Government
itself admits this, for in the Speech from
the Throne it promises that an inquiry will
be made into the well-known Borstal system
in Great Britain, for the evident purpose of
adopting some of its ideas.
The Government bas steadfastly refused to
appoint a royal commission, which would be
a means of securing outside advice, possibly
on the assumption that a public investigation
might further inflame the prisoners. I do not
attach any importance to sucli an assumption.
However, I should like to make a suggestion
which I believe would overcome the objection,
namely, that the Department of Justice call
into counsel Canadians who are deeply
in the question. I have in
interested
mind Genoral Ross of Kingston, W. F.
Nickle, K.C., and his son, also of Kingston, Miss MacPhail, a member of the other
House, and Archdeacon Scott. In my opinion
they would to a certain extent be able to
accomplish the object which I should like,
and which no doubt the Government also
would like, to sec attained, without publicity
and without delay.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Mr. Speaker, I
rise to a point of order. The bonourable
gentleman is making a speech. On the Orders
of the Day he may rise and put a question
on a matter of urgent public importance, but
he bas no right to initiate a debate.
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: The honourable gentleman bas done me a great service, for I had
just concluded my remarks.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I must confess,
very promptly, that I had a great deal, more
sympathy with the appeal made last week on
behalf of free entry of French books than I
have with this appeal. I may feel too strongly
on this subject. The trend of my mind is

MARCH 26, 1935
wholly out of accord with that of the honourable senator.
I call attention, first, to the fact that these
outbreaks have been confined to Kingston
Penitentiary, and to the coincident fact that
all this fanfare by way of sympathetic acclaim
of prisoners, all this appeal to public sentiment to be good to them, all this denunciation
of their treatment as affected by all manner
of human infirmities-,severity, callousness.
cruelty and the like-is also well within the
neighbourhood of Kingston Penitentiary, or
is confined to Ontario. I do not know whether
others draw tlhe inference or not, but I do,
that there is a very direct relationship between
the trouble and the fanfare. The inmates of
that penitentiary are in some way infected
with the belief that publie sympathy is with
then; that those who are behind the authorities are but a small minority in this province,
and that if these disturbances burst forth often
enough, and violently enough, the best classes
of society will be intimidated and the
prisoners will get the upper hand.
The honourable member says that the
Government's undertaking to study and investigate the Borstal system,. as given in the
Speech from the Throne, is an evidence that
it is incapable of dealing with this matter.
I do not foldow that reasoning. I cannot for
the life of me see just what is in the honourable mem-ber's mind to cause him to say,
because the 'Government promises to investiga.te an idea that is new, that it is incapable of anything new in the way of ideas.
If that is the way in which the honourable member's mind works, it is different fron the way
mine works. As a matter of fact, the Borstal
system has no relation to this subject. It
has to do with the treatment of boys, as I
understand it. I may be wrong in that. I
have not given very great study or special
attention to the system referred to.
It seems to me that we have about reached
the stage when lawbreakers in this country
have to be taught their place.
Some Hon. SSNATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We have not
had dificulties in other parts of the country.
I know of no reason for thinking that the
men in charge of our penitentiaries are less
amenable to the higher impulses of humanity
than are other prople. They are dealàing with
a very difficult class of men. I know that in
certain cases--and f think the statement can
be made very generally-the officials are alive
to their responsibilities and are exceedingly
worried in consequence of a type of propaganda which is too much encouraged in this
Dominion at the present time. From their

observations at close range they realize just
what effect it has on the minds of prisoners;
and when these violent outbreaks occur without rhyme, reason, or sense, in the centre of
the area where propaganda is greatest, I am
surely not unreasonable in suspecting a very
close relationship between the two facts.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: While I am
quite aware that there is nothing before the
House, I should like to add a' word which
I think is germane to the question just treated
by the right honourable gentleman. I have
noticed lately, and I have had three or four
clippings which bear me out, that many of the
criminals arrested for burglary have been on
ticket of leave. Some years ago, when I was
acting Minister of Justice, there being no
Solicitor General, I had to perform the duty
of reviewing requests for tickets of leave. I
found that the work within the Department of
Justice was being done seriously and conscientiously. In these times of stress, with
outcroppings of burglaries and holdups, I have
been wondering whether the Depa.rtment
should not be somewhat hesitant about
granting tickets of leave to men who have
been found guilty of a certain number of
offences. I draw the attention of the right
honourable gentleman to this point, because
within the last six months a number of ticket
of leave men have been arrested within a
few weeks of their release. This fact ought
to be noted in fairness to the police forces of
the country, who have to face these men.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

Printing Bureau on Sundays during the months
of February and March, 1935?

2. If so, how many persons were employed

on such Sundays?

3. What was the nature of the work they
performed, if so employed?
4. What were the names of the persons so
employed, if any?
5. If so employed, were they paid for extra
time?
6. What was the total amount paid to such
persons, if so employed?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have an
answer for the honourable gentleman. The
answer to the first question is that no work
has been done in the Printing Bureau on
Sundays during the months of February and
March, 1935. Questions 2 to 6 are answered.
by No. 1.

THIRD READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the third
reading of Bill A, an Act to amend and consolidate the Acts relating to Patents of Invention.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable gentlemen, I understand that two amendments are
to be made to this Bill, and, as the mover of
the third reading cannot move them, I have
been asked to do so. I move therefore:

made that whole paragraph should have corne

Th nixt aomend'ment covers an omission.
The $2 fee, with regard to which there is to

EMPLOYMENT AND SOCIAL
INSURANCE BILL
SECOND

READING

The Senate resumed from March 19 the
adjourned debate on the motion of Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen for the second reading
of Bill 8, an Act to establish an Employment and Social Insurance Commission, to
provide for a National Employment Service,
for Insurance against Unemployment, for aid
to Unemployed Persons, and for other forms
of Social Insurance and Security, and for
purposes related thereto.

MAROR 26, 1935
Right, Hon. ARTHIUIR MWIGHEN: Honourable senators, the debate on this motion
was delayed in order Vhat honourable members, including myseif, might be rfurth.er prepared to discuss, not details of the Bill, but
the constitutional principle on which it is
based and the plenitude of that principle se
far as federal powers are concerued.
On a resolution introduced, debated and
passed in this House some six weeks ago,
for the ratification of a draft. convention of
the Labour Organization of the League of
Nations, 1 outlined the reasons why in my
view this Parliament had power to pass laws
ba.sed uponl that resolution. In the main,
if nlot wholly, the reasons 'then adduced have
~paral1el application here. This stateme#lt
requires a certain degree of reservation, which
reservation I shall deal with more fully in
a moment. 'I postporie consideration of it
merely because it. can be made more plain
by a reca.pitulation cof the argument then
advanced. It will be rememlbered that, the
view I expressed-in which I have reason to
beLieve many 'honouralble senators at al
events concurred-was that with respect te
hours of labour we could very well found
our righ't te legisiate upon the trade and
commerce provisions of the Br.itish North
America Act, when the proposed legisiation
was of Dominion-wide effeet, had te do with
equality of rights and standing in respect of
interprovincial trade, and was indeed related
to our position in international trade. I
ccmtended that inasmuch se we -were seeking Vo legislate, not with respect Vo any particular trade, still less any particular act
of trade, but with respect Vo the whole of
Canada, and in a way which would affect
especially intecprovincial and international
trade, we were within our trade and commerce powers, and were not ýexercising them
so as to invade the civil rights jurisdiction
of the provinces. This argument undoubtedly
applies with equal force, no more anch no
less. to the prescnt Bill. In respect of the
contention that we are within our powers by
virtue of the trade and commerce provisions
of the British North America Act, we are
on just as sound and sure, a footing in this
Bill as we could be in the eight-hour-day
Bill, becs use the present measure wiil affect
trade and commerce in a Dominion-wide
way. in relation to our international and
interprovincial trade. On-Iy federal legislation can effect the desired purpose, because
federal legisiation alone can result in equality
of restriction as among our nine provinces.
Now I pass te other grounlds eutlined when
we were dea-ling w'ith the resolution. It was
contended then that section 132 of the British
North America Act also applied. It is the

183

section which enables and- enipowers the Dominion Parliamenlt to execute and iinpleiment,
te the full -the obligations binding upon Canada, by virtue of treaty, or otherwise, as a
part of the British Emipire. I contenided also,
lest this argument should be in any way
chullenged, that we were ceritainly within our
rights under section 91. I pointed out that
that section gave us power to leigislate in
respect of the peace, order and good Soverniment of Canada; and that in the Radio case,
as in the Aviation- case, it was held-indeed
it had been held in previous years--that although this residuary authority under the
general terms of peace, order and good gevernment eould noV ordinarily be dep%-nded
upon where it interfered with specific powers
gran-ted the provinces under section 92, and
could generally be exercised, only in relation
Vo matters net ithere specifically assigned, to
the provinces, yet there was this exception
to that rule, that where legisiation impinged
in lany way on speciflc powers granted the
provinces, it could still be justifled if the
subjeV-,matter cf the legislation were cf such
importance, character and moment as Vo make
it a national problem of Vhs -country.
Hion. Mr. DANDULAiND: Wfio would be
the judge?
Right Hon. Mr. M'EIGHEN: The Privy
Couneil, in tihe end. We have to use our best
judgment and sulrniit ourselves to the highest authority in the realm. lt was argued in
the eight-hour-day discussion-and I irnpreas
it again now-4ihat il ever there was a mubjeot which had grown. Voethese dimensions,
which ccupied that high and, ail-imoportant
position in Vhe public mind and in the spheTe
of politicai acobivity in Canada, it surely was
this subject of the eight-hour day.
Is the question of insurance, as affecting
labour and employment in our country, of
equai stiature? In dealing with the diotinction 1 hope that I shall noV, because cif inadequate preparation due Vo lack of ime, fail to
malce anyseif clear. I said in the other instance thait we rested upon section 132, which
enabled u.s to carry out any obligation falling
upon Vhe Dominion or any province of the
Dominion by virtue of a treaty made by the
British Empire. I say that broad base is
applicable in the present case, -but there is
Vlïis difference. The Treaty of Versailles conVemplated legisiattion by Vhe parties Vo the
treaty along the lines of our eight-hour-day
Bill, and it provided that there shouid be a
Labour Organization, of which the coruntries
compoeing the League shou1d he the members, and which shauid draft conventions for
submission ùo the governments of ail these
ceuntries. I pointed out that inasmuch. as

184

SENATE

Canada is a member of the League as an individual nation, and not as part of the Empire, there would be a question as to whether
any obligation entered into by this country
as a member of the League was an Empire
obligation, and I argued it would be rather
an obligation of Canada itself. As honourable
members will recall, in dealing with section
132 I said 'that if it was held we were not
bound by an Empire obligation in respect of
any of these conventions, we nevertheless had
equal responsibility devolving upon us, according to the judgment in the Radio case,
in which it was held that it amounted to the
very same thing whether an obligation rested
on us as a memiber of the Empire or wheither
it rested on us because of our own individual
nationali.ty.
The present legislation is not based on a
convention made by the International Labour
Office, as will be the eight-hour-day measure.
The onl'y treaty background to this legislation
is the Treaty of Versailles itself. That treaty
did provide, in article 23, that the members of
the League "wil. endeavour to secure and
maintain fair and humane conditions of labour
for men, women, and children, both in their
own countries and in all countries to which
their commercial and industrial relations extend." And in article 427 it is stated: "The
well-being, physical, moral and intellectual, of
industrial wage-earners is of supreme international importance." In these words consists, so far as I know, the only agreement
by way of treaty to which this country is a
party. And we are a party to it not because
we as an individual nation are a member of
the League, but because the British Empire,
and Canada as a part thereof, signed the
Treaty of Versailles. Therefore whatever obligation arises by virtue of these terms of the
Treaty of Versailles binds us of the Dominion
because we are part of the British Empire. So
under section 132 of the British North
America Act we .are undoubtedly and indisputably enabled to carry out the obligation,
whatever it may be, because it rests on us as
part of the Empire. In that sense we are on
a solider footing in respect of section 132
here than we were when dealing with the
eighthour-day .measure.
There is, however, still a point as to just
how far this is a specific obligation. It is true
it has not the same specifie nature and definition as have the terms of a draft convention
which we have signed subject to ratification.
Nevertheless, these words in the Treaty of
Versailles, and the obligations imposed by
them, mean something. We are endeavourmng to carry out the more or less general
obligation resting upon us by virtue of these
Riglt Hon.

fr. ME;MIEN.

words, and inasmuch as we are endeavouring
to do so in the way best suited to ourselves,
we place our feet upon section 132 of the
British North America Act. And I argue here
again, as in the former case, that the mere
fact that our full duty cannot be donc otherwise than through federal action, taken by us
as a great national unit functioning through
its national Parliament, makes the matter of
such stature and importance as to lift it out
of oher categories, and makes it a Dominion
responsibility and power under the peace,
order and good government provisions in section 91. This case is different from any of
the resolutions in that we have here no specific
convention, but although that difference has
some importance in the argument with respect
to section 132, it cannot shove us off the rock
of that section. It has some importance also
with respect to the peace, order and good
government section, but since there is no way
by whieh a nation can comply with the general
obligation to which I have referred than
through action by its national Parliament, we
certainly come within the terms of the judgment in the Radio case and are within our
powers here.
In su'bmitting these views to honourable
members let me urge this consideration, by
no means of a legal characiter at all. There
are certain things this country has to do if
we are to take our part in the general
emergence from the distressing conditions of
these times in respect of social matters. The
things we have to do are of iar-reaching, paramount importance; they are vital and
essential to our recovery and to our national
existence.
People have said, times without
number. that the depression we are labouring
under now is not of the same character and
kind as any of those cycles which have disturbed the progress of humanity in the past.
This is true. The discoveries of man have
brought upon us a condition utterly without
precedent, a condition which requires remedies
never before even tried. Those discoveries
have made it possible for a very few of this
world's population to produce more than the
whole can use, unless there is a wider distribution of earnings and the people in general are better able to buy. This condition
can be dealt with, first, by our moving, in
concert with other powcrs. towards a red-uction of hours of labour. and secondly by our
taking care of incidental unemployment, which
undoubtedly will be our lot in the process.
These steps ive must take, as must other countries. I humbly submit it should be the purpose of every man upon whom responsibility
for legislation lies to find ways of performing
these duties, and not endeavour to find

MARCH 26, 1935
obstacles that prevent us from performing
themn and meeting our .iust obligation. If
we are going Vo sbield ourselves bebiind-perhaps that is flot a fair way oif putting it-if
we are going to get bebind constitutional
difficulties we shall only end up 1»' etrangling
ourselves and making this country an impediment in the general march of the nations cd
the world towards a brigbtor and better day.
Surely the solution of these problems is cd
consoquence enough to be an obligation of
Canada's. And surely when the day cornes
that a decision must 'be made in a constitutional form it will be held that this country
is flot to bo considered fettered by so-called
limitations, applicable possibly to other days
and other times, but that we are a nation
in faet as well as in f orrn, and are going
to take our part as a really mature and cornpetent nation, and not as a nation in process
cd maturity.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, my rigbt honourable friend (Right
Hon. Mr. Meigbon) knows better than any
other member of this Chamber that there
are somo limitations to tbe competonce of
Parliament. He has had ample oxporience
in drafting laws and knows that to enact
legislation the Federal Parliament must find
its power within the four corners of the British
North Amorica Act. Great Britain has the
advantage of a very olastic system: ber constitution is unwritten. Canada's is a written
constitution.
My right honourable friend cannet close
bis oyes and bis mind te what, up Vo this
date, have been bis own views on these
points. Ho has affirmed, and bas acted upon
tho affirmation, that social legisiation came
under provincial jurisdiction. The question
is new brought to our attention from another
angle. A series of judgmonts of the Privy
Ceuncil bave established our limitations, and
yet we are now asking ourselves if this proposed legislation is noV within our competenco.
I put to my right honourable friond a moment
ago this question: who will be the judge cf
the contention advanced by somoe honourable
gentlemen tbat tbe subjeet-matter cf tbis
legislation has becorne a national matter and
honce falîs witbin the jurisdiction cf tbe Parliament cf Canada? My right honourable
friend bas answered, the Judicial Commnitteo
cf the Privy Ceuncil. This brings us hack te
the point that in trying te do our best we are
confronted witb the knowledge that we are
on very delicato ground.
It appertains to this Chamber more than
to, the House cf Commons te test all proposed
legislation in order te sce tbhat we are net

1&5

violating the privilogos and jurisdiction cf the
provinces, because the Senate has been held
te be the protecter cf the Constitution and
cf provincial rights. Our whcle erganization
bas been designod te that end. It is our
beunden duty te settle the question, and 1
intend te deal with it even though it may
ho held that I arn attacking tbo proposed
legislation. I arn net, and before entering
upen the constitutional question I intend te
discuss tbe principlo upon whicb the Bill is
based.
Tbe Bill deals with unemployment insurance. Independently cf the question cf jurisdiction, I have in this Chamber declared
more than once that I was absolutely won
over te tbe idea cf unemployment insurance.
By studying the situation cf the labeurer I
have gradually cerne te tbat cenclusien. I
know arguments have been advanced against
this kind cf insurance. It is said that this is
a young country full cf possibilities and with
unlirnited natural resources and that we should
be slow te enter upon this field. I rnay sayperhaps I arn but repeating myself- that I
read a report cf an inquiry made by twe social
workers cf note in the United States. They
spent twc years in Pittsburgh and olsowhere
and, clad in everalîs, they kept in close contact with workrnen from mernîng till night
and frcrn nigbt tili merning, labourod alongsido them. lived with them, convened with
tbem at meals and over their pipes in the
evening. They found that the men's conversgation bore constantly on the fear cf
unempicyment. The men felt unoasy and
unhappy, rernernbering what had taken place
in the last ten years, at tbe prospect that
there might ha another period cf unomployment. These workmen, rnany cf them married
and with families dependent upon them, were
earning only sufficient for maintenance and had
ne spare cash even te make provision for sickness or death. Their conversation reverted
constantly to tbe nigbtmare cf unempîcymont,
te the possibility that next day there rnight
be a suspension cf work and they and their
families might be destitute. Gradually I have
corne te realize that if we are aIl in search cf
happiness on this earth working mon are ontitled te protection against the spectre cf unempîcyment. I feol that, if only in his ewn
interest, the employer wbc in normal times
needs a working staff cf one hundred men, and
perhaps more during peak periods, should net
dismiss fifty or sevonty-five cf those men
just as peremptorily ns he might shut down
a machine; that ho must treat tbom as buman
beings. Consequently the duty dovolves upon
hirn cf assisting those mon when they are unemployed. This is cne cf the roasons why I

186

SENATE

have always felt there should be some kind
of unemployment insurance, contributed to
by the employer, the employee and the State.
The millions of our labouring men are entitled to what I should call contentment and
peace of mind by being assured they shall not
be thrown out on the sidewalk and discardced
as if they were a mere piece of worn-out
machinery.
I agree with the statement made by the
Prime Minister whein on the 2nd of January
be made his first address on the air, that this
social legislation would come better in a time
of prosperity, because then labour is normally
employed and can subscribe to an unemployment insurance fund, and, as he emphasized, the Treasury is aso better able to
stand the strain. But though I realize, as
dees every sane man, that such liegislation
might better be enacted in normal times, I
sqpport the BiHl because it embodies the
principle of unemployment insurance.
The sole question in my mind is whether
this Parliament is competent to enaet such
legislation. I have stated what I deem to
be an important funiction of this Ohamber.
I think it is but just that the Senate hould
go on record as to what may be our constitutional restrictions; in other words, what is
the division of jurisdiction between the
provinces and the Dominion. I agree with
the right honourable gentleman that uniformity in social legislation is very much
to be desired. But, that having been said,
what is the power of the Federal Parliam ent
to enact this proposed legislation? To-day I
have made this affirmation, and my right
honourable friend will not deny it, that at
one time there was unanimity of opinion in
both Houses in favour of pro'vincial jurisdfiction in social legislation. So my right honourable friend must not be surprised if I wonder
what are the reasons which have brought about
a change of opinion on this most important
subject.
Now, I desire to test some of the reasons
that have been given for a change of view.
My right honourable friend did not mince
matters when a few weeks ago, on looking
at the statements which I cited from the
declaration of his own policy of 1920, be
stated that fe tad to admit that he had
been wrong. He went even further and said
the Supreme Court was wrong. This should
perhaps cause everyone to hesitate a little
before asserting that he is right. One may
have been wrong yesterday and be right today, or one may have been right yesterday
and be wrong to-day. My right honourable
friend says the Privy Council will decide.
It is because I see the difficulty facing us
Hon. Mr. DANDURANT.

that I intend to discuss briefly the arguments
advanced in support of the situation as we
now have it.
My rigbt bonourable friend has spoken of
section 132 of the British North America
Act. and tas rested his case, in part, on tlhe
application of that Act. I should like to read
clause 132:
The Parliament and Governmnent of Canada
sh.all have all powers necessary or proper for
performing the obligations of Canada or any
province thereof, as part of the British Em.pire
towards foreign countries, arising under treaties
between the Empire and such foreign countries.
That clause was enacted in 1867. What
at that time was a treaty between the Empire
and a foireign country? Allusion is made to
that, and that alone.
At that time the
British Empire could be held to be comprised
of the possessions over wlhieh the British
flag flew. Treaties were then made by the
King. They were not submitted to the
British Parliament, much les to the legislaturcs of the other parts of the British Empire.
I recall, however, and my right honourable
iriend also wihi recald, that in the case of
the Treaty of Versailles the. British ministers
of the Crown stated in a politic way that
tie treaty was of such importance that there
àhould be deviation from the general rule
and Parliament should be asked to sanction
it. Prior to that time a treaty made by Ris
Majesty the King bound Great Britain and
t-he rest of the British Empire. The British
Empire was represented by the supreme
authority of the King, and by his Parlianent
whenever that Parliament acted. There waa
then a much larger British Empire than
there is to-day. It inchlded, as I have said,
alf British possessions. even those wlhich had
legislatures, and the King, in signing treaties,
bound every Britisher throughout the w'orld.
That is why this clause 132 of the British
North America Act was passed.
The Treaty of Versailles is not a treaty of
the British Empire. If you turn to the first
page of that treaty you will see that the
British Empire appears there and is represented by British ministers in Tondon. They
were quite right in appearing and signing as
representatives of the British Empire, but
they did so as representatives of the Empire
as constituted at that time, which included
Great Britain and all the British possessions
not represented at Versailles or Paris. The
British Empire still has dependencies. But
Canada did not appear in Versailles as a dependency. It appeared as an autonomous
nation, and signed the treaty as such. The
ministers in London did not sign it for the
British Empire as including Canada, Australia,

MARCH 26, 1935
New Zealand, Ireland or South Africa. No,
they signed, and advised the King to sign, for
the British Empire as then constituted. Canada appeared by its own ministers, and signed
the treaty for itself.
No less an authority than Sir Robert
Borden, in his Canadian Constitutional
Studies, explains the gradual development of
Canada as an autonomous nation. He says:
A further development relates to the signature and ratification of the various treaties
concluded at the Conference. In view of the
new position secuîred, and of the part played
by the Dominion representatives at the peace
table, it was considered that the treaty shouid
be signed by Dominion plenipotentiaries, and
should be submitted for approval to the
Dominion Parliaments. Accordingly the Prime
Minister of Canada proposed that the assent
of the King as High Contraeting Party to the
various treaties should, in respect of the
Dominions, be expressed by -the signature of
Dominion plenipotentiaries, 'and that the preamble and other formal parts of the treaties
should be drafted accordingly. This proposai,
having been -adopted in the form cf a memorandum by all the Dominion Prime Ministers,
at a meeting summoned by the Prime Minister
of Canada, was put forward and accepted. It
involved the issuance by the King as High
Contracting Party, of "Full Powers" to the
Dominion delegates; and in order that those
issued to the Canadian plenipotentiaries might
be based upon formal action of the Canadian
Government, an Order in Couneil conferring
authority for that purpose was passed on
April 10, 1919. The new status of the Dominion
is manifested again in the constitution of the
League of Nations.
I am citing from pages 118, 119 and 120.
In its final form, as amendedi and incorporated
in the Treaty of Peace with Germany, the
Covenant fully recognizes the statue of the
Dominions. As signatories of the Treaty they
became menibers of the League, and their
position as to membership and representation
in the Assenibly is in all respects the same as
that of other signatory members.
So, with al1 due modesty, while recognizing
the -right of my right honourable friend to
take a contrary view, I say there was no
signature of the treaty by the King as representing the British Empire including the
Dominions.
The British Empire is represented at the
League of Nations by the London ministers,
and when the roll is called its representative
walks up to the rostrum and deposits the
Empire's votes in the urn. The Dominions
also are called. Sometimes surprise is expressed that the British Empire does not
include the Dominions. But as an autonomous and free country we are on an equality
with the British Empire, and in regard to
expressing an opinion our ministers are on
an absolute equality with the ministers from
London.

187

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Does the honourable gentleman argue that section 132 of
the British North America Act no longer
has any effect or application as a result of
these developments?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Yes, because
the British Empire as constituted in 1867
cannot speak for us to-day, and cannot bind
us. The British Empire to-day is composed
of Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the
other British possessions that are not under
autonomous rule and have not gained absolute equality under the resolution of 1926
and the Statute of Westminster.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: So the change
that came about at the time of the Versailles
Treaty was not based on any legislative enactment of this Parliament or the Parliament of
Great Britain, but simply emerged out of the
powers expressed or implied in the constitution, such as it was at that time. There was
no legislative enactment. The power cf the
British Empire to cease to exist, and of Canada to emerge, had been there, but had been
unexercised. Is that the argument?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is, I find, the
argument of those who speak of this constitutional evolution. Canada went to Versailles
by authority cf an Order in Council of its
own Government, and under a delegation of
power from His Majesty the King. His
Majesty the King signed the Treaty of Versailles, but only after this Parliament had
decided to adopt that treaty. Canada, and
all the other Dominions that agreed, were
bound; and we were bound of our own volition
through the action of this Parliament.
The second argument that is raised in
favour of a change of view in regard to the
field of social legislation is this. My right
honourable friend has just alluded to it. If
Canada signed the treaty of her own volition
and through her own power, she is bound
directly by ber signature. I repeat what I
said a few weeks ago, that 'Canada signed and
bound herself, but subject to her constitutional powers, which were recognized in the
Treaty of Versailles. One cannot take one
clause of the treaty and say, "See what it
says," without being met with the answer,
"Look at the next clause and see what it
says." When one does that, one finds that
the duty of the federal state is simply to
transfer the obligation to the proper authority. And who were responsible for this
clause being put into the treaty? The United
States of America. The United -States were
represented, and when it came to assuming
obligations they said, "But we have our limit-

188

SENATE

ations--we have our states." and they insisted upon the insertion of this clause. This
caused no small worry Vo the draftsmen, for
they had to devise a clause which would not
except the United States from the obligation
of bettering the condition of labour by accepting the principles contained in what I call
"the Magna Charta of labour." The draftsmen found a formula, which at all points
meets the constitution of Canada. When we.
signed as an autonomous nation we signed
as what we were, and we did not hide the
fact. The United States insisted upon a.
statement as to the difference between a
federal state and an autonomous state.
There was no pretence at that time of altering our constitution. Nobody thought of it.
My rigit honourable friend was the first
to implement the obligation by Order in
Council. He declared that when he received
the convention and transferred it to the
provinces his obligation was ended.
The third argument that has been advanced
is a most extraordinary one. We are told
that the provinces can raise money by direct
taxes, but that they cannot pass this legislation, because it imposes a tax on the Dominion treasury. I have no less an authority
for that statement than the Right Hon. the
Prime Minister himself. He says that it is not
necessary to discuss at length the assertion that
the employer is called upon to pay, the
employee is called upon to pay, and the Dominion treasury, under its national legislation.
is called upon to pay, and that as the provinces cannot impose a tax upon the Dominion
treasury we are the only power vested with
that authority.
When the matter is presented in that form
there is no doubt the provinces cannot levy a
tax on the federal treasury. But they can provide themselves with funds from their own
treasuries and from their own direct taxation.
Here, word for word, is the Prime Minister's statement to which I have alluded:
If it is a national measure there is only one
power that can divert ioneys froi the treasury
of Canada for the purpose of unemploynent
insurance.
This is begging the question. Undoubtedly
the provinces cannot order the payment of
money from the federal treasury, but every
province has its own treasury. There are
provincial Old Age Pension Acts, and in
making payments under these the provinces
do not impinge upon the federal authority.
Thougi we should prefer national legislation,
the fact that ve pass laws here does net make
them valid. As my right honourable friend
has sa.id. the Privy Council will pass upon the
validity of this measure. The Dairy Products
Hou. M\r. DANDURAND.

Sale Adjustment tax of British Columbia,
which has been referred to elsewhere, though
not by my right honourable friend, was declared invalid because it was an indirect tax.
The provinces have the right to levy direct
taxation.
Another argument often heard, and one to
which my right honourable friend has given
expression in this Chamber, is that the provinces cannot interfere with interprovincial
trade. That is the general principle, I admit,
but let us test the application. Any provincial unemployment insurance, it is contended, would affect interprovincial trade and
consequently be illegal. I say the conclusion
is false. What if all the provinces passed
identical statutes on this subject?
There
would then be uniform law throughout the
whole country, and the provinces would be
within their jurisdiction in passing it. Even
if the statutes were different, I contend that
such legislation would still be intra vires of
the provinces. There are in the different
provinces very many and widely diverse conditions which may indirectly affect interprovincial trade. Municipal taxation, for instance. may create considerable diversity in the
load that the manufacturer is carrying. Also
the geographical situation alters conditions.
The provinces by the sea have certain advantages with respect te transportation, while the
land-locked provinces suffer disadvantages.
Large agglomerations such as are found in
some provinces offer to manufacturers desirable fields which they cannot find elsewhere.
A sparse population suffers because of its very
sparseness. Within the last few days there
was proposed in the Legislature of Quebee a
resolution protesting against a tax imposed by
the city of Ottawa, on the authority of the
province of Ontario, on the ground that it was
a business levy on non-residents of this province. Tha argument that the provinces cannot interfere with interprovincial trade is
quite a specious one, but il does net alter the
constitution. There may be a difference in the
unemployment insurance policies of the
varions provinces. But there is no denying
the right of the provinces to deal with matters
affecting civil right.s. contracts and property.
Another specious argument, one advanced
by my right honourable friend. is that the
Dominion is bound by certain principles governing labour in the Treaty of Versailles; that
labour conditions may affect international
trade, and that as the provinces cannot legislate with respect te international trade the
Dominion has sole jurisdiction in such legislation as this. I contend that the whole
a-rgumrent is basles, for the Treaty of Versailles recognizes our limitations as a federal

MARCH 26, 1935
state. As I have aircady said, if was tlie
Unit-ed States which asked for recognition of
sucli limitations.
My riglif lonourable friend dlaims fliat our

Parliament to enacf this legisiation. I have
tried, but in vain, to visualize the extent f0
which flie Dominion miglit go in invading provincial righfs on flic ground of its jurisdiction
in trade and commerce. Tbe expression "trade
and commerce" might be made f0 cover al
property and civil righfs in justification of any
measure similar to this.
The Riglit Hun. the Prime Minieter lias
eften dilated upon tlie uncertainties of judi.cil interpret-ation, and the Secretary of State
has done likewigc. I Vhink, ýtoo, that I could
find stafements by the riglit lionouralile leader
of this flouse to tlic same effeet. Our insurance legisiation, whicli we tliought came wifliin our ýown powers, lias so often been upset
that 1 think one sliould hesitate before empliatically declaring tlie present rneasure to
be within our jurisdiotion. Would it not be
elemcntary prudence to bave a reference on
this question f0 the Supreme Court of Canada? Witbintfle last twelve montbs tlie Govtrament of my rigif lionourable friend lias
re-ferred to tha-t tribunal no fcwer than tliree
questions, ail respecting matters of less imaportance than this one. Those questions concerned the Companies' Creditors Arrangement

Act, and thie powers of the Tarif! Board.
I would draw tlie attention of lionourable
members ýto thle fact that flie staff f0 be organize-d under tliis legislation wiil number
at least 3,800 and flic yearly exipenditure will

Hon. LOUIS ýCOTE: Honourable senators,
mýay I ýbe permit'ted to say a few wordis about
the question under discussion, not in an endeavour to enligliten ftle Flouse, 'but f0 explain as briefly as 1 can the vote whicli I shall
give in support of the Bill? 1 too have for
the Constitution a great reverence, whicli is
at least flot surpasscd by, if it is flot greater
than, that held by other ho-nourable members.
I do not see defects in that Constitution to
the same extent as ofliers may. The Britishi
Northi America Act is often criticized because
it is a wvritten Constitution and consequently,
so it is claimed, not clastie. But I suimit
that if anyonc looks at it in the liglit not
only of the printed words, but also of history,
lie finds that its provisions are a grent deal
more elast-ic -than lie ýpreviotsly was inclined
to believe.
Personally I have alway-s looked upon the
Britishi North America A-et as a charter under
which minority riglits are protected, wiûbout
any doubt as to interpretation or in other
respects. The sections dealing witli minority
riýghts are separate and distinct fro-m other
sections; and flire tliey stand, I think, neyer
to fail nor -to lose their usefulness by process
of interpretation, judicial or oflier. Then there
are sections 91 and 92 of the Act-tiey are
not before me at the moment-which define
the fields whcrein the Dominion and -the
provinces rcspectivcly may legislate. There
is no doulit tliat wlien fliese two sections, and
indeed the wliole Act, were drafted and passed
tlie intention was to give to tlic Dominion
Governrnenf sucli powers as mniglif be necessarv in order to make central government
effective. 1 thinlc this view is very weil expressed hy Lord Sankey's judgmcnf in tlic
Aviation case. There was also a desire to conserve for thle provinces certain legislative
riglits, whicli are enumerated in section 92.
But over bofli sections 91 and 92 I sec an intention in the legislafion, and on tihe part of
those who put it tlirougli, fo clothe thie central Government witli sufficient aufliority to,
carry on good govcrnment in an effective and
continuons inanner.
Forgetting for flic moment the question
of section 132 and whether we are obliged to
pass this legislation in order to give effeet
to freafy obligations incurrcd by us as a part
of the Britisli Empire or as a separaf c nation,
and forgetting even the question of trade

subject as interpreted by decisions of the
Privy Council is very much narrower than

not find there ample authority to justify the

that for the last five years Ottawa has been
the Mecca of all the provincial premiers and
their colleagues. They have been rapping at
the door of the federal treasury asking for
relief loans and assistance, every one of them
realizing that the problem has got beyond
their ability to deal with it. As a result we
have made disbursements out of the federal
treasury to the extent of hundreds of millions
of dollars. Who to-day would argue that this
is a municipal or a provincial problem? Who
would dare say that it has not become a
matter of national interest and national dimensions, so as to bring it within the legislative power of the central authority?
I could go further and say that it is a
matter of international importance. That
point has been very ably dealt with by the
right honourable leader of the House. Even
if we were not bound by the labour convention, the fact remains that all the nations of
the world, assembled around a peace table,
have unanimously accepted the view that the
question of the fair treatment of labour has
assumed such importance that failure to deal
with it in a proper way would disturb or
threaten the peace of individual nations
throughout the world. If this measure, after
enactment, is tested before the Privy Council,
would it be possible to summon better evidence of the international nature of the
problem than the unanimous voice of all the
nations of the world, expressed in such emphatic and clear terms in the peace treaty?
It is, as I say, a question of international importance.
Having these facts in mind, how can we for
a moment doubt what the judgment of the
Privy Council would be? Can we have any
doubt sufficient to induce us to postpone the
passing of this Bill in order to obtain a decision by the Supreme Court of Canada, not on
the legislation itself, but on the principle of
the legislation? Personally, I have not the
slightest doubt as to the powers of the Parliament of Canada to pass this legislation. I will
be candid and say that if I thought that by
voting for this measure I should be violating
the constitution of my country, I would do
myself the honour of voting against it. But
those doubts I do not entertain to the slightest
extent, and for this reason I shall vote for
the Bill.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
members, I think it might be somewhat unfortunate if on an important question of this
kind only members of the legal profession
should diseuss the Bill pro and con. To-day
we are considering just one piece of social
legislation, intended presumably for the

191

benefit of the ordinary citizen of Canada. The
question naturally arises, what are our obligations in connection therewith? I find that on
June 28, 1919, Canada, over the signatures of
its representatives, agreed with the other nations of the world, parties to the Treaty of
Versailles, to endeavour to secure and maintain fair and humane conditions of labour for
men, women and children. That is ahnost
sixteen years ago, and Canada in the meantime bas done virtually nothing concrete and
definite. The old-time game of "ipassing the
buck" has been played between the Dominion
and the provinces, the provinces taking the
position that they have full jurisdiction in
this matter, but most of them making no
move whatever to assert their rights and implement their obligations. By article 427 of
the treaty Canada agreed "that the well-being,
physical, moral and intellectual, of industrial
wage-earners is of supreme international importance." Yet, as Canada, she has, one might
say, done less than nothing to discharge the
obligations assumed on June 28, 1919.
I am one of the citizens of Canada who
have been converted from the belief that
what certain distinguished, upright, honourable and learned gentlemen on both sides
of politics told me was the truth. As will
be found on reference to the Senate Hansard
of February 6, 1933, I am one of those who
took the position that the Parliament of
Canada had no jurisdiction whatever over
matters of this kind. Why? Not because
of any legal knowledge that I personally had,
but because distinguished and honourable and
learned gentlemen in both political parties
and in all our governments that I knew
anything about had repeatedly taken the
position that, by reason of the rights conceded and guaranteed to the provinces by
the British North America Act, the Dominion
had no power to interfere in respect to an
eight-hour day, unemployment insurance,
minimum wages, and many other things that
were never dreamed of when section 92 was
written into our Constitution. We were told
repeatedly that the Federal Government could
not be a party to changing the existing conditions; that we simply had to mark time
until the provinces-presumably all-made a
move in the direction necessary to secure
and maintain fair and humane conditions of
labour. Before that was done by the provinces Canada, we were told, could not implement those treaty promises.
As I say, I have been converted. I have
become more than ever convinced that either
all men are liars, or, more charitably, all
men are mistaken. True, there have been

1W2

SENATE

some changes in the legal views recently
expressed with regard to the constitutional
powers of the Parliament of Canada. But
after reading carefully every word of the
discussion in another place by high-class
gentlemen, both legal and other, and after
listening to the present discussion, my personal judgment is that for many years past
it has been a case of the selfishness of human
nature determining the rights to be conceded
to the ordinary, poorer classes of Canadian
citizenship. I mean money controls all things,
and in my judgment wealthy individuals in
years gone by were in a position to make
known their views and back them up as far
as necessary, to the detriment of the unemployed and unfortunate citizen.
In my
opinion they are responsible for this general
understanding that for many years was promulgated throughout the length and breadth
of Canada, to the disadvantage of the ordinary citizen, an understanding which implied
that the Dominion had no jurisdiction over
many of these things, but they were solely
under the control of the provinces.
I have never participated in a revolution
and I do not believe I ever shall, nor do I
think that Canadians now or in the future
will give serious thoughit to such extreme
action. But it does not do us any harm
sometimes to look back into history and learn
the views of those who have gone before us.
One of the best and most informative speeches
that I ever heard was in reference to a
Britisher who died many years ago. And so
I think it would not be amiss to-day to quote
the views of a distinguished member of this
House delivered on February 6, 1933. He
was discussing net an eight-hour day, but a
proposal to adopt a six-hour day. Having
regard to the necessities of our times and
what should be our obligations, he was more
up-to-date than many of us are right at this
minute.
I refer to the late distinguished
senator from Acadie, the Hon. Pascal Poirier.
Dealing with the Imperial Conference that
had been held a little while before, he said:

And what will

Reieiber wha.t happened in France during
the Revolution of 1793. Look at what happened
in Portugal not so long ago. Look at what is
happening to-day in Russia. in Spain, in Mexico.
The Czar of all the Russias, the grandees of
Spain and Portugal. the clergy of Mexico, once
all-powerful, were scattered like dry leaves in
a hurricane wxhen the people rose in anger.
Ail that may be true, but are we, the governing class in denrocratic Canada, not in a
position to quell insurrections? No, ny friends,
wxeare not, if lines are drawn and sides taken.
Since the granting of manhood and woianhood
suffrage, the miajority governs. as it did before,
but the axis of the niajority has shifted. There
is even no necessity of a revolution in Canada
to put the administration down and out. It

of public peace, as insurgents. as undesirables;
and, if they deer it necessary for the preservation of order and good' g.ovecirnent, they may
confiscate our properties and show us tihe road
to exile. Such things have hapened elsewiere
and are actually happening.
Nothing like this is likely to occur in Canada,

no grievous charge to lay against their emrpleyers; they were never oppressed nor wronged

But let disvonftent grow, let the nuniber of unemrployed increase to dangerous proportions, let
a crisis come, and no one can tell what nay

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: May I ask 'the

ionourable gentleman a question?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Would the honourable gentleman tell us what was the fate of
that resolution?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That is a very apt
question. Your humble servant took the position that the six-hour day was something to
be greatly desired, but, having listened to
wiat wa.s said by honourable members on
both sides of the House, he accepted the
view expressed by them. Now I do not believe a single word of it. I think that in the
years gone by there bas been nothing but
bluff and fourflushing on the part of certain
people in Canada who desired to keep the
workers from getting their just dues. That
is the answer to the question.
Now let me procceed a littie further and
refer to some of this social legislation. On
the

20th

of

February

my

very

highly

re-

spected friend the honourable senator from
Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Lemicux) spoke on
one of these sorial questions. I value his

MARCH 26, 1935
judgment and experience greatly, but listen
to what he says.
I wonder whether my right honourable friend
realizes that when those social reforms have
been in operation a very short time we shall
have about 25 per cent of the population maintaining the other 75 per cent.
Well, if 25 per cent of the population have
cornered all the wealth of Canada, may I ask
kind Providence who should take care of the
other 75 per cent? Holy Writ, as I recall it,
says, "The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness therof." 1i have been brought up to believe that every human being has a right to
live and, within reason, to secure the wherewithal to preserve life. If we have come, or
are coming, to such an unfortunate pass that
25 per cent of the people of Canada have to
take care ad the other 75 per cent, who is to
blame? Is it not possibly the fault of that
capitalistic system which we heard assailed
by a distinguished gentleman not long since,
a system which has enabled some to benefit,
perhaps too much, at the expense of their
fellows?
The other day we heard about the further
inroads that were to be made upon those who
are able to pay. To my mind we have not
gone nearly far enough in that direction. It
is now proposed that a person who receives a
million should "cough up" $100,000. Presumably he would be left $900,000 to live on.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Every twelve
months.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Every twelve
months. At the same time thousands of aged
citizens of this Canada of ours, under our old
age pensions are required to live on-what?
Hon. Mr. HARDY: May I interrupt the
honourable gentleman? The $100,000 which
the honourable gentleman speaks of is in addition to $500,000 which already has been paid.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I have no doubt
about that.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: That is of some importance.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: How would
anyone have $900,000 left from a million alter
paying out $600,000?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: If you will look
at the schedule that has been laid before us,
I think you will find that the figures I am
quoting are correct.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That there is an
assessment of 10 per cent on earnings of from
$500,000 to $1,000,000.
92584-13

193

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: $600,000.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is an
extra assessment.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: All right, an extra
assessment, after the ordinary assessment. The
question I ask is: Why not? I was talking this
morning to a very distinguished agd capable
gentleman who, I think, understands finance.
He intimated that if a proper percentage were
taken from those who are able to pay, the debt
of the Dominion of Canada wouild be wiped
out entirely. I do nat know whether that is
so or not.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is not.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: But the point I
want to make is that it is almost time that
members on both sides of this Senate unite
to do something that Canada obligated herself
to do sixteen years ago, and discontinue "passing the buck " to others, in many cases hoping
that nothing will be done.
In the remarks I read from the speech of
our late lamented friend Senator Poirier there
are some statements to which I do not subscribe. I read those remarks because I wanted
to indicate what one member on the other
side of the House deemed it necessary to say
on this question of social insurance more than
two years ago.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Will my honourable
friend allow me to insist upon an answer to
my question? I asked whether he would
willingly tell us what was the fate of that
resolution.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The resolution died.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Absolutely.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Yes.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: It was not worth
while considering in those days.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: It was impossible,
logically, to consider it. In the first place,
Canada was obligated at that time, as she is
to-day, to give effect to an eight-hour day. If
Canada had undertaken to adopt a six-hour
day she would have been ahead of all the
other members of the League of Nations. Such
action wouild have been simply silly then;
and it would be silly now, even though a sixhour day would be more consistent and logical
at the present time than an eight-hour day.
But even if we put into effect a six-hour day,
it would not take up all the slack, or provide
work for all who are looking for employment.
We shall be doing a pretty good job of work
if we stick to our knitting and undertake to
put into effect the eight-hour day, which our
representatives agreed to sixteen years ago.

MARCH 26, 1935
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: This year. I think
the Gazette is one of the very best papers in
Canada. If there is a better one, tell me the
name of it and 'I will read it. The dispatch
says:
Mr. Taschereau, after briefly mentioning the
Bill, referred to the fact that last year the
Rt. Hon. Arthur Meighen had introduced a Bill
in the Senate, which Quebec could not accept in
view of its defined rights under the Privy
Council judgments.
That word is in the plural; so there was more
than one judgment.
He said he had no objection to another interprovincial conference in the matter.
The question was whether Quebec laws, based
on French custom and legislation-la coutume de Paris-for laws, after all,
are customs reduced to writing-were to be taken away bit by bit, and finally
disappear. As matters were, Ottawa had proceeded to take control in insurance matters, and
the Privy Council had on two occasions made
it clear that the provinces rule in civil matters,
that is, as regards contracts.
I ask hon.ourable members of this House
if there is any better contract than an insurance policy, whether it is for life or for
a -determined time. You have a contract with
an insurance company. Is that not a matter
under provincial jurisdiction? Has that not
to do with civil rights?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
does not seem to thinik so.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
take care of himself.

Mr. Hepburn

Mr. Hepburn can

And

of a

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The dispatch goes
on:
It was much the saine case as regards company law. Ottawa every day sought to get
control in this matter.
"Now, there is the matter of hours of labour,
an eight-hour day, and labour conditions," the
Premier went on. "These things are matters
of civil rightThat is what he says, but there are people, who
have never studied law, who say be is not
right.
-since they involve contracts between employers
and employees, and they should be entirely
governed by provincial laws, and yet we find
that Ottawa bas invoked the Versailles Treaty
in the matter, and there is now legislation
passed to say how many hours a person shall
work, and what his minimum shall be. Yet.
in this province we have minimum wages
arranged under legislation of last year, and we
have a minimum wage commission as regards
wages of female employees. What will happen
later on if Ottawa and the provinces have
contradictory legislation in the same matter?
92584-131

195

If one authority says eight hours and another
authority says seven hours, which will be
correct?"
The Premier said that there was to have
been an interprovincial conference in the
matter of hours of work, of minimum wages,
and some other matters, and then the conference was abandoned. Was Quebec to abandon
its constitutional rights as regards hours of
labour and rates of wages? The interprovincial
conference had been cancelled, and now the
Federal Parliament had gone ahead and legislated in the matters which were to have been
discussed at the proposed conference.
Premier Taschereau said he had no objection to throwing out the idea that another
conference on insurance matters should be
called.
I thought that the opinion of the Prime
Minister of Quebec might be of interest to
this House. He certainly is a man of long
experience in legislative matters. If a reference to the Supreme Court has to be made
on this legislation, why not go ahead with it
as soon as possible? It does not cost the
Government much to get the opinion of that
court. But imagine the damage that will be
done if this Bill is passed and after large
numbers of people are insured it is found ont
that we had no power to pass the measure at
all! There would be no end of trouble. So
I say we should make sure, we should look
where we are going to land, before we jump.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: In other words,
look for another sixteen years.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, the debate up to the present moment
has been instructive, and perhaps somewhat
diverting. Some contributions to it have
made anything in the way of a lengthy reply
on my part unnecessary. I want to compliment particularly the honourable senator from
Ottawa East (Hon. Mr. Coté). I think that
during his whole presentation be did not depart by a hairbreadth from the direct line of
matters relevant to the issue.
Honourable members opposite say: "Do not
take any chances in building up an organization. We dispute the constitutionality of
this legislation, and Mr. Taschereau disputes
it. So the thing to do is to refer it to the courts
and wait till they have rendered a decision."
I am not leading a political party, but if 1
were I should not want my opponent to be
in any more vulnerable situation than one
is when taking that ground. We could not
get a judgment of the Privy Council, which
would be the only decision worth while, for
some months, probably a year, and more
likely two years. This seemingly innocent
suggestion to ditch the legislation until we
get a finding by the Privy Council, to arrest
all progress and do nothing until then, in effect

196

SENATE

means to abandon it for a serious length of
time, during which there would be immense
loss in this country and we should be chargeable with dereliction in the discharge of our
obligation. The usual course of a Government which is confident of its constitutional
position is to go ahead, and to take the consequences later if its position is attacked. We
do not run away because someone has a
different view; we adhere to our ground and
take full responsibility for our course. That
is our position now.
I do not find that I have any important
differences with the honourable senator from
Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) as to what
our duty is, nor as to some of bis views
which in earlier times I might have thought
rather extreme. I believe it would be fait
to say there is greater need of a six-hour
day at ihis time than there was of an eightheur day when the Treaty of Versailles was
signed. Economie pressure has brought us
to the stage where available labour would
not be absorbed even if the working day
were rcduced to six hours.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
cows be milked?

When would the

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There would
still be idle men even if we had such a
short working day. However, the question
before us bas te do, not with this point,
but with our constitutional powers. I differ
with the honourable senator from Parkdale
in that I would not support nor vote for
this
unless I were convinced we were
within our powers in passing it. I think
no member of either House is justified in
voting for a measure unless he feels Parliament will be within its rights in enacting
it. I do believe tha.t Parliament has the
power te pass the present measure, and I
support it.
But my main difference with the honourable gentleman is on another ground. Because
other people hold views at variance with
mine, or advocate with respect 'to social
problems a certain course which to me seems
unwise, I cannot feel that they are necessarily actuated by
some greedy, sinister
design, nor that they are allied with hostile
interests and are not just as good citizens
as I am. If I were to define what in my
judgment is the greatest need of the hour,
not only in this country, but throughout the
world, it would be that we restore for a
period of time something of trust in one
another.

Some Hon. SENATORS:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We are continually investigating the other fellow's
success. His methods and practices have been
continually probed for the purpose of finding
something wrong, until the whole fabric of
society bas been weakened and progress paralysed in this as well as other nations. The
United States are in semi-chaos because, while
endeavouring by one plunge into the unknown
to renovate business and industry, they are
rendering it impossible for the forces of business and industry to make any progress at
allHon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIE'N: -by continually thwarting them in every direction they
move, and by scattering abroad the thouglht
that everybody who succeeds is an enemy
of the State and must have achieved his
success by dishonest means.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Anybody who pays
wages is an enemy.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is truc I
bad a different view of this matter fourteen
or fifteen years ago from what I have to-day.
I was just as honest in my opinion then as I
am now. I had not been as thorough in iny
study; it had been impossible for me to be so.
In a Government one naturally subordinates
one's view on matters affecting an individual
department, and especially the Department of
Justice, to that of the law officers of the
Crown. Their judgment as te the duty of
Canada by virtue of the convention of the
Labour Office was that, being a federal state,
we should submit the convention to the provinces. I do not know that it was my duty as
a lawyer to seek to delve into the inner principles to see if I could net find some way b
which the duty and power of this country
could be established as a federal duty and
power. Perhaps it was an obligation on my
part. If it was, I did net discharge it. I
came to the conclusion I did then just as
honestly as I do now. I accepted the conclusion of the Justice Department. On its
face it seemed a reasonable and just deduction
from the premises. Nor do I think that the
honourable senator opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) or Mr. Taschereau is any less honest
in his opinion than I am. But as respects
Mr. Taschereau, I do humbly submit that perhaps he has not given his best attention to
this subject; that perhaps he has not studied
it as a lawyer upon whom there is a great
responsibility should study it.
I doubt
whether he has the time to do so. I venture
to suggest that if he does, he will come to a
conclusion not very far from that upon which
we stand now.

MARCH 26, 1935
Who can imagine the Privy Council, which
decided that the questions involved in the

Liquor and the Newsprint cases were of
such Canadian importance and Canadian
dimensions as to bring them within the
residuary clause of section 91 and enable the
Dominion to legislate on them, even though
they were, as matters of civil rights, named
specifically in section 92-who, I ask, can
imagine the Privy Council, which decided that
those subjects were of such magnitude, would
ever for a moment consider that the subjects
with which we are dealing in this Bill are of
lesser consequence and lesser dimensions? It
is impossible to conceive it. I think a very
good argument could be made out for the
view that in those two cases the Privy Council
was very close to, if indeed not beyond, the
line, in coming to the conclusion that merely
because the questions at issue had become of
considerable importance they could be made
part of the residuary powers of the Dominion
under section 91. But here is something
recognized in a solemn treaty as not only of
national but of international and far-reaching consequence, something which Canada
deemed it ber duty to commit herseif to
directly perform. Who can conceive of the
Privy Council saying, "Why. no, that does
not make it of such Canadian sweep and
Canadian dimensions that it becomes part of

imagine that, having held that in matters of
radio. though we had not as part of the
British Empire made any treaty at all, and
therefore could net come under section 132,
nevertheless we had power by virtue of the
residuary clause of section 91, the Privy
Council will now hold that we are not in
the saine position with respect to the eighthour day and unemployment insurance? It
is impossible to conceive, and particularly
when one contemplates what would be the
result. Should such be the decision of the Privy
Council, then the next step Canada must take,
if it is any longer to rest in the consciousness
that it is a nation, is to see to the amendment of the British North America Act. It will
be an admission that this Constitution which
we have revered for many years makes it impossible for the Dominion to assert itself as
a nation at all; that it is going to be for ever
shackled and subject to the individual whims
of the nine provinces. The prospect is in-conceivable; the consequences are too terrible;
and therefore it seems to me that anyone
could argue this matter with supreme confidence before the highest tribunal of the
land.
I did not perhaps quite get the significance
of the argument of the honourable senator

opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) with relation
to the Treaty of Versailles. If I caught it
correctly he said, addressing himself to me:
"You rest yourself on section 132, which gives
to the Dominion of Canada, as such, powers
to implement and fulfil any treaty obligations
resting upon the Empire, and upon Canada
as part of the Empire."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
by the British Empire.

A treaty made

Right Hon. Mr. MEIIGHEN: A treaty
made by the British Empire. "But," he said,
"you cannot utilize that in the present case,
because the Treaty of Versailles was not made
by the British Empire; it was made by Canada separately, just in the sane sense in which
Canada executed the Radio agreement."
Now, suppose the honourable senator is
right, does it advance his case one iota? I
do not think he is right at all; I think he is
demonstrably wrong. But assuming he is
right, that Canada signed the Treaty of Versailles as a separate, self-governing nation, just
as she signed the Radio Treaty, then we come
within the Radio decision.
But we signed
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
it as a federal state.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We signed
the Radio Treaty as a federal state. Certainly we did, and the Privy Council held
that because we had signed it, we had power
to execute it, as that would be ermbraced in

friend is not a particle ahead, even if he is
right as to the Treaty of Versailles. He only
brings himself definitely within the Radio case
instead of the Aviation case.
But the Radio
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
case in nine-tenths of its application was outside section 92 and would fall naturally under
the residuary powers.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, no. The
courts held in the Radio case, as was clearly
defined by the senator from Ottawa East
(Hon. Mr. Coté), that radio was of such onsequence that it rose to the stature of a Dominion matter. Therefore, although it did
conflict with section 92, it was a Dominion
power. The Privy Council said that, Canada
having executed the treaty, that of itself conferred Dominion stature, and consequently
the subject was the same as if it came within
an Empire treaty under section 132.
But my honourable friend is completely
wrong -in saying that Canada signed the
Treaty of Versailles in the capacity of a
separate nation. Canada did nothing of the
kind. Has the honourable gentleman the
Treaty of Versailles before him?

'us

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I had it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am sorry
he has not a copy before him now. J have a
copy of the treaty. It starts in this way:
"The United Sta-tes of America, The British
Empire, France, Italy and Japan," these powers being des'cribed as the Principal Allied and
Associated powers; then Belgium, Bolivia
Brazil, and a large number of other Powers
down to Uruguay, all these other Powers
"constituting with the Principal Powers mentioned above the Allied and Associated Powers." No Canada, no Australia, no India.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

That is right.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Then Germany. The treaty goes on to say that these
powers, bearing in nind the armistice. and
much clse, decided that the armistice should
be replaced by a firm, just and enduring
peace. For this purpose the high contracting
parties were represented as stated.
The
President of the United States was represented by five statesmen or officers. His
Majesty the King of the United Kingdom
of Great 'Britain and Ireland and of the
British dominions beyond the seas, Emperor
of India. was represented by five of the
ministers of the Crown of Great Britain; t'hen,
for the Dominion of Canada, by the lon.
Charles Joseph Doherty and the Hon. Arthur
Lewis Sifton. His Majesty the King, who
is the excecutive head of the British Empire,
signed here by five British statesmen, for
Canada by tvo Canadian statesmen, and for
Australia by two ot'hers. It is His Majesty
the King as executive head of the British
Empire who signs. Canada, Australia, and
other Dominions insisted that if he signed
as executive head of the British Empire, inclusive of Canada, his signature should be
attested byv two reprcsent-atives of the Dominion. They contended tihat nuembers of the
British Gov ernmcnt alone could no longer
do the signing. But the signature in its
form and meaning is for the British Empire,
because the British Empire appears as a
party to the treaty. Canada does not appear.
Australia does not appear. No other part
of the Empire appears. There is nothing
in the treaty in the way of mutual obligation
between Britain on the one hand and Canada or Australia on the other. It is wholly
different froin the League of Nations.
When we come to the League of Nations
we find that Canada is naned specifically
as a party to the covenants. as are Australia,
New Zealand, and India. Furthermore, each
of them signed separately. The covenants of
the League are covenants as between Britain
and Canada, Canada and Australia, Canada
Right Hon.

Mr. MEIGHtEN.

and New Zealand, Australia and Britain. anu
so forth. They are mutual covenants, biniing on each. It is very plain why that should
be so. It is just as important to us that
Great Britain should step into line with us
in the matter of heurs of labour as that Germany should do se.
But it is only in the League of Nations
that Canada signs as a self-governing power.
In the Treaty of Versailles she does net do so.
She is net naned as a party to the treaty. The
King is named as head -of the Empire and
his signature is attested by five representatives
of Great Britain and two fronm this country.
While I have thought well to put forward
this view, I want to say very frankly that
if the honourable senator opposite were right
and I were wrong, it would net b of the
least adivantage to him. Truc, if we come
under section 132 of the British North America Act, we are carrying out an obligation
made by the Empire; but if we do not, we
come within the obligation incurred by Canada, and are directly within the four corners
of the Radio decision. Hence, both those
footings of my honourable friend fall away.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
As a federal
state any social matters-Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It does net
say "social matters' at all, and it does not
say "in federal matters."
My honourable
friend's mind is on the section which refers
to the case of a federal state whose treatymaking powers are limited. What are our
powers to make a treaty? There is no limitation in the world governing us. How did
we maike our Radio Treaty if we had net the
power to make a treaty?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
We assumed
that in that field, which was unknown in
1867, we had aut'hority.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
We can
assume in any field. Will the honourable
gentleman tell me by what statute, Imperial
or Dominion, our powers to make a treaty
are limited?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Well, they are
limited in so far as our capacity to carry
them out is concerned, if they have to do
with matters falling under section 92.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
I am net
asking about that. Once we have decided
upon the power to make a treaty, we shall
argue about the power to carry it out. I
am asking the honourable gentleman to tell
me under what statute, Imperial or Dominion,
our powers to make a treaty on any subject
are limited.

SENATE
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The cost was
estimated in the other House on the basis of
the percentage cost in England. There the
percentage is 15. It is the view of the
Prime Minister, who bas given the closest
study to the purely insurance features of
tie Bill, that the cost will probably be more
in Canada. I do not know whether members
of the committee are going to agree with me
or n'ot, but I may say to my honourable
friend that I think the Bill can be vastly
improved along this line. A suggestion was
made by one of the Labour members-maybe
I am going further than I should-that the
alimost infinite right of appeal embodied in
the Bill is in the interest of neither one side
nor the other. The Englishman seems to
regard the right of appeal as the very essence
of his bcing, as something from which he
cannot be severed under any consideration;
but in this contry we do not so regard it.
The Workmen's Compensation Art of Ontario bas worked excellently. The judgments
of the tribunal are the judgments which count
and by which all must abide. It seems to
me that we eau simplify this Bill in committee by extricating it from these cumbersome appeal provisions and so reduce the
cost of operation. I see no reason why the
cost should net be reduced until it is away
below the percentage cost in England.
As to the number of employees, really I
am afraid I cannot give any information. It
will be considerable, no doubt. The 15 per
cent c.ost of administration is appalling
enough. but I am hopeful of our being able
to make amendm.enits which will reduce this
cost considerably.

CANADA'S NEXT GOVERNOR GENERAL
INQUIRY

ON

PRESS

ANNOUNCEMENT

Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Honourable senators, I should like to ask the right honourable
leader of this House if he can inform us as to
the accuracy of a news item to the effect
that Mr. John Buchan has received the appointment as next Governor General of Canada. The Ottawa Journal of this morning
carried a story headed "John Buchan for
Rideau Hall," and from the tenor of the
story it would seem to be true. The article
says that Mr. Mackenzie King has been consulted in the matter, and that it is scarcely
probable Mr. Bennett would take it upon
himself alone at this time to recommend Earl
Bessborough's successor. I think that is complimentary to the leader of the Liberal party.
However, that is merely an aside. But I
should like to know if the news is true.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I freely admit
that I ought to be in a position to give a
negative or an affirmative answer to the
question, and I apologize for my inability
to do so. The reason 'I cannot give the desired information is that I have been prevented by morning and afternoon activities
of the Senate from attending meetings of the
The question raised by the
Governement.
honourable senator will doubtless be referred
to in the other fHouse, if the news item is
correct. Should it b so referred to. I shall
make an announcement in this House later.
I should have liked to be able to give a
direct answer at once, as I ought to have
been in a position to do. All I can say now
is that if the iniformation should prove true,
I can commend the appointment on the
ground of Mr. Buchan's position in English
literature. He certainly has written some
very valuable and exceedingly interesting
books.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Hear, hear.

time that elapsed between their return to
Canada and their becoming members of the

principle is bad. Unless that information
is available I intend to vote against this
clause for the reasons which I have already
stated.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I «an give
the information which the honourable senator
desires. It is contained in the following comCanadian

I enclose the following papers for the use
of the Right Hon. Mr. Meighen:
(1) Copy of the R.C.M. Police Act, Chapter
160 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927.
(2) Copy of Chapter 8 of the 1934 Statutes.
(3) Copy of Chapter 40 of the 1934 Statutes.
With regard to sections 2 and 3 of the Bill.
The explanatory notes appear to be sufficient,
but it should be borne in mind that the paragraphs (e), (i) or (j) (of section 30) therein
referred to are those set forth ln section 30
as amended by section 8 of the 1934 Statutes.
See No. 2 of the above-mentioned enclosures.
Sections 4 and 5 of Bill No. 9 deal with
service with the military forces in South Africa.
In connection with ,this matter it should be
noted that by Chapter 19, assented to on the
7th May, 1900, all members of the force who
were on active service in South Africa with
the Canadian Volunteers are entitled to have
such active service count for pension purposes.
That is, those who were members of the force
at the time.
The intention of sections 4 and 5 is to allow
all South African service to count irrespective
of whether the present members of the force
concerned were actually in the police at the
time they enlisted for service in South Africa
or Dot.
At the outside, there are not more than four
commissioned officers and six other ranks who
will be affected, and as the South African War
was terminated over thirty years ago. no
recruits coming into the force will be eligible
for any of the benefits provided.
Cost.-It is not possible to arrive at anything
more than an approximate estimate of the cost,
as the actual ranks held and the pay of such
ranks in South Africa have not been officially
ascertained. Furthermore, it is not known at

amounting to a total of $863.80 per annuin, is
attached to this letter.
The computation is attached. The aggregate
in respect of four officers appears to be
$425.80 per annum, and in respect of six
constables $438 per annum.
That is the information which the honourable senator asked for.

202

SENATE
SENATE

202
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
It is scarcely the
information I asked for; in fact it is a long
way from it. What I wanted was definite
information as to when these men joined the
forces in South Africa, how long they were
there, what length of time elapsed after their
return to Canada before they joined the
Mounted Police, how long they have been
in the Mounted Police, what their ranks were
in South Africa, their pay, and the cost. But
a mere fraction of that information is given
in the memorandum which bas been read.
However, altogether apart from that-even
if we had the information, it would not go
to the root of the matter-there is a very
important principle involved. As I pointed
out the other day, two men join the forces
in South Africa as volunteers.
I say as
volunteers; that is important.
Those two
men return to Canada at exactly the same
time and both enter the service of the
Crown, one the Mounted Police and the other
the Civil Service. I say that if we adopt
this principle so far as the Mounted Police
are concerned, there is bound to be a demand
that the same principle be applied to the
man who goes into the Civil Service. The
mere fact that a man was in the South
African War and afterwards joined the
Mounted Police does not entitle him to any
better treatment that that received by the
man who was in the South African War and
afterwards joined the Civil Service.
Further, as I pointed ont. we mnst consider
the demand that will be made for the application of this principle to every man who served
in the Creat War and is at the present time
in the Civil Service. Such men number
tfhousands.
J intend to oppose the principle, because I

but to the fact that they served there. They
were equally meritorious, and were treated
alike. Let us say that a dozen, or two dozen,
South African veterans enlisted in the Mounted
Police and have served in that force ever
since.
They have had steady employment
and have been receiving pay ail these years.
It is true that they have served their country
well, but why should they be treated differently froni other South African veterans
who entered civil life on returning to this
country and have remained civilians. undoubtedly meeting with many difficulties in
the business of making a liv ing? Probably
some of those people have become unemuployed
by this timxe. It seems to me that the State
lias doue well by the veterans who joined
the Mounted Police, and I am unable to sec
any good reason why the years they served
in the South African War should be connted
for pension purposes on their retirement. If
we pass this section we shall be creating a
precedent, as pointed out by the honourable
gentlemxan from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder),
and this may be cited in support of many
other claims in the future. In view of our
present financial condition J doubt if this is
the time to open the door to such liberality
of treatment for South African veterans wlo
went into the Mounted Police.

Sonie Hon. SENATORS: No.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I think it refers
to a different matter. In 1919 or 1920 the
permanent force found itself overloaded with
senior non-commissioned and newly promoted
officers. as a result of the termination of the
War. There was a surplus of some 300 who
were quite unnecessary for the proper funetioning of the permanent force. So provision
ivas made, by a measure similar to what is
known as the Calder Act, to pension them.
Now this subsection 9 provides that the time
served with the military forces for which a
pension has been granted shall net be included in the term of service for the purposes
of pension under the Mounted Police Act.
Let us say an officer was pensioned after ten
years' service in the military forces. Ordinarily he would be eligible for enlistment in
the Mounted Police. There is a rule or provision, whieh I cannot cite at the moment,
that a man cannot draw pay and pension at
the same time. So in the case of such an
oficer his military pension would be suspended and he would nerely draw his pay
from the Mounted Police. Now when the
time comes for him to retire from the
Mounted Police, this subsection 9 provides
that the time ie served with the military
forces, for which ie already has been granted
a pension, shall not be included for purposes
of pension under the Mounted Police Act.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What I am
wondering is wlether this subsection 9 is
necessary when subsection 8 is rejected.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
This subsection
9 merely provides that if a pension bas been
granted to a man under the provisions of
the Militia Pension Act, the time he served
and for which he received that pension shall
not be included when his Mounted Police
pension is computed. Subsection 9 bas no
particular reference to any one war; it refers
to service in military forces in general.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Have we
already passed legislation which adds the
time of service in the military forces, which
I understand mean the permanent forces,
to the time served in the Mounted Police
for the purposes of computation of pensions
under the Mounted Police Act?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:

I think we have.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
If we have
donc that, then we should pass this subsection 9 and renumber it subsection S.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The marginal note
to subsection 9 reads, " If pension granted
under the lilitia Pension Act."
I should
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

like to ask if there are in the Mounted Police
any men who are drawing a pension under
the Militia Pension Act.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I could no, answer

the que-tion specifically, but probaly there
are. As I explained a moment ago, at the
outbreak of the War there were a nunber of
young niin e tihe permanent force wlo had
joined at the age 'of 19 or 20 and had served
five or six years. During the War ticir
promotion was accelerated and ther finished
their war service with the rank of captain or
lieutenant. There was no room for themas in
the permanent force, and by special enactment tiey were pensioned.
In 1920 they
were at an age to join the Mounted Police,
and I fancy some of them were draft( d into
the force.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: If we pass subsection 9, and any of those tnen are drawing
a pension as a result. of their miitary
would thiey in course of time qalify for
another pension from the Mounted Polise,
and then receive two pensions?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Tiey would draw
two pensions, but Sor two periods of sersice.
There is nothing wrong in a mcan's drawing
two or even a doen pensions; the important
point is his length of service.
We iave a
nunber of examples of that. This is a case
wiere a issan iaving served ten year.s in the
permanent force is retired on a pension; then
hie serves twenty years in the Mounted Police
The two pensions will probably approximate
to a thirty-year pension.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: But the, man
loes not draw his pension when lie is drawing
a salary froms the Mountecd Police.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:

No.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: We briefly liscussed this pension question hast seSSion. May
I again bring to the attention of honourable
members the case of an individual pensioned
by the Government of Canada to the extent
of $8.000 or 510,009 a year. He has gone into
private business-I ans told. one of the most
lucrative in the city of Toronto. Now tisen,
is or is not Canada in bard luck? Is Canada
prepared to deal fairly and reasonably y its
civil servants? I tiinsk it is. But nias w
not overdo it? I ueile rstanl the ionourable
senator from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Grie-sch)
to admit that under subsection 9 it wuld be
possible in the vears to come for certain m0embers of the iMounted Police to draw tswo pensions.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Net under thi section.

MARCH 27, 1935
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: This is the marginal reference to subsection 9: "If pension
granted under the Militia Pension Act." It
would imply that there are some men in the
Mounted Police drawing a pension under the
Militia Pension Act.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: A man is discharged from the permanent force under the
circumstances I have described and is
awarded 'a pension. Assuming, for the sake
of argument, that he joins the Mounted Police
the following week, bis pension under the
Militia Pension Act ceases while he serves
in the Mounted Police. When, after, say,
twenty-five years' service, he retires to civil
life and becomes entitled to a Mounted Police
Pension, payment of his militia pension is
resumed. There is no odium attached to the
receipt of two pensions if the amount for the
combined services is the same as it would be
for a similar .period of continuous service in
one force. This section restricts; it does net
enlarge.
Hon. Mr. MURDOOK: But it is admitted
that later on it may be possible for a member of the Mounted Police force to draw two
pensions.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Not for the
same service.
Hon. Mr. MURDOICK: But he would draw
it from the same Government.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not see
anything objectionable in that. Suppose a
man had served thirty-five years in one service; then his pension would bc the same in
anount as if he had served ten years in one
force and twenty-five years in another.
The honourable senator raises the point,
should a man who is able te earn additional
income continue te draw his pension from the
Grown? I want the honourable senator te
sec that if the man has a Government position, then. at least in the class of cases mentioned by the honourable senator from
Edmonton. his pension from the Crown ceases.
I am net sure that it does in every case.
If -a pensioner is able te earn money after his
retirement, he is entitled te do se. Even the
ordinary soldier pensioned because of war
wounds or other infirmity, is permitted te
earn whatever he can over and above his
pension.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: And he can
earn it even from the Crown.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, if he
gets his pension for disability; but net if he
gets it for service. If he is pensioned for
disability he ought te be entitled te whatever additional money he can earn.

205

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: He really has
a preference.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, the same
as any returned soldier. The honourable
member (Hon. Mr. Murdock) has in mind
what may be an extreme case, some man who
is particularly fortunate; but you cannot
legisla-te to cover a single case. You have to
say either that a man who draws a pension is
to be at liberty te go out and earn money, or
that he shall be debarred from doing se. I
know-for the attempt was once made-that
if you take steps to stop a pensioner from
earning money there will be a roar, net only
from the man himself, but from the public
generally, because the human heart revolts
against the idea of preventing anybody from
earning what money he can merely because
he is drawing a pension. I have heard the
roar. I do not know any class it did net corne
from. If the Government of which the
honourable senator was a member made any
attempt to do that sort of thing-I do not
think it did-his ears would be ringing still
with the protests.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Would the right
honourable leader of the House indicate what
is the underlying principle of a pension paid
by the Government of Canada?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is not in
issue just now, and I am not sure that I am
competent to frame extempore definitions
which will be invulnerable.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There have been
three Pension Acts.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. A pension, aside from a war disability pension, is a
retiring allowance fixed by statute, te which
the pensioner becomes entitled by length of
service fixed by statute, the underlying principle being that a better class of servant can
be secured, and perhaps at a lower rate, by
ensuring a certain amount of compensation
for him after his terrn of service expires.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: And the longer the
service the larger the pension.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, and the
less the ability of the pensioner to earn something afterwards. But he has never been forbidden to earn whatever he can.
Now, if the honourable senator feels that
nobody should be permitted to draw a pension
if he is able to earn money, I can only hope
that some day he will be a member of a
Government which will attempt to bring that
prohibition about, and I am sure that if he
is be will never forget the attempt.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask another
question? Is it not a reasonable assumption
that the average man is all through with
remunerative work about the time of his
retirement, and therefore the Government
obligates itself to take care of him with a
pension for the rest of his life? Is that the
principle?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No, that is
not quite fair. It may be that in the general
run of cases the pensioner will be all through.
But men are not built alike; they have not
the same intellectual or physical endowments.
The stronger half, or third, or quarter, may on
their retirement be more competent than they
ever were. Nevert'heless the statute has to be
general. That stronger haIf, or third, or quarter,
will say: "Very well, we are able to earn
money; we are going to do it. We have
earned our pension and we are entitled to receive it. We completed our contract under
which you agreed to give it to us. Now, are
you going to deny us the right to earn more if
we can?"
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: And they pay for
their pensions.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. usually
by contributions. Perhaps the gentleman to
whom the honourable senator refers paid for
his pension by contribution.
But to cone to the subsection. It may
be the honourable senator behind me (Hon.
Mr. Griesbach) is right, that there are some
members of the Mounted Police force with
military service to whon this restriction
slould apply, and that the time which
earned their pension for iilitary service is
net to be counted in the computation of
their Mounted Police pension. But here we
have this expilanation on the right side of
this page:
The intention is to permit time served in
Scuth Africa witli the military forces diring
the years ientionîed to coint for pension in
the saine way as is done with the perimanent
corps of the activ e imilitia.
If

that is a common-sense explanation, when

subsection 8 goes subsection 9 ouîght ic go
too. I dIo not think mvself it is eilcr a
commonsense or a complete explanation.
Perhaps the logical course for us to take is
to acccpt the explanation as it is and strike
out the two suîbsections.
Thîn when the
amended Bill is dealt witlh in the House of
Commons the Minister in charge of it can
put back subsection 9 if he xishes te. I
tIo not think I am supposped to go back over
the history of the legislation te cover the
laches of the Dtpartnu et of Mouinted Police.
Riglt Hon. Nr. MEIGHEN.

Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: It is admitctd that
a pension earned in the permanent force
continues to be payable to the pensioner.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. MOLLOY:
Then if he serves
twenty or twen-ty-five years in the Mounted
Police he earns another pension.
He is
entitled to both, because he has earned them
So leave him alone.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: There is anothe.
phase of the pension question that should
not be lost sight of. It is in a sense the
same as superannuation und'er the Superannuation Act. People are apt to ask, "Why
does the Government provide a superannuation allowance to a civil servant?"' The point
is lost sight of that to a very large extent
civil servants are paying for their pensions.
It is a kind of insurance. We have been
dealing with an Unemployment Insurance
Bill. The principle involved is exactly the
same. Men and women in the Civil Service
contribute annually a certain percentage of
their salaries and the State also makes a
contribution te the fund. The State believes
in the principle that after a man has served
thirty or thirty-five years in the pubie service some provision should be made for the
tail-end of his life. So we have superannuation provided for the Civil Service.
The
commercial world does exactly thîe sane
thing.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Every bank ini Canada provides a superannuation fund for its
employees. Each member of the bank staff
bas to set aside, as insurance, a certain portion of his monthly salary. That is insurance against a person having not-hing to live
on when he reaches a certain age.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: That is good labour
legislation.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: So, wxxhen
aling
with superannuation and pensionS. we nust
not lose sight of the fact that the beneficiaries
have contributed and that, apart from a
sinall auicunt fuîrnished b v lie Stoe. the
funds are self-suîstaining.
As far as the militia are concerned, and
also, I presume. the Mounted Police. I
should imagine the situation o be thi. The
ceommissioned officers in the Mounted Police
and in the permanent force make contribîîtions in just the same way as eIo nelibers of
the Civil Service. But as for the private.
the State recognizes that lie is a poorlyv paid
man, and it assuiiies the entire resonili!itv.

MARCH 27, 1935
He is not called upon ta contribute anything
towards the pension, because he serves at a
very low rate. Others in the service are paid
at a comparatively high rate.
I am a firm believer in the principle of
insurance and pensions. If we had started
a system of contributory insurance for all
our people, including industrial workers,
fifty years ago, we should not now have the
tremendous problem that confronts us to-day.
If the individual, and his employer, and the
State had contributed on an actuarial basis
the funds necessary to provide for such a
situation as we have had in Canada for the
last six years, there would not have been
one-tenth of the trouble that we now have
on our hands. So I say that as pensions,
insurance and superannuation are based on
right principles and have proper objects in
view, we should do everything we can to get
all these claims into proper shape.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I have no responsibility for this legislation, but I understand that it is proposed ta strike out subsections 8 and 9. I suggest that you strike
out subsection 8 and pass subsection 9. I
do not think they are related at all.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It was my
view that we ought ta take this explanation
on the right-hand page at its face value,
if it is of any value, and to strike out subsection 8 and subsection 9. I am convinced,
however, by the remark of the honourable
senator from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach)
that the explanation is worthless and, having
this consideration in mind, I think it would
be wise ta restore subsection 9. This subsection contains a restricting provision; consequently if we restore it, and it is wrong, it
is certain ta be corrected.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Is it a restriction
relating ta subsection 8?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
think it relates ta subsection 8. Even if it
does, it is restrictive; consequently it will
not be missed by the Department. Sa I
move that subsection 8 be struck out and
that subsection 9 be made subsection 8.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
If the right
honourable gentleman has any doubt as ta
the soundness of the interpretation he has
just given, which seems to be somewhat of
a hypothesis, as we have considerable time
at our disposa], would it not be as well for
the Committee ta rise and report progress?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am confident that the honourable senator from Edmonton is right.

207

Time served with the military forces for
which a pension has been, granted under the
provisions of the Militia Pension ActHon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Would that apply
ta time served in South Africa?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I should
not think it likely. If it is intended ta apply
only ta that, and therefore is necessary only
if subsection 8 passes, it is sure ta be struck
out. But if we struck it out now, I am not
so sure that it would be restored, even if it
ought ta be.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: It has no reference ta
subsection 8 at all.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
I would
move ta restore section 3, leaving out subsection 8, and numbering subsection 9 as
subsectiori 8.
The amendment was agreed ta, and section
3 as amended was agreed ta.
On section 4-constables' pensions:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: A similar
motion should be made here. It will be
moved by Hon. Senator Calder, and seconded
by Hon. Senator Black, that section 4 be
amended by striking out the portion numbered 5, and changing 6 ta 5.
The amendment was agreed ta, and section
4 as amended was agreed ta.
On section 5-widows' and orphans' pensions:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This merely
limits the time within which a constable may
elect, without proof of health on his part,
ta accept the benefits of Part IV of the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act, which
was passed last year, and which covers pensions ta widows and children. The time is
ta be limited ta eight months, with a provision for extension, rather than be fixed at
one year.
Section 5 was agreed ta.
Section 6 was agreed ta.
The Bill was reported as amended, and
the amendments were concurred in.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this

mental reaction to the work of our Commîittee the right honourable gentleman may

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is quite
satisfactory.
CANADA'S NEXT GOVERNOR GENERAL
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Before the
ncxt Order of the Day is called, J crave the
iidulgenmc of the Senate while I make a
furthlcr statement with reference to the question raised by the honourable senator from
Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Lemieux). It is true
that His Majesty the King has been graciously
pleae«d to nominate Mr. John Buchan,
member for the Scottish Universities in the
Imperial House of Commons, as Governor
Generaýl of Canada, the appointment to be
effective at the expiration of the term of His

Excellency the Earl of Bessborough.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We have not
been informcd as to when the term of His
Excellency the Earl of Bessborough will end.
I was under the impression that it would be
at the conclusion of this year.
Rihit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am not in
a position to state the exact date. but I
know it is sone time in the autumn of this
VEar.

Perhaps it

would be timely for me to say a word on this

with some diffidence, and with perfect knowledge that I am speaking for myself alone.
Inasnuch as I am advancing in years. I
had hoped that before leaving this side of
the Styx I should experience the satisfaction
and pride of secing a Canadian appointed as
Governor General of Canada. By the Statute
of Westminster we have established our absolute equality with the other parts of the
Commonwealth, and I think it would have
been somewliat in keeping with our new status
to suggest to His Majesty the King that a
Canadian be appointed as Governor General
of Canada. Two or three years ago Australia set us an example in this respect: Sir
Isaac Isaacs, who was Chief Justice of its
Supreme Court, is now the Governor General of Australia. I should have been happy
to hear from the lips of my right honourable
friend that the Government of Canada had
suggested the name of one who for a long
and momentous period was at the head of
the Government, and is now the highly respected dean of the Conservative party, the
RiLht Hon. Sir Robert Borden. I will menH

.

r. ]DDURAND.

tion also the venerable Sir William Mulock,
Chief Justice of Ontario, and Sir Robert
Falconer. the retired President of Toronto
University.
I mention but three names; I
could mention others. It seems to me that
the raising of a Canadian te the high and
honourable position of Governor General
would cause the Canadian people to feel that
they had grown up to their new status.
Having had this thought in mind for some
time, I thought it but right te give expression
to it, and I trust that by having done so I
am net prevented from joining in the elogy
of the future occupant of Rideau Hall. I
recognize that the appointment is a happy
one, Mr. John Buchan having all the qualifications necessary to adorn the post.
Hon. Mr. LEM-EUX: Honourable senators, I quite agree with the honourable the
leader on this side of the House that the
idea which has been in the public mind for
some years, of having a full-blooded Canadian as Governor General of this country, will
some day be realized, and that no more
worthy name could b mentioned for the
post than that of the Right Hon. Sir Robert
Borden. However, if we are not to have a
Canadian as our next Governor General I
think His Majesty the King has been well
advised in selecting a son of Scotland.
Some Hon. SELNATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: I have a great
admiration for the English people, and, of
course, for the Irish people; but I remember
the old alliances between Scotland and France.
I say that the selection of John Buchan is a
credit to the Mother Country and will be of
benefit to Canada as well. We have in this
country two great basic races, the English and
the French, and if we study our history we
find that the Scotchman bas always been a
good interpreter, an agent de liaison, between
the English and the French. Therefore I
welcome the appointment of John Buchan.
I know that he will be well received by all
parts of this Dominion. particularly by the
section from which I come, the province of
Quebec.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: As the two honourable gentlemen who have preceded me are
still young, strong and hearty, I think their
anticipations will be fulfilled and tha:t they
will see a Canadian as Governor General of
this country. As for me, I declare myself
entirely satisfied with the appointment which
bas been made.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Were it net for the
remarks which have just fallen from the lips
of the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr.

MARCH 27, 1935
Béland). 1 would flot say a word at this time.
1 know there is considerable sentiment
throughout Canada in favour of the appointment of one of our own citizens as Governor General. Much can be said in support
of such a proposai. However, I have often
wonderprl if in the end it wouid be the very
best thing. After ail, we must flot forget that
the person who hoids the very high position
of Gove.rnor Genoral in our land is flot always
a mere rubber stanp or simply a social
functionary. Thore are occasions when he has
very important state fonctions to performoccasions which may occur at any time. One
can never tell whon we may have an acute
political crisis. It is all very nice to, say that
our good friend Sir Robert Borden shou'ld bo
Governor General of Canada, but if he were
to stand as arbiter between the two political
parties in this country in times such as I have
mentioned, as he might have to do, what
wouid haif the people of Canada. say?
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Byng!
Hon. Mr. CALDER: And what ivould the
other hall say? We should have a fine
Canadian row on our hands.
It seems to me far botter for our own safety,
and for the good of tihe country-I arn speaking of the political side of our affairs--that in
a situation of that kind wo shouid have somoone who would be in an independent position.
We should have someone who has nover been
mixed up in our local party aff airs. I wrnîid
go a litti-e fartber than that. In my opinion
it would be a wise thing if the poisons
appointed as Lieutonant-Governors were in
every case chosen from a. province other than
that in which they are to hold office.

209

Canadian as Governor General of Canada, I
arn inclinad to think that the prasent method
of appointment is better. We must remamber
that the office is nover filied until our own
Government has been consuited. As 1 understand it, the Canadian Administration mus't
give its approval, and the mattar is no longer
ieft entirely to Downing Street.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourabla
friend is referring to the former method. Nowadays the Government of Canada suggests the
name.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: It always bas
been so.
Right Hon. iMr. GRAHAM: Honourable
senators, I arn not sure that 1 agree with
anyona. That is contrary to my usuai experience. My honourable friend froma Saitcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder) has suggested that
a man sbould not ha appo-inted LieutenantGovernor of a province in which ho has been
residîng. If my honourabie friend had made
a practice of reading the speeches of great

suggestion when addressing the Canadian

92584-14
REVISED ESITION

SENATE
I should have no objection to the appointment as Governor General of any one of
the Canadians whose names have been mentioned, if I could really bring myself to the
point of thinking the time had arrived when
we should have one of our own countrymen
in that office. I am not much afraid of the
danger referred to by the honourable gentleman from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder),
because a man like Sir Robert Borden, for
instance, who himseif bas been Prime Minister, ivould if appointed Covernor General
be likely to act readily on the advice of his
constitutional advisers. I imagine that if
a Canadian wero appointed there would be
less danger of difference of opinion between
the Governor and the Administration than
there is under the present system. But I
am old-fashioned as well as old, and I cannot bring myself to the point of agreeing
that it would be wise to sever the last link
between the Motheriland and ourselves. The
British Dominions have become more or less
separate entities, but there is one Throne
to which we all are connected. We could
say that if a Canadian were appointed
Governor General of Canada he would be
the representative of the King, but for me
the change would mean a weakening of our
conne.ction with the Throne. That is my
own sentiment. I am old-fashioned enough
to be unable to bring myself to a frame of.
mind favourable te the appointment of a
Canadian.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, though the right honourable gentleman from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham)
says he does not agree with anyone, I am
very happy to say that I agree wholeheartedIlv with him, and as well with the
(Hon.
honourable ge ntleman fron Sa1-to:it
Mr. Calder). To me it would seem regrettable
indeed if this country were to moor itself so
far from the Motherland as te sever that
link which is the most obvions of ali. and
which I think should be the most lasting, the
symbol of our common allegiance with the
fountain and centre of the Commonwealth.
And I am sure that such a severance would
be regrettable to the greater part of onr
country. It has been remarked that a precedent bas been establislhed in the appointment of an Australian as Governor Ceneral
of his own coutry. Australia is a federation
of seven states, all having their own Governors Ceneral, who are appointed in the same
way as is the Governor General of Canada.
Every one of tbem has the title of His
Excellency. and they all cone from Great
Britain. I have no right whatever to venture
an interpretation of Australian opinion, but I
Right Hion. Mr. GRAHAM.

can go so far as to suggest that the fact that
an experimoent has been tried there is not an
assurance it will be made permanent. If it
should be decided te go back to the former
system, the decision would in itself be no reflection upon the present Governor General,
His Excellency Sir Isaac Isaacs.
I will now explain why I concur in what bas
been said by the honourable senator from
Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder). It is generally
assumed that the function of the Governor
General in relation to matters of government
is te follow the advice of his ministers, and
that alone. As it is almost universalily true
that the Governor General does follow this
course, the assuimption is net at all unnatural.
But in the fullest sense it does net hold good
It is unneccssary for me to do more than refer
to an incident which took place in Manitoba
about twenty years ago. The position and
duties of the Lieutenant-Governor of a province are analogous in the provincial sphere to
those of the Covernor General as respects the
whole of Canada. In the case to w-hich I
refer the Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba
refused to comply with the advice of his
ministers to dissolve the Legislature. I would
refer to a similar incident of a later date
were it not that I was immediately concerned
and bave no desire to revive a controversv.
My point here is that the function of the
Governor General, in se far as he at any
time becomes an arbiter-indeed. hii haic
s
function with respect to legislation, Parliament and the GoCernment-is not to override
the Government. much less Parliament. but
rather to sec that no action of the Administration is a defiance of or a refusal to submîit
itself to Parliament. His duty is te see t-hat
the suprenacy of Parliament over the Covernment is maintained at any time that it
may become necessary for him to intervene
Such vas tho rosponsibilit*y as sen v Sir
Douglas Cameron twenty years ago, wlien as
Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba he rejected
the advice of his ministers and refused to
dissolve the Legislature. His purpose wis te
make certain that the will of the Legislature
in relation to a certain matter thon bcfore it
was net thwartod by a dissolution. It will
net be difficult for honourable members te sec
that at any time, in federal or provincial
affairs, it might become the duty of a Governor General or a Lieutenant-Goinuor to
vindicate the supreme and final authority of
Parliament or the LegisIa.ture as against the
wish of a Government. And there can be
no doubt that in the event of such circumstances arising in the federal arena the stand
taken by the Governor General will be
more easily acceptable to the people of

MARCH 27, 1935
Canada if hie has neyer been conne-cted with
any party than if he has been a Canadian
party leader or office bolder, reýgardless of hew
dignified hie is, or how be'loved hie may have
become since he discontinued his active
political career.
Therefore it seems ta me well that we
should flot abandon the system whicb has
been associated with our history ever since
we became a country. In the flrst place, it
constitutes almost our ilast link with the
Throne, and if that link is severed we shal,
be in littie better position than was Hanover
when its King was George the First, wbo
was also K-ing of England.
,My second point in favour of a continuation of this system is the imparti-ality of the
appointeee, who is agreed upon and indeed
suggested by the Government of Canada.'
He- is always well known and highly regarded
in the Motherland and neyer bas been embroiled in ýCanadian polities.
For those reasons I arn much pleased that
there bas been no departure in the matter of
making this new appointment. I persanally had nothing to do with the choice that
bas been made, 'but I think it is a gond one.
I amn glad that one who, tbough flot ennobled,
is no.ted for his bigh achievements, who has
risen to a distinguished position by bis own
efforts and genius, has 'been chosen for the
most exalted diplomatie position within this
Empire. I know that Mr. John Buchan will
be warmly welcom-ed at the hands of ail
classes of Canadians.

cannat say anything more than I have ailready
said on this subi ect, and I leave it ta the
Senate ta pass the amendments proposed
in the report il tbey are tbought proper.
Thexe are in this Chamber honourable gentlemen who are members of the Bar of the
province of Queec, and they will have ta
take the responsibility jointly with me.
Hon. H. S. BELA'ND: Honourable senators, wben this law was promulgated last
year much was said as to the 'benefits
expected ta resultd from it, especially ta
farmers. If I remember rightly, it was
thought tbat one of the effe-ets would be an
cxtended application of the golden arule from
a social point of view; and it was also felt
it would bring about some economic improvernents by assisting in the continuation
of farming operations that otherwise would
have been ahandoned. Now the only way
we can test the value of a law is in its
application. This Act bas been in force
almost one year, as I understand it. I was
bo.rn and reared in a farming eommunity,
and I bave lived in another farming comnmunity ever since I graduated as a medical
dactor. I 'have yet ta ilearn that 'farmers in
the province of Quebec, at least, have been
remiss in the duty of honouring financial.
obligations. In the province of Quebec,
perhaps more than in any other provinces,
this duty was regarded as an ethie, as probably a royal mandate was regarded in the
Middle Ages. Th-en all of a, sudden the
farmers in Quebec-.I amn referring ta my
own province particularly-are informed that
a new law has been -enact.ed, having something ta do with the payment of farmers'
debts. Tbe information respecting tbe legislation may not be quite correct, but an impression is created throughout the rural
communities that by saine mysteriaus means
farmers will be re'lieved 'from paying their
debts. Naturally tbere is great rejoicing.
Human nature being wbat it is, frail and
weak, many ask themselves wbetber it would
not be possible ta do away witb repayment
of the money they owe.
To ilustrate this point.
I have been
lyrought to my feet to-day 'by a lett-er published in a French nelwspaper. It is written
by a very erninent lawyer of the district of
Quebec. His name 'I amn ot at liberty te
revëal at the moment. I may add that hie is
well known ta My rigb't honourable friend
opposite and is 'higbly regarded as a legal
autharity and an bonourable man. He says
that in the last few monthis he bias sent out
650 letters ta larmers requesting payment of
moneys owing by tbem. He has received

MARCH 27, 1935
Hon. Mr. BELAND:
I ask my right
bonourabie friend, how is it passible for sucb
a board to be available to our farmers? A
lawyer lias no difllculty in attending court.
But what about a farmer trying ta colleet
$1,000 or $2,000 from bis neiglibour who is
unwilling to pay? It is difficuit for bim ta
attend the court, and his attendance involves
considerable expense. A Board of Review is,
in a measure, a remedy for a bad situation,
but there should be a board in every riding.
Even then I do flot know whether it would
work satisfactorily. I know the law bas been
praised in many quarters. I arn sorry I
cannot sbare tbe same view.
Quebec is primarily a farming province.
We have thirty or thirty-five Superior Court
*iudges who funictian in as many judicial districts. Why sbould flot those judges be
given jurisdictian concurrent witb tbat of tbe
Board of Review? This, ta a certain extent,
would help to remedy a bad situation. Besides the Superior Court judges we bave in
the province fourteen stipendiary magistrates
-juges salariés. Tbese magistrates should
also lie given concurrent jurisdiction. I do
not see any seriaus objection ta my suggestion. Perbaps my rigbt honourable friend
may be able ta satisfy me that hie is perfectly riglit in refusing ta adopt it. I believe
its adoption would certainly lead ta a mucli
more satisfactory administration of tbe Act.
Tbese disconnected remarks I submit in
the hope tbat it may lie possible ta amend
the Act sa as ta render it less difficult of
application ta the province of Quebec.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Honourable senators,
I would not for a moment attempt ta discuss
any legal points relative ta the Act itself
or ta the proposed amendments. I leave tbe
discussion ta tbose bonourable members wbose
knowledge and abulity better qualify tbem for
tbe task. I do want ta say, however, that I
regret the lionourable senator wlio bas just
sat down was not able ta attend the sessions
ai the Banking and Commerce Committee
wben it had tbe Bill under considerati on.
Tbpn lie migbt have heardHon. Mr. BELAND: Quite so.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Then lie migbt have
beard tbe complimentary tbings said af the
manner in wbicb tbe Act bas operated. and
bie would have bad full opportunity ta put
forward the complaint whichlibe bas made
bere.
That complaint migbt have been
answered by the experts of the department
as well as by members of the committee.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: 1 admit it was my
fault that 1 was nlot present.

213

Hon. Mr. BLACK: The phase of the
situation ta whicb lie has referred was not
raised before the committee at ail. We were
given the impression that the Act liad been
eminently satisfactory, s0 far as sucli legislation could be considered satisfactory. Certainly if any statute can be so applied, this
Act lias been applied in the spirit of the
golden rule. 1 arn inclined ta tbink the bionourable senator from Lauzon (Hon. Mr.
Béland) is perhaps ascribing ta the Act many
results that flow from. the depression. The
fact that tbe farmer receives sucli inadequate
prices for bis produce makes it very difficuit
for him ta pay eitlier bis doctor or bis lawyer,
or in fact anybody else. I do not think
the working out of tlie Act affects ta any
great extent tbe ordinary, everyday payment
of bills by the farmer or by residents in a
small country town. If it does so work in
the province af Quebec, I arn satisfied from
my own experience and observation that tbis
is not the case in tbe Maritime Provinces,
particularly in tbe province ai New Brunswick. It was intended primarily ta assist
the farmer wbo found himself se greatly
involved in delit tbat lie was unable ta pay.
It is true that hie could be sold out, but then
tbe eommunity would suifer and nobody
would gain. I think that is a fair assumrptian.
Along this saine line it was stated, I do
not know wbetber correctly or nat, that in
some instances, particularly in the province
af Quebee, tbe fees cbarged and the costs

in forcing the sale of property were extremely
lieavy. Tbe fees mentioned before the coinmittee were eertainly surprising, ta me at
ail events. So it does flot seem that tbe
working af the Act, so far as I understand it,
bas imposed a disability or worked an in.jury.
During the past ten years the lawyers
af Canada bave become more and more
caneentrated in the larger towns and cities.
Whien I was a boy tbere were a lawyer and
a doctar in mast af tbe towns of tlie Maritime
Provinces. To-day there is scarcely a lawyer
leit in tbe small tawns, or, in fict. in the
larger towns; tbey are ail congregated in
the cities. Tbe same is truc ai thc doctars.
W.iile gond people like my haonourable friend
ta my leit (Hon. Mr. Bourque) have reinained in the smalier places for the love
of bumanity, the young lawyers and doctors
ai to-day do not go ta the small towns as
they used ta do. They prefer the larger
communities, where the sphere ai tbeir
activities is wider and their apportunities
are greater.
The buman element is respansible for this change. Furtherrnore, the
fact that the farmers now have no ready cash
and in maoy cases are nlot deriv ing sufficient

SENATE
revenue from t heir farms to pay any more
than the ordinary household expenses is
having an influence. But thcre is nothing
in the amendments before us that adversely
affects the situation.
May I go back and say that the evidence
placed before the committee by the departmental officiails and others indicated that the
efforts and ability of the boards towards
bringing debtor and creditor together had
saved nany farms and kept on them many
people wlho, if they had lad to go through
i
r egulhr legal process, would probably
have heen sold oet andi have left the farm
altogether. Several instances were given of
farms which had been saved, and the officials
of the department mentioned many cases
in which a great deal of good had been done.
As a mebnier of that committee I must say
that te Act seems te me to have been
beneficial.
As to the legal aspect, I am going to leave
that entirely to honourable gentlemen who
know more about it than I do. Though all the
arguments of my honourable friend be sound,
there is nothing in the amendments to aggravate the situation.
Hon. Mc. BELAND: What are the amendnentS?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: They are all explained
in the Bill. Sixty days is changed to ninety
days. The principal change is in section 3
of the Bill. The general changes are nut
important in relation
lt te question raised
by the honourable gentle min.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
mnembers, I gather from his attack on the provisions as to legal determination that the
honourable gentleman rather misapprehends
the construction of the Act. The Act provides for one tribunal, not in each province,
but in each district. I do not know how
large a district is, but whecrever necessary an
official referee is appointed, and it is his
business to effect an arrangement between
a farmer whu is hopelessly submerged and
his creditors.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: He is the first judge.
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN:
a judge; he is a negotiator.

He is not

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I mean as to the
qualification of the farmer to apply under
the Act.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Oh, yes. That
is necessary in order that a conciliation or
arrangement may be effected.
Where the
referee does not succeed, the case can be taken
to the Board of Review, which, in each provHIon. Mr. BLACK.

ince, is hcaded by a high court judge. The
honourable senator (Hon. Mr. Béland) says
that other high court judges should have
concurrent jurisdiction. I am afraid that if
they had the Act would not work as well as
it does, because you would have a variety of
judgments and principles within the same
province, and perhaps even within the same
district.
The idea behind the Act was-and it appears
to bu working in accordance with the original
hope-that
most
settlements
would
he
voluntary, and would be mcade because of the
power of the overriding tribunal to impose
the settlement, if the parties did nut come
to it voluntarily, through the intervention of
the official referee; and that, after certain decisions had been made by the Board of Review, the lesson taught would have the effect
of making casier conciliation before the referee.
The referee is informed of cases already heard
and is in a position to convince the parties
that if their case goes to the Board of Review
it will be decided in a certain way.. Consequently, so far, at any rate, it has not been
found necessary to have more than one Board
of Review. The judge is assisted by two other
persons, one of whom represents the creditors
and the other the debtors.
I know there is a body of opinion which is
opposed to these settlements and to statutes
which look to the reduction, if nut the cancellation, of debts. This feeling is probably
stronger in Quebec than anywhere else in
Canada, not only as respects farmers, but all
other people. I do nut lament that such a
iore
feeling exists. I only wish it wercc
prevalent.
I have before me a letter from a prominent
legal authority, not a practising lawyer, but
an academie dignitary, from which I will quote.
I hope that my French may be understood.
It says:
(TransiLation): From the earliest times (1
would refer you for confirmation to the following sources: Roman law, Germianic customiii.
canon law. royal ordinances). our civil laws
have becen based on the sanctity of contracts.
on the ionour clue to the given word. Under
the rule of these two new laws, contracts, the
only object of which is to bind, will dlo so no
longer; promises freely given need not be kept.
The law, according to its character. had charged
the courts with the luty of ratifying agreements; these two new .aws .suppress ratification.
Well, it is logical, and is thus typical of the
French mind, but is it practical? The writer
says that contracts must bu for ever sacred.
Yes, so long as the sacredness can be maintained; but it cannot be maintained where
overwhelming obligations are set off against
very limited assets.

MARCH 27. 1935
Hon. Mr. BELAND: A l'impossible nul n'est
tenu. (No one can be held bound to do what
is impossible.)
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: 'Ihat is
exactly what I am trying to say in English.
The principle which is so ably stated in this
letter, and which seems to be subscribed to by
the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Béland),
is a challenge to the whole law of bankruptcy.
It is a challenge to a principle of law that has
been in our federal statutes, and in the
statutes of his own province, for a long period
of years. Why is it going to be ruinous to
apply tihat princip'le in the case of the farmers
and give them a chance to get from under the
mass of debris that keeps them down and to
breathe the free air once more? It gives them
a new life and exhilaration, a chance to see
somehing ahead. Otherwise they have to go
down and out and let others take their places.
Such is the principle of this legislation, and
I am pretty certain that it will not work to
the disadvantage of the doctor. The country
doctor, as a creditor, is the last to get his
money.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: He comes even after
the undertaker.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, even
after the undertaker. While, under this law,
he may have to take a reduction, he at
least will stand up with the creditors and
receive an equal portion with others who are
in a similar position. It will not drive the
doctors out of the country towns; it will
enable them to convert what very often are
worthless accounts into actual cash.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: Are the members
of the Board of Review in each province
remunerated?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. I am
not so sure as to the judge, but I presume
he is.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No. He receives his travelling expenses.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, he gets
his travelling expenses. His time is virtually
devoted to this work. The official referees
get $150 a month, except in Quebec and one
or two other provinces.
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH: Honourable members, I should like to say a word
about the probable effect of the adoption of
the first clause of the recommendations of
the committee. That is the clause with regard to the preservation of the creditor's
security. I suppose the policy of the whole
legislation is to afford relief to the farmer
who finds himself not able to pay his debts

215

in full, and the question to my mind is
whether or no the adoption of the proposed
additional clause would be of any help to the
unfortunate farmer who finds himself in that
position.
Suppose the clause proposed is not inserted
in the Bill, and we have the creditor and the
surety left in the position in which they now
stand under the law. I know nothing, of
course, âbout the provisions of the Civil Code
in Quebec, but speaking of the general law
of the English-speaking provinces with regard to the liability of the surety to the
creditor, I should think the position was
simply this. If the creditor voluntarily enters
into any agreement with the debtor to lessen
the amount -of the debt, or even an agreement to give the debtor further time for
payment, and the surety is not a party to
that agreement, then the surety is discharged
either of the whole of his liability to the
creditor or of that portion of it which the
creditor has voluntarily agreed to remit. Well,
as long as the law stands in that position we
may assume that the creditor will be opposed
to any great reduction in the amount of the
debt.
But if you change the law, as this proposal
recommends, and if you provide that notwithstanding such an agreement the creditor
shall still have his full rights for the full
amount against the surety, do you not at once
make the surety the opponent of the proposal? You make it easier for the farmer to
secure the agreement of the creditor to reduce the amount, but you at once will have
a new opponent. The surety will surely say:
"I am not willing to be made to pay, whether
or no, the amount by which the creditor is
willing to reduce his debt. If you are proposing to release the original debtor to a
certain extent, and to claim the full amount
from me, then I will object to the whole
proceeding." If that position arises, I should
feel afraid that more impediments are going
to be thrown in the way of the farmer securing an agreement from his creditors for a
reduction of the debt. The surety very
probably will be a member of the debtor's
immediate family, a brother or a cousin, or,
at any rate, some neighbour and friend, and
if this amendment is -adopted you are going
to convert the friendly surety into a hostile
opponent of any compromise.
If it is thought that the amendment would
facilitate the farmer in procuring a workable
arrangement for his debts, then there is just
one other consideration that I should like to
point out to the House. If the surety is to
remain liable to the creditor for the full

216

SENATE

amount of bis contract to pay, then, as soon
as he pays, he himseif becomes a creditor
of the original debtor. He has a right to
recover from the debtor the full amount
which he has paid. Surely if this amen.dment
is adopted provision ought to be made that
the surety who pays should not be in any
way deprived of his present legal rights.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I asked the
honourable senator from North York (Hon.
Sir Allen Aylesworth) to give the House the
benefit of bis views on this phase of the law,
and especially on the first amendment which
was made in conmittee, and I am very
grateful to him for his statement.
It is
true, no doubt, that the preservation of the
creditor's right against the surety brings the
surety into the picture before the official
referee and the Board of Review. He in
fact becomes a creditor, that is, if his suretyship is dependable, if he is a good and
responsible person.
Under the law it is
necessary to notify him of any proceedings;
so be goes and looks after his own rights.
Now, even though the debt is reduced. because
of inability of the debtor to pay, it surelv
cannot be argued that the creditor should
get no benefit at all from bis surety. What
would be the good of having any surety at
all if you could collect only to the extent
of the debtor's capacity to pay?
If this
amendment is not adopted the result will be
that all who have taken sureties will be
stripped of their extra security. I know that
the House would net take such a step, realizing the full effect of it.
The honourable senator from North York
says that the bringing in of the surety will
make a settlement more difficult-that the
surety himself will probably be an opponent
of the settlement proposed. Of course he
will be an opponent unless he is satisfied
that the amount agreed upon is all the debtor
can, pay. It viil probably be necessary to
make the best settlement possible in the face
of his position.
The honourable senator's last suggestion is
to prescrve the present rights of the surety
against the debtor. Under the law, entirely
aside from the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Art, a surety who pays the full amount
can come back on the debtor if he fails to pay.
The surety

becomes a cteditor. as the hon-

ourable senator has pointed out. But he can
come back on tie debtor olv te the extent
fixed by the Board of Review as the amount
of what the de btor can pav. I cannot see
how it would be possile to preserve the right
to the full amount, beas-e that would mean
the debtor wouxlx have te pay the same sum
d
as if there ha
been ino settleinst.
The

effect of the law is that if the surety has been
called upon to pay he can seek compensation
from the debtor, but only to the amount to
which the debt has been limited by the Board
of Review on the basis of the debtor's capacity
to discharge bis obligation.

MARCH 27, 1935
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Or is it bound by
some special regulations? In recent years I
have often been paid by bartering drugs and
services for products of the farm, carrots,
potatoes and so on. What I wish to know
is whether the Board of Review has a free
hand in leaving it to the farmer to pay his
debt as he pleases and as he can.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I should like to know
whether a farmer is just as free as to the
way he may pay his debts after a settlement
as he was before he brought himself within
the provisions of the Act.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The powers
of the Board of Review are plenary and fin-al.
It can give effect to any arrangement which
it thinks is fair and just all around. That
then becomes a judgment of the court, is
filed in the court, and represents the relationship between the debtor and his creditors. I
will try to answer the honourable senator's
last question. Suppose a doctor's bill against
a farmer was $100 and it is reduced to $90.
That is what the farmer must pay, and probably within a certain time, for a time can be
fixed.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I understand the rule
applied so far has been that assets and liabilities are eut in half.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, no, there
is no such rule at all. There could not
possibly be. The whole sense of the Act is
that the farthest extent to which the debtor
can go in meeting his obligations is the limit
that is fixed. In the hypothetical case referred to, after the doctor's bill has been fixed
at a certain sum, to be paid within a specified time, the farmer can make payment in
any way agreeable to the doctor. That is, he
can pay it in turnips or chickens, or anything
except moonshine whiskey.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should like to
ask, a question of my right honourable friend.
Let us say the official receiver convenes the
creditors in a case and examines into the
assets of the debtor. He finds out that the
debtor can pay only 75 per cent of his liabilities. Then an effort is made to establish
equality among all the creditors, that is,
have all accept a reduction of 25 per cent.
My impression is that it is part of the work
of the 'official receiver to bring about that
equality. Now, if one of the creditors holds
a note which has been endorsed, how can he
agree to accept that reduction of 25 per cent
as against the debtor and yet retain his full
right against the endorser, who becomes in

217

fact a creditor? All the other creditors accept
the reduction, but the holder of the note is
by this amendment allowed to retain his
right to collect in full from the endorser. The
endorser, who signed -bis name merely to
enable the maker of the note to borrow. is
obliged to pay in full. It seems to me there
is a difference of equality as among the
creditors, of whom the endorser is one.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIEN: I am sorry
that I -have not succeeded in making clear
my own view as to the equity of this amendment. Let us say that A borrows from C
and the lender is not ready to take A's
security; so the endorsement of B is procured. The effect of the contract is that
A must pay to the limit of his ability, for
he is the principal debtor. If he pays the
whole debt, B is discharged. But if he pays
only part and B pays the rest, then B holds
the amount that he has paid against A. The
principle of this law is that if a man is
judicially found to be so overwhelmed with
debt that he cannot discharge all his obligations, a finding is made as to what he can
pay and there is an apportionment of the
debt reduction among the different creditors,
including classes of creditors. Suppose that
A, who owes $100 to C, guaranteed by B,
can pay only $60, and that this amount is
fixed by the Board. What should be the
legal result? Should C lose entirely the
benefit of B's endorsement? C would say,
" Why, I got the endorsement so that in the
event that A could not pay I might protect
myself by being able to depend upon B."
Hon. Mr. HUGHES:
worse position.

And B is in no

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No; B is
in the position he undertook to be in.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES:
position.

B is in a better

Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGEEN: I do not
think he is in a better position, but he is
in just the position he undertook to be in.
Consequently no injustice is done to B. But
to strike B out of the picture just because
you reduce the debt of A on the score of
inability to pay-if the debt were reduced
on any other score the case would be different-and say to C, "You have now to do
without B altogether," would be a gross and
palpable wrong. Why, it would destroy the
contract without any relation at all to capacity to pay. B is quite able to pay, and he
undertook to do so in the event of 'A not
being able to pay. So the equities are preserved by the retention of the right against the

SENATE
rrntor. 'ey
arr conpletely disturbcd,
indeed they are thrown into collapse, if you
let B off altogether.
Hon. Mr. DANDURANÇD:
Yes. but you
are relieving the debtor from paying a certain proportion of his debt.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
be'cause he cannot pay it.

I know;-

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: You are imposing tlie amount of that reduction upon the
endorser, who at least should retain his
rigbt of collecting 100 per cent against the
debtor.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: You are net
imposing anything on the endorser, but be
has always had on him the responsibility of
paying off the debtor's account, and he still
Las that responsibility.
Now we will suppose B pays. The honourable senator says,
then B should be able to come on the
debtor for the whole amount. If so, there
is no compromise at all. The courts have
already decided the debtor cannot pay the
whole amount, but can pay only 60 cents on
the dollar. Consequently B becomes the
creditor instead of C, tbat is all, and he has
te take the compromise determined by the
court. The compromise, remember, is based
on the ability to pay. I tried to emphtasize
at the outset that ability to pay is the essence
of the whole measure.
If for any other
reason A was allowed to escape, of course
B would escape too, because if you imposed
any other responsibility on B you would
be imposing on him something he never contracted for. But he had already contracted
to pay what A could not pay, and he is in
that position still.

INTERNAL
ECONOMY AND
TINGENT ACCOUNTS

CON-

Hon. Mr. SHARPE moved concurrence in
the second report of the Standing Committee
on Internal Econony and Contingent Accounts.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: What is the report? I have net seen it yet.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: It will be found at
page 122 of the Minutes of the Proceedings
of the Senate. I will read the report:
hlie Standing Comnnittee on Internal Econonmy
andi Contingent Accounts bg leave to make
their second report. as follow-s:
The Commîîîittee recommitîend:
1. That the rate of pay of Walter Sotierton,
Senate Carpenter, be increased from $5.25 to
5.50 per day, from the lst April. 1935.
2. Tîhat the rate of pay of Léo Godbout,
l)oor-keeper and Niglit Watchmiian, be continued dering the recess of Parliamient at the
so-ssionial rate of $4.50 per day.
3. That the Senators' sessional stenographic
staff be increased by the addition of one
bilinguial stenographer.
All whithi is respectfully subnitted.
The motion was agreed te.

LIMITATION OF HOURS OF WORK BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING
Riglt Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN moved
the second reading of Bill 21, an Act to provide for limiting the Hours of Work in Industrial Undertakings to eight in the day and
forty-eigit in the week, in accordance with the
Convention concerning the application of the
principle of the Eight Hour Day or of the
Forty-eight Hour Week adopted by the
General Conference of the International Labour Organization of the League of Nations,
in accordance with the Labour Part of the
Treaty of Versailles of 28th June, 1919.

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
Even if these
amendments were net passed, the law as it
stands would have absolutely the same
effect.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As we are nearing 6 o'elock, could net this Order be better
dealt with to-morrow? It should net take
more than an heur.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The law as
it always did stand. There is just a question
as to whether the new law does net relieve
the guarantor. We want to make it clear
that it does not.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think it
could. There will be no need of a constitutional debate on the Bill; it has taken place
once already.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
In case of
bankruptcy what is the position of the
guarantor?
Right Hon. Mr. .MEIGHEN: That is a
very good point. He would be in just the
same position.
Hon. Mr. BLACK moved concurrence in
the report.
The motion was agreed to.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGEEN.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may have to
invade that field again, but I shall net be very
long.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Will this Bill
go to a committee?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Let me say
this-it will avoid my making a speech temorrow and the honourable senator from De
Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) will have
right of way. This Bill is virtually a verbatim

MARCII 27, 1935
reproduction of the draft convention of the
Labour Office of the League of Nations in respect of shortening hours of labour. It defines
"rndustrial undcrtaking" just as it is deflned
in the convention. It then sets out the hours
of labour applicable to the day or the week
as set out in the convention. It provides for
distinction as to industry, commerce and agriculture by the aùthority defined in the convention. It provides also for penalties as there
defined. In short, it carnies out with an
exactitude that is indeed astonishing-for one
would hardly think it practicable to have such
exactitude-the provisions of the convention.
This is what we really undertook to do when
we adopted the resolution which was debated
at somýe length in this House about six weeks
ago.
Hon. '.nI. GORDON: The Bill will be referred to a committee?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I propose to
have it go before a oommittee as in the case
of the Insurance Bill, and there will be
opportunity for anyone to appear who desires
to be heard. I understand that neither in relation to this Bill nor the Insurance Bill was
opportunity given to those concerned to be
heard before a committee of the otber House.
Therefore it must be done by a com.mittee of
this House.
Has any date
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
been fixed for hearing representations at the
committee stage?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. I intimated this morning that we sbould be able
to hean representations to-morrow afternoon
on the Insurance Bill, but I did that witbout
the authority of the committee. 1 gave no
definite statement.
On motion of Hlon. Mr. Dandurand, the
debate was adjourned.
ECONOMIC COUNCIL OF CANADA BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGREN moved
the second reading of Bill 39, an Act to
establish an Economic Council.
He said: This Bill provides for. establishment by the Prime Minister of an Economic
Council consisting of not more than fifteen
members, seven froma those members of the
Civil Service who have had most to do with
economie inatters, five from social and economie organizations, and three from, what
might be called academic institutions. This
Economie Council, or committees thereof, are
to study matters of a peculiarly economic
nature that require analysis of statistics for

219

their proper determination, and to make reports thereon for the better guidance of the
Goverament in its legislative course. The
Prime Minister is empowered to refer subjeets to the Council. Its secretary is to be
I
the Dominion Statistician, Dr. Coats.
understand be is mainly responsible for the
preparation of the Bill. I do flot wish to
make any pronouncement as to how practically valuable tbe measure is likely to be,
but I certainly feel that if the Dominion
Statistician bas been the presiding genius in
its preparation it probably represents the best
that can be made of the idea, and inasmuch
as he strongly supports the idea, 1 arn disposed to bave considerable respect for it
myseif.
I have nead
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the Bill. The Prime Minister has already
under bis command the officials who would
form part of the proposed committee, and,
as my right honourable frîend knows, quite
often departmental questions are referred to
the experts of various departments. So that
this is but enlarging to a certain extentRight Hon. Mr. METOHEN: That is so.
-the practice
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
which bas obtained for a number of years.
The value of the outside representation on
the Council will be worth just what the men
are wonth themselves. If a wise selection
is made of men well qualified to give advice
in the field of cconomics, for they will he
consulted mostly on economic questions, some
good may come of the proposal. I bave no
objection te the Bill.
Will Parliament
Hon. Mr. HUGHES:
have access to the reports of the Council?
Oh, yes,
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
tbey are to be laid before Parliament each
session.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: At the beginning or
the end of the session?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think at
the beginning. There is to be no pay for
the members of the Council. I know the
honourable senator fromn Essex (Hýon. Mr.
Lacasse) will be glad to hear that.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I think my right
honounable friend is a mind-reader. When
the Bill was introduced in the other House
I thought the Prime Minister simply wanted
the Parliament of Canada to give him the
night to pay certain persons for advising him
on economic matters. I find there is nothing
to be paid to the membens of the proposed

SENATE
Economie Council exoept for travelling expenses, and also, I suppose, for any additional
clerical help that may Le required.
Righit Hon. Mr. MEICHEN:
bursements.

Actual dis-

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: So it Ns immaterial
whether the Economie ýCouncil s comiposed
of tliirteen or a hundred membors. I do not
think it would Le adrisable on tLe part of
this Bouse to prevent the Prime Minister
from se-eking adx-iee in env quarter xx

kind avilI hlp the eountrv .and. provided

end of the session somne schemc of development or of public works throughout the
country. The form. of the work-s and undertakings to be carried on under such a seheme
would cause considerable discussion. However, if the Bill is to go before a standing
ecommittee I may obtain the information 1
arn seeking.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHIEN: I shall have
the Bill go to a standing committee if the
bonourable senator desires it.
Banking and
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Commerce?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: It would be
the Comnmittee on Banking and Commerce.
I will undertake to give the committee ai
the information I have as to how much
wbeat is held, and the extent of the responsibility. I do not know but that I could
go as fer as to say that, if the committee
so desires, it can get ail the information
the Deputy Minister of Trade and Comnmerce bas in bis possession.
I know that
Hon. Mr. DANDÎURAND:
hast year a very interesting statement was
made before a committee of the other House
by 'Mr. McFarhand, wbo, I tbink, is the
head of this organization. It might be worth
wbile to have him before our committee,
if hie is available.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Both honourable gentlemen seem to 'have forgotten the
visit of the mayors to -Ottawa to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. HARMER: To-night.
~Right Hon. Mr. GRA'HAM: Our committee might be able to get from the mayors
a better conception of wha.t the demand is.
I have read, with varying degrees of perception. somne of the speeches that have been
made, and 1 tbink it would be a good idea
to find out what the muniýcipalities want.
My own view is that they want plenty. As
a committee we might be able to assist the
Government by an expression of opinion, if
we heard these gentlemen.
May I be
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
alhowed to throw out a suggestion that bas
occurred to me in connection with the very
serins problem of unemploymen.t? In 1917,
I think, we decided to hevy an income tax,
whicb we called a war measure, to hehp us
in meeting a situation that then existed.
L. is a direct tax, and the provinces might
very welh dlaim that as tbey are limited in
their ability to make imposts the income
tax should be left to tbem. The federal
authority bas many ways of levying charges.

In the budget speech we were told of the
large advances that have been made to most
of the provinces; so we know the serious
situation tbat faces provincial treasuries.
Now, wby shouhd we not make a sacrifice by
repealin-g that war-time measure and transferring income taxation to the provinces, at
the samne time leaving to tbem the entire
obligation of attending to the unemphoyment
problem? If it is said that we cannot do so,
on the ground that unemployment is a matter
of national importance and therefore is necessà,rily witbin federal jurîsdiction, as was said
of tbe unempînyment insurance measure, then
I submit the Dominion Government shouhd
assume full responsibihity for the wbode situation. But if that is not contended, then
the burden could be passed on to the provinces, and by way of compensation the power
to levy income tax be transferred to tbem.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
hand them the sales tax too?

Why not

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I refer to the
income tax because àt is direct taxation.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: So is the
sales tax.
Hon. Mr. LAÇASSE: Honourable mcmbers, reference bas been made to the mayors
of Canada meeting in this building to-nigtnot to-morrow.
Rigaht Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: They meet the
Government to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. LAÇASSE:- To-night tbey wihh
Ne in the Raihway Committee room and wilh
Ne glad to meet members of botb buses.
I think it wouhd be well for bonourable
senators to attend.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Wbat is the time of the
meeting?
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Eight o'clock.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bihl
wvas read the second time.
Tbe Senate adjourned until to-morrow at

Article 9
A Member which bas ratified this convention
may denounce it after the expiration of ten
years froui the date on which the convention
first comes into force, by an act communicated
to the Secretary-General of the League of
Nations for registration.
Such denunciation
shall not take effect until one year after the
date on which it is registered with the
Secretariat.
Each Member which has ratified this convention and which does not, within the year
following the expiration of the period of ten
years mentioned in the preceding paragraph,
exercise the right of denunciation provided for
in this Article, will be bound for another
period of five years and, thereafter. may
denounce this convention at the expiration of
each period of five years under the terms
provided for in this Article,
Article 10
At least once in ten years. the Governing
Body of the International Labour Office shall
present to the General Conference a report of
the working of this convention and shall consider the desirability of placing on the agenda
of the conference the question of its rev'ision
or modification.
Article Il
The French and English texts of this convention shall both be authentic.
And that this House do approve of the same.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would suggest
to the right honourable gentleman that the
debate on this motion be adjourned until Tuesday next. I have net yet had time to peruse
the motion.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am prepared to -consent to the adjournment of the
debate, but perhaps I had better unbosom
myself now of all I know about it.
This is a motion for ratification of a draft
convention made analogously to the draft convention respecting hours of labour, the resolution in respect of which was debated in this
House about six .weeks ago.
The draft convention covered by this resolution ias to do with minimum standards of
wages applicable to trades, the trades comprising manufactures and commerce. The convention was arrived at by delegates to the
International Labour Organization at Geneva
under the auspices of the League of Nations
in June of 1928.
I hope there is no one in this House under
the impression which seems to have in some
way paralysed the usually intelligent minds
of certain other citizens of -Canada. I refer
to the impression that delegates to meetings
of the International Labour Organization, or
of the League of Nations itself, can bind
this Dominion or to any extent prejudge
the will of the Parliament of Canada.
I
have read somewhere the argument that if
what has been said here on behalf of the

Government is correct. then whoever may be
delegated to represent Canada at conferences
of the International Labour Organizationbe it Tom Moore or Paddy Draper, as the
names were stated-can fetter this country,
can arrogate to himself the right of making
legislation, and enter into treaties for us
without reference to the will of this or any
It was even suggested
other Parliament.
that representatives of other countries, being
in the majority at these labour conferences,
can rivet treaties upon us.
Such a preposterous notion would, I think,
find access only with great difficulty to any
mind. The draft conventions arrived at by
these conferences are necessarily submited in
every case to the competent parliamentary
authority of the respective countries there
represented, and have no force or effect whatever until ratified at the instance of such
authority. This resolution is now before us
as a branch of the Canadian Parliament,
in order that one draft convention may be
ratified. If the resolution is passed, ratification follows by executive act.
I am not now going to discuss what has
been pretty thoroughly debated twice already
in this House, tihe question whether or not
we are the competent parliamentary authority in Canada. The reasons adduced six
weeks ago, and two days ago in respect of
the eight-hour-day resolution and the Employnent and Social Insurance Bill, are
applicable in this case. All that behooves
me now is to outline the particulars of the
convention, which the resolution seeks to
have approved, with respect to minimum
wages.
It provides that every one of the participating countries shall establish machinery,
which of course means some competent
organization, with power to bring about
minimum standards throughout that country.
The machinery shall be of such character
as seems best in the judgment of the respective countries. Every individual country is
left free to draw the line separating those
trades or parts of trades--remember that
trades include manufactures and commerce
-with respect to which minimum wages are
to be fixed, from those in which it may not
be necessary to fix minimum wages; but the
convention specifically states it is important
that minimum wages should be fixed with
respect to the small trades, the individual
working units, that is to say such small
units as have not pertaining to them labour
organizations competent of themselves to
regulate fairly the rates of wages. In a word,
the main intention apparently is to cover
that sphere of wages in trades which is not

SENATE
SENATE

2224

224
now in any way safeguarded or superintended by labour organizations.
The convention further provides that one
year after the date upon which two participating countries file their ratifications the
provisions take effect as respects tbose countries; and as respects any other country, within
a vear after it files its ratification.
Each member is free to decide the nature
and form of the minimum wage fixing
machinery, as I pointed out before, and as
well the methods to be followed in its operation. that is to say the plan which the organization will work out. It is provided, however, that there must be inspection with a
view to making certain that employers are
living up to regulations; also tîat there must
be such publicity as will enable the employees
to know what are their rights in respect to
minimum wages. It is provided further that
before standards are set up consultation shall
be had by the organization with organized
labour, or such branch of it as is nearest akin
to the special trade to be regulated, and also
with organizations of employers who are engaged in the trade, or, if there is no such
organization, with the employers themselves.
There is as well a stipulation that the
character of the trades included in the minimum wage legislation of each country shall
be reported to the International Labour Organization, so that it may know just how far
it has been deemed advisable to apply the
minimum in sucl country. Further, every
country legislating in pursuance of a ratified
convention on the subject shall report full
details of the working of the legislation, not
only as to the scope of its operation, but also
as to results achieved, difficulties encountered,
and the like.
This convention was probably more difficult
to formulate than any other I know of. I
have not read any which is more elastic in its
provisions. and I feel certain this elasticity is
the i!csult of the conflicting positions of the
vario s nations and the impossibility of meet-

ing the full requirements of any.
The convention, if ratified, lasts for ten
years. It may then be denounced on one
year's notice. If it is not denounced at the
expiration of ten years it continues for five
years longer, and so on for periods of five
years.
The French and English texts of the convention shall both be regarded as authentic.
Our legislation to ratify this convention will
provide that wherever by virtue of provincial
enactments there are minimum wage laws
effecting a minimum wage higher than that
R

ht Hon.

Mr. MEtGHEN.

fixed by the machinery established by the
federal law, the higher minimum wage so
fixed by provincial law shall prevail.
I understand that
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX:
in certain trades regulations have already
been accepted by both employers and employees and adopted, and are working satisfactorily. Does this proposed legislation impose new duties on those trades?
It would
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
not necessarily do so, for the reason that the
board, or whatever body may be established,
can draw the line between those trades in
whieh the law and regulations operate and
those in which they do not. It is free to do
so by virtue of the original convention.
Consequently I should think where minimum
wages have been agreed upon and are pretty
thoroughly controlled by agreements between
employers and employees there would not be
much need of this measure. In fact, it is
very clear from the convention itself that
where it is intended to have effect is in those
areas in which there is no protection by
labour organizations.
HonourHon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
able senators, my request for the adjourment
of the debate is fully justified by the opinion
expressed by my right honourable friend in
his opening remarks. He said there was an
erroneous impression abroad, to which expression had been given elsewhere, that
representatives of labour and of employers
attending the labour conferences at Geneva
-and he mentioned two gentlemen whom I
have had the pleasure of meeting on the
other side-could be a law unto themselves
and bind Canada to discharge obligations
entered into with a number of other nations
of the world.
My right honourable friend has not donc
justice to the problem. It is being affirmed
that a draft convention adopted by a labour
conference and concurred in by representatives
of Canadian employers and employees operates to empower this Parliament to appropriate jurisdiction that belongs to the provinces, and thereby lay the basis for altering
our Constitution. This is the important point.
According to the theory of my right honourable friend's Government, a draft convention
passed at a labour conference gives jurisdiction to the Federal Parliament to invade
pro tanto the jurisdiction of the provinces.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
debate was adjourned.

Mr. Meighen.
ECONOMIC COUNCIL 0F CANADA BILL
THIRD READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
third reading of Bill 39, an Act to establish
an Economie Council.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable senators,
1 understand there are two slight amendments
to be made to the Bill. I therefore move:That this Bill be flot now read a third time,
but that it be amended as follows:
Page 1, line 11, for "Prime Minister" substitute "miember of the King's Privy Council
for Canada who holds the recognized position
of First Minister."
Page 1, Iine 15, leave out the word "Prime."
Right Hon. Mr. ME'IGHEN: The words
"Prime Minister" are not used in statutes; in
fact they have no meaning except in the
popular mind. The statute creating the
D.epartment of External Affairs describes the
Prime Minister in the language of the amendment, and it is that department of which the
Prime Min ister is the head. The second
ameudment merely conforrus to the first.
"Minister" is dcfined in the Bill as the Prime
Minister. Consequently when the terni "Prime
Minister" is used subsgequently it should be
just the word "Minister."
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I suppose an
acting Prime Minister would be covered by
thât amendment.
Righit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, under
the Interpretation Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The expression
"Prime Minister" had no place in the machinery of government in England until quite
recently. I noticed lately that in olden times
in France the description "le Premier Ministre"

225

was given to the first councillor of the King.
It crossed the Channel and was adopted as the
titie of the first couneillor of His Britannic
Mai esty. The expression, after being Iost sight
of in France for one hundred years, waa
borrowed from the British parliamentary
system, and now it is current in both
countries.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Calder was
agreed to.
The motion of Right Hon. Mr. Meighen
for the third reading of the Bill was agreed
to, and the Bill was read the third time, and
passed.

Senate meets again next Tuesday I expect to
have further legal advice, which I consider wil
be as good legal advice as can be obtained in
this Canada of ours. If the advice is that the
Bill is in the public interest, I shall then proceed
with it; if not, I shahl asic that it be dropped.
I move, therefore, that this Order be discharged and be placed on the Order Paper for
Tuesday next.
The Order was discharged.

MOTION FOR SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of the motion for the second reading
of Bill 21, an Act to provide for limiting the
Hours of Work in Industrial Undertakings to

in accordance with the Convention concerning
the application of the principle of the Eight

SENATE

Government in October, 1932, long after the
decision of the Privy Council in the Radio
and Aviation cases; one year and eight months
afterwards. My right honourable friend said
that he hoped to be able to meet me in this
Chamber after the Privy Council had expressed
an opinion on the validity of this social legislation, and in order that we may be judged
by those who come after us, I desire to complete the record by citing the Order in Council:
The Committee of the Privy Council have had
before them a report, dated 13th October, 1932,
from the Minister of Justice, submitting that
he has had under consideration, upon reference
from the Department of Labour, the authentic
text of the dra-ft convention limiting hours of
work in coa: mines, adopted by the International
Labour Conference at its fifteenth session (28th
May-18th June, 1931), with a view to determining whether and to what extent the subjectmatter of this draft convention lies within the
competence of Parliament or of the provincial
legi'latures, in order that the said draft convention may be brought by the Dominion Government, in discharge of its obligation under
article 405 of the Treaty of Versailles and the
corresponding article of the other treaties of
peace, before the authority or authorities within whose competence the matter lies, for legislative or other action.
The MinisterThat is the Minister of Justice.
-observes that the draft convention embodies
various provisions with regard to the regulation
of hours of work of workers employed in coal
mines, that is to say, in any mine from which
hard coal or lignite, or principally hard coal
or lignite together with other minerals, is
extracted. It contemplates that such provisions
shall be given compulsory effect against the
management of every mine to which such
provisions are to be respectively made applicable. Ratification of the convention would consequently involve an obligation on the part of
each government concerned to give effect te
the provisions of the convention by legislative
action in so far as existing iaws may not afford
adequate authority for that purpose.
The provisions of the convention which
require legislative action to make them effective
clearly involve legislation which, in its subjectmatter, would be directly concerned with classes
of subjects assigned exclusively to the provincial legislatures by section 92 of the British
North America Act, 1867: in particular "local
work and undertakings" [section 92 (10)];
"property and, civil rights in the province"
[section 92 (13)] and perhaps also "generally
all matters of a merely local or private nature
While
in the province" [section 92 (16)].
legislation upon the subject-matter of the
provisions of the convention might perhaps
be enacted by the Parliament of Canada in an
ancillary or incidental way in relation to any
coal mine which bas been declared to be a
work for the general advantage of Canada

parts of Canada inoluded within the several
provinces, primarily vested in the provincial
legislatures and that it is within the competence of the several provincial governmenta
by appropriate legislative .action to give effect
to the proposals of the convention generally
and comprehensively, exeept for those parts of
Canada which are not included within the
'limits of any province. As to the latter,
exclusive legislative jufrisdiction in relation te
the subject-matter of the convention is vested
in the Parliament of Canada. The Minister
observes that the decision of the Supreme Court
of Canada in the matter of legislative jurisdiction over hours of bubour (1925, SC.R. 505)
affords strong support for the opinion above
expressed.
The CommitteeThat is the whole Government.
-concur
in the foregoing and advise that a
copy hereof, together with an authenticated
copy of the draft convention, be transmitted
to the lieitenant-governors of the respective
provinces for the consideration of their respective governments with a view to the enactment
of legislation or such other action upon the
subject-matter of the draft convention, within
the provincial] sphere of jurisdiction, as each
government may be advised to take.
All of which is respectfully suibmitted for
Your Excellency's approvaL.
E. J. Lemaire,
Clerk of the Privy Council.
I wish only to say that the law of 1932 is,
I think, still the law in 1935.
It is truc th'at some weeks ago we voted
here for the convention with respect to the
eight-hour day or forty-eight-hour week, as
affecting in part the federal domain; for it
must not be forgotten that tiat convention
could apply in part to the federal jurisdiction
as well as to the provincial. Because it could
be made so to apply, I bad no objection to
its adoption. Now there is pre-sented to us
a measure, based upon that convention,
which to my mind invades the rights of the
provinces.
It has been urged that sinice the British
Empire signed the Tre'aty of Versailles, Canada is obligated under it because section 132
of the British North America Act so provides.
I do not share that view. On that point only
will I ask this Chanber to bear with me
briefly, for I do not intend to traverse the
whole field again. I said, and I repeat, that
section 132 decs not apply with respect to
our obligations under the Versailles Treaty,
because Great Britain did not sign alonedid not speak for the whole Empire. The
Dominions spoke for themselves and signed
tlie treaty. Thus they projeýcted their personalities into it. They did so officially, with
the full knowledge and consent of alU the
other signatory powers. If Great Britain had
signed clone. Canada would have been placed
under obligation towards those powers, ac-

cording to section 132. Wliat is the consequence arising from our participation in and
signing of the treaty? It is that Great Britain
did lot. bind Canada and thie other Dominrions by its signature. This 'Parliament
alone oan bind Canada. The treaty was preseunted to us for ratifihcation and we could
have rejected it, just as the United States did.
I contend that, had we re'jetLd it, we should
have had no obligations towards the other
signatories, the foreign countries, within the
meaning of section 132 of our Constitution.
Canada did not take part in the Lausanne
Treaty. When we were asked to ratify that
treaty of peace between Great Britain and
Turkey we refused, and we declared in no uncertain manner, through our Prime Minister,
that Canada dîd not intend to, assume any
obligations under it. True, the King signed
the treaty and Canada naturally recognized
that she and ai other parts cf the Commonwealth were no longer at war with

House
was at that time in the Comsnons, and I
have not had occasion to. look up his attitude
on this question. At any rate, Canada abso]utely refused to aocept the obligations that
would flow from that treaty.

Hon. Mr. LEIMUX: What about the

Trianon Treaty?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I think we
signed the Trianon Treaty. The outside world
was slow to understand our international
status. We developed constitutionally into
a position that had not previous1y been known
in international law. The Statute of Westminster has clarified the matter officially for
the world at large.
As I have said, we were at Versailles and
signed the treaty, but in order that this
country Ëhould be bound it was necessary
for Parliament to ratify it. I will quote a
statement made by the then Prime Minister,
Right Hon. Sir Robert Borden, when lie
presented the treaty for the approval. of the
House of Commons, on the 2nd of September,
1919. He said:
Whatever doubt may exist in other cases, it
is unquestionable that this treaty should lie

subrnitted to Parliament for its consideration
and approval before ratification on behaîf of
Canada takes place. The formaI ratification is
of course in the naine of the Sovereign; but in
giving that ratification on behalf of Canada,
His Majesty necesearily acts at the instance of
hie constitutional advisers in this country.
Proceeding to explain our statue at Paris
when the treaty was being negotiated, lie

I now corne to consider the character of the
representation secured by Canada at the Conference, ber position as a signatory of the
treaties concluded there.
After referring to some sessions of the Imperial War Cabinet, lie dealt with his presence
in London in November, 1918, when the
status of the Dominions at the Peace Conference was diseussed. He said:
In the end I proposed that there should lie
a distinctive representation for each Dominion
similar to that accorded to the amaller Allied
Powers, and in addition that the Britishi Empire
representation of five delegates should lie
selected froin day to day froin a panel made up
of representatives of the United Kingdem and
the Dominions. This proposal was adopted by
the Imperial War Cabinet...
The Preliminary Peace Conference began at
Paris on January 12, 19,19, and the question of
procedure, including that of representation,
was immediately taken up by the representa.
tives of the principal Allied and Asoiated
Powers, afterwards commonly known as the
Councjl of Ten. At firet strong objection was,
made to the proposed representation of the
British Dominions. Subsequently there was a
full discussion in the British Empire delegation, at which a firin protest wae made against
any receesion froin the proposai adopted in
London. In the end that proposai was aceepted.
A little further on, dealing with what took
place at the Peace Conference, lie said:
It is desirable to note an important development in constitutional practice respecting the
.signature of the various treaties concluded at
the Conference. Hitherto it lias been the practice to insert an article or reservation providing for the adhesion of the Dominions. In
view of the new position that had been secured
and of the part played by Dominion representatives at the peace table, we thouglit this
method inappropriate and undesirable in connection with the Peace Treaty. Accordingly
1 proposed that the assent of the King as Hi¶li
Contracting Party to the various treaties should
in respect of the Dominions lie eignified by the
signature of the Dominion plenipotentiariesRiglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Hear, liear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
-nd
that the preamble and other formal parts
of the treaties should be draîted -accordin ly.
This proposai was adopted in tlie form oi a
memorandum by aIl the Dominion Prime Ministers at a meeting whidli 1 sumnmoned, and
was put forward by me on tlieir behaîf to the
British Empire delegation, by wbom it was
accepted.
The proposaI was subsequently
adopted by the Conference -and the various
treaties bave been drawn up accordingly, soc
that the Dominions appear therein as signatories. and their concurrence in the treaties
is thus given in the saine manner as that of
other nations.
Towards tliose nations we are responsible if
any obligation flows from our signature.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Precisely wliat
I said yesterday.

SENATE

228

That is not
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
exactly what my right honourable friend said.
Sir Robert Borden went on:
developinent
This important constitutional
involved the issuance by the King, as High
Contraeting Party, of full powers to the various
Dominion plenipotentiary delegates. In order
that such powers issued to the Canadian

plenipotentiaries inight be based upon formal
action of the Canadian Government. an Order
in Council was passed on April 10, 1919, granting the necessary authority. Accordingly I
addressed a communication to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom requesting that
neceesary and appropriate steps should be taken
to establish the connection between this Order
in Concil and the issuance of the full powers
by His Majesty so that it might formally
appear of record that they were issued on the
responsilility of the Government of Canada.

And he closed his speech with the following
statement:
On behalf of my country I stood firmly upon
this solid ground; that in this, the greatest
of all w ars. in which the world's liberty, the
world's justice, in short the world's future
destiny were at stake. Canada had led the
deiocracies of both the American continents.
Her resolve had given inspiration, her sacrifices
had been conspicuous. her effort was unabated
to the end. The saine indomitable spirit which
made lier capable of that effort and sacrifice
made her equally incapable of accepting at the
Peace Conference, in the League of Nations, or
elsewhere. a status inferior to that accorded
to nations less advanced in their development,
less amply endowed in wealth, resources and
their
more complote in
population.
no
sovelreignty

and

far less conspicuous

in their

saicrifice.
This, I believe, justifies me in repeating
that under section 132 of the British North

America Act the obligations of Canada are
solely towards foreign nations. And the
foreign nations towards whom we should be
obligated under the Treaty of Versailles are
the signatories to the treaty, naturally. If
this Parliament had refused to approve the
Treaty of Versailles, would Canada be bound
by it? I have no hesitation in answering in
the negative. Under neither international
law nor moral law should we be bound.
Ail the signatories were fully aware of our
situation, that we were present at the Conference as their equals in the negotiations
leading up to the treaty. We had participated
from A to Z in the Conference, and the
signatories officially recognized our situation.
I will close with one practical suggestion.
Since the present Government refuses to consuit the Supreme Court as to the validity
of all this legislation, notwithstanding that
within the last twelve months it went to that
tribunal for advice on three matters of far
less importance, I suggest that it reconvene
the interprovincial conference that was called
iLRmi lt i.

Mr. MEIGIIEN.

for November last to discuss the division of
legislative powers and was adjourned because
the Government suddenly decided, without
consulting the provinces, to appropriate certain powers to which they claim exclusive
right. Well, it has to face responsibility for
that to-day, as it will have to do in the
years to come. I have good reason to believe that such a conference would be a
successful one. My honourable friend frorn
De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) read
yesterday a statement to the effect that the
Prime Minister of the province of Quebec
had expressed his willingness to attend a
conference. I am convinced that if one were
held within the next three months the provinces would agree to the transfer of jurisdiction in most of this social legislation to
the federal authority.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: May I ask
the honourable gentleman what good that
would be if the legislation is in fact ultra
vires?
I realize that
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the Constitution cannot be changed by mere
consent of the provinces. But if such consent were obtained a resolution addressed to
the Imperial Parliament could be based upon
it and passed during this present session,
should we adjourn over Easter.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I thought
the suggestion was to hold a conference after
three months.
No; I said
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
within three months. It could be called
to-morrow.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We meet the
mayors to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think my right
honourable friend will not contradict me
when I say that if the Easter adjournment
lasts six weeks it will be at least three months
fron now before we prorogue. Certainly a
conference could be held within three months,
and indeed within thirty days. I am convinced that the whole discussion upon the
validity of this legislation could be waived
by an agreement with the provinces. Of course
there would have to be a resolution passed
by this Parliament.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: How long
would it take before the law could be put
into effect?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: By following my
suggestion the Government would satisfy the
public that this legislation is of serious intent,
with the consent of the provinces behind it,
and not merely an election gesture.

MARCH 28, 1935
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think we
should satisfy them that we were siniply
monkeying with the situation.
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Further
monkeying.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I cannot understand why a conferen-ce that was called for
November cannot be reconvened in April.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It would
mean another year's delay.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It would mean
that legisiation cou.ld be enacted rwith an
assurance from the provinces that they agree
upon a resolution to be pa.ssed by this very
Parliament before we prorogue, asking the
Imperial Parliament to smend our Constitution. I have suggested that we do only
wbat 1 think is fair, and what we should do
if we were twenty-four months away from
the turmoil of an impending election. We
should go to the Supreme Court, es the ýright
honourabie gentleman and his Goverument
have done in the last twelve months. "Oh,"
my right honourable friend says, "the question
would then go to the Privy Council and take
another year or so." No, not a reference to
the Supreme Court, which, at ail events,
would give us prima facie assurance, if we
are on safe ground. If the Goverument wil
not follow that course, I say, reconvene the
provincial conference and see if you cannot
within the next two monthýs obtain the consent of the provinces to a resohition- addressed
to the Imperial Parliament rcquesting an
amendrnent to our Constitution to enable
the Parliament of Canada to enact this legislation.

framed the British North America Act under,
I may say, a providential inspiration in order
to ensure the progress, prosperity and
happiness of a population of different racial
enigins and religions creeds, and to we.ld it
into a happy nation. In my early years 1
came into personal contact with some of those
great statesmen, and many of their cloquent
words are stili resonant in my heart. I refer
to about the time of the sehool. trouble in New
Brunswick, some sixty-four years ago. I have
no douibt that every honourable member is
just as sincere an admirer of our Constitution
as I am.
On Apnil 15, 1925. a few years after I became
a member of this honourable House, I introduced a motion advocating the recognition
and maintenance tif provincial rights. I con-

229

tended that, the British North Amenica Act
was a solemn contratit and could not be
changed without the consent of all the provinces. I shaHl neyer forget the warm congratulations I received from many honourable
members on both sides. Some of those who
then so eloquently and forcibly supported my
motion have since gone to, their eternal
reward, but there still remain the honourable
senator from Grandville (Hon. Mr. Chapaîs),
the honourable senator from Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien), the honourbale senator
from North York (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth)
and the honourable senator from De'Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand). These distinguishied
members of the leýgal profession expressed
appreciation. of the motion in termis beyond
my fondest expectations.
In speaking to my motion I related my
study oif the Constitution and outli-ned my
correspondence with Sir Wilfrid Laurier xi
1906 and 1907. We both came to the conclusion that no constitutional change couid be
made without the unanimous consent of the
provinces.
The Fathers oif Confederation did flot build
this Dominion in the expectation that it would
last for only a few years. They did not intend
to take away from the old Eastern Provinces
their rich revenues, revenues which maintained
the population of the Maritimes in pràsperity
and fraternal happiness. The Fathers of Confederation had no intention to unite sucb a
vast country with links se weak that they
might break at any time under the stress of
the least egotism or passing emotion of a few
honest but misguided spirits. The Fathers oif
Confederation united British North America in
the strong bonds of fraternity, generosity, justice and charity, in the confident hope that the
population would eventually number 50,000,000
or more and that Cana-da would become a
great nation. To bring about Confederation
the provinces made sacrifices. They gave to
the Dominion their best sources oif revenue,
their customs and excise taxes and postal service. Without those concessions on the part
of the provinces no Federal Goveroment could
function.
I submit the Parliament oif Canada bas no
power to change the Constitution. The provinces may be asked to agree to amendments
to the Constitution to meet changed economie
and social conditions, but no action to this end
can be taken without the unanimous consent
tif the provinces.

made between the provinces and the Dominion, and I repeat, changes can be made only
by consent of all the provinces.
In this connection may I quote from a
speech delivered by the Hon. Mr. Açlderley
when introducing the British North America
Act in the British House of Commons. He
said:
The louse may ask what occasion there can
be for our interfering in a question of this
description.
It will, however, I think, be
manifest, upon reflection, that, as the arrangement is a matter of mutual concession on the
part of the Provinces, there must be some
external authority to give a sanction to the
compact into which they have entered. It is
very true we have often given to colonies,
secondary in importance to these, the task of
framîing their own constitution. A general Act
was passed two years ago which gives to all
colonies with representative institutions the
power, at any time, of altering their Constitution within certain limits; but it is clear
the process of federation is impracticable to
the constituent Legislatures. If again, fedjeration bas in this case specially been a matter
of most delicate treaty and compact between
the Provinces--if it has been a matter of
mutual concession and compromise-it is clearly
necessary that there should be a third party
ab extra to give sanction to the treaty made
between them. Such seems to me the office we
have to perform in regard to this Bill.
I may say that recently representatives of
the Maritime Provinces assembled hiere in
complete accord to interview the Government
and request just treatment. Now the Government is seeking to take from the provinces
more of their privileges and to invade a jurisdiction of the greatest importance, the jurisdiction of the provinces with respect to hours
of labour and other social matters.
The Premier of Nova Scotia, the Hon.
Angus Macdonald, before leaving Ottawa last
January expressed his dissatisfaction with the
Bill then before Parliament which takes away
certain provincial rights. He said:
The Premier of Quebec, Hon. L. A.
Taseit-reau. bas already reiterated the statement that no change can be made in the Constitution ivithout the unanimous consent of the
nine provinces.
In an interview given to the press Hon. Mr.
Macdonald stated:
Before Mr. Bennett puts in reform measures
affeùting the provinces, be should consult the
provinces. tt is not fair that be should dangle
legislation before the provinces with the idea
that pbilic opinion will force them in line.
without respect to the needs of the individual
provinces.
At a federal-provincial conference a year ago
I suggested that an exhaustive study should' be
made of the British North America Act. I do
not believe that vital provisions of the Act,
such as mîinority rights, should be touched; but
I thinl
that financial matters could be readjusted withouit changing greatly the character
of the Act.
Hon. Mr. TURGEON.

The time, however, for the Dominion to get
together with the provinces to tührash out
respective jurisclictions is after an election, not
before. J think, though, that the provinces
should at least bave been consulted, before any
federal measure which would require enabling
legislation from them is passed.
The honourable the Premier of Nova
Scotia is a distinguisbed lawyer and well
known throughout the country.
,I ha,ve before me a statement by the
Hon. Mr. Taschereau, Premier of Quebec.
I cite the last sentence:
Let ne speak for a moment as leader of this
Government to say that I am not prepared to
permit the British North America Act to be
changed by the will of a majority of the provinces. We have built certain things here in
this old province; we have created institutions
whiclh are dear to us, and we don't want them
done away with to suit the caprice of even a
majority of the provinces.
I think these -expressions of opinion represent pretty well the attitude of the provinces on the question of changing the Constitution.

The right honourable leader of the House
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), of whose eloquence and literary and legal talents there
is no greater admirer tran his humble friend
from Gloucester, w-ihen speaking of the draft
labour conventions some time ago asked
whether it would ever be possible for Canada to make any real progress in the way of
keeping itself abreast of the adv.ances in
social legislation throughout the world if we
were always going to say that, we must wait
until all the provinces are in agreement.
Well, I take the liberty of replying, it will
be easy at any time to get the decision of
the provinces if the Government will submit
its case to them. It will be better for the
Federal Government to proceed calmly and
fraternally, for without the co-operation of
the provinces Confederation would not be
possible.
The provinces, I may say, have always
given their best attention to the condition
of the working classes. :Many years ago the
Government of Quebec sponsored legislation
respecting labour accidents. Under this legislation a labourer injured in the course of
bis employment is given medical attention
at the expense of the employer and the
province, and while ho is in hospital his
family is maintained.
The province of New Brunswick bas also
a similar law. It was enacted inl1918, when
the honourable senator from Saint John
(Hon. Mr. Foster) was Premier. It bas been
of great benefit to the workers in mills,
lumber camps and factories. Not only bas
this legislation been of benefit to the workers;
it bas aIso enured to the advantage of the

4

employers, for 'by taking every possible
means to prevent accidents they reduce their
costs.
I need not recail the Jnternational Labour
Conference held at Washington in 11)19 and
the delay in iinplementing tihe draft convention then entered into. This has been
adequately deait with by the honourable
leader on tibis @ide of the Bouse (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand). He quoted tihe opinion of Hon.
Mr. Doherty, then Minister of Justice, an
emînent lawyer, to the effect. that eigbt-hourday legislation is a matter for the provinces
to deal with.
If the provinces confer together and decide
to transfer their jurisdiction over matters
dealing with the hours of labour I shall be
ready to accept theïr decision. Otherwise I
submit the Government should not, proceed
with this motion, for it may find the provinces taking steps to petîtiion the Imperial
Government to protect their rights and
privileges.
-In my judgment the Government should
secure the consent of all the provinces before
taking further action. In a word, it should
wbide by the Constitution.

INTERNATIONAL LABOUR
CONVENTION
MINIMUM

WAGES

The Senate resumed from Thursday, March
28, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Right Hon. Mr. Meighen:
That it is expedient that Parliament do
approve of the convention concerning the
creation of minimum wage fixing machinery
adopted as a draft convention by the General
Conference of the International Labour Organization of the League of Nations at its Eleventh
Session in Geneva on the 16th day of June,
1928.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
Honourable members of the Senate, in order that
this Chamber may know the extent of the
jurisdiction which will be claimed under this
convention, I crave permission to read the
first four articles of the convention.
Article 1
Each Member of the International Labour
OrganizationThat means each nation.
Each Member of the lnternational Labour
Organization which ratifies this convention
undertakes to create or naintain nachinery
whereby mniniuni rates of wages can be fixed
for workers employed in certain of the trades
or parts of trades (and in particular in home
working trades) in which no arrangements exist
for the effective regulation of wages by collective agreement or otherwise and wages are
exceptionally low.
For the purpose of this convention the terni
"trades" includes manufacture and comnnerce.
Article 2
Eaclh Member whici ratifies this convention
shail be free to decide after consultation with
the organizations. if any, of workers and
employers in the trade or part of trade concerned,. in which trades or parts of trades, and
in particular in whib home working trades or
parts of suci trades. the minimum wage fixing
machinery referred to in Article i shahl be
applied.
Rigit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Article 3
Eaci Member which ratifies this convention
shall be free to decide the nature and form
of the min.imum wage fixing machinery, and
the methods to be followed in its operation:
Provided that,
(1) Before the machinery is applied in a
trade or part of trade, representatives of the
employers and workers concerned, including
representatives of their respective organizations,
if any, shall be consulted as well as any other
persons, being specially qualified for the purpose by their trade or functions, whom the
competent autbority deems it expedient to
consult;
(2) The employers and workers concerned
shall b associated in the operation of the
nachinery, in such manner and to, such extent,
but in any case in equal numbers and on equal
ternis, as may be determined by national laws
or regulations;
(3) Minimum rates of wages which bave been
fixed shall be bind:ing on the enployers and
w-orkers concerned so as not to be subjeet to
abatement by themi by individual agreement,
nor, except with the general or particular
authorization of the competent authority. by
collective agreement.
Article 4
Each Menber which ratifies this convention
shall take the necessary measures. by iway of
a systens of supervision and sanctions. to
ensure that the emsployers and vorkers concerned are inforned of the minimum rates of
wages in force and that wages are not paid
at less than these rates in cases where thev are
applicable.
A worker to whon the minimum rates are
applicable and vho has been paid wages at less
than these rates shall be entitled to recover,
by judicial or other legalized proceedîings. the
amount by wihicih ie has been underpaid, subject to such limitation of timie as osayv be
determined by national laws or regulations.
I desire first to draw the attention of this
Chamber to the fact that this legislation
covers, and can only cover, contracts to
hire, which. under clause 92 of the British
North America Act, form part of and fall
under the title of property and civil rights.
Heretofore legislation such as is being introduced under this convention has been a
matter of exclusively provincial jurisdiction,
and all the provinces in which industries
exist have legislated in various ways and to
various extents in that field.
In order to know what ground has been
covered by the provinces, I looked up the
code of labour and industrial laws of the
province of Quebec, a large quarto volume
of 320 pages, in which is contained a record
of the varied activities of the Legislature
dealing with nearly everything that would
seem to be necessary for the protection of
labour. Among the provincial enactnents
and regulations to which reference is made

APRIL 2, 1935
are the Industrial and Commercial Establ-ishments Act, the classification of dangerous.
unhealthy or incommodioue establishments,
regulations relatoing to ail principal trades, an
Act respecting the Limitation of Hours of
Work, an Act respecting the Extension of
Collective Labour Agreements--a most, interesting and important piece of legisiation,
an Act respecting the Priviieges of Workmen, an Act respecting Electricians and
Electrical Installations, an Act respecting
Meehanics, iPlumbing and Pipe Workers, an
Act respecting Stationary Enginemen, Steam
Boilers and Pressure Vessels, an Act respecting Unemployment Bureaus, an Act respecting Workmexfs 'Compensation, an Act respecting a Minimum Wage for Women and
Children, an Act respecting One day of Rest
Eacli Week, an Act respecting 'Investigations
in Industrial Disputes, and an Act respecting
Councils of Conciliation and Arbitration. 1
arn naming simply the principal measures.
'Under the Act respecting the Extension of
Collective Labour Agreements a considerable
number of agreements have been made which
are absolutely in accord with the provisions
of this convention and which comnpletely
cover the activities of numerous trades. That
Act is practically along the lines of article
4, 'which I read. I have in my hand an
extension of a collective labour agreement
relating to the clothing industry, and it
applies to ail activities in that industry. As
I have said, a number of such agreements
have been made under this Act, and I believe
that they might well bie studied by Dominion
Government officiais who have to frame legislation under the convention.
I feel sure that if I looked I shouid find
that the great industrial province of Ontario,
like the province of Quebec, lias flot been
remisa in its duty of legislating with respect
to the social needs of its people.
This legislation which we are passing here
will, as my right honourable friend lias said,
supersede certain provincial laws. I wonder
if it will flot create havoc in the provinces,
where there ha.s gradualiy been built up a sy&tem, of iaws to meet their own needs. Mter
ail,,we must not forget, when thinking of the
authority of this Parliament, that we represent the same people who are represented in
the legislatures. I have referred only to the
two provinces of Ontario and Quebec, because
they are the most highly industrialized,
Ontario leading the way for the whole
Dominion; but what we do here will of
course apply tbroughout the other seven
provinces as wcll. Legisiation sucli as we
have now before us is not at ail extraordinary,
for the provinces have to a large extent

covered the same ground. The only reason
they have not gone farther is that their
people did not want them to do so. We are
called upon now to decide that; the provinces
have not gone far enougli in some respects.
Well, I will not con rovert the statement
that lawe can always be improved. They
are 'being improved in our legisiatures, as
well as in our Parliament, all the time. But
what will be the effeet of superimposing upon
the provinces measures respecting needs wbich
they feel have already been pretty weli
attended toi'
As 1 said when I moved the adjournment
of this debate, the fact that the International
Labour Organization decides that certain
legislation is desirable does not give us the
right to oust the provinces from their flelds
of jurisdiction. I have repeated this more
than once, and to-day I draw attention particularly to what the provinces theniselves
have done. I will not further challenge the
vote to he taken, for the Government will
have to take responsiblity for the legisiation
wben, later on, various parts of the country
contend that it was ultra vires of Parliament.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGIIEN: Honourable senators, 1 think a fair statement of
my honourable friend's position would lie
this. Here is another draft convention which
we are seeking to ratify, the subjeet-matter
of which, inasmucli as it deals with scales
of wages, is ordinarily within provincial jurisdiction. In this sphere the provinces have
presumably passed many enactments, by
virtue of which there is already in effect what
we are trying to have done in compliance
with the draft convention. To this hie adds
the general objection that the proposed legislation is ultra vires of Parliament for the
very reason that it covers subi ects which
ordinarily are under provincial jurisdiction.
I know that the subjeet of rates of wages,
entirely aside fromn our position in reslpect
of international agreements and our general
right of legislation in trade and commerce,
is a matter under provincial jurisdiction.
Speciflc cases are undoubtedly in that category. I do not for a moment intend to
traverse again the subjeet of our rights and
the duty that rests upon us because of our
desire to take our place with other countries
in what we believe to lie advancement in
this sphere. But I urge this consideration
upon the Huse. Suppose ail provinces in
Canada had some legisiation providing a
minimum wage for men and women in different classes of industry-and they have notwould ouïr duty be in the least. affected by
that? One of the purposes of international

234

SENATE

arrangements on this subject is to produce
uniformity. What uniformity would there be
if we left the matter to the nine provinces?
What uniformity is there now? In some
provinces we have no minimum wage legislation at all. Even in the province to which
my honourable friend referred specifically by
cataloguing some of its enactments, there is
minimum wage legislation only in respect of
women and children.
No, not under
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the Act respecting the Extension of Collective
Labour Agreements. That is progressive.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Certainly,
they have Acts validating or authorizing
voluntary agreements; but that is not legislation fixing a minimum wage.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The agreements
become compulsory.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I know, but
they do not cease to be voluntary. In so
far as there is a statutory limitation, it is
applicable to women and children alone. I
do not think there is any statutory minimum
in Ontario outside of that limitation. How can
it be argued that when other countries are
moving and many have adopted this legislatien we can rest on our oars, and because
Quebec bas imposed a minimum, whatever
it may be, on the wages of women and children, and Ontario and British Columbia have
done the same, and Manitoba somewhat the
same, we can consider that sufficient, and on
the plea of functus officio let the Dominion
stand idly by? The fact is, all those other
enactments do not concern minimum wages
at all, and this Bill has nothing to do with
them. They relate to conditions of labour,
health, and so forth. This is a Bill to establisb
machinery for the fixing of minimum wages
throughout Canada, whereby the unanimity
contemplated by international arrangements is
brought about.
There was an implied objection to the
legislation in my honourable friend's speech,
on the ground that under this machinery
there might be conflict between provincial
and Dominion regulations. That would be a
formidable objection in relation to conditions of labour, health, and so on. But I
cannot see how there can be any confliet in
respect of minimum wages. When a province fixes a higher minimum this Bill maintains the provincial legislation. That is the
way the conflict he fears is avoided.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I draw my right
bonourable friend's attention to clause 3,
article 3, to which the provincial jurisdiction
conforms.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This is article
3:
Each Member which ratifies this convention
shall be free to deoide the nature and form of
the minimum wage fixing machinery, and the
methods to be followed in its operation:
Provided that,
(1) Before the nachinery is applied in a
trade or part of trade, representatives of the
employers and workers concerned, including
representatives of their respective organizations,
if any, shahl be consulted as well as any other
persons, being specially qualifiedand so on.
(2) The employers and workers concerned
shall be associated in the operation of the
machinery, in such manner and to such extent,
but in any case in equal numbers and on equal
teris. as may be determined by national laws
or regulations.
That is in the operation.
(3) Minimum rates of wages which have
been fixed shall be binding on the employers and
workers concerned so as not to be subject to
abateient by them by individual agreementHon. Mr. DANDURCAND:
Quebec legislation.

That is the

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Certainly,
that is the whole intent. If the major
strength has been on the side, say, of the employer in Quebec, and he has fixed a minimum wage which it is believed is below what
it should be in the national and the international interest, then of course Dominion
legislation supersedes it should our minimum
be above that of the province. If theirs is
above ours, theirs supersedes by virtue of this
enactment. Consequently there is no opportunity for conflict.
I want to say only one word on the subject
of general jurisdiction. Perhaps it will ibe
of more interest to the lawyers of this
Chambor than to other members. Already
the subject has been twice discussed, and
In the
quite elaborately, in this House.
November issue of last year and the February
issue of this year of the Journal of Comparative Legislation and Constitutional Law
will be found a very careful examination of
this question by a legal writer, Mr. C. Wilfred Jenks. Any lawyer who reads the articles
will see that the author lias very thoroughly
studied the subject and exhibits a mastery
of it greater than bas been shown in these debates, or, I think, in any judgment of our
courts. I am not going to say what his conclusions are, but I earnestly hope that if he
has an opportunity of reading what I have said
in this House his satisfaction will be somewhat commensurate with the satisfaction I
experienced in reading his articles.

lion. Mr. BELAND. Have the provinces
been invited to express their ratification of
this convention?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGH.EN: I cannot

practice. initiated by the Goverument of

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I simply desire
to draw attention to one feature of these Bills,
No. 47 and No. 49, both of which I suppose are
before us. The provisional vote of one-twelfth
should be passed, it goes without saying, and
the request under the other Bill cannot be
denied, because we must meet our liabilities;
but I would point out that we are voting
$49,000,000 to meet the deficits of the Canadian National Railways, and I want to remind
my right honourable friend that all has not
been done by this Government that could
have been donc to bring about a better
showing by the Canadian National. For the
last three years we have worked diligently to
try to frame legislation which would allow
of economies being effected by the two railways coming together, but the machinery
provided for that purpose has not yet been

SECOND R~EADING

The Senate- resumed from Match 28 con:sideration of the motion for the second reading of Bill 21, an Act to provide for lirniting
,the Hours of Work in Industrial Undertakings
to eight in the day and forty-eight in the week,
in accordance witb the Convention concerning
the application of the principle of the Eight
Hour Day or of the Forty-eight Hour Week
adopted by the General Conference of the
International Labour Organization of the
League of Nations, in accordance with the
Labour Part of the Treaty of Versailles of
28th June, 1919.

Organization of Labour

Whereas the League of Nations has for its

objeet the establishiment of universal peace, and
sncb a peace can be established only if it is
based on social justice;
Andi whereas conditions of labour exist involving sucli injustice, hardship and privation
to large numbers of people as to produce unrest
so great that the peace and harmony of the
world are imperilleti; andi an improvement of
those conditions is urgently required; as, for
example, by the regniation of the hours of
work-

manv conflicting opinions have been given by

as is provided for in this Bill.
This is followed by an enumeration of
methodg for obtaining the desired results, and
of principles which I would place under three
headings:
1. Universal peace is the main objeet of the
League of Nations.
2. This peace is to be based on social
justice.
3. The failure of any nation to adopt
hurnane conditions of labour is an obstacle to
other nations who seek to improve conditions
in their own territories.
The natural andi necessary conclusion is that
this question of the protection of labour cannot ýbe considered as a provincial affair: it bas
become not only a national one, but, what is
more, a niatter of international concern.
By its signature to the Peace Treaty Canada
is bound not only to accept but to co-operate
in carrying on these undertakings.
How must we fulfil our obligation? It has
been arguedi on high authority, first, that the
only obligation on the part of Canada was to
bring the proposed draft convention before

good lawyers, emînenýt judges and our best,
parlia ment arians; and I hesitate even more
to cover the legal grounds so ably eiqpounded
by the right honourable leader of the Senate,

legislatures, and none other.
I will not discuss the right of the Federal

Han. A. MARCOTTE: Honourable senators,
1 would ask you to be patient with me for a
short time. So muci has been written and
spoken about the question of jurisdiction of
the Federal Govern.ment to legi.slate on the
subject-matter of this Bill, so rnany referenceîq
have been made to the dangers to minority
rights from the supposed invasion, of provincial jurisdiction by the Federal Parlianent,
that it is expedient to give further consideration to this question.
I may say that I arn somewhat diffident in
rising to deal with this sub.ject, on which so

and the other senators who have spoken on
the same question. But as I arn considered
to be one of the representatives of a rninority,
1 have been requested to give my own views
on the present Bill, and, de.pending on your
indulgence, I will do so.
First let us consider the aims of Part XIII
of the Peace Treaty, whicba deals with labour.
Out of the horrors of the World War grew
an overwhelrning desire not only for universal
peace between nations, but for the betterment
of social liýfe, especially arnong the working
classes. If the League of Nations Icould not
permanently ensure nations against war, it
could at least better conditions for the working classes and it imrnediately began activities
to.wards- that end.
Let us read once more section I of Part
XIII of the Peace Treaty, dealing with the
protection of labour:

the competent legislatures; second, that the
competent legislative bodies are our provincial
Governient to legislate under the provisions
of section 132 of the British North America
Act. This point bas been amply covered by
the right honourable leader of the Senate, and
it is unnecessary for my purpose to, repeat
bis argument. I wish merely to add another
authority to tbose already quoted. I refer
to the case of Rex vs. Stuart, Dominion Law
,Reports, 1925, page 12, where it was decided
that
The Migratory Birds Convention Act, Canada, 1917, eliapter 18, to implement a treaty du
aceordance witb section 132 of tbe British Nortb
Amnerica Art is intra vires of the Dominion,
thougb trencbing on provincial powers over
property and civil rigbts, and is paramount over

provincial statotes.
Now I intend to discuss tbe question of
.îurisdiction under clauses 91l and 92 of the
British North America Act. I arn going to
submit that even if the Federal Governient

238

SENATE

had not the power given in section 132-I
contend it has-it would have jurisdiction
under section 91. I base my argument on
the law as I find it in decisions of the Supreme
Court of Canada and of the Privy Council,
and on the existing facts as the law applies
to them. Section 91 reads:
It shall be lawful for the Queen, by and with
the advice and consent of the Senate and House
of Commons, to make laws for the peace, order
and good government of Canada, in relation to
all matters not coming within the classes of
subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the
legislatures of the provincesIv is important that we emphasize "exclusively" and "peace, order and good government of Canada.'
References have been made to the Order
in Council of November 6, 1920, and much
stress has been laid on the opinion therein
given. What was that opinion?
The treaty engagement being of this character,
it is not such as to justify legislation on the
part of Parliament under the authority of section 132 of the British North America Act,
1867, to give effect to any of the proposals of
the said draft conventions and recommendations,
whici must be held, -as between the Dominion
and the provinces, to be within the legislative
competence of the latter.
Read careful-ly, it simply means that if,
as between the Dominion and the provinces,
any of the proposals is held to be within the
legislative competence of the provinces, then
the treaty engagement is not such as to
empower the Parliament of Canada to legislate under section 132. The Order in Council
does not decide that the present draft convention covers a matter exclusively reserved
to the provincial field under section 92; not
at all.
But, I ask, has sufficient attention been
given to the last paragraph of the Order in
Council?
The Government's, obligation will, in the
opinion of the Minister, be fuly carried out if
the different conventions and recommendations
are brought before the competent authority,
Dominion or provincial, accordingly as it may
appear, having regard to the scope and objects,
the true nature and character of the legislation required to give effect to the proposals of
the conventions and recommendations respectively. that they fall within the legislative
competence of the one or the other.
If, as is claimed by some, this Order in
Council Lad clearly given the opinion that
these draft conventions or proposals were
"exclusively" within the competence of the
provincial legislatures, why this last paragraph? Why this recommendation to have
"regard to the scope and objects, the true
nature and character" of the proposals, or to
have the draft conventions brought before the
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE.

competent
authorities, Dominion or provincial?
We have to keep this advice in
mind when we come to consider later decisions.
This Order in Council gives the opinion
that the obligation under the treaty does npt
justify legislation on the part of Parhiament
under section 132. But it says something
more. There is no mention here of jurisdiction "exclusively" provincial, but it says "competent authority, Dominion or provincial,
accordingly as it may appear."
This opinion did not entirely satisfy Parliament, and in 1924 a committee was appointed by the House of Commons, which
reported that in spite of the Order in Council of 1920 and the views expressed by the
law officers, the matter was of such importance that it should be submitted to the
Supreme Court of Canada by way of reference.
The report from the Supreme Court came
out in 1925. Let us study this report for a
few moments. Four questions were submitted and; answered. This is the first question:
What is the nature of the obligation of the
Dominion of Canada as a member of the International Labour Conference, under the provisions of the Labour Part (Parit XIII) of the
Treaty of Versailles and of the corresponding
provisions of the other treaties of peace, with
relation to such dr.aft conventions and recomnendations as may be from time to time
adopted by the said conference under the
authority of and pursuant to the aforesaid
provisions?
To which the Supreme Court answered:
The obligation is simply in the nature of an
undertaking to bring the recommendation or
draft convention before the authority or
authorities within whose competence the matter
lies, for the enactment of legislation or other
action.
It will be noticed the Court says "authority
or authorities within whose competence the
matter lies."
Question 2:
Are the legislatures of the provinces the
authorities within whose competence the subject-matter of the said draft convention (copy
of which is herewith submitted) in whole or in
part lies and before whom such draft convention
should be brought, under the provisions of
Article 405 of the treaty of peace with Germany,
for the enactment of legislation or other action?
This is the answer:
Yes, in part.
Although the answer is very short, it is
quite important. A copy of the draft convention had been submitted with the questions.
The Court took full cognizance of it and the

APRIL 2, 1935
answer is clear. The .iurisdiction is flot "exclusively" with the provinces, but only "in
part."
Question 3:
If the subject-matter of the said draft
eonvention be, in part only, within the coinpetence of the legislatures of the provinces,
the% in what particular or particulars, or to
wbhat extent, is the eubjet-matter of the draft
convention within the competence of the
legisiatures?
The answer is:
The subject-rnatter is generally within the
competence of the legisiatures cf the provincesHlere we do find, net the word "exclusively,"
as mentioned in section 91, but the word
"gene'rally."
What is the meaning of this
The Privy iCouncil deword~ "generally"?
cidcd in the Aerial Navigation case, 1932,
that it does not mean "in every respect."
The answer continues:
-but the autherity vested in these legialatures; does net enable thein to give thefoc
cf law to provisions such as those contained
in the draft convention in relation to servants
of the Dominion Government, or to legisiate
for those parts of Canada whicb are net
within the boundaries cf a province.
If the legisiatures have no authority vcstcd
in themn te make laws in relation te servants
of the Dominion, or te those parts cf Canada
net within the boundaries cf a province, then
this authority canneot lie elsewhere than with
the Federal Parliament, and the an.swcr te
question 4 covers the point. I asic honourable
senators always te keep in mind the words
"#exclusivcly"1 as in section 91, "in part" as in
the Supreme Court judgment, and "«generally"
ais in the saine judgment.
Question 4:
If the subject-matter cf the said draft
convention be, in part only, within the cernpetenCe of the Iegisatures of the provinces,
then in what particular or particulars, or te
what extent, is the subject-matter of the draft
convention within the competence of the
Parliament cf Canada?
This is the answer:
The Parliament of Canada bas exclusive
legislative authority in tho6e parts cf Canada
not within the boundaries of any province, and
also upon the subjeets dealt with in the draft
eonvention in relation to the servants cf thie
Dominion Governinent.
It is important to observe that according
to this judgment we arc confronted with a
dual jurisdiction, federal and provincial, each
having the necessary power te legisl.ate in its
own field. This bas te be carried in mind
in view cf later deýcisions by the Privy
Council.

239

1 corne now te the decisions of the Privy
Council in re Aerial Navigation, Vol. 1,
Dominion Law Reports, 1932. Four peints
are decided as f ollows:
1. The legialation of the Parliamient of the
Dominion, so long as it 8trietly relates toe ubjects cf legislation expressly enumerated in
section 91, is cf paraznount authority, even
thougli it trenches upon matters assigned te
the provincial legislature by section 92.
This is the point concerning trade and comnmeree which was relied upon by the right
honourable leader of the Senate. It is of no
use to repeat the argument.
2. The general power of legislation conferred
upon the Parliament cf the Dominion by section 91 of the Act in supplement of the power
te legisiate upon the subjects expressly enumerated must be strictly confined te sncb matterB
as are unquestionably cf national interest and
importance, and must net trench on any of
the subjects enumcrated in section 92, as within
the scope cf provincial legislation, unless these
matters have attained such dimensions as to
affect the body politic cf the Dominion.
As will be observed, two requisites are te be
fulfild: (1) the matters must be unquestionably of national interest and importance;
(2) they must not trench on any cf the sub.
jccts enumnerated in section 92, "uniess these
matters have attained such dimensions as te
affect the body politic cf the Dominion."~
In the case at bar, ne one will deny that the
subject-matter is o-Tnational interest and importance; it is cf international concern. In
these days cf general unrest it bas attained
dimensions of first magnitude. The consensus
of cpin.ion is virtually unanimous in faveur

opinion is on the jurisdîction -cf Parliament
te legislate.
3. It is within the competence cf the
Dominion Parliament te provide for matters
which, though otherwise witbin the legisiative
competence cf the provincial legisiature, are
necessarily incidental to effective legislation by
the P-arliament cf t.he Dominion upon a aubject
cf legislation expressly enumerated in section 91.
It la not necessary te comment on th-is
proposition, which is elosely related te proposinien No. 1.

SENATE
might attain such dimensions as to affect the
body politic of the Dominion and to justify the
Canadian Parliament in passing laws for their
regulation or abolition in the interests of the
Dominion, but great caution must be observed
in distinguishing between that which is local
and provincial and therefore within the jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures and that
which hbas ceased to be merely local or provincial, and lias become matter of national
concern in such sense as to bring it within the
jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada."
In his eloquent address the other day the
honourable senator from Rougemont (Hon.
Mr. Lemieux) cited a speech of Hon. Edward
Blake in 1896. May I draw the attention of
the honourmble senator to this part of his own
citation? Mr. Blake said:
I naintain that under our Constitution,
properly interpreted, the provinces have the
uncontroIlable power of passing laws, valid and
binding laws, upon all those matters which are
exclusively within their competence, except,
perhaps, in the rare cases in which such legislation may be shown substantially to affect
Dominion interests.
Does not the present Bill affect interests of
even greater than Dominion importance-interests of international concern? This opinion
dates fram 1896, ithe same year when Lord
Watson made the remarks I have already
cited.
The interpretation that some of us give today to sections 91 and 92 is not a new one.
On this point I cite the opinion given a few
days ago by Mr. W. S. Edwards, Deputy
Minister of Justice:
It will be observed that the purpose is to
enable this Parliament to deal effectively with
urgent economic problems which are essentially
national in their scope. Well, in my view,
problems of that kind are now within the conpetence of Parliament under the B.N.A. Act
as it stands. A good deal lias been said about
the failure of the Fathers of Confederation to
anticipate the necessity which might arise for
the amendment of the Constitution. Personally
J do not think that they failed to anticipate
surh necessity; but I think they deliberately
fraumed the Constitution se as to make it subjeet to expansion by its own terms as the needs
and as the problems of the

country develop.

In sone of the self-governing Dominions and in
other couintries where a federal systein prevails,
there are fixed provisions for the amendment
of their constitution; but in most, if not all,
of those countries. their constitutions are not
simnilar to ours in this respect, that the
residuary powers rest vith the state, and not
with the central authority as it does in Canada.
Therefore I think that the Fathers of Confederation deliberately provided a scheme
whereby alil natters that are essentially national
in their scope would be within the exclusive
conpetence of Parliament. They did that by
vesting in the Dominion Parliament the
residuary power, and in giving to the provinces
tieir legislative powers they were very careful
to nmake it clear that the legisative jiirisdiction of the province was not, in any case, to
Hon. Mr. MAROOTTE.

extend beyond matters and rights situate in
the province itself, matters of purely provincial
or local concern.
As lias been clearly pointed out in the
judgment of the Supreme Court already cited,
we are confronted with a diual jurisdiction.
But the provinces .could not entirely cover
the matter dealt with in the draft convention.
Therefore the Federal Parliament being the
only body competent te make treaties with
other countries, and being partially clothed
with authority to legislate on the subjectmatter, is alone competent to enact the
necessary law not only to comply with the
treaty, but to ensure uniform legislation on
matters of national. importance.
In summing up this argument, I submit
that the Federal Parliament, in addition to
the power given under section 132, has jurisdiction under section 91, because (1) this is a
matter not "exclusively" reserved to the provinces under seetion 92, but reserved "in part"
only; (2) there is here a dual jurisdiction, and
the federal must predominate, as the Parliament of Canada is -the only body with power
to make a treaty with other countries on this
matter; (3) this matter has grown to be of
national and international concern and therefore falls under the principles laid down in
the decision of the Privy Council.
There is still one point I wish to cover.
It has been stated here and elsewhere that
the present legislation creates a precedent
dangerous to minority rights, because the
Federal Government is encroaching on the
jurisdiction of the provinces. Are there any
real grounds for such fears? I will, with your
permission, repeat what was so eloquently
stated a little while ago in this Chamber by
the right honourable leader of the Senate:
The honourable senator from Rougemont
(Hon. Mr. Lemieux) is very fearful that the
compact of Confederation is to be broken, the
rights of minorities to be impinged upon, and
generally that we are going to play fast and
loose with the terns of the Constitution and the
solenmn compact it embodies. I want to assure
the honourable gentleman that there is no
thought farther from the mind of the Government, and there is no possibility of a precedent
being created which could ever be used for the
purpose of invading those rights and sacred
pr'ivileges te seeks to protect. He says tliere
are riglits of iace. of language, of religion and
of education upon which the Fathers of Confederation conpromised and agreed. and that
the compromise is now embodied in the British
North Anserica Act. He says that if you seek
to do what is proposed in the present instance
under the guise of treaty-making you set a
precedent under which the rights as between
races, and minority riglits in respect of religion
and elucation, may some day also be invaded.
There is no reason for any such apprehension.
Is it conceivable that the rights of the minority
of Quebec. or the rights of the minority of

APRIL 2, 1935
Ontario. should ever be made the subject of a
treaty between Canada and other nations?
What have other nations ta do with these
matters? How are they concerned in -them at
all? These rights are flot proper subjects for
negotiation between nations. and they could flot
carne within the four corners of any treaty
with other powers.
This is the answer ta one phase of the
question. But, honourable senators, the protection of minorities is safeguarded. in no
uncertain way by special sections of the
British North America Act, namely, sections
93 and 133, and subsections 12, 13 and 14
of section 92. There is no duality of jurisdiction in regard to the rights of minorities.
In order to acquire jurisdiction in matters
reserved ta the provincial authorities, nlot
"exclusively," but "in part" or "generally,"
the Federal Goverument bas ta find justification. When and where daes it find it?
The Federal Government has ta prove (1)
that the matters involved are nlot "exclusively"
mentioned in section 92; (2) that they are
"partially" under cither one of the two jurisdictions; (3) that they have grown ta be
of such national importance as ta affect the
pence, order and good government of the
country; (4) that failure ta legisiate upon thein
will prevent other countries, to which we are
bound by treaty or treaties, from. bettering
their own conditions; and (5) the Federal
Government is unable ta take any roundahout
way ta create jurisdiction for itself. Our
courts have so decided, and the Privy Councîl
bas already given decisions on that point,
notably in the following, which is to be found
in Dominion Law Reports, 1932, Volume I,
page 65:
Inasmuch as the ActThat is the British North America Act.
-embodies a compromise under which the
original provinces agreed ta federate, it is
important ta keep in mind that the preservation
of the rights of minarities was a condition on
which such minorities entered into the federation, and the foundation upon which the whole
structure was subsequently erected. The proceas of interpretation as the years go on ought
nat ta be allowed ta dim or ta whlittle down
the provisions of the original contract upan
which the federation was founded, nor is it
legitirnate that any judýicial construction of the
provisions of sections 91 and 92 should impose
a new and different contract upon the federating bodies.
But while the courts should be jealous in
upholding the charter of the provinces as
enacted in section 92, it muet no less be borne
in mmnd that the real abject of the Act was

I have tried, honourable senators, ta be as
brief and concise as passible in this argument. No one is more anxious than -I arn
that the rights of minorities shaîl be fully
protected. But in aur desîre ta safeguard
these rîghts we should neot be blinded by
i.maginary fears.
It bas been claimed by many that we
were not bound by any of these draft, conventions because they were only proposais
or means ta abtain certain abjects. I do
nat agree with that contention. But even
if it were so, even. if we were not bound
by a treaty, it is nevertheless aur d-uty ta
pass legislation ta better the living conditions of aur working classes. We have agreed
by the terrns of this treaty ta do aur utmast
ta create pence between nations and ta base
this pence on social justice. Social justice
demande that we help the working classes,
and this mensure is one of the means of
reaching the goal. We are bound ta try ta
have aur people more contented, better protected against known miseries and accidents,
and adequately remunerated for their work.
This is the first step. Let us go forward
without being hampered by the fear osf nonexistent dangers.
Furthermore, we have
agreed ta pass legisîntion o? that kind, not
only for the protection o? aur own people,
but likewise ta help other nations secuze
better conditions o? living for their own
citizens. If we shirk these dçuties we are
preventing these other nations from prometing social justice. Sa let us go ahead with
the work of trying ta achieve the greatest
ai of the world at large--universal peace.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill
was read the second time.

ment. I concluded that what was really
needed, il an Act designed to prevent combines
was needed at ail, was an enactmnent to curb
bad combines. I may say in passing that as
to England I can find no record of legislation
agamast combines. In my view what was
needed was an Act restricting or cru.shing bad
combines, but nlot extending to what I would
eall gond combines.
Any agreement in restraint o4f trade macle
by two or more persons is a combine. An
individual may restrain trade as much as he
likes. For instance, our co]league fromn Calgary (Hon. Mr. Burns)-may I be allowed
to say?-is supposed to have 30,000 head of
cattie. ýHe can do what he likes with those
cattie: hie can keep them, lie can sel! them,
he can give themn aavay. Suipposing two
neighbours of bis, ranchers, flot wealthy as
he is, combine their resources and hold 3,000
head of cattie, only one-tenth the number
owned by the honourable senator, tkiey may
be sentenced to gaol under the law as it is
to-day.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Nonsense.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: If it is a proper combine it is ail righ.t; if it is an undue comubine
it may lie penalized.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Now, it seems to me
that-an individual can restrain trade as much
as be likes. Under the Act it would be easy
for a person to acquire six or seven corporations and merge themn into one and do just
as lie pleases; yet if those corporations continue as separate entities, but combine together
for common action, the various executives
render the'mselves hiable to a gaol term. If
two individuals or two corporations agree te
restrain their trade they become members of
a combine.
Good combines are neot only possible, notwithstanding the Cenbines Investigation Aot,
but even Governments have encouraged their
creation. Do honourable meenbers recollect
the Wheat Pool? If that was flot a combine,
what is? The Wbeat Pool deait a blow to the
wheat trade of Canada under which it stil]
reels--how long it wil reel I do nlot know.
They lest the wheat marke't of England,
because an Englishman objects to being
coerced. When the Wheat Pool could have
got a price of 81.40 a bushel they held out
for $2. The Englishman neyer said a word,
but he did not buy our wheat. The Wheat
Pool sent their manager, a Mr. Smith, ta
England to seIl their wheat, but he had no
succeas, because the wheat brokers of England, men whose fathers and grandlathers had
been engaged in the business, were not going

24b

to be gy-pped out of their commissions. They
said, "We will make other arrangements."
And, to our sorrow, they have madle other
arrangements.
Have honourable members forgotten the
paper co.mbine, orgeiiized to raise the price
of newsprint? Some of the manufacturera
were forced into the combine by Government
pressure. That is happening to-day in ou-r
own province.
Have honourable, mernbers forgotten the
receat exhortations of varions commnittees and
commissions ta business men: "Why dont you.
get together and remedy trade conditions as
best you can? Why don't you dlean up your
industry?" Have we forgotten, the answer?
"We are not free to do se. We are restrained
by the crîminal law. You present us with a
Combines Investigation Act and section 498
of thie Criminal 'Code, which enumerate a
number of things that we cannot agree te do,
and if we do agree te act we are criminals.
You say you do net forbid us absolutely te
agree te do these things; you only forbid
us te do them unduly. We cannot know
whether we have acted unduly until the courts
have spoken, and they can speak only te
persans who have been accused as criminals.
We have ne desire te run the risks involved."t
When business men say that, they mean
they cannot safely make arrangements among
themnselves to stàbilize industry or remedy
abuses, for fear that in doing sa they might
infringe somne specific provision of section 2
of the Corabines Investigation Act or of sectien 498 of the Criminal Code. The resuit
is, it is said, that net being free, for example,
reasonably te restrain competition as a'meng
themselves, they join together in one corporation or trust, and alter coing se they can
act practically as they please. If this is so,
an Act that was designed te ensure cempetitien
is operating te destrey competition.
Witlh these considerations in mind 1 began
te wonder whether the difference betwe n a
good combine and a bad one could net lie so
simply stated in a statute that anyibody could
understand it. It seemed te me that the
test of the geodneas or badness of a combinatien ef business men was whether what they
proposed te do was, under aIl the circumstances, reasonable. I consulted my lawyer
friends, and, te my pride and joy, they told
me that 1 had the right ideaSome Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. CAiSGRAIiN\: -and ithat the
word of t.he law that distinguishes lawful
from unlawîul restraint of trade is the word
"uniireasonable."
That is, apart from statute, a restraint of trade is flot unlawvful unles it is unreasonabie. They tnl'd me, too,
that there were decizions by the hiundred
under whicli it was possible to ascertain in
any given case what was reasonable or unAs nearly as Il can remember,
reasonable.
they told me that if the restraint of trade
agreed upon was in the interest of those who
a-reed, %vith the desire to benefit their crait
or business. but without intent to injure the
public, the law, apart from statute, regarded
ýudh restraint as reasonable and ]awiful; that
onlv unreasonable resitraints of trade are unlawful at common law, and that agreements
te r.estrail trade unlaiNvfully are criminal conspira cies.
1 think that what I have said sufficiently
explains the first section of this Bill. I might
add that its termis are quite general. They
arc wide enough, iI think, to cover ail that
we now have in the Combines Act and the
Criminal Code, but they are more easi]y
understood.
'Fli second section of tihe Bill is one that
should be w.elcomed by employers and eruployecs alike. For many years employers as
well as employes have biad the right to
organize thecmselves inte associations. This
is cenvenielit whien it is neceissary to negotiate
a collective bargain as to wages or working
conditions. T'le Combines Investigation Act
has all along- expreSsly cxcmpted workmen or
employ-ees, as such, fromn the operation of the
Act. Clause 2 of the Bill, by the addition of
the words un'derlined, extenda to employers,
as. stuch, the saine exemption from the operatien of the Act as bias been enjo>yed by the
emlplovees.
I hiave been tolti that the right oif a number of cmployers te joie in a common ag-reemuent witb thc empînyces of ail of them has
been doîrbtcd. Clause 2 -will in any event reniovc any deubt as te this matter. It is at
lea-.t as much in the interest of the employees
as of employers thiat clauise 2 of the Bill should
be passed.
The third clause ef the Bill is designed te
remiedy fer the future a certain construction
that bas 'becn iplaced upon the Act by the
courts. This clause practically says that ne
persen shahlie found guilty under the Act
iinless, lie i's guilty in fact under it. This

Mr

tCX;GR AN.

Now, subject te correction, I am going te
make a statement wthich I have had ne chance
te verify. 'but which any lawyer in this House
can verify ifor himself. If I knew where te,
look in order te do so, I would verify it
myself. Two or three ycars ago two offioers
cof a trade association in the province of Ontario were charged under the Comrbines Investigation Act with being mejmbers of a
combine. They were tried by the late ýMr.

honourable members te note that word. They
were acquitted on the ground that they had
net heen party te nor had knowhcdge of any
iliegal act done hy their association or any
of its members; also, that their association
was not originally designed te, operate in restraiet of trade. The case was taken te, the
Court of Appeal, which dccided, and the
Supreme Court of 'Canada upheld the deci.sien, that the two efficers in question were,
under the termis of the Act, guilty in lawlegal gentlemen will1 appreciate what that
means--and, ahthough they lived and carried
on business in Toronto, responsible for certain unlawful acts of which tbey knew nothing,
and which were committed by fellow menabers at Windsor, seime 200 miles or more
away. The Appeal Court convicted these
acquitted men. innocent though they were
in lact. as persons guilty in law, and flned
t.hemn 34.000 each. The men were poor and
were ruined by the fine. 'Ihey ýhad ne redress. I do net want that sort of thing te,
occur again in Canada. It is net creditable
te us. The Senate of Canada is supposed te
revise ail legisîntion.
At this point I m.igbt ask why it is that
we have the great British Empire to-day. It
is becau-,e of its just and equitable laws,
because people in every latitude and longitude of the worhd have had confidence that
in our courts the humblest and the poorest
would be treated in the samne way as tlhe
mighty, the euperb and the wealthy.
As a result of the ternis of Canadian legishation the incident that I have reiferred to
did in fact occur. as anybody can discover by
reading the case of the King against Belyea
and Weinraub in the Ontýario Law Repo-rts.
My hegal friends can flnd eut whether what
I say is true or net.
The fourth clause of the Bihl is designed te
remnedy -what seems te me te be an abuse of
the ýCriminal law. It bas become a universal
practice in the trial of persens accused of
violations of the Combines Investigation Act
te charge them with, and aise te convict
tlîemi of, offending again-.t section 498 uf the

AFRIL 3, 1935
Criminal Code of Canada. Thus, for one aet,
or Upon. one set of circumstances, an accused
person may be convicted of two crimes.
Beylea and Weinraub, for example, although
acquitted on the f aots, were each convicted
on appeal and fined $2,000 under the Criminal
Code and $2,000 under the Combines Act, or
$4,000 eaoh. There is something revolting
about that if true, and as section 498 of the
Criminal Code, first enacted iii 1889, 46 years
ago, applies only f0 agreements in restraint,
of trade in. articles of commerce, and clause 2
of this Bill covers restraint of trade in general. I suggest that section 498 of the Criminal
Code ought to be repealed.
1 should like to restafe the point made by
me at an early stage of my remnarks, that even
a combine in reetraint of trade can be a good
thing as well as a bad thing, and that reasonable restraint of trade may be not only desirable in the interest of a trader, but necessary
in the interest of the pu~blie.
Now, honourable meimbers, 1 have here a
report on restraint of trade issued by a committee appointed b>' the Right Hon. Lord
Sanke>', G.BE., Lord Chancellor, and the
Right Hon. William Graham, M2P., Prasident

Survey of the subject. The trada practices

the following kind-(a) thosa whjch rasult in withholding frorn

I will explain that, though the exiplanation

who bought them hud to pay a certain price
for them. Senator Ful-ford, sold tbem to the
whole'saler, with wbom he made a contract
that they should be sold to the retailer at a
fixed price. I may say that he was doing
lesa business in Canada than in 29 other
countries on the face od the eartb. The
wholesaler would make a bargain with the
retailer that the retail price was to he s0
much, and if the retailer increased or lowered
this price the wholesaler had recourse against
him. But Senator Fuiford had recourse only
against the wholesaler.
I will read now what the committec said
about tbe existing law on the subject of
restraint of trade in England:
It is desirable bore to state -%vhat 've believe
to be the law on the subjeet witb which we
are asked to deal.
A man has the rigbt te trade as lie pleases.
A muifacturer or inierehant niay refuse to sali
his goods to anyone wbo wishes to boy them,
or hie mnay seil them on sncb conditions as he
thinks fit te impose. If the buyer of goods
wbo bas acquired those goods subject to ternis
or conditions subsequently deals with tbem in
a manner contrary tu the termis ef bis agreement bie commits a breacb of bis contract witb
the seller, and tbe seller bas a rigbt o f action

Tbe rigbt to combine in defence of, or in
support of, trade interests is recognized just as
is the rigbt of a man te contraet witbi wbomsocrer bo pieuses.
If the real purpose of tbe combination is,
not to injure anotber, but to, forwvard or defend
the trade of tbose wbo enter into it, then no
wrong is eominitted, and nou action will lie,
althougb damage te another ensues, provided
tbat the purpese is flot effected by illegal

Dealing with the extent of the practice
ef resale price maintenance, the committee
said:
We tound that the imposition ot conditions
mîpen retailers and wbelesalers regarding tbe
resale prices te be cbarged is a wi<lespread and
grewing practice among mianrîfacturers: and
that it is common te enferre the conditions

lion. Mir. CASGRAIN,

The system varies in detail fromn trade to
trade and it seldoma affects the whole of a
trade, while in many cases it affects only a
small part. Among the tradles in which it is
For instance,
most prevalent are books.
Lady Minto has just published a book, which
is being sold for $6 the world over. Will
anybody say that is wrong? If people do
flot want to buy the book they are flot coinpelled to, but if they want, it the price is
$6. Yet the cost is probably flot. more than
one dollar. There is a big spread in that
price. A committee which was sitting n-ot
far from here and dealing with price spreads
might have taken up the question of Lady
Minto's book. Other trades in which the
committee says the system is most prevalent
are:
newspapers and periodicals, stationery, drugs,
photographic goods. gramophones and records,
miotors and cycles. tohacco and cigarettes, confeetionery and groceries.
I arn reading only part of this report. If
you want to regulate businesses you will have
to pass a separate law for nearly every one
of them. Take confectionery, for instance.
The more stores there are in a town selling
the products of a manufacturer, the better he
wiîll like it. But it is .iust the reverse in
many other lines of goods, which rnanufactîîrers wvil.l permit wholesalers to seli only to
a restricted number of retailers in a community. The efficient storekeeper who puts
on a good window display and knows how to
push sales can get the goods, but the sluggard
who keeps a poor store wilI not be allowed
the privilege ef handling them.
The report says that the system is prevalent
in the newspaper trade. I was in the newspaper business eight years and I did not
know that. Newspapers are desirous of getting
in
the largest possible circulation, but
England they wvill not seli through stores.
Some publishers will seli througb co-operative
stores, but most will not. As a rule their sales
will be larger if they are made mostly through
newsboys. There is in the newspaper business
the practice of sale and return. Some newspapers that are not very well known-the
Montreal Herald was like that for a whilewilI say to a newsboy, "Yeu can have a dozen
copies if you pay for them, and we will give

you your money back for any you do not
selI." Then there is a lirait to the distances
from the place of publication at which newspapers may be sold.
I may as well tell the Huse at once that
the gist of the report is that any attempt to,
restrain trades sueh as those mentioned would
do more harm than good.

APRIL 3, 193
If honourable members will bear with me,
I shall fot be very mucli longer. Perhaps I
miglit better hold back ail this ammunition
for our committee. 0f course it is flot my
fault if I arn keeping the Senate in session.
Everyhody knows whose fault it is.
The report goes on to say:
In general the goodq whieh are thus -price
maintained belong to the clama of branded goods
which are distinguished by bearing the manufacturer's proprietary label or trade mark.
Naturally the producer who owns a trade
mark sets a price for his goods. People think
they are flot getting the genuine article unlese
it is branded.
Branded goods which are widely advertised

are, however, nearly always price maintained,
and the system of price maintenance is clearly
associated flot only with the proprietary label
or trade mark, but also with the advertisement.
Because of their uniform quality, branded
articles are specially hiable to be used by the
retailer as leading lines; and although the
retailer may be compensated on his trade as a
whole, the interests of the individual manufacturer, who lias given the goods their brand and
their advertisement. are prejudiced in the
manner explained below.
The next section of the report deals with
effects of price cutting on retailers and manufacturers, but I will flot read that just now.
I will make a reference to something that I
know from
my own experience.
Take
Fellowe's Syrup. In some drug stores it seils
at $1.50 a bottle, in others at $125, but the
eut-rate stores seli it at 99 cents. Many people
think that what they buy for 99 cents is flot
genuine, although it bears the trade mark.
The consequences are that in, time ail the
druggists suifer because some people lose faîth
in the medicine. And, by the way, it is an

excellent remedy. 1 was paying $1,50 for it,
but I found that a drug store on St. Catherine
Street in Montreal was selling for 99 cents
exactly the samne article, which produced the
saine good eifects. Cut-price husinessee la-st
only a comparatively short time, because in
the end they find their profits are too low.
Then the committee says:
In some cases where goods are distributed
through iwholesale firms manufacturera specify
not only the retail prices, but also the trade
price chargeable by the whclesaler to the
retailer. The latter price, like the former,
may be either a definite price or a minimum
price.
We sometimes hear of the high cost of
committee reports.
Well, honourable senators may be interested to hear that this
valuable report cost only £138-l9-,
of which
£27-640 represents the cost of printing and
publishing. And a copy may be purchased

for 9 pence.

249

The report deals with the treatment of cooperative societies, but I will not, read that

now.

However, here is one point.

The co-

operatives agree with manufacturers and
whorlesalers to selI goods at a certain price,
but the co-operatives cheat. I mean that
they pay dividends to their members, or they

give you a discount at a certain rate if you
pay your bills weekly, or at another rate if
you pay them monthly.
The next section of the report deals with
the method of enforcement. That is long;
so I will try to summarize it. When a retailer
does not abide hy his agreement to seil at
a certain price, the manufacturer does not
go to law with him. The retailer is simply
told that he will not be able to obtain any
more of those goods.
Then under the heading of "Trade Associations " the report says:
The difficulties encountered by individual
manufacturera seeking to maintain resale prices
bas led in a number of trades to the formation
of associations for the purpose of detecting and
putting a stop to price cutting. The oldest
of the associations in question are the Proprietary Articles Trade Association in the drug
trade and the Publishers' Association in the
book trade.
Proprietary articles are medicines and 50 on
that are sold by druggists. It may he that

the actual cost of a certain medicine is less
than the value of the vial, the label and the
cork. That may seem outrageous, but perhaps research work had been going on for
years and years before the article was perfected. Very heavy expenses may have been
incurred by the manufacturer in developing
a satisfactory formula, and hie bas to be
compensated.
As to the Proprietary Articles Trade Association, the report sys:
The Proprietary Articles Trade Association
consists (June, 1930) of some 440 manufacturera, 63 wholesalers and 8,700 retailers trading in proprietary drugs and other articles
sold in chemists' 8hops. It was formed 35
years ago mainly for the purpose of putting
a stop to price cutting of proprietary goods,
which was at that time very severe, and of
preventing "substitution" (i.e. the practice of
persuading customers to buy articles carrying
a larger profit in place of the particular articles
deinanded).
The Association regards as price cutting the
payment by a co-operative society of dividends upon purchases made by its inembers.
Price-fixing in the motor trade is maintained
by means of a stop list. This list is in four
sections covering cars, tires, petrol, and
accessories.
Now I come to the fixing of the retailer's
profit:

250

SENATE

If an article is one of popular use, for which
there is a good demand, the retailer's margin
is likely te be fixed at a lower figure than if
the article is one of a special kind and of
limited demand, because in the latter case the
presumption is that cost of distribution per
unit is relatively high. In particular cases,
where a manufacturer lias something approaching a monopoly, and where the interest of the
public in the article is assured by advertising
or owing to the article being in common use,
the retailer's margin may be reduced te a
small percentage.
In 1918 the Hon. Mr. Geddes, President of
the Board of Trade, when Minister of Reconstruction, appointed a committee ef twelve,
consisting of representatives of all parties in
the British House eof Commons on an equal
basis, including four Socialists or Labour
members, of which the then Sydney Webb,
now a peer, was one. The committee was
appointed to study trade organizations and
combinations in the United Kingdom. It reported under the heading "Report of Committee on Trusts." The report (9236) is to be
found in Accounts and Papers of 1918, Volume
12, at page 789. It was unanimously against
enacting any law such as our Combines Act,
restricting combinations of men of business.
The Socialist party concurred in the report
and added these expressive words:
We have signed the above report because we
find nothing te disagree with in its recommendations.... We do not suggest any action
be taken te prevent or obstruet combination
or association in capitalist enterprise. Apart
from the experience that no such interference
can be made effective, we have te recognize
that association and combination in production
and distribution are steps in the greater
efficiency. the increased economy and the better
organization of industry.
We regard this
evolution as both inevitable and' desirable. It
is. however. plain that the change from conpetitive rivalry to combination calls for corresponding developments to secure fer the community both safeguards against the evils of
monopoly and at least a share of the economie
benefits of the better organization of industry
which it promotes.
The position of the wholesaler is stated in
these words:
The wholesaler is under modern conditions
in many trades a factor of diminishing importance. the tendency being increasingly for manufacturers te sell direct te retailer?.
Witness the T. Eaton Company. It can
buy'v from the manufacturer probably cheaper
than can the ordinary wholesaler, because it
buys in such tge quantities. Consequently
it can sell the goods cheaper. Who benefits?
The public-the poor working man benefits.
t te the consumer the report states:
The position of the consumer in relation te
price maintained goods is similar to that of the
retailer in se far as he can refuse te buy any
particular brand of goods and buy instead other
brands or. where such exist. non-branded goods.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

In other words, the consumer does net need
to buy any particular brand.
Regarding
control practices the report
states:
It is quite common for individual manufacturers te sell their goods, net te all retailers
who wish te stock them, but only te a limited
number in any given area, particular retailers
being chosen with reference te location or te
their probable efficiency and suitability in other
ways.
That is, they can afford to pay for the goods.
The report deals with the disadvantages
.f the system of price maintenance and proceeds:
It must be recognized that the price maintenance system lias disadvantages from the point
of view of the public, though in our opinion
such disadvantages are incidental and are not
such as would justify a withdrawal of the right
of the manufacturer to sell his goods subject
te conditions as regards prices te be charged on
resale....
Another result is that the retailer is prevented fren selling te the public at a lower
price even though lie can afford te do se: as
an offset to this the public are protected by
the fixing of prices from unduly grasping
retailers who might put up the price because
of the sudden denand or for other reasons....
It has been further suggested that if price
maintenance were abolished the less efficient
shops, and particularly the smaller shops, would
be driven out of business; and that in the end
the standard of efficiency in retailing would be
generally raised te the advantage of the conmunity as a whole....

The mere replacement of a large number of
small shopkeepers by stores and multiple shops
would be of no advantage te the public unless
the stores and multiple shops were able and
willing te serve the public more cheaply or
more efficiently.
A great cry was raised in another place
that our retail chain stores did net give correct weight. That has nothing te do with
any deifect of the law. We have the Weights
and Measures Act, and it should have been
enforced.
The committee reached this conclusion as
to the system of price maintenance:
Our general conclusion regarding the broad
principle of maintained resale prices for branded
goods is that no sufficient case bas been made
out for interfering with the right of the manufacturer to sell his goods ipon conditions which
permit iims te name the terms on which such
goods should be resold. We have dealt with
some of the disadvantages and drawbacks of
the systen, and we must net be taken as finding that the prices charged te the public and
the margins allowedThat is the spread in another place.
-to
the retailer are in all cases reasonable,
but ve are quite unable te say that the interests of the public would be better served
by an alteration of the law whlsch would pre-

vent the fixing of prices of branded goods.

251

APRIL 3, 1935
The committee deait aise with the tobacco
trade. We have heard a lot recently about
this trade in Canada. They state:
In the tobacco trade, as in other trades,
widespread price cutting can probably be controlied by effective organization and co-operation among the different sections of the trade.
There is just one more point, and that is
service. i passed, it wh.iîe dealing with other
phases of the report. Service makes a great
difference in business. For instance, a lady
goes into a shop and buys an article, and
she is told: "Madam, if you do not, like this
article you can returu it, and we will give
you back your money; or if you cannot
corne te the store again just phone us w.hat
you paid for the article and we will send
a messenger to take it back and réfund you
the money." That is what is called "service."
Take the photographic business. ManuTheturers seli cameras onlyr to chemists and
optical stores, because the men operating
those stores are weUl qualified to instruet
their customers in the use of the apparatus.
They tell a oustomer, "If this camera does
not rwork properly bring it back and we will
show you how to use it." That again is
service.
Now I corne to the general conclusions of
this report. I have read, as it were, only
the marginal notes of the report. The conclusions were reached by these prominent
gentlemen: Mr. Wibfrid Arthur Greene, K.C.,
chairman; Mr. Alexander Johnston, J.P.;
Professor David Hutchison Macgregor, M.C.;
Mr. William E. Mortimer; Mr. John Edward
Singleton, K£., and Mr. Alexander George
Waikden, J.iP., M.P. 'Their conclusions may
be summ'arized in a sentence: any attempt
to, pass legisiation would do more harm than
good.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAiND: Honourable
senators, 1 must congratulate my honourable
friend on the industry with which he bas explored the wide field covered by his remarks.
But he has net convinced me that there are
any valid reasons for amending subseotion 1
of the Combines Investigation Act. The sectien reads as f oliows:
(1) Combines which have operated or are
likely te operate to the detriment or against
the interest of the public, whether consumera,
producers or others, and which
(a) are mergers, trusts or monopolies, so
cailed; or
(b) resuit f rom the purchase, lease, or other
acquisition by any person of any control over
or interest in the wbole or part of the business
of any other persen; or
(c) resuit from any actual or tacit contract,
agreemnt, arrangement, or combination which
has or is designed te have the effeet of
(i) limiting facilities for transporting. producing-. iianufacturing, supplying, storing or
deaiing. or

(ii) preventing, limniting or iessening manufacture or production, or
(iii) fixing a common price or a resale price,
or a common rentai, or a common cost of storage
or transportation, or
(iv) enhancing the price, rentai or cost of
ar-ticle, rentai, storage or transportation, or
(y) preventing or lessening competition in, or
substantiaiiy controlling within any particular
area or district or generaily, production, manufacture, purchase, barter, sale, storage, transportation, insurance or suppiy, or
(vi) otherwise restrainîng or injuring trade
or commerce, are described by the word

"combine."

My honourable friend desires to, replace
this definition -by these four paragraphs:
(1) "Combine" means a combinjation of two
or more persons which is formed by way of
actual or tacit contract, agreement or arrangement and which(a) at the time when iormed is designed by
the memnbers thereof te restrain unreasonabiy
trade or commerce, against the interest of the
public, whether consumers, producers or others;
or
(b) although it is not, at the time when
formed, designed as in subparagraph (a) mentioned, is afterwards operated tei restrain un-

reasonabiy

trade or

commerce,

against the

interest of the public, whether consumers, producers or others; or
(c) is a conspiracy in restraint of trade or
commerce.
When 1 compare the old section with the
section of the Bill II must declare my preference 'for the very clear language of the Act.
The Combines Investigation Act bas been
on our Statute Book a number of years and
bas been invoked in a number of cases. Undoubtedly it bas acted as a deterrent against
over-ambitious or grasping persons, and up te
the present I have not heard of an-y complaint
of the wording cf the section which my
henourable friend seeks to amend.
My honourable friend also desires te amend
section 4 of the Criminal Code, which reads:
Notbing in this Act shail be construed te
apply te combinations of workmen or empioyees
for their own reasonable protection as such
werkmen or employees.
This exception is made te allew employees
te maintain their labour unions in order to
promote their interests.
My honourabie
friend would amend the section in this way:
Nothing in this Act shall be construed toi
apply to combinations of workmen or employees,
or of masters or employer&, for their reasonable protection as such workmen or empîcyees
or masters or employers.
'I contend that the proposed amendiments
would destroy both the letter and the spirit
of the Combines Investigation Act and of
this section of the Criminal Code. It would
open the door te the formation of ail sorts of

trusts and mergers.
My honourable friend bas said that the
Senate of Canada is independent, and does

252

SENATE

not have to look to the people for its maintenance. But it must see the signs cf the
times and recognize them. I have heard of
no demand for a loosening up of legislation
such as would be effected by the Bill before
us. On the contrary, a considerable body of
public opinion is favourable to a tightening
up of the law ýprohibiting combines and
mergers, and to a strengthening of the Combines Investigation Act.
My honourable friend knows that a Royal
Commission has been examining into mass
buying and price spreads. This inquiry has
created considerable commotion in the country. I am not prepared to say what conclusion we should draw from the investigation
that has been going on, but I know the present Government has stated in the Speech
from the Throne that measures will be submitted to us, not in the direction indicated
by the honourable gentleman's ,proposed legislation, but in a contrary direction. Here is
what the Speech from the Throne says:
You will be invited to enact measures
designed to safeguard the consumer and primary
producer against unfair trading practices and
to regulate. in the public interest, concentrations in production and distribution.
As I see it, the Governýment fairly expresses, in a general way, the view of the
public that legislation of this kind should be
tightened rather than relaxed, and I feel that
the country is not at the moment looking
for a betterment of conditions by a movement in the direction indicated by my honourable friend. For this reason I intend to
move, seconded by Right Hon. Mr. Graham,
that this Bill bc not now read a second time,
but that it be read this day six months.
The proposed amendment
Dandurand was agreed to.

EASTER ADJOURNMENT
Hon. Mr. BELAND: Before the right
honourable gentleman moves the adjournment, may I ask if he would care to give the
Senate some intimation as to the probable
date of adjournment for the Easter recess?
Some honourable members would perhaps
like to make arrangements in connection
therewith.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think the
recess usually commences on the Thursday
preceding Easter. That would be two weeks
from Thursday.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: From to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAXD.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is. it
would commence two weeks from to-morrow.
I certainly have no intimation from the Acting Prime Minister or any authoritative
source that it will be earlier this year.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: And as to the length
of the adjournment?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I cannot
make any statement as to the length of the
adjournment, but I have asked to be advised
as soon as there is any decision on the matter,
so that this House may receive the information as soon as the other does. I have seen
something in the press, and as a matter of
fact I do not know any more about the
subject than I have read.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at

CANADIAN NATIONAL STEAMSHIP
REPAIRS
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. FOSTER inquired of the Government:
1. Have there been any Canadian National
steaiships repaired in United States shipyards?
2. If so. what is the name or names of the
ship or ships upon which such repairs were
made?
3. If so, what was the amount paid for such
repairs?
4. If so, were such ships so unseaworthy that
they could not proceed to a Canadian drydock?
5. Is the Government aware that there is a
drydock ship repair plant at Saint John, New
Brunswick, such drydock being the largest on
the Atlantic coast and efficiently rnanaged and
sibsidized by the Government?
6. Are there any reasons why Canadian drydocks or shipyards should not be given the
repair work on Canadian National steamships?
7. Does the Honourable C. P. Fullerton, K.C.,
Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the
Canadian National Railways. make an annual
report of the activities of the Board. and if
so. will such report soon be made available?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The answer
to the honourable gentleman's inquiry is as
follows:

APRIL 4, 1935
1. Yes.
2. Since the year 1027 two vessele of the
Canadian Government Merchant Marine have
undergone repairs at drydocks in the United
States, viz., the Canadian Highlander and
the Canadian Britisher.
3. Including drydocking, painting and repairs, the figures were:
Canadian Highlander.. ..... 8S5,702
Canadian Britisher .. ....
... 2,529
s 8,21
4. No.
5. The Government is, of course, aware of
the excellent drydock facilities availatile at
Saint John. The matter of repairs is entirely
in the bands of the management at Montreal. but the Government, so far as its influence extends, insists upon repairs (other
than emergent repairs en route) being executed
in Canadian ports and drydocks.
6. Under ordinary circumstances, no; but,
under the special circumstances of these two
cases, the management of t.he Steamships
dlaim there were.
7. Report of the Board of Trustees has been
tabled in both Huses of Parliament.
EXPIRY OF PRESENT PARLIAMENT
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. FOSTER inquired of the Goveroment:

1. What is the date upon which the life of
the present Parliament will automatically
expire?
2. What is the latest date upon whieh a
general election must be held?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: The answer

to the honourable gentleman's first question
is: five years from the date of the return of
the writs for the election of the present
bouse of Commons. The question then is:
What was the date of the return of the writs?
The date named in the proclamation for the
return of the writs was the l8th of August,
1930. The Yukon writ was not returned,
I believe, until September 8, 1930, but invariably the practice luis been to consider
the date named in the proclamation the date
of the return. According to that practice
the expiry would be on August 18, 1935.
Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND: What was tihe
date of the Yukon writ?
Right Hon. Mr. MEICGHEN: September 8,
1930.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: When was Parliament convened?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
remember. I did nt adorn the House in
those times.

The second question is: "'What is the >atest

WHEAT POOL HOLDINGS

Before the Ordens of the Day:
Riglit Hon. ARTHUR MEIGIIEN1: Honourable senators, be-fore the Orders of the Day are
ppoceeded with, I th.ink I should, for the purpose of personal explanation, caîl to the atten,tion of the H.ouse a neivs article on the front

page of that great fniyjournal the Montreal Gazette. I take exception pamticularly to
the heading. The dispatch itself, from Ottawa,
while not precisely correct, ks fot very fax
astray.

I .understand the art of writing head-

lines ks one of the real tests of the earning
power -of news edtitors. This ks the heading:
No danger seen in holdings of wheat combine.

This refera to a statement I made aýt a

to the obligations which the Pool entailed

to assurances given or expectation expressed
by Mr. McFarland, who is in charge of the

st.ated, that the carryover would be the figure
mentioned here. I made no refernce whaîtever te the Pool hiaving been properly advised
in entailing its obligations. Neither does the
article to which the head-lines are attached
give any basis for such manifestos to the

DIVORCE BILLS
SECOND READIXOS
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS nioved the second
reading of the foliowing Buis:
Bill P, an Act for the relief of Emma Geifman Goîdman Stokolsky.
Bill Q, an Act for the relief or Albertine
M1ontpellier de Beaujeu.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it your
pleasure, honiourable senators, that these Bills
be noxi rea.d a second time?
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: No.
Honourable
senators, the motion for second reading of
these Bills gives to honourable members of
this House the opportunity to discuss the
whole question of marriage and divorce.
Many thoughtful persons regard divorce as the
greatest nationa-l, social and moral evil that
we have on this continent, and it is growing.
Others go further and believe that it, and the
light. frivolous regard in which marital relations are heid by many, are the greatest
evils that affliet our race.
The little attention 1 have be-en able to
give to the reading of saered and profane
history has convinced me that divorce and its
concomitant evils; hav e often hrought terrible
and direct scourges upon the world, and have
been :a leading factor in the decay and final
destruction of cities and emipires. w-buse naines
are now almost forgotten. Is it not possible
that history is repeating it.self?
1 shaîl perhaps 'be told that you cannot
make men moral by legislation, and I admit
there is niuch truth in the stetement. But
men can bc. restrained from evil by legislation.
if they could not, there would be little sense
in having our Criminal Code. However, legislation can give legal respectability and other
assistance te evil actions, whîch is just what
our divorce laws do. Should the Parliament
of Canada pass laws of that kind? I may be
told that in somne circumstances it would be
excessive crueltY to compel certain persons to
Right Hn. Mr. NIEIGHEN.

live in wedlook with other persans, and that in
such cases the State should intervene to give
relief. Perhaps that is true. But even in such
cases should the State ever go further than to
allow separation from bed and board? Or, in
any event, if it goes s0 far as to grant divorce,
should it allo-w the dlivoreees to marry, thus
putting a premium on divorce? Honourable
members of this House and honourable persons in the country who are flot given to
exaggceration have dec]ared that if the right to
mnarry were not given te divorcees, 80 or 90
per cent of the divorce applications would be
climinated. Would that net be a worth-while
refonm?
I stated at the outset of my remarks that
div orce ivas increasing. I shaîl therefore suhmit some figures to prove that statemnent.
For thirty odd years after Confederation
divorces for the whole six provinces of Prince
Edward Island, Quebec. Ontario. Manitoba,
Saskatchewan and Alberta ran frein one te

five a year.

Then from the beginning of this

century until 1920 they averaged about
twventY a year for the sanie provinces. From
1920 uintil 1080 they grew from 100 te 247
for Quebec and Ontario only. Then. for aIl
of Canada, they grexv from 692 in 1930 to

923 in 19.33.
This is a stale of affairs xvhieh I tlîink
honourable members should consider carefull 'v. In my opinion every persan wlie reads
the evidence given br'fore the Div orce Committec of the Senate muiist come to th-, conclusion that in the great majority of cases
there is collusion betwecn tlie parties to the
suit. and that in aIl cases the perjurv is
appallhng.
There are two, and only two, fleurishing
institutions in the xvorld to-day-tlîe armament factories and the dlivorce mnilîs.
And
Canada is doing her share te maintain one
of these institutions. Is it net tiînw we
thought of what we are doing?
About nine înonths ago the Toronto Globe
lîad an article on the subjeet xxhichi 1 tlîink

Collusion In Divorce

the parties concerned, and the desire for

find awaiting themn in snmall centres an array
of divorce actions in which the principale were

reached on divorce-aiwaye with a view to

is te have the hearing in a court remote from,

prefer to have nothing to do with the sordid
business, but the law is there, the divorce
courts are in operation, and the actions muet
be heard.
The people of Ontario had ample warning
of the condition that would arise foliowing
arrangements for quick and easy divorce. The
condition is here, and ail thougbtful citizens
are ashiamed of wbat is going on. There is
synxpathy with the judiciary in the position in
wbich it has been plaeed, but the sorry business
bas taken root and ie flourishing like a noxious
weed.
A few rnonths ago I took frorn one of aur
Ottawa newspapers this c]ipping, which reprecents conditions of another phase of the subject:
,Chicago, Jan. 29 - (U.P.) - The Chicago
Churcli Federation, yearning for the spirit of
borse and buggy days, complained to-day that
whoopee romance and stream-lined weddings
have got Cupid a little dizzy.
The Federatin, which is the voice of about
M0 ministers, turned its ire on the marriage
court in the smoke-crusted county building
where marriage ceremonies have been "stripped
dowu to the chassie." "ýWe talk about Russia
and look what we've got right here in our
own City," said Rev. PhiIip Yarrow, civie relations chairman of the Federation.
"I hate to think how many young peo<ple are
married in haste in the marriage court and
lîve to regret it in leisure. It's 'a semi-reoket,
a bit and run affair."
A mild-mannered e;quire sits in the littie
court, within sound of the jingling cash reginters of the alimony office, waiting for the
young loyers to turm the corner from the Licence
Bureau. Each day between 25 and 30 couples
came te him and ]eave for-better-or-for-worse.
It's ail very si'mple-easier and quieker than
ea'lling your girl on the telephonc.
Shora of alI fancy embeilishmients, the
Marriage Court ceremony is a 10-second ritual.
The judge, having made sure that the $5 fee
bas been deposited in the euter office, turne to
the bridegroom.
"Do you take this woman, whose rigbt hand
you hold, to be your Iawful wedded wif e9"

255

The judge turns to the bride and repeats the
sarne quLiest ion--substituting "husband" for
"ýWife."
The couple, not quite sure whether they have
been married, are hustled out to Mise Bee
Duffy Doane in the next office and'given a lithographed card certifying that they have been
joined "in the holy bonds of matrimony."
"That's what we don't like," said Rev. Mr.
Yarrow, sincerely.
"They get a certificate with the big words
'Holy Matrimony,' but there's nothing holy
about it. It's just a cold legal ceremony.
"And the county charges $5 for that. There
are a lot of us ministers who'd like a f ew
marriages at $2. And we'd make it a real,
holy one, too."
Miss Doane. wbo shy]y confessed that she was
studying psychiatry and 9ociology at night sehool
and finds the Marriage Court "a most interesting place," tries to breathe a little sentiment into the 10-second weddings.
After handing a certificate to a. gangling
youth in a lumberjack jacket and bis gumche,7wnq bride, Miss Doane said eweetiy:
"I wish you mueh happiness and lots of good
luck"And Joe' When are you going to empty
this waste býasket?"
I amn alraid, from what I read, that similar
conditions exist in sorne pllaces in Canada.
This ie a state of affairs over which perbaps
neither this House nor Parliament bas control, 'but in view of the conditions which I
have described, can honourable members continue to be favourabie or even indifferent to
what je going on? Can corne of us gather
our skirts about us and say that we wil
neither recognize nor touch the unholy thing?
As 1 see it, that is not an attitude worthy
either of ourselves or our country. I should
be giad to cee introduced a Bill to prevent
the remarriage of divorced persons in Canada.
As I have said, it je claimed that such a
law would reduce divorce applications in this
country by 80 or 90 per cent. 1 presumne £t
Bill of that kînd should be introduced by
one of the prominelxt legal members of the
House, but if no such member i.s ready to
do so I shaîl deem it my duty -to perform
the task, should I get any encouragement
frorn the debate which I hope will follow these
rernarks.
The motion wac agreed to, and the Bille
were read the second time.

HonouirRight Hon. Mr. MEIGREN:

the announcement that His Majesty wishes
the Jubilee Cancer Fond to be regarded
as a comprehienýsive Jubilee gif t from al
His Majesty's Canadian subjects, including

for i-lsirr.d that any other Jubilee gif t,
whether collective or individual, be sent to

The announcement is made public in this
way at this time because there appears to
be some idea that, personal gifts wvill be sent
to lis Maiesty by governments and officiai
bodies at the time of the Silver Juhilee, as
has been done on similar occasions. As lis
Majesty has graciously decided that, instead
of any such personal gifts, the contributions
to the King George V Silver Jubilee Cancer
Fund of Canada shaîl bie regarded as a coinprehensive Jubilee gif t, the hope is expressed
that the people of Canada will support that
Fund. flot only on account of our great
loyalty to and admiration for His Majesty,
but also because ýthe money so raised will
be used in our ftght against cancer, the
worst disease from which we are now suifering.

THE LATE HO-N. WARREN DELANO
ROBBINS
TRIBUTE TO HIS MEMORY

Be fore the Orders of the Day:
iRight Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I know I arn only responding to the feelings of ail the members of this
House when I seek ta give expression, in a
very few sentences, to the regret we ail feel
at the death of the United States Minister ta
Canada. the Hon. Warren Delano Rabbins.
Mr. Rabbins was, I believe, the third in succession of the Ministers representing in this
Dominion, in the diplomatic sense, the great
American Republic. Having already served
in sucli higli diplomatie postes as the embassies
at Paris, Berlin, Rome and Buenos Aires, he
brought with him a weal>tb of experience which
dignified his office. Indeed, so exceedingly
fine wvas bis experience that Ca.nada was
bonoured in baving a man of bis rank as the
representative of the United States in this
country. Because of the assiduity with whicb
he performed his duty wbile occupying this
post, and particularly because of his only too
manifest desire to serve at ail times in sucb
a way as to improve the relationship between
aur country and bis own, he endeared himself
to the Canadian people. One and ail, we
bighly valued his presence. To bis widow
and family we extend our very deep and
sincere sympathy. We particularly lament bie
untimely end because of the manner of man
he was-because of the charma of his personality. and the acceptability wîth wbich he discharged a very important function on behaif
of the great country he represented.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Although,
witb the exception of a few days in the month
of August last, I did not have occasion ta meet
the Hon. Warren Delana Rabbins very
intimately, I bad reason to realize that be
was a diplomat of bigb -rank, a man with a
wide outlook on the world at large,' and a
splendid representative of the neighbouring
republic. He had, it seemed, imbibed tbe milk
of human kindness, and won friendships
wberever he went. Wben, in the month of
August last, he came ta Gaspé fotr the
celebration of the four bundredth anniversary
of the landing of Jacques Cartier, be was heard
in every centre of Quebee, and by bis lingual
versatility won tbe heart of that province.
His sudden departure is a great lass ta hie
country and bis family. Ris name was being
m.entioned for a still higber position in the
diplomatie service. As Victor Hugo bas said
in his poem A Villequier:

257

Je sais que le fruit tombe au vent qui le
secoue,
Que l'oiseau perd sa plume et la fleur son
parfum,
Que la création est une grande roue
Qui ne peut se mouvoir sans écraser quelqu'un.
Our deepest and most beartfelt sympathy
goes out ta bis cbarming widow, to bis family,
and to bis country.
Hon. H. S. BELAND: Hanourable gentlemen, on bebaîf of the senators wbo reside ini
the Capital, and who bave bad an opportunity
of becoming personally acquainted witb the
Inte lament-ed representative of tbe United
States, I seize this opportunity of joining with
my rigbt bonourable friend tbe leader of the
House (Rigbt Hon. Mr. Meigben) and my
bonourable friend the leader of thîs side (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) in tbe eulogy ta wbich tbey
bave given expression. Ail of us wbo reside
in the city of Ottawa will regret perhaps more
than otber honourable members the untimely
departure of tbe bonaurable Minister of the
United States.

CANADIAN FARM LOAN BI.LL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE PRESENTED
Hon. Mr. BLACK presented the report of
the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce on Bill 15, an Act to amend the
Canadian Farm Loan Act.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
report be taken into consideration?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Now, with
the consent of the House.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Honourable members, I have no objection to the Farm Loan
Bill. but I should like to call the attention of
the Government to one feature. I think the
Government would be wise if it formulated
some scheme of insurance in connection with
the Act. We know that the commission paid
on insurance is a very heavy charge on the
farmer, and if the Government would consider
earrying the risk entailed by the insurance that
must go on this $9,000,000 of loans, the
farmer would be saved a great deal of money.
The Government of course would charge a
premium to protect itself against loss.
Hon.
what?

Mr.

HUGHES:

Insurance

against

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If I understand
the honourable gentleman, he suggests that the
Government assume the risk of the insurance,
and collect the premium.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And pay out
whateverHon. Mr. MeMEANS: The losses. It is
just a suggestion.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: So the Government would b going into a further business,
that of insurance.
Hon. M-r. MeMEANS: It would save a good
deal of money for the farmers.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: It might as well go
into the implement business.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: The amcndments
made to the Bill are very extensive, and I
suggest that they should be printed in the
Minutes and we should have them before us
whern we are dealing with this matter.
Righît Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If there is
any objection, I shall have to accede to it.
We cannot proceed faster than the rules allow.
The only reason I suggest the suspension of
the rules is this. We are getting on pretty
well into the spring. and I am told that seeding operations in Saskatchewan are pending,
in considerable measure. on the passage of
Riglt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

this Bill. In fact, for the last three weeks
iliere has been strong pressure to get the Bill
through. If there is one province in Canada
where there is no possibility of getting any
money. except out of the Government, I
fancy it is Saskatchewan. In saying this I am
not intimating, even remotely, that it is the
fault of the people; I am referring to the
fact tiat Saskatchewan has suffered from an
o-erwhelming drought and from grasshoppers.
Consequently, if the House secs fit. I should
like to have these amendments adopted now.
I know it is impossible for honourable members who were not on the committee to have
a very intelligent grasp of the amendments,
which are very numerous. The Bill is almost
rewritten. I fancy it will be about double the
size it was when it reached us, but I think
it is now legislation rather than a draft. I
know honourable members from Saskatchewan
are eager that the Bill should be passed. and
if honourable senators can see their way to
accept the amendments, I should be glad to
have thern do so. If they cannot, of course,
I must accede to the request for postponement.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: We have been dillydallying with this Bill for about three weeks.
This legislation is very important to the
Western Provinces, and I think it should have
bren reported to this House two weeks ago,
and assented to on the occasion of the last
Royal Assent. To delay the measure any
Many
longer would be a serious matter.
honourable members may not be familiar with
the numerous amendments made by the cornmittee, but in any event, though some of ifs
conclusions may be wrong, it has given the
measure full consideration. For this reason I
think we should not delay acceptance of the
amendments and submission of the Bill for
fhird reading.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Honourable members. the Bill will not become law until it is
assented to. I think we have ample time to
give it full consideration while keeping within
our rules. and have it sent over to the other
House early enough for consideration there
and for the giving of the Royal Assent before
the Easter adjournment. Therefore I think
i would be wise to wait until the amendments
are printed in our Minutes before we consider
them.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Honourable members,
I think most honourrable senators have had an
opportunity of being present at the meetings
of the Committee on Banking and Commerce
and studying the amendments. I agree with
the honourable gentleman from Saskatchewan
(Hon. Mr. Gillis) that there should not be one

more day's delay. With ail respect ta the
right honou-rable leader of the Huse, may I

has a large number of farmers who feel that
they have the best credit that can be offered
in this Dominion. It is not a question of there
being no other way in which they cen secure

SENATE

Hon. Mr. GILLIS: I scarcely see the advantage of delaying this Bill for another day.
The amendments are very extensive. I think
honourable members would be well advised
to consider them now and so expedite the
passage of the Bill to the other House. Otherwise it will be delayed until after the Easter
adjournment, to the great disadvantage of the
farmers of Western Canada.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We have two
proposals before us, bath of which would
bring about the same result. The first proposal is that we pass the amendments now and
put the Bill diown for third reading to-morrow;
the other is that we postpone consideration of
the report of the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce until to-morrow, and
then deal with the amendments and, pass the
Bill in its amended form. We cannot take the
amendments into consideration now without
tnanimous consent. Therefore. if my honourable friend from Qucen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair) insists. we shall have to postpone conideration of the amendments until to-morrow,
in the expectation that these will be adopted
then and the amended Bill be given third
reading. I recognize the importance of proceeding expeditiously, for undoubtedly the
other House will not accept what is absolutely a new Bill without thoroughly considering the changes we have made in the

might take a month. Whatever method it
adopts, two or three days at least will be
required for the purpose of going through the
Bill, and if Parliament is te adjourn by the
middle of next week the Commons will have
to make use of all the time available.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I accept the
suggestion of the honourable senator opposite
that we postpone the passing of these amendments, on the understanding that we shall
endeavour to deal with them and give the Bill
third reading to-morrow.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: There are
occasions when the Commons does not give
us much time.

ADJOURNMENT
On the motion to adjourn:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Banking
and Commerce Committee meets at once, to
carry on its consideration of the Unemployment Insu-rance Act.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Before the House
adjourns, may I ask the right honourable
gentleman if he will be good enough to make
an inquiry? It appears that in Montreal, at
any rate, the indemnities of members of Parliament and senators are regarded as unearned
increment. As it naturally makes a great
difference in the matter of income tax, I
would ask the right honourable gentleman to
Jet us know when we meet again whether this
is correct or not.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Why does the
honourable gentleman speak of unearned increment? I understood it was said elsewhere
that we were not earning anything.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I will look
into the matter. I can ha.rdly credit the
rumour. The question, as I understand it, is
of intercst only to those who have incomes
of over $14,000; so up to the moment I have
not given it serious thought.

LOANS BY FARM LOAN BOARD
INQUIRY
Hon. Mr. GILLIS inquired of the Government:
I. What is the average amount of the loans
made by the Canadian Farm Loan Board during
the period in which the Act has been in operation?
2. How many loans of the maximum amount
allowed under the Act have been made during
the period mentioned?
3. To what persons and in what loca)lities
respectively were such maximum loans made?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The answer
to the honourable gentleman's inquiry is as
follows:

APRIL 11, 1935

Mi

1. To March 31, 1935, the average first
mortgage loan was $2039, and the average
second mortgage loan was $619.
2 and 3. To March 31, 1934, a total of 24
loans at the maximum amount of $10,000
fixed under the Act. Subsequent to March
31. 1934, one loan at the maximum of $7,500
fixed by the 1934 amendments to the Act.
Of the above loans, 15 were made in the
province of British Columbia, 6 in the province of Alberta, 1 in the province of Manitoba
and 3 in the province of Quebec.
Loan transactions between the Board and
borrowers are treated as confidential and it is
not considered in the public interest that
information revealing the names of persons
who obtained loans should be made public.

but I may point out it refers not to Newfoundland at all, but to the territory handed

TRANSFER OF LABRADOR TO CANADA
INQUIRY
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR inquired of the Government:
1. Has the Government of Newfoundland
offered to sell Labrador to Canada?
2. If so, at what price?
3. Has the Canadian Government offered to
purchase Labrador from Newfoundland?
4. Have there been any negotiations or correspondence between Canada and Newfoundland
regarding the purchase or sale of Labrador?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The answer
to this question is long. I suppose I may
dispense with reading it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The right honcurable gentleman's statement that the answer
is too voluminous to read whets my curiosity.
Perhaps he couild give us a summary of the
answer.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The answer
itself, I find, is very short. Several pages of
correspondence are attached and I thought
they were the answer. This is the information
my honou.rable friend desires:
1. In 1931 the Government of Newfoundland suggested the initiation of negotiations
looking to the transfer of the Labrador
territory to the Dominion of Canada.
2. One hundred million dollars.
3. No.
4. Yes. The correspondence, which took
place in October, 1931, was made public on
the 17th February, 1932. Copies are tabled
herewith.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Does the sum of
$100,000,00 cover the debt?

Finance Department
St. John's Newfoundland,
October 7, 1931.
Rt. Hon. R. B. Bennett, K.C., P.C.,
Prime Minister of Canada,
Ottawa.
Sir,
It having been intimated to our Government
that the Dominion of Canada, actuated by the
spirit that animated the Fathers of Confederation, might be desirous of acquiring the Labrador
Peninsula, so that Canada should extend its
territory from the Atlantic to the Pacifie, the
Executive Council of Newfoundland decided to
dellegate three of their Ministers to meet you
unofficially and ascertain the views of your
Government on this matter. Our delegation
consisted of Rt. Hon. Sir R. A. Squires, Prime
Minister of Newfoundland: Hon. P. J. Cashin,
Minister of Finance, and Hon. H. M. Mosdell,
Chairman of the Newfoundland Board of
Health. The Prime Minister of Newfoundland
was, unfortunately, unable to be present at the
interview with you at Ottawa, which took place
on September 25, but was cognizant thereof and
expressed his thorough approval of the action
of his two ministerial associates in discussing
with you the matter mentioned.
Your undertaking at this interview was to
submit the question for consideration of your
Cabinet and to aequaint us at the earliest
possible date whether or not the Government
of Canada were prepared to receive official
communications in this connection and to enter
into official negotiations designed to effect thetransfer of the territory as aforesaid. On
September 28, our delegates, then at Montreal,
received an official communication from the
Government of Newfoundland on the subject
under consideration.
The two delegates who had had the unofficial
conversation with you at Ottawa immediately
conveyed this intimation to the Prime Minister
of Newfoundland. who was also at Montreal,
and, further, cabled full information to their
ministerial coilleagues in Newfoundland.
The Executive Council of the Government of
Newfoundland met in formal session to consider
this report. and, under date of October 3, 1931,
a formal Minute of Council, duly signed by His
Excellency the Governor of Newfoundland,
issued appointing as an official delegation the
three Ministers aforementioned in this communication, together with Hon. A. Barnes.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I could not
say. I recall where the national debt stood in
the early part of 1914, and, having regard to
the War and other obligations incurred since,
I presume it would not be very far out of
range of that figure.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Labrador.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Yes. That is what
they want $100,000,000 for. It is not worth
100,000,000 cents.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I understood the
right honourable leader of the House to say
that the answer would be incorporated in
Hansard. Will the correspondence be included?
Right Hon. Mr. iMEIGHEN: It is not so
very long. It may be included in Hansard.

conversations in this connection. have now the
Ionour to present to you certified copy of the
Order in Council authorizing their mission and
describing their powers, and they beg also to be
perittted to subinit to you their proposals,
regarding the suggested disposition of the
Labrador territory of Newfoundland.
The Covernment of Newfoundland iereby
offers to transfer to the Government of Canada the whole of the Labrador territory of the
Dominion of Nxewfoundland, such transfer to be
subject to the undermentioned general conditiens and considerations:
1. The rights and privileges of the fishermen of Newfoundland. and such other rights
and privileges of this nature as are actua'iy
existing in virtue of treaties still binding on
the British Crown to be recognized and preserved by the Government of Canada;
2. Hudson's Bay Company's concessions, riglts
and privileges, if any, to be safeguarded by the
said Governsent of Canada;
3. Claims arising under licences issed by the
Governmsent of Newfoundland in respect to
tiinbr lands in this territory to be adjusted in
accordance with the terms of paragraph 5
hereof;
4. The Goverrnment of Canada to assume the
obligation of paying the ful funded indebtedness of Nowfoundland. amounting to Eightyseven Million Doilsrs. aproximately, and at the
compl"tion of negotiations to rensit to the Governmîent of Newfoundland the sum of Thirteen
Million Dollars, approximately, making tbus a
total paymtent to the Government of Newfoundland of One Hundred Million Dollars in this
behalf.
5.
hlie Governimnt of Canada to deposit in
trust with a chartered bank in Montreal an
additional amsount of Ten Million Dollars xvith
instructions to said biank to deliver said amount
on presentation and delivery of a certificate
issued by the Government of Newfoundland te
the effect that all claims arising out of the
issuance of timber licences have been completely
settled and that the said Governmsent of Newfoundland is in a position to deliver to the
Governmsent of Canada a free and clear title
to the Labrador territory of Newfoiundland.
6. The Govertînsent of Newfoundland undertakes to subnit to the Legislature of Newfouîndland a Bill to convey to the Dominion of
Canada the full and clear ownership of the
Labrador territory aforesaid.
We trust the foregoing will prove satisfactory
to you and to your Government and that it
will be regarded as a reasonable basis for the
initiation of nigotiations in the connection
herein discussed.

REMARRIAGE 0F DIVORCED PERSONS
BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING

Hon. J. J. HUGHES moved the second
reading of Bill S, an Act respecting the
Remarriage of Divorced Persona.
11Hesaid: Honourable senators, very littie
need be said in explanation of this Bill,
because ail the members of the bouse understand it as well as I do. I might, however,
state that it proposes not to, ahohili divorce,
but to prevent the marriage of divorced
persons to others than their former spouses.
As stated a few days ago by myself, and
believed by many person8, this would eliminate
eighty or ninety per cent of the divorce
applications.
I think it is recognized that divorce is in
itself a great evil, and that m.ny evils
accompany it; and it is certainly growing very

264

SENATE

fast in Canada. If these things be acknowledged as facts, any legislation that would
retard or prevent the growth would be good
legislation.

When speaking on this question a few
days ago I mentioned the fact that for several
years after Confederation the growth was very
slow, and for the first twenty years of this
century not alarming. But during the last
thirteen or fourteen years it has become
startling, and I have been told that quite à
few of our people go to the neighbouring
states of the United States, get divorces there,
and come back and marry in Canada, thus
breaking the criminal law of this country.
There is a trait of character which is, I
think, common to all men and nations. The
things we do ourselves and, the things we see
done frequently by others, if they be evil in
their nature,, lose their repulsiveness by
familiarity. One of our poets, Pope, described

this very well when he said:
Vice is a monster of so frightful mien,
As to be hated needs but to be seen;
Yet seen too oft, familiar with ber face,
We first endure, then pity, then embrace.
This appears to be apropos of the trend of our
attitude towards divorce; hence the necessity,
or at all events the advisability, of oocasionally
calling attention to the great and growing evil.
A few years ago we should have been
alarmed had we been told that we had 900
or 1,000 divorces in Canada in one year. Now
we take it as a matter of course. If the
growth is as great, or approximately as great,
during the rest of the century as it has been
in the first third of it, we shall at the close
have 20,000 or 30,000 divorces a year. That is
something to think about.
The argument is sometimes used that if
divorce be not granted, with the right to
remarry,
more
immorality
will
result.
That argument is, I think, fallacious from
every point of view. In the first place, many
persons hold that a valid marriage can never
be dissolved except by death, and that therefore divorce does not and cannot reduce the
degree of immorality. But putting this argument aside, I think it is clear that if we
adopted the principle that we could do an
evil in order to prevent a greater evil there
would be no such thing as law or order or
morality possible, and decent society would
break down. Therefore the argument cannot
be sound. If, however, we are confronted with
two evils, one of which we must choose, we
are justified in choosing the lesser. Or if,
when confronted with a great evil which we
cannot abolish altogether, we can greatly reduce it by tolerating a part of it, we should
lon. Mr. HUGHES.

be justified in taking that course; and that
is what I am trying to do by this Bill.
Right
Hon.
ARTHUR
MEIGHEN:
Honourable senators, no one questions the
sincerity of the honourable senator, either as
to the rightness of the object which lie seeks
or as to the method which le judges the
best to attain it. The subject is a universal
one and bas in this country no features which
are not general in virtually all parts of the
world. That divorce is an evil we all admit.
That the readiness of couples to seek separation as a solution of differences of view and
of temperament is becoming more and more
prevalent, and that consequently the stability of the family as an institution is not
what it ought to be, indeed not what it was,
iwe all likewise agree.
But is not this measure really just another
attempt to perform by legislative restriction
that which can be accomplished only by the
reformation of the mind and the heart? I do
not wish to be a party, by a negative or an
affirmative vote, to anything which looks
like an encouragement of divorce. Likewise
I do not want to be a party to what can be
merely a futile and perhaps fatuous legislative performance. The measure, if passed,
might have some restraining effect. If the
opportunity of remarriage were denied, some
of the incentive might be taken away from
certain people who now lightly look to the
courts or to Parliament for divorce. I cannot for a moment imagine, though, that the
percentage so affected would be anything like
vhat the honourable senator bas in mind.
Remarriage may be a distant goal, perhaps in
some cases even a fairly immediate one, but
separation, I really believe, is the main
objective of the great majority of petitioners. It seems to me tîat remarriage is
more or less collateral. The percentage of
those cases in which that object is the real
and underlying cause of the desire for divorce
does not, I fancy, reach anything like the
proportion which the honourable senator believes it does. But in any event, whether his
figures be right or wrong, I cannot sec that
we are going to get anywhere by denying the
privilege of remarriage. In one breath we
should be saying to the divorced persons:
"You are now separate. You are single again.
The bonds are broken. You are each now
off by yourself. You are in the same position in which you were before marriage." In
the next breath we should be saying: 'You
are not. Your rights as citizens are hereafter
going to be restrained." It does not appear
to me to befit the dignity of Parliament or

APRIL 12, 1935
the right purpose of legislation to bring about
that state of affairs.
If we did bring about what seems to me
an incongruity, where should we be then?
The marriage would take place somewhere
else. That, to my mind, would be the easiest
way by which Parliament could be defied.
But it would not be the only way. Parlament could be defied by the means indicated
by the honourable member himself, and such
defiance, in its effect on the general moral
rank of the mass of our population, would be
far more deleterious than even the other plan.
Cohabitation would take the place of marriage, and the last state would be worse than
the first.
It seems to me that if anything is to be
done at all to discourage divorce, it must be
done by those institutions and through those
channels which exist for that purpose. And
while I am on my feet may I venture to express the hope that in those, their natural,
spheres, these agencies will be more active
in the future than they have been in the past,
and possibly not quite as active in other
spheres, for which they are less qualified.
Hon. JAMES MFURDOCK:
Honourable
senators, when I first noticed this Bill on the
Order Paper I wondered what was the reason
for its introduction. We all know that of late
years there has been a marked reduction in
the number of petitions heard by the Standing Committee on Divorce, because since
the establishment of divorce courts in Ontario
these petitions come from only one province. I have the most sincere and profound
respect for the religious scruples of the
people of Quebec in relation to divorce.
Always when a Divorce Bill is passed in this
House we hear the qualification "on division,"
which conveys to my mind that there is
opposition to the Bill on the part of members from the province of Quebec.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: And elsewhere.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: All right. At the
moment I am not particularly concerned
with the "elsewhere," because elsewhere is
not troubling the Senate with its petitions
for divorce. But we all have the most sincere respect for certain religious scruples
which actuate honourable members from the
province of Quebec and elsewhere in their
opposition to the granting of bills of divorce.
May I risk what is implied in the maxim,
"Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,"
by making a suggestion? We have heard
during this session, yes, and in other sessions,
and I am sure we are going to hear in future
sessions, a great deal about provincial rights.
But incidental to these rights are there not

265

certain obligations? It seems to me that
there are. Why do I say that? I have
never attended a sitting of the Divorce Committee, but I have noticed time and again
that the committee has decided to grant a
divorce by some such vote as four to three,
or five to three. This has prompted me to
analyse the evidence in an effort to arrive at
the reason for the difference of opinion, and
invariably it has seemed to me that it would
have been in every way preferable to refer
the case to the courts for adjudication. I
do not think it would be consistent with the
humane and decent conditions prevailing
in Canada to-day to pasæ this Bill. But I
do thinik some consideration should be given
to the possibility of removing entirely from
the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada
divorce petitions from the province of Quebec, in the same way as divorce petitions
from the province of Ontario were withdrawn from this jurisdiction. I believe if
that were done it would be possible in many
cases to deal more effectively with the guilty
party.
Where it is beyond controversy that the
province bas exclusive jurisdiction, it should
assume that jurisdiction, and then it would
not be proper on our part to question the
decision of any of its courts with respect
to its citizens. In my judgment this wouId
be an improvement on our present method of
dealing with divorce, and it should be
adopted.
Right Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM:
Honourable senators, since entering my later
youth I have been opposed to two thingsand I must say I have found very few
people willing to agree with me. I have
been opposed to capital punishment and to
divorce. I will not repeat any of my speeches
on capital punishment.
I should like to call attention to one fact
that appears to be overlooked. The federal
authority in referring divorce cases to the
courts in certain provinces did not give up
its right to deal with these cases in the
Parliament of Canada. It merely approved
of another tribunal. I imagine, notwithstanding that the courts of Ontario try divorce
cases, persons living in that province could
come to this Parliament and petition for a
divorce; and similarly with respect to any
other province. It is not the people of
Quebec alone who can apply to this Parliament in such matters. We have done nothing
to give up our right to consider a divorce petition from any citizen of Canada.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
give it up.

We cannot

Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
No; it is

Divorce did.
Sone Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

The flexiRight Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
bility in the procedure of the Divorce Conmxittee enables it, without too strict adherence
to the rules of evidence, to get at the truth
more thoroughly than do our courts of
justice.
As I said before, I have ahvays been
opposed to divorce. I admit thore are cases
whbere divorce seems to be the better way
ot. but their number is so infinitesinal, as
compared with the number of divorces granted
where the evidence has been manufactured,
that I am impelled to follow the principle
of the greatest good to the greatest number.
WVe cannot imagine tbat if there was no
divorce in sight in this or in other countries
-I
refer particularly to the south-people
would enter upon this sacred life-contract
with such flippancy as they often do when
they know tiat subsequently, for little or no
reason, they can free themselves of all their
matrimonial obligations.
J ami not from the province of Quebec,
but J amn firnly of the view, and always
have boen, that marriage was intended to be
moie than a civil contract; that that solemn
cereionvI do not know whether to call
it a acraient or not-carries with it a moral
obligation above and beyond the civil contract. That is why the clergy were given
the right to solemnize marriage. In all the
churches marriage is a solemn covenant before God. The civil contract, to my mind,
.macks too much of a horse trade or sometiing of that kind. "Well, wc will try this
for a whiile, and if it does not go, all right."
If we are going to follow that idea and make
the bond lighter, wc nay as well try the
schemie of companionate marriage. In some
coutre-, as you kno. marriage may be half
companionate, because people can be relieved
of the ir solemn obligations within a few
weeks. J believe that if by this Bill, or
soxmething like it. people were prevented
from having constantly before them, even
from the days of thoir courting the idea that
they can be relieved of their marriage contract. fewer foolish, puppy-love, passionate
andi hence companionate marriages would
take place.
MY right honourable friend (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen) thinks the mxover of this Bill

of those who obtain divorces for the purpose
of remarrying. I am inclined to think that
is the chief object in view, and the first
marriage and the divorce are collaterals.
Honourable gentlemen who have followed the
cases will agree, I think, that the figure of
eighty per cent is not too high, and that
many people are, in fact, courting others than
their own wives or husbands for months and
years because they know they can get a
divorce when the right time cornes.
I believe too, no matter what the applicants say, that there is collusion in ninety
per cent of divorces.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: In the great
majority of cases the parties to the m.arriage
tire of each other, and, as there is only one
way out, evidence is sought through paid
detectives. who, perhaps in collusion with the
party of the first part, move about and endeavour to manufacture evidence. The class
of detectives or spies engaged in the filthy
process of procuring divorce evidence are not,
to my mind, entitled to have thoir evidence
credited at all. It seems to me that we are
aiding and abetting in this looseness.
I ami not sure that the prevention of the
remarriage of div-orced persons, particularly
the guilty ones, would result in any such
dire consequences as my right honourable
friend seems to fear. I agree with him that
mxatikind is very frail, and that it is difficult
to ourtail the wrong desires of the human
But that is no argument against

passing legislation to make divorce as difficult
as possible. For weeks we have been engaged
in committee on bills of a social character.
While admitting that in their dealings with
each other employer and employee should
show that they are possessed of the milk of
human kindness, we are passing legislation to
provide that they shall be compelled to do
the right thing if they will not do it voluntarily. We are not content to leave the
matter entirely to the Church or other educational forces. I am strongly of the opinion
that the number of divorces would be at once
eut in two if the guilty party were net
allowed to remarry. I am convinced of that
from a study of the question, supported by
evidence secured froin social centres and
elsewhere.
I feel that my position in regard to divorce
is somewhat like my position in regard to
capital punishment. I think that this Bill
will not go through, and that none of us
expect it will. However, I want to make it
clear that my view is not influenced by any
religious obligation. I think divorce is wrong

APRIL 12, 1935
in itself, and 1 bel-ieve we couid curtail the
cvii to, a marked degree, and restrict the
number of divorces by eliminating from al
divorce buis the provision which gives the
right to marry again.
Hon. G. LACASSE: Honourable members,
I take much pride in expressing my full
concurrence in ail that has been said by the
mover (Hon. Mr. Hughes) and the seconder
(Rigbît Hon. Mr. Graham) of this Bill. I
go further: I consider it a personal duty.
I adimit right at the beginning that this
is a very delicate matter. especiai.iy in a
country like ours, where reiigious feeling, social
conditions and racial elements are s0 varied
and complex. I admit also that legisiation
alone w'ii] fot prevent the decay of human
minds and hearts. Yet, whiie I firmly beieve
that one of Canada's main troubles at the
present time is over-iegisiation and undereducation of the masses--and the first ef
these exists because of the second-I ask
whetlier we should aiways be content to
adolit haif measures. It may be that concessions should be made on the three grounds
of industria1 progress, social undertakings,
and econ&mic conditions, but I do not think
that. in the sphere of morality, there should
be any catering to vice and a wrong understanding of the supreme lessons of divine
precepts.
I share the view of the right honourabie
gentleman from Eganviile (Right Hon. Mr.
Grahami) that the percentage of divorces
with remarriage in view bas not been exaggerated by the mover of the Bill. We al
know what is muant by the eternal triangle.
If youi search into this probiem and serutinize
the ainis. the objecte and the reasons of the
manv applicants who corne to the Senate or
te, the courts of the country, you wiil, as
the novelist says, always find a woman-or a
man. I believe that if remarriage were not
aiiowe(i thc number of divorces would be
reduced by at lea.st fifty per cent.
Aa Canadian I take pride in the fact that
in this country divorces cannot be secured
on such frivolous grounds as prevail elsewhiere. Heru they are lî.mited to one ground.
That is considerable improvement on the
situation as it exists in some other countries.
I do not think that man bas any right to
break the seai of God as put upon the hearts
of mankind by the churches of various denominations.
True enough, as my right honourabie friend
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) bas said,' this Bill
might iead to another evii-cohabitation. I
admit, too. that we cannot prevent that to
any large degree by any specifie law of the
land-

267

Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Why not include that
in the Bill?
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: -but in this country
such conditions at least should not receive
the sanction of the State, and sacrilegious
ceremonies shoild flot bc covered hy the
mantde of iegislation, as they are in rnany
counitries.
I have risun in support of this measure
not oniy because of what I believe to be a
clear understanding of the iaws of God, but
aiso because I consider that divorce bas been
at the root. and has been one of tbe mnain
causes, of the disruption and wrecking of the
fundamentai institution of cîviiized society:
the home and family 11f c. From that point
of view I regard this question as truly
national in scope.
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: I think the brinourable member from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) is under a misapprehiension in regard
to the law a.nd in regard to, the rights of the
provinces. The Federal Government, according to the Constitution, bas full and special
powers over marriage and divorce. The province has oniy the right of solemnization.
Therefore the Parliament of Canada bas full
power, and the full right, to pass a Bill of
this kind. Whetber or not it wouid be wise
to do so is another question. I think it wouid,
but I am quite prepared to accept the view
of men who think it wouid flot bu wise under
tbe present unfortun-ate conditions.
The right bonourabie the leader of this
House (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), wbo i8 clear
on ail questions, did not take into account
ail the angles of this subjeet. Thougb I arn
not quite sure, I tbink the rigbt bonourabie
gentleman said divorce in it.self was an evil.
I know the rigbt honourabie senator fromn
Eganvilie (Rigbt Hon. Mr. Graham) said it.
Righit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I tbink it is,
but sametimes it is the letsser of two evils.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: If it is admitted to,
be an evil in itseif, then to my mmnd the
Parli.ament of Canada, by grantîng divorce
and permitting re-marriage, is giving legal
standing eand social respectability to a thMng
that sh.ould not have tbat status. 0f course
we cannot legisate to change the hearts of
men; we cannot make men moral by legislation. I think that is acknowledged. But
as far as possible we shouid avoid giving
assistance 'hy the s-et of Parldament to something tbat is evil in its nature. I think the
,right bonourabie leader perbaps lost sight of
that point, and if hie would choose to address
bimself to it hie couid make a good case.

268

SENATE

The honourable senator fromr
Parkdale
(Hon. Mr. Mýurdock) raised a question of
provincial rights. Eighýt of the provinces have
jurisdiction for the trial of divorce cases in
thoir own courts, and they might flot be
willing that the Parliament of Canada should
deprive themn of that right, at least without
consultation. I expected an argument of that
kind would ho raisod, and I think it is a
pretty strong one. In view of whbat ha. been
said in the presont debate, and bocauso of the
sparse attendance this afternoon, I feel the
cause I have in mmnd would net ho promotod
hymy asking for a vote. I may possibly
bring the matter up again next session. If I
decide to do so I shall try during the rocess
to ascertain frona provincial
authorities
whether they would have any objection, and
if so, on what ground, te the passage of legislýation of this kind by Parliament. I should
ondeavour to got the attitude of the provinces
on the questÀon. It is a matter that may
very well stand over. Rather than get an
adverse vote, I should prefer, if this is agreeable to honourablo memabers, te lot the
mattex: stand until next session. And as I
sa.y, in the moant-ime I may ho able to get the
opinion of the country upon it.
Hon. RAOUTL DANDURAND:
Honourable senators, before this matter is disposed
of I shoulcl like to sav a few words as to the
stand of those members of the Sonate who
by their religious ethies or doctrine are
precluded froma voting in favour of divorce.
When I entered this House I found there was
an occasional petition for divorce; perhaps
two. three or four a session. When the first
one camne to my attention, through a report
from a Divorce Committee, 1 inquired of
the leading senators froin Quebec what stand
miv Church took on these mattors. Some of
those gentlemen had been in this Chamber
ever since Confederation.
They wcre mon
of considerable experience; in fact two or
three of theni were former Primo Ministers
of the province of Quebec. Tbey said they
had made uip their minds not. to forma part
of the jury on matters of divorce, but to
abstain froin participation in such questions,
as at least a quorumi of other members could
always be obtained. This bias been my mbl,
and naturall *v I haveo refrained frein reading
the divorce ex idence. Since 1 'vas unable te
vote in favour of anv case I foît disqualified
te vote against it. I suppose it is on account
cf this habit of ahl senators who feel as I
do that it bias bocome the practice for His
Honotir to say that div orce bis are carried
on division."
Hoii. 'Mr. HUGHES,

Coming to the procodure which wc-ýhave
followed sinco 1867 in dealing withl divorce
potitions and bills, 1 think the Senate has
donc its xvork in a very creditable mannor.
to say the ieast. Wo have had a standing
committeo which bias constitutod a court xvith
the responsibility of hearing witnosses, weighing the eviden-ce and making a report in every
case. The Heuse of Commons bas ne such
special organization for this purpose. and our
divorce bilis are reforred by that Chamber
to its Private Buis Committee. I have often
hoard it said that the bills fail te reepîx e ina
that committee the sericus consideration which
wo give te thoni.
The voting upon those
measures is supposed to ho guidecd by the
evidence which is printed and sent over te
the othier House. I should like te draw this
mattor te the attention cf the Right Hon. the
Prime Minister and the Right Hon. the
Leýader of the Opposition, who have ai greater
responsibility than have othier menibers of
Parliament foir examining the inanner in
which divorce bis are deait with in their
Chamber.
I have been told, even this
session, that mnbers were rendering a service
te a neighibour or a friend by voting on one
side or the othier in the Prix ate Biiiý Comimittee, and should the Prime M\,ini.,tfr and
the Leader cf the Opposition find tint te be
the fact thev might decide it is advisable
te ferro a joint cemnmittoe of Pariianwn4t. if
that is agreeabie te the Sonate also. for the
consideration cf divorce petitions. The reports cf s.ucl a comimitteo woiild cairry considei-abie xveight in hoth Chambers. I may
ho toli that I am ix ading the precinets cf
the ether Huse, but I feel the mati or is
of sncbi importance that it is my duitx te
make this suggestion.
Nexv we have before us a Bill whose object
is the curbing te some extent of the divorce
evil. I thought my honourable friend froma
King's (Hon. Mr. Hughes) would ho content
with a restriction against the guiity party
alone, but ho puts the innocent and the gity
on the saine plane. 0f course lais ow n feelings as te the menacing nature of the ex il
lead bum te go that Iength. I kniox there
are some honourable members m-ho .iecept
the prînciple cf divorce and would not f ivour
legisiation of this kind, even though they
were disposed te check the ex il te the saine
extent tlîat the Bill would. XVe ail admit
the exil exists. Naturally my feeling is that
it should ho cuî-bed, and I sbouid ho inclined
te faveur legislation along the lines siiggested
by my honourable friend frona King's.

APRIL 12, 1935
On the other side of the Atlantic I have
been unable to answer the questions sometimes asked of me as to the eff ect of the
numerous divorces in the United States upon
the body social and politic of that country.
One day a gentleman inquired if it was true
that for every ten American marriages there
were seven divorces. 1 could flot answer that,
but I told him a littie story, which may be
entirely imaginative, but which describes one
effect of the laxity of the marriage tic in the
great republie. At Newport, when the residents were opening their villas, one littie
girl of ten or twelve years looked over the
fence and said to ber neighbour of about the
same age: 'I see you have a new papa.
Do you like him?" The answer was: "Well,
I don't know. We have had hlm for only
three months." And the first littie girl said:

and devotion which will be shown to Your
Majesty ou this memorable anniversary.
Froim time to time during Your Majesty's
reign the people of Canada have enjoyed the
honioor of welcoming to this Dominion His
Royal Highness the Prince of Wales and other
members of the royal faniîly, whose visits have
not only deepened the loyal devotion of the
people of Canada to Your Majesty but have
elhaneed their appreciation of the interest
whic is always taken by the members of the
royal family in all that pertains to the progress
and welfare of this Dominion.
We trust that we may continue for many
years to enjoy the benefit of your gracious and
Peaceful rule. Our earnest prayer is that He
who is the Rlder of all nations and the King
of Kings may uphold, direct and preserve Your
Majesty in health, in happiness. and in the
affectionate loyalty of your people.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: I move,
seconded by Hon. Senator Dandurand:
That the Sonate do unite with the House
of Commons in the said Address, and do insert
in the blank space therein the words "Senate
and."
I am certain it is under no compulsion
of mere convention that we of this House
are moved to concur in the resolution
which has come from the Lower Chamber.
The commonwealth of British nations which
own allegiance to His Gracious Majesty
King George welcome the advent of this
anniversary season as a proper occasion for
the expression of their felicitations, and their
unreserved and whole-hearted respect for the
persons and station of His Majesty and his
gracious Queen. We, who possibly best of
all citizens of the Empire know of the blessings that flow from the occupancy of the
Throne by a person of the character and
grea.t common sense of His Majesty the
King. are particularly pleased to offer our
congratulations.
To us who believe that we are of a country
wherein the best forms of democratic government had their birth, it is a matter of extreme
gratification that at a time when the institutions of democracy have been subjected to
a continuous and ferocions challenge, as never
before in their long history, our institutions,
in the full flush of their powers. are presided ov'er by a monarch such as blesses the
British Empire. We are proud te think that
while in several countries of the world
throres have fallen, and in those and other
zountries many establishments which we
thought were permanent have collapsed,
not only have British institutions survived,
and retained all their pristine strength, but
they owe this survival and strong position
in no small measure to the character of the
occupant of the Throne itself.
Because of that unerring and indeed extraordinary instinct wbich enables him to deterHon. Mr. BLACK.

mine just what are his functions in our Empire,
and which holds him from stepping beyond
those functions, at the same time impelling
him to perform them without any sense of
restraint and with an eye single to the good
cf his people, we have had a period of econormie and political development, and. on the
whole, considerable prosperity and peace. Ours
has been a lot of more than average happiness in comparison with the condition of
peoples of the worldi in general, for we have
enjoyed those blessings at a time when nost
of the populations of this earth have undergone very bitter suffering and very great
pain. It bas been said by an eminent authority that the duty of the sovereign is to be
where in great matters he may alwvayS be
eonsulted. to offcr encouragement and to tive
warning. It may at times be bis duty, indeed
I think it is, to exercise functions more in the
nature of the executive. But in this spiere which
I have sought to describe, his part is a large
one, it is one of tremendous respoiîŽubility,
and at a time of crisis one of crucial responsibility. This part he has at all times performed with extraordinary wisdom and with
universal acceptance throughout iis ralm.
That fathomless comimon sense which
distinguishes the line from which he springs
seems in hin to have reached an excellence
which perhaps no other has approached, and
conscquentlv throughout the entire period of
lis reign, crowded as it has been, in war and
in peace, with great events. great perils and
tremendous changes, he has never ceased to
command the respect, the admiration, and,
as the years have passed one after the other,
the increasing affection of his people.
When the time of war was on us there
seemed no service beyond his capacity. It
seemed impossible for him to err in the
execution of his great duties. And through
this period of political and econornic evolution which has succeeded the War he has
shown those great abilities which are perhaps unnatced over the whole range of the
monarchs of the world. The Throne of
Britain is secure, while perhaps other institutions may not bo quite so secure; a.nd its
security is due in very great degree to the
character of the monarch himself.
I am sure this House will be prompt, and
indeed enthusiastic, in acknowledging that the
position which the Throne occupies is due to
the high moral rank which the occupant of
the Throne has reached, and I doubt not that
in the years te come the services, already so
ample, already so truly great, wili grow in
their usefulness and their importance te us all.
With His Majesty we all like to associate
the name of bis gracious Queen. Never has

APRIL 16, 1935
the true relationship which should subsist
between husband and wife been better understood than by Her Majesty Queen Mary.
She shares not only the high duties and
responsibilities of His Majesty, but as well
the rewards which come from their long and
beneficent discharge.
This House will join unanimously, all sections and all opinions, in the address which
comes to us from the Lower Ohamber.
HonourHon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
able members of the Senate, we all join
heartily in wishing long life and happiness to
His Majesty King George, to his gracious
consort, and to the members of the royal
family.
We who live beyond the seas are not privileged to see our Sovereign in the flesh, but
we have him constantly in our minds, because
our laws are enacted and enforced in his
name. Our lives and actions are shaped
urnder his tutelage. Our main roads, which
most of our people travel daily, are known as
"the King's Highway," or, in Quebec, as "le
chemin du Roi." Yet, surrounded as we are
by this atmosphere, His Majesty's real
presence is never beheld.
The King, while wielding no power, is the
emblem of constitution and authority. He
reigns, but does not govern. He can commit
no wrong, as he assumes no responsibility.
Individually, since he can give no command,
he cannot test the fidelity of the nation to
the Crown. He cannot call one soldier to
the colours, nor can lie levy a single shilling.
Parliaments have absorbed all the authority
which in times long past was the apanage
of the Crown. Parliaments only can test the
loyalty of the people to the institutions under
which they live, since they alone can enact
and enforce the laws which must be obeyed.
In the last analysis of what constitutes the
loyalty of the nation to the Crown, as representing the institutions which govern a free
people. I have come to the conclusion that
under our democratic form of government
the real test is the consent of the minority,
after a national consultation, to be governed
by a majority which does not represent its
views. Obedience to the will of the majority,
however small it may be, is the very basis
of our popular form of government.
The King, standing above party conficts
and popular clamour, represents, within and
without, the unity of the nation; and His
Majesty King George, by his scrupulous
devotion to the duties of his high office and
the perfect dignity of his life, has endeared
himself to all the peoples of the realm. The
Crown, which is but the emblem of
sovereignty, is the essential link which binds

271

together all the nations of the Commonwealth. Should Great Britain proclaim a
republic, all the Dominions, naturally, would
do likewise, and the Commonwealth would be,
no more.
The affection of the British peoples for His
Majesty the King and the royal family ensures the permanency of an association which,
to the astonishment of the outside world,
is solely maintained by the silken thread of
sentiment.
The motion was agreed to.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I move,
seconded by Hon. Senator Dandurand:
That the Honourable the Speaker do sign
the said Address to His Most Excellent
Majesty the King on behalf of the Senate.

GOLD EXPORT BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN moved
the second reading of Bill 42, an Act to amend
the Gold Export Act.
He said: Honourable members, this measure
is of no very great significance. Since, I believe,
late in 1931, the export of gold has been under
licence. The policy of restriction became necessary becaure of the gold standard difficulties
which overwhelm-ed the world about that time.
Licences for export have since been issued only
to the chartered banks, not by way of favour
to the banks, but merely because they were
the best medium through which the restriction
could be exercised. Honourable members will
keep in mind that what is affected is not coined
gold, or gold deposited against issue or cur-

rency, but merely the product of the mine,

which is regula.rly exported from Canada. The
business of expert is done through our banks
in any event; consequently, when it was
deemed wise to issue licences they were issued
to the banks. The effect of the present
measure is merely to add the Bank of Canada
to the banks which may be licensed, because
plainly a certain amount, if not the greater
part, of the gold exported hereafter will be sent
through the Bank of Canada.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There can be no
opposition to such a measure. It is net an
extension of the power given to the Government.

for somne wiser measure, if such could be devised, must be apparent to all. The southern
portion of Western Canada, particularly the
southern central portion, has been for some
years under a devastation caused by drought,
and consequent dust storms, with the result
that large areas which formerly were fertile
have been converted into what appears at the
present time to be a desert. A large section
of our heritage is threatened. Therefore, it is
the part of wisdom to address ourselves to
the problem of trying to find some way of
rescuing from this devastation as much of that
area as can possibly be rescued.
The problem is by no means simple. Many
have advanced schemes for its solution. In
the country to the south, I believe, great
parties are committed to definite schemes for
the solution of an analogous difficulty existing
there. The opinions of those whose judgment
ought to be best differ in very important
features. For the present, reforestation seems
to hold sway in the minds of public men to
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

the south, but there is grave doubt indeed as
to whether this solution will accomplish anything in the immediate future.
This Bill provides for the establishment of

a committee on this subject, and names the
sources from which its memhers are to be
drawn. The three Western governments are
to be represented on it. Because more extensive areas are subject to drought in Saskatchewan, that province is to have a larger
representation of farmers than are Manitoba
and Alberta. The railways are to have two
representatives, the banks one and the mortgage companies one. The stock men also
are entitled to one, I believe from Saskatchewan; at all events there will be somebody
te look after the interests of Western stock
men.
And the Department of Agriculture
will have two or three men to act on its
behalf.
The intention is to combine the practical
with the theoretical-to associate scientific
men with those who have actually lived and
wrestled with problems on the ground. The
committee will devise experimental tests, the
cost of which will be met out of moneys
granted by the Bill. I understand the plan
is to select in all the provinces an area of
a township, that is to say, 36 sections, which
would run to about 24,000 acres-a very
considerable area of ground, yet merely an
experimental station when one considers the
tremendous territory that has been overswept by the dust storms-and upon this area
experiments suggested by the committee will
be applied. The purpose is to use actual
methods of resourceful, vigorous, courageous
farmers who themselves have in some measure
conquered on their own farms the difficulties
which we seek to conquer in a wider area.
When an individual farmer tries to do something by himself he is faced with difficulties
brought about bocause surrounding farmers
will net follow his methods. Consequently
something bas to be done on a bigger scale
before a proper test can be made, and this
is what the measure seeks to have done.
The amount of money provided by the
Bill is three-quarters of a million dollars for
the first year, and one million every year
thereafter for a period of four years. I know
many honourable members of the House are
deeply interested in this measure, and possibly some are more or less critical of the

particular plan proposed for attacking the
problem. No one who lives in the West,
or who is interested in that part of our
country, as most of us are, can fail to be
strongly in favour of some attempt being
made to restore to the afflicted areas a

APRIL 16, 1935
measure of the fertility and prosperity which
they enjayed until late years.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Hon ourable
members, I arn of the opinion that the Bill
will be unanimously aecepted by this Chamber. The situation which the measure is
designed to meet is a grave one. A few
years ago we heard a great deal about the
drought problem in the West, and made sorne
atternpt ta solve it by helping the provinces
to transfer farmers frorn dry areas to the
middle west or the north. Later another
affliction befeli the West in the form of dust
storms or soit drifting. I suppose this trouble
had flot before exîsted to such an extent, for
I at least hiad not heard of it until late years.
We need flot consider now the early settlement of certain parts of the West. I have
heard discussions as ta the justification for
the settiement of certain areas which it was
claimed would have been better given over
to ranching. The matter bas been debated
in this Chamber as well as in the Lower
House. We must take the situation as it is
to-day. and I believe t.hat the presenýt mieasure
will bring a ray of hope to Western farmers
who without it might be threatened with
complete failure. 1 leave it to honourable
members who corne from. the West to speak
at greater length on the subjeet.
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN:
Honourable
senators, I should like to make saine observations on this measure, thougli I have not
had as long an experience as have somne other
senators with life in Western Canad , or
have I a practical knowledge of agricuture.
But I have forrned certain definite opinions
as a result of experiments made in the part
of the country wvhere 1 reside. I look upon
the Bihl as imnportant not only to Western
farmers but to the whole Dominion, because
if it succeeds in solving the problem now
facing farmers in rnany parts of the three
Western provinces it will benefit every persan who has an investment in those sections.
If we were ta allow the southeru parts of
Manitoba, Sasgkatchewan and Alberta, which
are sffected by drought and soul drifting, ta
be abandoned without any effort ta rechaim
them, the loas ta the elevatar companies, the
raihways, rnortgage companies and individuals
would run into hundredis of millions of
dollars. I think it is aour duty as a Parliament ýta focus attention on experirnents that
have been made. and try ta find out,
through a commission such as is provided for
in this Bill, whether the extension of those
experirnents inta the dry areas will salve the
problems of soit drifting and drought.

273

I look upon sofi drifting as the greatest
menace .we have ta contend with to-day in
the southern parts of the Prairie Provinces.
We know what is happening in the Middle
West states. In the region extending from
Texas ta the Canadian boundtary and inta
Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta crops
were ruined last year, not only by heat, but
by sait drifting. This yea-r millions of acres
have been destroyed in the wheat-growing
sections of the Middle West of the United
States, and in Weetexn Canada we are afflicted
with the saine trouble, though not on as
large a scale. However, the sail drifting
menace is growinýg every year, and the coinmission set up by the Bill will no doubt
stud3r the situation and, try ta find somne
means of combating and overcaming it. In
the lîglit of history it is reoognized hy everyone acquainted with Western Canada that
in the Prairie Provinces much land was
allowed ta be taken up for aettlement that
neyer should have been used £or anything
but ranching, and that such sections should
naw revert ta the grass stage and be set
aside solely for the use of ranchers. 1 think
the commission will probabhy find it desirable ta make a systematie effort ta determine
the best rneans of reclairning and rehabilitating certain a-eas, and ta this end somie
studies will probably ibe undertaken to ascertain the most suitable uses ta which the
lands can be put.
'I doa not want to take up too, much tirne
when we are near ta an adjournment of
several weeks, bu-t I feel it is worth while ta
bring ta the attention of this House sorne
observations I have rnade f.rom experiences
through which a section of southern Alberta
passed -somne fif.teen or twenty years ago.
Southeastern Alberta, as sve caîl it, that territory runýning from the irrigated land area in
the southern part of the province ta the
Saskatchewan bo-undary, wenit through two
or tb.ree dry periads, and such a serions condition developed that the Provincial Govemnment appointed a commission ta study and
report upon it. The chairman was Mr. C. A.
Magrath, who naw beads the International
Joint Commission. A thorough investigation
was made, and ever since that time the
territory in question has been generally
termed the drought area. The people who
decided ta remain there have done so on
the un-derstanding tha4, no relief will be given
ta thern. Ahi the banks moved from the
area; %a the local farmers can no langer get
credit through those sources; a-ad the mortgage companiffl and impliement makers
refuse ta give them credit. Probably about
half the farmners rnoved inta other sections of

he had succeeded.
He answered, "No, I
didn't find any water." "Well, did you find
anything at all?" "Yes," be replied, "I am
down more than 100 feet and the soil there is
as good as that on top." That may be also
the case in other sections, and it will take a
good deal of wind to blow all that good
soil away. And, let me add, it will take a
good deal of blowing to diminish the optimism
of the people of Western Canada.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable members, it may be worth while to spend a
short time in discussing the dreadful condition
in the southwest portions of the Prairie Provinces. I went west in 1882 and travelled by
buckboard thousands and thousands of miles
over the prairie between the Red river and
the Rocky Mountains. I know Western soil
conditions over large areas, and at one time
I knew them probably as well as any man
in Western Canada.
It is a vast expanse of country, extending
for more than 800 miles from Winnipeg to the
foothills. We must get away from the idea
that physical conditions are more or less the
same all across the prairie. That is far from
being the case. The northern part of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta is fairly
heavily treed; the area north of a line running
northwesterly from Winnipeg to Saskatoon
and Red Deer. Truc, a good deal of the
timber bas been removed. Southward is a
border area partially covered with scrub
timber, and varying in width from 20 miles
to 100. Then comes the pure prairie, extending westward for three or four hundred miles,
with not a singile tree anywhere.
There is a variety of soil in that immense
territory. My honourable friend from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan) bas just spoken
of the country around Regina. He is quite
right; you can sink a well 100 feet-I dare
say 200 feet-and the soil will be practically
the sane at the bottom as at the top. It
is a heavy loam-clay soil, characteristie of
extensive areas in the West, but not of all.
Forty miles west of Regina the soil becomes
sandy loam, but with a lower proportion
of clay. Twenty to thirty miles west of
Moose Jaw is the edge of what is called the
second prairie steppe. Beyond this hilly,
sandy region is the third prairie steppe, which
runs all the way to the mountains. Most of
the soil is light in southern Saskatchewan
and that area of the third prairie steppe from
Moose Jaw westward to Calgary, southward
to Lethbridge, and south of Maple Creek and
Swift Current.
It will be seen that soil conditions vary a
great deal. As my honourable friend bas said,
92584-18J

275

in attempting to solve this problem of
drought and soil drifting several methods will
have to be tried. No person at the present
time knows what can be or what should be
donc. It is an entirely new experience for our
people.
They are experimenting, and the
provincial governments are feeling their way
towards a solution. What that solution eventually will be nobody knows.
Personally, I am inclined to think there is
only one solution-rain. The problem is not
local; it is continental. Broadly speaking,
the territory affected extends all the way
froin the Saskatchewan river to Texas. In
old maps published a hundred years ago this
immense area is called the "Great American
Desert,"-just as we have to-day the Sahara
Desert, the Gobi Desert, and similar arid
regions. For at least a hundred years, probably two hundred years-since this North
American continent was settled-that area
was regarded as a desert region. We have the
northern tip of it. Honourable members no
doubt will recall what bas happened in the
United States within the last month. I read
in the papers yesterday that 11,000.000 acres
of land sown to wheat in Kansas. Oklahoma
and Nebraska will not yield a bushel of grain
this year. After ail, what is the prime cause
of this lamentable condition? Lack of rain.
A secondary cause, I think, is the continual
ploughing and working of the soil. If the
grass had not been broken up, its roots would
have held the soil together and there would
have been no soil drifting. Whence do Western Canada and the midwestern United States
get their rainfall? Not from the west. The
clouds have to get through the passes of the
Rocky Mountains at elevations varying from
three to six thousand feet, and most of the
moisture is precipitated before the prairies
are reached.
In other words, the clouds
blown from the Pacific Ocean towards Central
Canada Jose virtually all their moisture before they reach the prairies. So we must
depend upon the Atlantic, Hudson Bay and
the Great Lakes for our moisture supply.
From one cause or another, over a period
of years we have not received our share of
moisture, and the ground bas become drier
and drier all the time. Where ordinarily
around Regina you would find the soil quite
moist at a depth of twenty or thirty feet, today the reserve of moisture is practically all
gone. Year after year we have had hot, dry
weather, with the result that the ground bas
become parched. The soil of the Regina
plain is a good loam-clay. Under ordinary
moisture conditions it would not drift at all,
but when the clay becomes dry the slightest
movement in the air breaks up the surface

SENATE

276

into the very finest particles, and the dust
drifts worse than sand. As a matter of fact
the dry soil is so light that it is taken up into
the clouds by air currents and carried hundreds of miles.
I have simply attempted to give honourable members some idea of the conditions
that exist in the drought areas of Western
Canada. Afforestation has been suggested as
a remedy. From Regina to Lethbridge, where
my honourable friend lives, a distance of
approximately four hundred miles, there are
no trees. It would require very many trees
ind an enormous amount of money to plant
'hat area. Even for a farm one mile long and
ane mile wide we shall need a large number
of trees if anything effective is to be done
in the direction of afforesta.tion. On the
other band. it is quite possible that strip
farming and other methods may be very
helpful in counteracting the present soil drifting. It is a terrible condition, and wbat the
outcome is going to be nobody knows. I
am inclinedi to think that if Providence
sends us sufficient rainfall the trouble will
very largely take care of itself.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Honourable senators,
I should like to cal. the attention of the
members of the Banking and Commerce Committee to the fact that when the House rises
that committee will continue its work on
Bill 8.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In connection
with the statement of the Hon. the Chairman
of the Banking and Commerce Committee it
might be appropriate to mention that the
newspapers, upon looking at our Order Paper
and Hansard, have found that on many days
we have sat in this Chamber for but a short
while. They have failed to notice, however,
that the measures which have come here, and
which would have taken mnuch more of the
time of the Senate if examined in Committee
of the Whole, have been sent to standing committees, where, as those newspapers would
have observed if they had representatives
here, the members of this House have been
working as long hours, and perhaps as usefully, as the members of the Commons.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I want to
express my appreciation of what the honourable senator has said. Periodically I read

SENATE

278

satirical comments about our adjournments
and the hours we sit in this Chamber. As is
too often the case, the coniments are based
on judgments arrived at without much investigation. The habit of forming opinions in this
way is in fact a curse of our times. It is
certainly my earnest desire, as I think it is of
every honourable senator on either side, that
we in this House should util.ize our position
to the utmost of our power for the advantage
of the people; and I want to say on behalf
of memberes on both si.des that I never
witnessed in the other House, where I sat for
many years, a more intense devotion to duty
than has been demonstrated in the House in
which I now sit.
This House is not a .mere replica of the
Commons-not an arena for the repetition of
the political debates of that assembly. I say
this without any reflection on the value of
those debates. The House of Commons is
the natural theatre for such controversy as
must take place over puMie problems and
political questions. The Senate is rather a
commission of review, and its work is best
performed by its larger committees, whose
members devote themselves intensively to the
performance of their task. I fancy, having
regard to the amount of commnittee work done,
and the number of members on our committees. that we have really worked longer
hours than have the members of the other
Chamber; and while we cannot boast just at
present, because in the Banking and Commerce Committee we are considerably behind
in our work, I know that we are prepared to
sit even longer hours if that is necessary in
order that we may fuly and efficiently perform our duties as members of this House.

CANADIAN
SENATE

FARM LOAN BILL

AMENDMENTS

NOT INSISTED UPON

The Hon. the SPEAKER informed the
Senate that he had received the following
message from the House of Commons:
That this liouse agrees to all the amendments proposed by the Senate to Bill No. 15,
an Act te amend the Canadian Farin Loan
Act, with the exception of the 13th and 14th
ainendments, to which anendments this House
disagrees for the following reasons:
That farm property being at the present time
at its lowest value, a total advance of sixty-six
and two-thirds per cent of the appraised value
of a farm would secure a much smaller loan
than would have been secured at fifty per cent
valuation a few years ago.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, it will be observeid that the other
House has disagreed with really only one
amendment made by this House to the Farm
Loan Bill. The amendments made in committee of this House were quite extensive,
indeed sone of them were of front rank importance. Therefore we have the satisfaction
of knowing that the other House regards our
work as having been on the whole very well
done.
The amendment in which the House of
Commons does not concur provided for a
lower maximum loan in relation to value.

As

the Bill came to us it provided that 66j per
cent of the appraised value of the real estate
could be loaned where a second mortgage was
being taken and a collateral chattel mortgage
besides. It also provided that where a chattel
mortgage could not be taken because of the
provincial law, nanely, in the province of
Quebec, the proportion should be 60 per cent.
Our committee reduced those figures respectively to 60 per cent and 55 per cent. The
other House does not concur in that reduction, and gives as a reason that it would be
relatively safe to advance up to the larger
percentage, because of the belief that the
present low values of farm lands will not
continue. The belief is somewhat hazardous,
but I do net think it well for this House
further to delay the passage of the measure
when the exception taken to our very lengthy
list of amendments is comparatively so trifling.
I therefore move:
That the Senate do not insist upon its 13th
and 14th amendments to Bill 15, intituled: "An
Act to amend the Canadian Farm Loan Act,"
to which the House of Commons have disagreed.
Before I sit down, let me emphasize again
the importance, from the standpoint of usefulness in 1935, of passing the Bill before we

279

APRIL 17, 1935
adjourn. I am quite certain the Senate will
in general agree with my view that it is not
wise under the circumstances to insist on this
really single amendment
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The committee,
in the various amendments it made to the
Bill, was actuated by a desire to protect the
federal treasury as much as possible. It
knew the risks involved in loans to be made,
because of the losses incurred on loans already
made. Yet the circumstances are such that
the Parliament of Canada feels the necessity
of coming to the help of the farming community. Naturally our amendment would
decrease the risk. This is not a commercial
proposition. No reserve is accumulated to
take care of possible losses. Every loss is
a dead loss. The future only will show
whether this Chamber was reasonably prudent
in its amendment. Under the circumstances
I do not object to the motion.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am in
general agreement with my honourable friend,
but there is one statement I think I owe it
to the House to correct. Under the original
Bill a reserve is being created to guard against
losses. That reserve has reached some proportions. If I were asked whether it will
prove sufficient in the end, I should agree
with my honourable friend: I do not think
it will.
The motion was agreed to.
RADIO BROADCASTING BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bill 60, an Act respecting
Radio Broadcasting.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading the Bill.
He said: With the concurrence of the House
I should like to have this Bill read the second
time now. It is one of the shortest bills we
have had before us, consisting of only one
clause, which reads as follows:
The provisions of the Act to amend The
Canadian Radio Broadcasting Act, 1932, chapter
thirty-five of the statutes of 1932-33, as amended
by chapter sixty of the statutes of 1934, are
hereby re-enacted, except that in section four
thereof the thirtieth day of June, 1935, shall
be substituted for the thirt-ieth day of April,
1935.
It will be seen that the only intent of the
Bill is to carry over the present situation until
it can be dealt with after the adjournment.

Two months is certainly no more than will
be necessary for that purpose. The House
knows, of course, what the general situation
is at present. Radio is administered under
the Act of 1932-33, as amended.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Which was to

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This month.
This carries it forward two months.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Does that imply
that before Parliament prorogues there will
be further legislation in connection with
this matter?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It certainly
implies, as I understand it, that unless there
is the Act fabis, with whatever consequences
would ensue. The expectation is that the
matter will be dealt with in some way before
the expiration of the two months.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

MINIMUM

WAGES

BILL

MOTION FOR SECOND READING

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN moved
the second reading of Bill 40, an Act to
provide for Minimum Wages pursuant to
the Convention concerning minimum wages
adopted by the International Labour Organization in accordance with the provisions of
Part XIII of the Treaty of Versailles and of
the corresponding parts of the other treaties
of peace.
He said: Honourable members, it is not
the intention to have the Senate dispose
finally of this Bill before adjournment, for
this is another measure which will have to
go to the Banking and Commerce Committee.
Everyone well knows the purpose of the Bill.
It is based upon a resolution passed here

SENATE
some time ago. If second reading is given
now, the measure can be committed to the
Banking and Commerce Committee for consideration; but if objection is taken, that of
course cannot be done and second reading
will have to be postponed until we reassemble.
Perhaps it
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
would be as well to postpone the second
reading until after our long adjournment,
because that would give me, at all events,
time to compare the Bill with legislation
already in existence in the provinces. When
we resume I shall ask my right honourable
friend a question as to the effect of this
measure upon provincial statutes covering the
same subject.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I cannot of
course insist upon this motion; so the second
reading will have to stand over until we
reassemble.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
much work-

We have so

Yes, we
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
have plenty of work. I think I can answer
now the question asked by the honourable
gentleman, though there may be phases of it
which I have not in mind. His question is
how this legislation will affect analogous
provincial legislation, dealing with minimum
wages and minimum hours.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
wages alone.

No; minimum

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I understand that wherever the provincial minimum
wage is higher than the minimum fixed by
this Bill, the provincial will prevail. I understand that is what the measure says, though
I make the statement subject to further
consideration.
I am under
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
the impression that the Ontario Minister of
Labour has introduced into the Legislature a
bill looking to the same end as this does. I
have read a note upon it in the newspapers,
and I am not sure that it has not already
passed.
Generally speaking, it provides
machinery for employers and employees to
get together and make amicable arrangements
as to minimum wages.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I understand
that the honourable leader on the other side
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) will move the adjournment of the debate.
Does the right
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable gentleman intend to give his
explanations now?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
I cannot
give any further explanation than I have
already given on the point raised by the
honourable gentleman. I think what I have
said is correct.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
If the right
honourable gentleman intends to make a
further explanation of the Bill before second
reading, it will be for him to move the
adjournment of the debate.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This measure
merely implements a resolution which passed
this House some time ago, and the explanation given by me in the debate on that
resolution applies verbatim to this Bill. So
I will take the ground that my explanation
is already on the records of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Then I move
the adjournment of the debate until the next
sitting of the House.
The debate was adjourned.

one addition to make. This Bill, like the one
precedýing it, restores one-half of salary
deductions, but this one applies to judges,

,COPYRIGHT AMEN(DMFiNT BILL
SECOND R~EADING

lHon. C. P. BEAUIBIEN moved the second
reading of Bill 58, an Act Vo amend the
Copyright Amendmenit Act, 1931.
11e said': Honourable memnbers, I suppoce I
should say that although this Bill stands ini
my name, it is a Government measure. Its
purpose is Vo amend the Copyright A.mendment Act of lOSD. Seotion 10 of that Act
provides that the Covernment may institute
an investigation when a conoern holds certain performing rights and withholds Vhe
issue of licences, or charges excessive fees, for
the use of these righVs. There is a concern in
Canada which has been holding a very large
number of performing rights-,-no fewer than
three millions of them.
Hon. Mr. DANDU'RAND: Three millions?

281

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Three million performing right-s, which corne from Engiand,
the United States, France, Germany, Austria, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Roumania, Denmark. Hungary, Polanl, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, Portugal, Brazil, Norway and Finland. This company, which is incorporated
in Canada, controls these rights by reason of
its affiliation with certain companies in those
counVries. Complaints have been made to the
Government that the company is cither withholding, or charging excessive fees for,
licences for the performance of copyright
works. The Government, therefore, under
the authority given by the 1931 amendment to the Copyright Act, has named is
Honour Jiidge Parker, senior county court
judge of the County of York, Ontario, te
make an investigation. The purpose of this
Bill is, flrat, to deibar any association, soeiety
or company from taking action against any
person using works covered by performing
rights, when the fee provided by the statute
for the samne bas either been paid or duly
tendered. The second objective is to prevent
any action for infringement of such performing
rights while the investigation is being carried
on by Judge Parker. This stay of proceedings is limited to six months, but there is a
provision that it may be extended by the
Secretary of State. The Bill passed the
Lower House without opposition.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But the fees
charged by the company must -have been
approved by the Seeretary of State.
Hon. Mr. BEAIJBIEN: I understand that
every company controlling performing ri.ghts

list of the works it controls and of the fees At

or modified by the Secretary of State, after

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I regret te say I
have no such data. Right of action is barred
only pending the inquiry. If the commissioner should recommend that the fees be
lowered, then of course the right to sue
would attach only to reduced fees.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I understand that if
the Performing Rights Society is exacting
unreasonably high fees the Government may
modify them. What is the reason for the
investigation?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I should have been
more precise. The Government bas no right,
proprio motu, to modify the fee until investigation justifies its doing se. Therefore
the preliminary step is now being taken to
ascertain whether the fees are reasonable.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: As I read this
Bill, it proposes to inject an entirely new
principle into the law: no person shall have
recourse to the courts except with the assent
of the Secretary of State. We know sonething about lobbying. As a matter of fact
considerable lobbying is going on right nownot on this Bill, but on other matters;
divorce bills. for instance. We find responsible citizens button-holing senators for their
vote or assistance this way or tbat. This Bill
contemplates-I hope the honourable senator
will correct me if I am wrong-that if some
specially qualified person exercises the necessary iypnotism, or presents a suffciently
strong argument, he may convince the Secretary of State that somebody has net a good
case and should be prevented from taking
legal proceedings until the Minister gives
him, written permission to proceed. Is that
the kind of justice the citizens of Canada
have under the law? I wish the honourable
osenator would explain that point.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I am afraid I caninot contradict my honourable friend. This
Bill is presented to the House in the interest
of the public. In their interest the right of
action is not denied; it is suspended pen,ding
an investigation. Theatres and broadcasting
stations througbout the Dominion have been
complaining that the Performing Rights
Society-which, as I have already stated,
controls over 3,000.000 dramatico-musical or
musical work;-is exercising
monopolistie
power. Practicallv it has cornered all such
works. Undoubtedly it is in the in;terest of
(he public that an investigation should take
place. During the course of the investigation the right of action of this or any other
conpany is suspended, because it may be very
-materially modified by the jusdgment of the
conmissioner.
-non. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. A. C. HARDY: I may say for the
information of my honourable friend from
Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) that I believe
the purpose of this Bill is to avoid what might
otherwise develop into chaos. Some time ago
the Performing Rights Society was given very
broad privileges, and within the last year or
so it appears to be under the impression that
it can double and treble the fees charged
various broadcasting stations and country
fairs for the right to perform musical works.
The charges are practically prohibitive, and
I believe the Secretary of State bas taken a
very wise precaution in introdncing this Bill.
I have had, for certain reasons, occasion to
study the matter. I find the society can in
case of dispute sue any broadcasting station
or country fair or cancel tihe licence to perform
copyright works.
I think perhaps the honourable senator from
Parkdale is right in principle. Undoubtedly
this measure is intended to prevent the
society from indiscriminately suing dozens of
broadcasting stations and other bodies while
the investigation is proceeding. But it is in
the public interest that the society should be
restrained. else the broadcasting system of
Canada will be thrown into chaos. The society's rigbt of action is barred only pending
the inquiry by the county judge in Toronto,
and in rny opinion net only is the procedure
fair, but it is absolutely necessary if broadcasting is to continue. A small station in
which I am interested, and which pays the
society the comparatively small amount of
two or tree hundred dollars a year, is now
offering to pay each month what it thinks is
a proper amount. It bas refused to pay what
the society demands. The society is accepting
that payment under protest. In the absence
of the proposed legislation the station would
have to close down, for it could not possibly
afford to pay the society's scale of fees.
I do not think any fairer piece of legislation
could be brought down. The Secretary of
State may under certain circumstances consent
in writing to the society taking legal proceedings, but that is only in case the society would
suffer a real hardship if its right of action were
barred. As I say, I think the honourable
senator from Parkdale is right in principic-,
but tere are times when it is expedient that
the public interest should be considered. While
I am not very deeply versed in the matter, it
bas come before me in such a way that I can
speak with knowledge of the facts.
Hon.
Mr. MURDOCK:
I
am concerned with where we may go from here. I
am wondering whether, if certain persons can
be denied recourse to the courts as is proposed,
it might net be just as consistent later to

APRIL 17, 1935
make a workman's right to sue his employer
for wages subject to the consent of the Minister of Labour. It may be said that that
instance is rather far-fetched, but to my mind
the principle involved is exactly the same. I
notice the marginal note of the first section:
"right of action barred when fees paid or
tendered." Tendered to whom? To the Secretary of State or to the copyright owners?
An Hon. SENATOR:

The owners.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: All right, the copyright owners. Then, as long as the fees are
paid or tendered, any person can go ahead and
utilize the copyright music, or whatever it
may be, and the owner will have no redress
in the courts unless the Secretary of State
O.K's the proceedings. Is that it? Well, it
seems to me, even though the proposed legislation is absolutely essential, it is wrong in
principle.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
Honourable members, from what has been said I quite agree
with the necessity of the Bill, but I cannot
understand why the present law does not
operate to take care of a situation of this
kind. Under the Copyright Act we give
certain people certain rights. Has the copyright holder always had the right to charge
what he likes for the performance of his work?
If so, the law should be changed. Suppose I
own the copyright of a musical work, and
some person in the United States wants to
perform that work, can I charge him $1,000,000 for the privilege? No, the law will not
allow me to take such an unreasonable position. Why cannot the department deal with
this situation as it has always dealt with similar situations in the past? Does the Secretary of State desire to get a report from a
commissioner as to what should be the proper
charges before he takes action? So far as that
aspect of the case is concerned, I am still in
the dark.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: I think my honourable
friend will find that when the Performing
Rights Society was incorporated it was given
certain privileges.
It is just as necessary
that a reasonable tariff should be imposed
on the society as on railways or even on the
man who sells the product of his farm or
business. Whether fair or not, that is the
general principle on which I think the whole
procedure is based. It is felt that the Performing Rights Society has been inclined to raise
its fees so high that it has brought about a
conflict between the distributors of copyright
musical works and the owners of those copyrights, with the result that the Secretary of
State, perhaps considering himself not competent to make a ruling, has appointed a

283

commissioner to make an investigation and
recommend a tariff that will be fair to all
parties. It seems to me that in these days,
when we are trying to give everyone a fair
deal, the procedure of the Secretary of State
is eminently right.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Does he set the
fair market price?
Hon. Mr. HARDY: That is what the intended investigation is for-to set a fair
market price.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: A lot of that needs
to be done.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: May I endeavour to
answ.er the honouraible senator from Parkdale?
A list of the fees charged by a concern controlling producing rights is filed with the
Secretary of State; but the law provides-and
I answer the honourable gentleman to my
right (Hon. Mr. Calder) by pursuing the
argument-that if there is complaint the
Secretary of State cannot, proprio motu-of
his own motion-modify those rates unless an
investigation is held.
The case is very plain. The Performing
Rights Society is an organization that controls virtually all the dramatico-musical or
musical works that are used every day for the
benefit of the entire country, not only in
theatres and in broadcasting, but everywhere,
by thousands of people. If complaints are
made that this concern is charging excessive
fees, the Secretary of State simply turns to
the law passed in 1931 and takes the first step
towards ascertaining whether the fees are
proper or should be reduced. That is why
Judge Parker has been named. The Minister
cannot reduce the fees until he gets a report
from his commissioner. If the report states
that the fees should be reduced, they will be
reduced accordingly.
What is the amendment proposed by the
present Bill? It is a very simple one. In
order to prevent a multiplicity of useless lawsuits, the Government steps in and says to
any user of a composition, "If you have paid
or tendered the specified fees for the performing rights for such composition, you shaill
not be sued." That is proper If those fees
have been paid or tendered, why should an
action be taken?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: So far so good.
But when the action is takenHon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: That is the first
paragraph.
The second paragraph provides that pending
the investigation, which may last two or three
months, right of action is barred. Thousands

284

SENATE

of actions might be taken, the costs of which
would have to be paid, and if at the conclusion
of the investigation it were found that the
fees should have been reduced, all these
actions would have been taken for nothing.
Is that right and proper? Should not the
Government take the precaution which is
provided for in the Bill, and say to the company, "Hold your hand"?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Is it necessary to
tender the full amount required by the copyright holders?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: In order to avoid
being sued it is necessary to tender.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Tender what?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The amount specified
in the list deposited with the Secretary of
State. If the commissioner says the fees
must be reduced, is it not perfectly fair, and
in the interest of the public, that these three
million musical works which are in daily
demand throughout the country should be
available for use at a reasonable fee? No
injustice is done to the company possessing
these rights. It is not unreasonable for the
Government to say: "Hold your hand! You
are entitled only to what the commissioner
will give you. When he has fixed the amount,
you may claim, but not before, because the
fees may be varied."
I suppose the honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) is quite correct in
stating that we should not interfere with the
principle that any British subject is entitled
to appeal to the courts; but my honourable
friend must know very well that as long as
there have been British parliaments there has
been an exception to this rule. When the
public interest is at stake any individual may
be denied the right to sue the Government.
Why? Because the public interest must be
protected. The same principle applies here.
Thousands of people want to use these works,
but they could not do so unlcss they were
protected. So they are protected. But in
)rder to use these works they have to pay
,he price which is fixed after investigation.

CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
FINANCING BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN moved
the second reading of Bill 24, an Act respecting
the Canadian National Railways and to
authorize the provision of moneys to meet
expenditures made and indebtedness incurred
during the calendar year 1935.
He said: Honourable members. this is a
measure to provide moneys to meet expenditures made and indebtedness incurred by
the Canadian National Railways during the
calendar year 1935. It enables the company
to issue notes for refunding and capital expenditures, as specifically detailed in subclauses
(a) and (b) of section 2, for "equipment principal payments, sinking funds, miscellaneous
maturing or matured notes and other obligations secured or unsecured, not exceeding
$8,700,000," and for "construction and betterments, including co-ordinations" under the Act
of two years ago, and "acquisition of real or
personal property, and working capital, not
exceeding $5,500.000."
This shows the division of the $14,200,000, the total amount which
may be issued.
Then it is provided that the Minister of
Finance may make loans for the purpose of
meeting authorized expenditures; and lastly,
that the Minister of Finance may make advances on account of net income deficits to an
aggregate of $44,000,000.
I ,do not think the House desires a general
discussion on Canadian National financing
just now. Suffice to say that the situation
improves gradually, and with some steadiness,
though by no means at a very encouraging
rate.
There is power in the Bill te aid other companies included in the system. Perhaps it
would be better to read this clause specifically:
The National Company may aid and assist,
in any inanner, any other or others of the
said companies and, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, may for its own
requirements and also for the requirements of
any other or others of the said companies
from time to time:-(a) Apply the proceeds of any issue of notes
in meeting authorized expenditures on its own
account or on account of any other or others
of the said companies;
(b) Make advances for the purpose of meeting authorized expenditures to any other or
others of the said companies, upon or without
any security, at discretion;
(c) Apply any and all accountable advances
made by the Minister of Finance to the
National Company under the provisions of
section four of this Act on account of the
net income deficits, in the said section described,
of the National Company, or of any other or
others of the said companies.

APRIL 17, 1935
Those are
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
companies that form part of the National
system?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. They
are really, in their various relationships, subsidiaries of the Canadian National Railways.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I suppose that
section is essential by reason of the fact
that there are included in the Canadian
National Railway System as many, I think, as
104 companies, not a few of which, while they
form part of the Canadian National, continue
in their existence under their original names.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: And all on relief.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: It bas just occurred
to me that we should probably get some
information with regard to certain conclusions
that we came to some two years ago. At
that time we held a lIengthy inquiry before
the Railway Committee, and after great
struggle we finally decided that the two
railway companies should co-operate with a
view to reducing the millions required each
year. It seems to me the time bas arrived
when this body should look for a little
information as to what actually bas been
accomplished under the provisions then made.
We all hoped for great things. There was a
good deal of talk about a saving of millions
upon millions of dollars. I for one, and I
think probably every other member of this
House, would like to know just what bas
happened during the past two years, and
whether the co-operation provided for bas
actually taken place, and what are the
prospects for the future. I realize that there
is not time to obtain that information now,
but I really think that we should take some
steps te secure it after the adjournment. It
would not take very long. I think that if
we had Mr. Hungerford and Mr. Beatty bere
for one day it would be sufficient.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Mr. Fullerton.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes, Mr. Fullerton
or Mr. Hungerford. If we had them here
for one day we could, I think, ascertain what
the situation is, what they are aiming at,
and when we may expect to get results which
will be a little more substantial than those
secured during the past two years.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There will be
no objection on the part of the Government
to the Railway Committee requesting those
officials to appear and report on progress.
Speaking very generally, and very briefly,
the effect of the measure then passed bas

285

been good. There has been some degree of
co-operation, and so far as I know there bas
been nothing in the way of friction in the
working out of its provisions. As to the
extent of the savings effected, I do not think
they have been such as were perhaps anticipated by the House as a whole. This is no
time to debate the question whether that
is the final solution or not; but we are certain
that at least deficits are steadily, if slowly,
decreasing. I do not think we can expect
them to be reduced at any rapid rate, because
a large proportion of the properties of the
Canadian National Railways were not built
in the first place to produce revenue, nor
were they intended primarily to serve that
purpose. They were built as colonization
roads and for collateral and national purposes.
Consequently they do not lend themselves
to such a reduction of deficits as might have
been expected if they had been constructed
in the first place to make money as part
of a great national system.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I find myself quite in sympathy
with the honourable senator from Saltcoats
(Hon. Mr. Calder). I for one am not altogether satisfied with the economies that have
been brought about. I recall very clearly
that when the railway officials appeared before our Committee on Railways, Telegraphs
and Harbours they freely stated that even
if the provision for the arbitral tribunal were
removed from the measure then under consideration they could, by voluntary cooperation, combine the telegraph offices and
express offices, cl-ose up hundreds of such
offices in this country and elsewhere, and
pool their terminals. All that bas been done,
so far as I can learn from the press and other
sources, has been to pool train services. I
think, therefore, it would be quite in order
for us to hear from Mr. Beatty and Mr.
Fullerton what has been accomplished to date
and what is to be done in the future. I for
one thought that all these things I have
enumerated would havé been dealt with. I
regret to say that such bas not been the case.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK:
Honourable
senators, if there is any intention of having
these gentlemen before the Railway Committee to give information with respect to
the questions that we are now discussing, I
hope instructions will be issued to them to
bring data regarding each and every one of
the proposed plans of co-operation that have
been considered as between the two railroads
during the past fifteen months, in order that
we may ascertain in detail what has prevented
the further co-operation which the Railway

cuity in understanding why he would appeai
to the electors wbo were close to Mim and
with whomn he liveil, and how he would gain
and retain their confidence throughout life.
Hie was a man.of most attractive personality,
and of a kindly and generous disposition. I
neyer knew him out of humour. Be was
gifted to a very extraordinary degree yith
those qualities which are peculiarly usefi.l in
public if e. Born in the bosom of aid Quebec,
brought up doubtless to spe'ak the Frenchi
langýuage alone, Le acquired a command of
En.glisb equalled by very few, indeed rarely
approachad, even by those wbose native
tangue it is. I always admired lis sentences
for their dignity, grace and perfect construction, such as we of English birth and rearing
raraly attain. In this I always thouglit lie
approached that great master of the art of
expression, who also came fromn the province
of Quebec, Sir Wilfrid Laurier.
Sanator Béland's delicate heal.th of Iate years
was a source of concern to us in this Bouse
and te, ail bis friends. He neyer permitted
himeif to be deceived as ýta bis precarious
tenure of life, and doubtiesa lie met the end
with the courage which sustained him througbout a long and even.tful carear.
To bis widow we extend our sincerest
sgympathy; and in doing sa we do not fail ta
recali that at a period of great anxiaety and
parul he suffered the cruelties af imprisonment
becausa on the outbraak of the War lie
voluntèered for service on bahaif of Belgium.
Senator Martin came ta this Bouse from
Halifax in 1921. 1 had the bonour af recammanding bim for appointment ta the Upper
Chamber after four years' service in the

remarnbers that for eighteen years ha was a

Commission, for three years Mayor of that
city, that lie was than electad by acclamation to the Bouse ai Commons, and from
that House came liera, ail this spanninýg a
great breadth of tima during wbich aach year
was a witness ta the strangtli of bis hold
upon the people wbo knew him, one realizes
the kind of man Senator Martin was. Unfartunately, disability in later life prevented
his being with us ragularly. After four score
years ai great strangtli, lie bas gone týo his

SENATE
during his long public career in Halifax.
Coming from the several provinces of this Dominion, we bring our special knowledge of
conditions that prevail in our various localities. The Hon. Mr. Martin had special
knowledge of the needs and aspirations of the
people among whom he had dwelt and whose
confidence he retained for so many years while
allerman or mayor of Halifax.
Senator Lewis was splendidly equipped for
a parliamentary career by bis long training as
a journalist and bis thorough knowledge of
political history. He was familiar with all the
problems which this Parliament bas had to
solve during the last fifty years. He was a
student with a philosophic mind. He was regarded as somewhat of a radical by the reactionary element, but never was he in the
least aggressive. He had a gentle disposition,
somewhat retiring and modest. By his death
this Chamber loses a valuable and highly gifted
member.
I join my right honourable friend in tendering our heartfelt sympathy to the families of
the departed senators.
Before resuming my seat I may be allowed
to read a letter I have received from Madame
Béland, asking me to thank all my colleagues
who have been so kind in expressing deep appreciation of the life of Dr. Béland and sympathy with her in her great loss:
(Translation)

Yorins grateful and sorrowing.
Henriette Béland.

Hon. RODOLPHE LEMIEUX: Honourable
members, I join with both leaders of this House
in offering my sincere sympathy to the families
of our three departed friends.
Our late colleague Dr. Béland has gone down
in the full splendour of bis meri-dian. I wish
I could express adequately the sorrow we all
feel when we think that he is departed, that we
shall no more press bis loyal hand, nor enjoy
bis cheerful conversation.
He and I were old friends; indeed, fortyfive years ago I became acquainted with him,
when he was still a budding young student in
his native town of Louiseville, in that community of well-to-do farmers where bis forbears had settled in a verdant plain dotted
Hun.

Mr1. DANDURAND.

with church spires, with the Laurentian bills as
a background, and had laboured and prospered. I, at once, had been subdued by his
eloquence and attracted by bis charming
personality. As years rolled' by, we became
very much attached to each other.
He was about to receive bis medical degrees
froin Laval University. He then left Canada
to practise lis profession in one of the New
England centres, so that he might master the
English language. He returned in time to be
elected in Beauce county for the Provincial
Legislature, but soon gravitated to the Dominion Parliament, and since tien he bas sat
continuously, first in the Commons and later in
this Chamber.
Senator Béland was a power before the
people, and I know of few men who were as
dearly beloved by their electors as our late
lamented colleague.
He possessed to an unusual degree the grace,
the intellect and the impulsive generosity of
bis race. He lived in the lives of bis people,
bled in their wounds and wept in their sorrows.
He endeared himself te all because he naturally
applied his heart to their heart and felt its
beatings.
Who in this Chamber can ever forget bis
radiant smile and his genial mind?
One of bis last speeches-I think it was
his last-was bis firm and loyal stand on
behalf of bis profession, a stand which reminded us of that noble book written by
Honoré de Balzac on the Country Doctor,
that humble servant of the people, rich or
poor, healer of ills and consoler of human
miseries, ever ready to answer the call of bis
patients, by day, by night, in fair or foul
weather, giving but a fleeting thought to the
question of material reward.
As a public servant Dr. Béland first came
prominently before the country on the everperplexing problem of the better conservation
of natural resources. At the request of Sir
Wilfrid Laurier he had been appointed, with
Sir Clifford Sifton, to represent the Dominion
at the notable North American Conferences
convened at Washington by the late Theodore
Roosevelt.
He also took a deep interest in public health
matters. In recent years he published several
useful tracts which were made part of the
curriculum of our colleges, schools and convents.
It is generally aeknowledged that as Minister of National Health and of Military
Pensions he made a name for himself. He
iad a thorough grasp of such problems and
applied himself assiduously and successfully
to their solution. His sole objective was the

MAY 21, 1935
public weal and the welfare of returned
soldiers. To serve was ever his watohword.
He gave a striking evidence of bis desire
to serve, when in 1914, during those fateful
advances of the German invasion, he--a Canadian doctor-chose to serve in the military
bospitals of Belgium. He knew what risks
he was taking. He soon became a prisoner of
war. H1e accepted his fate, cruel as it was,
uncomplainingly. We ail know througb what
an ordeal hie passed during bis years of internment in the Berlin jail. Our hearte melted
as we were apprised of ilîs that befeli him
ail of a sudden. We were proud of him, hocause we knew bow chivaîrous ho was. 0f
course, he soon disarmed the enemy by bis
equanimity, bis cheerful countenance, bis wit,
and also by the readiness witb wbich ho freely
tendered medical services to frionds and foes
alike.
The good doctor, a perfect gentleman, won
the admiration of aIl. But he was too rich
a prize for Germany to be given the freedorn
whicb the laws of bumanity commanded. So
he languisbod in jail, and tbere, bebind tbe
bars, ho felt the firsýt attacks of the fatal
illness wbicb finally so emaciated bis featuros
tbat he said froquently: "I shall die soon;
I know it: I arn ready."
Our colleague wa;s a man of deep religious
convictions and was propared to appear bof ore
his Creator. Some weeks ago, wben about
to leave on a trip for a rest cure, hie said
to the honourable senator from Glrandvillo
(Hon. Mr. Chapais) and mysoîf: "I arn going
soutb in search of the sun." Hie lef t, but
alas! it was not to batbe in the sun nor to
breathe the balmy breoze of the South, but
to enter tbe Valley of Sbadows, tbat boumne

well.
is memory will be preserved by Parliament, whicb he bas adorned tbeso rnany
years, and in whose halls ho leaves tbe imprint of a puissant intellect and a chivalrous
soul.
To bis bereavod widow, to his dearly beloved children, to bis family se bighly respocted in my province, 1 beg to offer, in
your naine, the bornage of our profound
sympatby.
Right Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM: Honourable senators, 1 do not rise to attompt to
add anytbing to what bas been so woll saîd
by tbe rigbt bonourable leader of the Goverument and our leader on this side and by the
honourable gentleman wbo bas just taken bis
seat. I fully concur in everytbing they bave
said. Any person who knew our lato col-

289

leagues will agree tbat notbing bas been
overstated in paying tribute to tbeir memory.
As an Onitario man I sbould like to add
my tribute to the momory and worth of
John Lewis. I bave known Senator Lewis
for so many years that I wold not attenipt
to state, even approximately, wben I ýfirst met
hum. I met lim in newspaper work, and wag
at once attracted to bim, not by wbat he
said, but 'by wbat be wrote. In listoning to
Mr. Lewis, as ho tben was9, one was not unprossed witb tho driving force of bis utterancos; but tbioso utteirances, once road, wero
found tob'h not only impressive, but inspiring.
Honesty of purpose was an out.standing
characteristic of Senator Lewis. H1e belioved
in everything hoe adyocated, and he was ready
to condenui. anytbing he did not believe in.
H1e shrank froin wbat we caîl the hand-tohand struggle, but took bis own quiet way;
and, given a pen, ho could discuss any question of public interest with as groat clarity as,
and perbaps more convin*cingly than, any
of the root of us in this flouse. Wben I first
entered journalism as a young man, although
we were about the saine age, I always took
great pleasure in having a quiet talk with
John Lewis. No inatter how convinced one
nigbt ho before seoing bim, he alïways loft
an impression that influenced ono's future
treatment of the question that bad boon
discussed.
I neyer droamed, of course, that ho was
so near bis end. One characteristie that
impressed mie aIl tbrougb bis life was-and
y-ou will. have noticed it here-that he
sympatbizod witb that portion of the coinmunity, no matter what it might ho called,
wbichbc eft was not getting fair play. John
Lewis was always9 a sympathizer witb those
wbo were down. Except, in bis profession,
he neyer aspired to dlimh, or to ho classed
as an arîstocrat, or as one of those wbo were
above birn in station.
I neyer came in contact witb another man
from whom I cuuld get as much information
in such a short space of turne as I could. get
frein John Lewis. Wbatever question one
introduced ho could discuas intelligently, as a
man who baýd read, di-gested wbat hoe read,
and tbougbt about it. Ho was broad-minded,
but very persistent in ad'bering to what hoe
believed was right, oven though others mîgbt
not agreo with hum. His request tbat a
certain rabbi ho asked to make an address at
bis funeral was one evidenco of bis hroadmindedness and of the hreadth of bis friendship. That address, wbicb was most eloquent,
did not take the place of the regular cburcb
cereýmony, but was in addition to it. Anyone

who did not hear the address could hardly
realize the effect it had upon those who
heard it, because it was known that Senator
Lewis had requested it.
Through our lives we shall find many men
whose utterances are more emphatie than
were those of John Lewis, but we shall never
find anywhere a man with opinions more
soundly or honestly formed. Though there
may be men in this Parliament, or elsewhere
in Canada, who will be more talked about
than Senator Lewis, we shall never find any
person whose words and utterances will follow
us more constantly through life. I join with
those who have already paid tribute in extending my sympathy to the widow and family
of the late Senator Lewis.
Hon. H. C. HOCKEN: Honourable senators,
while joining with those who have spoken so
eloquently of the late Dr. Béland and the
late Peter Martin, I want, in a few words,
to pay a special tribute of respect and esteem
to my old friend the late John Lewis. Our
friendship began, I think, before his friendship
with any other man who knew hit,, or before
mine with any man I know. We were boys
together in the primary school.
Senator Lewis subsequently entered upon
newspaper work, as I also did. Forty years
after we were in school together we found that
we were both engaged in newspaper work.
He was the editor of the Globe, writing Liberal
editorials at the corner of Melinda and Yonge
streets, while I was editor of the News, a Conservative paper published only two blocks
farther up the street. So we were in constant
contact, and our friendship was enduring.
While bis views were different fromn mine,
there was never anything between us but the
warmest friendship. He was a man who had
regard for the fact that there were two sides
to every question, and he was always able to
consider the side of his opponent. I hope I
was too. He was distinguished for the moderation of his writing and the fairness of bis
argument. He was never violent in his argument or in bis advocacy of any cause; he was
always logical and fair. and, according to his
views, perfectly just. It was but natural that
throughout a rather extended life a man of
that type should never make an enemy. By
reason of his fine qualities of fairness and
tolerance, and bis willingness to consider the
other man's position, he was the enemy of no
man, and no man was his enemy.
One of Senator Lewis's striking characteristics was bis passion for personal liberty: he
allowed no man to infringe on bis liberty, and
infringed on the liberty of no man. He
thought that if a man was sincere in his conRight Hon. Mr. GRAHAM.

victions he should not be violen'tly criticized
for holding them. He was a fine, tolerant,
Christian, Canadian gentleman, and by reason
of his judicial temperament was eminently
fitted for the place he was given in this House.
In our own ciýty, where he lived practically all
his life, he was as highly esteemed as any man,
and justly so, for his qualities of mind and
heart.

Right Hon. Mr. Meighen for the second reading of Bill 40, an Act to provide for Minimum Wages pursuant to the Convention concerning minimum wages adopted by the International Labour Organization in accordance
with the provisions of Part XIII of the Treaty
of Versailles and of the corresponding parts of
the other treaties of peace.
HonourHon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
t
able sena ors, when my right honourable friend
moved the second reading of this Bill I expected a somewhat fuller explanation than
he gave. He referred to the debate which
had taken place when the draft convention
was before us for approval. After looking
through the Bill I am strengthened in the
conviction that it is a matter which for practical effect and application is more of a provincial than of a federal nature. The reason
given for this legislation has been the desirability of establishing uniformity in minimunm
wages throughout the country. Yet I find in
the Bill itself a provision that the Governor
in Council may make exceptions where conditions in different areas vary so grcatly as
to justify the conclusion that in certain instances the wage scale can be better regulated
by the provinces. When we were discussing
the draft convention I emphasized the point
that conditions are not alike in all the provinces, from one seaboard to the othier, and
the w-ording of the Bill shows a recognition

MAY 21, 1935
of the fact that the variation in different areas
may be considerable. I will not refer to the
terms of the Bill, but my conviction that this
is a matter which might well be left to the
provinces is substantiated by the various
clauses of the measure.
Perhaps my right honourable friend will
explain to us why it is that, according to
section 12This Act, except section four, shall corne into
force when assented to, and section four shall
come into force when proclaimed by the
Governor in Council.
I find it difficult to imagine how the rest
of the measure could be of any utility if
section four were not put into force. My
right honourable friend may explain this now
or when we go into committee.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
I should
prefer to give the explanation in committee.
Though it is a matter of an important detail,
still it is a detail.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at
3 p.m.

ST. LAWRENCE RIVER CHANNEL
INQUIRY FOR RETURN

Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. POPE: Before the Orders of the
Day are called, I desire to remind the Government of the fact that in March I moved
for returns in connection with the digging
of the canal system of the St. Lawrence river.
If the Government is not dead, or if the
Minister of Public Works has not been replaced, I think it is time I had my returns.
I also desire to give notice that next Tuesday I shall ask the Government for a return
of the annual report as made by the permanent
engineer of the Montreal Harbour. I trust
I shall receive some response to my request.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I remember
the order made by the House. As the return
is a lengthy one, I presume its preparation
would take considerable time. The fact that
preparation of a return takes two months is
no evidence that the Government is dead.

THE LATE SENATOR SCHAFFNER
TRIBUTE TO HIS MEMORY

Before the Orders of the Day:
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I have just heard the very
distressing news of the death of another of
our number, the Hon. Senator Schaffner.
We naturally and inevitably feel a sense of
shock at news reeeived so suddenly as this
during the progress of a session, though all
of us who have been intimate with the senator
were aware for months that his physical
strength was rapidly diminishing. Having
represented for many years, and having lived
for a still longer time in, tihe province of
Manitoba, from which Senator Schaffner came
into political life, I knew him extremely well,
worked with him, and met him constantly,
politically and socially, for a period of nearly
three decades. Like many others who have
been su'ccessful in our Western Provinces, he
was born in the eastern Maritime Provinces
of this country. He was of 'German and
English parentage, and the thoroughness and
devotion to work characteristic of both races
were well exemplified in the character and
career of Senator Schaffner. For many years
he practised medicine in the southern portion
of Manitoba, in one of the finest districts of
that province, and there be attained a very
high and credi-table standing not only in his
profession, but in civil and community life.
In 1904 he first contested a seat in the
Dominion House and was successful by a
considerable majority. This success was repeated in 1908 and 1911, and from the House
of Commons he was raised to this Chamber
in October, 1917. We all know the services
he has rendered to Parliament and the
country in his capacity as a member of important committees here. We know of his
devotion to duty and his uniform courtesy,
and we know particularly also of the kind
disposition and friendly character of his good
wife. We all lament his loss, though he had
almost reached the age of four score years.
His colleagues in this House, and particularly
those who have known of the constant attendance and poignant anxiety with which Mrs.
Schaffner has laboured with him for many
months past, extend to her the deepest and
most heartfelt sympathy in this her irreparable
loss.

292

SENATE

My right
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
honourable friend has spoken of the qualities
which distinguished our lamented colleague,
Hon. Dr. Schaffner, who has just left us for
a better world. I confess that I did not
know very much of his political activities
prior to his coming to this Chamber. We
have been together now for nearly eighteen
years and gradually I have come to appreciate more and more his excellent qualities.
He was, as my right honourable friend has
indicated, courtesy itself.
I happen to know of the change that came
over his mind with respect to the men with
whom he came into contact, or met in combat,
in political life. I learned that he had been
one of the sternest and strongest party men
to be found in Manitoba; that he had waged
a war, which for him was a holy war, against
an enemy in whom he saw no good at all.
That state of mind was net peculiar to himself, for in my early years I was perhaps as
aggressive a politician as he. But I had
opportunity to observe how he mellowed and
came to realize that we human beings are
made of virtually the same clay and actuated
by the same sincerity in our political alliances
and affiliations. In 1926 or 1927, when about
to cross the ocean-I think, for the first time
-he asked me if I could give him any letters
which would enable him te sec His Holiness
the Pope. I did all I could to that end. On
reaching Geneva a few months later I heard
that he had passed through that city and seen
his old deskmate of the House of Commons,
Sir Herbert Ames. Sir Herbert asked him
how he liked the atmosphere of the Senate,
and he answered: " Compared with the House
of Commons, it is as day to night. In the
Senate I have met men who are actuated solely
by the desire to revise legislation to the best
of their abilities, without any political or
electoral consideration. Sometimes I sit in
at a debate in which half a dozen lawyers on
DOe side and half a dozen on the other deal
with a particular piece of legisation until
late in the evening." He referred to the
Bankruptcy Act, every clause of which had
been discussed by my honourable friend from
Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) and
the late honourable Senators Béique and Sir
I remember seeing Dr.
James Lougheed.
Schaffner sitting from eight o'clock in the
even:ig until half past eleven, thoroughly
cnjoying the work that was being donc. He
exprecsed to Sir Herbert Ames his appreciation
of the fact that we members of this Chamber,
Liberals and Conservatives, attended quietly
to the serious work of considering lcgislation
without having in mind political advantages
Riglt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

that might accrue to one party or the other.
And Sir Herbert Ames expressed his surprise
at such a transformation: one whom he had
known as among the sternest and strongest
party men in the House of Commons had so
mellowed that he saw no difference between
sitting behind Sir James Lougheed and sitting
behind Senator Dandurand.
I mention that because it revealed to me
the human nature of Dr. Schaffner at its best.
I had already discovered bis kind qualities
of heart and mind, and to this day I have
felt towards him the most sympathetic and
friendly sentiments. I am sure I express the
feelings of everyone on this side of the House
when I say that we all join in extending to
his family our deepest sympathy.
ADJOURNMENT
On the motion to adjourn:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am glad
to be able to report -that the Committee on
Banking and Commerce has finished, this
afternoon, its labours on the Unemployment
Insurance Bill, No. 8. The committee, I
think, has been engaged constantly on the Bill
for nearly two months.
The Committee on Banking and Commerce

meets this afternoon immediately
adjournment of the House te consider Bill 21,
with respect to the eight-hour day.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Can the right honourable gentleman advise us as regards the
Senate sitting on the 24th?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I can assure
my honourable friend that this House will net
sit on the 24th of May. I rather feel, though,
that we should sit next Monday.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: In the evening?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I should like
to say in the evening, but our work in the
Banking and Commerce Conmittee is pressing
and is far behind. My hesitancy about mentioning the evening is due to the fact that I
think the committee should sit in the forenoon
of Monday and if the House is net to sit until
the evening there may net be a quorum in the
committee.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would suggest
that inasmuch as there may be very little, if
any, business on the Order Paper for Monday
evening. we might meet at 8 o'clock, adjourn
in a short time, and devote the whole evening
to the wnrk of the Banking and Commerce
Comith e.

REPORT

COMMITTEE

Ronl. F. B. BLACK presented the report
of the Standing Committee on 'Banking and
Commerce on Bill 8, an Act to establish an
Employment and Social Insurance Commission, to provide for a National Employment
Service, for -Insurance against ilnemployment, for aid to Unemployed Persons, and for
other forma of Social Insurance and Security, and for purposes related thereto.
He said: Honourable members,' this Bill
has been before the Committeeý on fBanking and Commerce for some four weeks of
almest continuous sittings. The committee
has made many slight changes in the Bill
and a few important ones; in ahl, fifty-one.
,I have in mind when 1 present a 'Bill of
this kind the remark that was frequently
made in past years by a most distinguished
member of this House, the late Right Hon.
Sir George Foster, that an explanation should
be given. This is often very embarrassing,
and I should not like to be held diown, too,
striotly in attempting to explain this Bill.
At the risk of wearying honourable senators
Who are members of t.he committee, but
for the benefit of those Who are not, 1 arn
going to make a f ew explanatory remarks.
You aIl know the obj ect of the Bill. The
general provisions are these. The Government of the day shall set up a commission,

293

to consist of three members. The chairman
is to ha appointed by the Government, and
the other two memibers are to be appointed
by organized employers and organized employees, respectively.
Not
Right Hon. Mr. MEIIGHEN:.
appointed; neminated.
Hlon. Mr. BLACK: Nominated. The cost
of the commirission, including salaries, organization expenses, and every expenditure connected
with it, is to be borne by the federal treasury.
The insuranlce fund is to be made up of contributions by employers, employees and the
federal treasury, the last mentioned to contribute twenty per cent of the fund. The
weekly rates of contribution are set forth in
the Bill, being 25 cents a week -for maie
employees of twenty-one years and upwards,
and 21 cents a week for female employees of
twenty-one years and upwards, in addition
to which an equal amount will be contributed
by the employers. In the case of minora
the contributions are scaled down to as littie
as 7 cents a *week. The bene-fits receivable
are listed on page 35 of the Bill. In the case
of a man the amount is not. to exceed $1 a
day, or $6 a week, and in the case of a
woman 85 cents a day, or 85.10 a week.
Smaller sums will be received by unemployed
persons who are under the age of twenty-one.
IUnder the provisions of the Act a beneficiary is entitled to receive benefits for a period
not exceeding 78 days in any one year, and if
he has dependents there is provision for additional sumns. Broadly speaking, 78 days is the
limitation. There are a number of exemptions.
to which 1 shall pe.rhaps refer more partioularly when I take up one or t'wo of the
amendments which we made. Those exceptions from the provisions of the Bill axe
to be f ound on page 8, section 16, and page
31, schedules, Part II.
In order to be eligible for relief payments
the applicant must be in good standing, must
have contributed for not less than f orty weeks
within a period not exceeuding two years, and
must have beeu engaged in an insurable employment. F'urther, under section 20 of the
Bill, proof must be .present.ed by the applicant
for relief that he or she is capable of and
available for work and has been unable to
obtain suitable eaployment. I mention this
because it seemed to, iembers of the committee to be important to provide against
imposition by persons seeking relief to which
they were not entitled.
There are penalties for employers of labour
Who evade in any particular the provisions of
this Bin!. Fines may be imposed, and if necessary they may be made exceedingly drastie.

294

SENATE

Anothier Mtaternent that might help to clarify
the ineasure to some hionourabile memibers is
that the collection of contributions by both
employees and employers mu.st be made by the
employers. The record of payments muitst be
kcpt on books or cards, somnewhat similar to a
time book or time card. To these books or
cards a rev\enue stamp, or sorne type of stamp
to be devisýcd, amounting to 25 cents or less,
as the case may be, wilI be affixed every week
for the employee, if the measure is stri-ctly
conformed to, and a stamp of the same amount
for the employer; and the employer is respenisible for seeing that this is doiae. These
books or cards will be kept in the possession
of the employer, if that is found to ha mest
convenient, though it is flot essential under the
Bill as 1 understand it. At the end of every
week the employee may hia%-e access to bis own
book or card. The books or cards muast be
open to examination by inspecters in the
v ariens divisions.
Regional divisions are to be set up by the
Commission, as I have already intimated. In
each of these areas there wilIl be a central
oflice and also certain bureaus whicb wý%ill
really
ha ciimploiaaent agencies or clcaring-hiii:se. for
information respecting employees seeking work
and employers seeking workers. The name of
every person out of employment and on relief
rnust be registered at one -of these places, and
any person who is offered employment and
dees net take it is liable to lose the benefits
provided for by the measure.
As I have said, the committee made a large
number of amendments, bot I shaîl refer te
only a few of them.
Section 16, subseýction 1, paragraph (a), on
page 8 of the Bill as it came to us from the
flouse of Commons, provides that where any
employed persan proves that lie is "in receipt
of any pension or income of the annnal value
of $365 or upwards, which dees not depend on
lais personal exertiona," he shail niot be hiable
to contribute, nor shail he be insured under
this Act. That paragraph lias been taken eut.
I do net think this needs any particular comment.
The next material alteration in that part
of the Bill was te section 27, on page 17.
Thore xas a provise fer the referring of
apr lications to the Exehequer Court. and it
wvas decided ba' the cominittee that it was
net acîxisable to bave sucbi references made te
that court, as the possibly numerouis applications might neecsýitate a large inerease in
that branch of the judiciar 'v, and the work
it liad been intended to p:î.ssoni to thiat court
nig-ht botter he on0e by the, Commission,
whirh would bn more cexc atwith the

whole situation. So that previse bas been
taken eut.
Then in section 35, subsection 7, page 25,
it was provided:
Thîe Commission miay open and maintain
doposit accounts with chartered hanks and any
balances se nlaintdijled shahI form part of the
f lnd.
The affect of that bas net been changed, but
we bave broadened it se as to bring within
the purview of that subsection two banks, I
think, which operate in the province of Quebec under special charter.
On the subjeet of exenmptions I think I
shouhd say a word or two. I have net a note
on this befere me. Paragraph (f) of Part II
of the sehedules provided that employecs in
banks, insurance cempanies and financial institutions generally should be exempted from
the provisions of the Bill. The cemmittee
lîeard evidence from representatix as of banks,
insurance cempanies, trust companies, department stores, wholesale and retail marchants'
associations, erganizations of different classes
of merchandisers, telephione companios, railways and other bodies, aîl of wvhom wanted
to know why, if exemptions were te, be
granted alt alI, the privilege should net be
extended te thein. Very streug arguments
were presented te show that certain industries and parts of etîmers should be exempted,
and I think the majority ef the committee
were cenivinced that if we did recemmend the
exemptien of banks, insurance companies,
brokerage bouses and financial institutions
genernlly, there were ether institutions which
had almost equally goed dlaims te similar
treatment. Porhaps net aIl these ether institutiens could show sucla a high percentage
ef steady employment as the banks and financial concerns in general, yet in manv cases
the difference w-as Io slight that if exemptions
were granted at aIl it weuhd be difficult to
draw a line, and the whole structure of the
measure would be ruined, becamuse thora weuld
net be enougha contributers te keep the insuranco fend on a basis sufficiently stroîig te
enable it te benefit those wheo in future wouhd
need te depend upon it.
The Bill dees net propose te take care of
cxistieg uuemphoyment. That is te say, the
ebjeet is net the eliminatien of the so-called
dIole ut the present timo, but rallier the
pi-oviding of insurauce against unemployaaont
of people w-ho are now w-orking. It is based
on the assiumptioo, w'hich I think is a reasenableonee, that eventuahly inilstry will revive
te a greate- extent than it already lias donc,
and that those w%-ho in fiituire become îînemplex-ed w-ill ho taken caro of by this insurance
fund, se tlhat the dole ex unempleymcnt

I rather thought it was the intention of the
chairman of the committee that its fifth
report also should be considered. But other
matters of business intervened and there was
no motion to adopt the fifth report. It was
merely a report as to certain formalities

be delayed until next week.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, I beg to move that when the House
adjourns to-day it stand adjourned until Tuesday next at 3 o'clock. I take this opportunity
of pointing out that it is necessary for the
Banking and Commerce Committee to hear
representations in respect to the eight-hourday Bill, which is at present before the
committee, and the first date on which those

295

representations can conveniently be heard is
next Tuesday. The committee has already
gone through the whole Bill clause by clause
and is awaiting such arguments as may be
advanced before it finally decides upon the
form of certain provisions. In the light of
this situation there is no value in meeting
on Monday. Consequently I have moved
adjournment until Tuesday next at 3 o'clock
in order that we may be certain to have a
good attendance at the Banking and Commerce Committee when it meets Tuesday
forenoon at 10.30. I ask honourable members
to note the time.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: I would remind the
right honourable gentleman that railway connections between Quebec and Ottawa are
very bad. I submit that as a member of
the committee I should not be called upon to
be here at 10.30 in the morning when the
Senate does not meet until 3 o'clock in the
afternoon.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Why go away at
alil? Why not stay here?
Hon. Mr. PARENT: Surely when the
Senate is not called to meet until 3 o'clock
in the afternoon I cannot be called here for
10.30 in the forenoon.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The committee is called for 10.30 in the morning.
That I cannot change. The honourable member has been called. You can call spirits
from the vasty deep, but they may not come.
I hope the honourable gentleman will not
act like the spirits. Persons fron. Ontario,
the Maritimes and Quebec have been summoned to be here on Tuesday morning. If
the Senate ad!journed until the evening of
Tuesday we might have no quorum of the
committee that morning. We do not want
this to occur. I have no doubt there will be
a good attendance of the Banking and Commerce Committee in the morning if the Senate
is to meet at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: The matter is not
very important, but I would point out to
the right honourable gentleman that unless I
can reach Montreal at an early hour in the
morning I cannot be here in time for the
committee meeting.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I understand
that.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: As I have said, rail
connections between Quebec and Ottawa are
very bad.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: If the honourable member leaves Quebec at 1.30 in the
afternoon of Monday he will be he.re at

Hon. Mr. PARENT: But that involves a
waste of valuable time.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: I understand the
eight-hour-day Bill is the only business now

before the Banking and Commerce Committee,
and the Price Spreads Bills wifll not be ready
for two or three weeks. Perhaps the right
honou-rable gentleman can tell us something
about the probabilities as to the House sitting
all through next week. If there is to be
an interval of, say, ten days, we from the
Maritimes might find it convenient to go
home.

there is no objection, that these reports be

placed on the Order Paper to be considered
to-morrow.

I suppose the
cases are all unopposed?

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: All unopposed.

make them any the better, of course.

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable members of the Senate, when the motion
for second reading of this Bill was before
us I stated that in Committee of the Whole
I would suggest that the measure should go
into force. not on the day of its sanction, but
by proclamation, after a reference had been
made to the Supreme Court and that body
had ruled upon the constitutionality of this
legisiation. The measure was referred, flot
to the C'ommittee of the Whole, but to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce. There I moved my amcndment, but
it was not entertained. I desire to renew it
at this stage, and I therefore move, seconded
by the right honourable senator fromn Eganville ('Right Hon. Mr. Graham), that the Bill
be further amended by striking out the words
"whcn assented to' in section 48 and substituting therefor the words: "by proclamation

This is the amendment whicb I moved in

committee.
Now, I desire in, a few words to repeat
my reasons for suggesting the amendment.
My right honourable friend bas admitted that
this Bill was not based upon an international
convention. It is based gene.rally upon the
fact that by the Treaty of Versailles we
have declared that we would favour social
legislation. According to my right honourable
friend, this declaration creates an obligation
towards other countries, but I draw the
attention of the Senate to the fact that
Great Britain herself bas not yet Iegislated
along these lines; neither have other countries,
parties to the treaty. But, whatever may
have been done by other countries, I say it
is not olear that the courts of this country
would hoid that this measure is constitutional.
However, I realize that it is a moot question.
I have already given my views on thbis point.
We are about to adopt legisiation wbich
will1 create an organization aIl over the country
of some 4,000 empioyees at a cost of some
$7,000,000. We ail recognize that the financial
situation is critical and that the load the
Dominion is carryîng to-day is a very heavy
one. It seems to nie, therefore, that ordinary
prudence should impel1 us to suhmît this Bill
to the Supreme Court of Canada for a
decision on its constitutionality.
There is plenty of time to do so, for part
of this Bill as now drafted is ouuly to corne
into force by proclamation. A considerable
organization will bave to, be prepared on
paper before we Iaunch this new venture. I
reahize the importance of unemployment insurance, but I am not quite sure as to the
real reason for the present Bill. The Right
Hon. the Prime Minister, in bis first statement last January, decired that he recognized
such, legishation would corne before Parliament more -appropriately in prosperous ti:mes.
I think many pecsons in Canada 'believe that
the prosperous times whioh be foresaw, but
indicated in a somewhat d-iffident way, have
not yet reached this country. The lapse of
a year or so before the measure went into
force would not prejudice anyone in the least.
because those who would tbenefit under
unemnployment insurance are t-hose who have
retained their emjployment during the last
four years, and they are not in very great
danger in the years to corne if, as we hope,
we have reached the bottom of tbe cri.sis and
are on the road to greater prosperity. In
other words, we are legisiating now for a
contingency wbich I hope wÎll be very distant.

It may be ten years or more-I pray it may
he longer-before we again bave to face

SENATE

such

a depression as that from which we may
now be emerging.
There is no urgency in the matter. I am
quite sure that those who are privileged to
come back to this Chamber next session will
find that not much headway bas been made
in the application of this measure. In the
meantime, I bel'ieve, we owe it to ourselves
not to take this step without at least consulting the Supreme Court of Canada. We
have done so more than once during the last
three years with reference to legislation far
less important than the present Bill. We
should think twice before launching 'this
matter when we see what bas happened to
important measures that have been in operation for two or three years in the United
States: the Supreme Court of the United
States bas declared them to be un'constitutional. I repea-t, we should think twice before
launching a scheme that will cost millions
of dollars and employ thousands of men.
Naturally they would claim compensation if
the legislation were upset by the Supreme
Court. For these reasons I suggest that the
amendment be adopted.

GEORGE
LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Honourable members, I quite agree with the
expressions that have fallen from the bonourable leader on the other side. I think no
great loss can happen if this measure be not
brought into force until proclaimed by the
Governor General. Many persons have doubts
about its constitutionality.
If the measure
d'id not involve an enormous expendAture
before it could be put into force beneficially,
I should think no harm would be donc in
letting it go into effect at once. But it seems
to me that if such a fate befalls it as bas
befallen certain legislation in the neighbouring republic in the last two days, Parliament
culd be justly reproached for having taken
a step in the dark at a time when, as we all
know, we must economize.
Hon. JAMES J. ýDONNELLY:
Honourable members, as I understand the procedure,
we arc at the present time considering amendflents made to Bill 8 by the Committee on
Banking and Commerce. It seems to me that
the amendment moved by the honourable
leader of the Opposition is an amendment,
not to the committee amendments, but
rather to a particular section of the Bill.
This being se, I think the proper time to
diseuss it would be on the third reading.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No; I simply
move to add this amendment to those already
proposed by the Committee on Bankin-g and
Ctommerce.
Hon. Mlr. DANDURAND.

Right Hon. ARTtUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, the motion of the honourable member who leads the other side is to
add an amendment, the effect of which is to
defer the coming into force of this measure
until a decision as to its constitutionality is
reached by the Supreme Court of Canada.
I believe that is the body.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

By reference.

Right Hon. Mr. -GRAHAM:
able decision.

A favour-

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: A favourable
decision. that the measure is constitutional.
This is not a. usual motion. I am net aware
of reasons which would make it specially
applicable to the present measure and not
applicable to almost every important measure
coming before this House. I know that the
constitutionality of the Bill bas been challenged. I have not read, though, opinions
going further than those of members of this
House and the other House in attacking that
feature of the measure. In saying this I do
not deprecate at all the standing at the Bar
of members of either House, but it is somewhat worth while to reflect that the opinions
of men of legal standing and reputation have
not been introduced into the discussion in
either Chamber in support of those who
attacked the Bill. On the other hand, the
opinions of jurists of great capacity and of
international standing have been introduced
on the other side. So, having regard to the
weight of opinion outside the walls of this
House and of the other, and not to balance
the two schools of thought in each Chamber,
we find that the weight is entirely in favour
of the Bill.
But we have a department whose function
it is to guide Parliament in matters of the
Constitution. If on such a question as this
we were simply to wait and say, " Well, we
will get the opinion of the Supreme Court,"
how turbid would be the stream of legislation! How could we adequately rise to the
measure of our responsibilities in respect of
all problems of this kind? We could not
move at all. We should be blocked at every
step, and the more important the measure
the more effective and probably the more
disastrous would be the impediment. Why
should we in the ordnary run of legislation,
important or unimportant, be guided by the
Department of Justice, but in this case say,
"No, we will wait util the courts have
decided on the constitutionality of our Bill
before we dare give it effect?"
The view of the Department of Justice on
this measure is quite unequivocal and clear,
and bas been accepted by the other House.

all wrong. It will be impossible to undo all
the harm caused by his action. We are supposed to revise legislation. We are the ones
who are supposed to put on the brakes and
prevent hasty legislation. If there ever was
a piece of hasty legislation, this is it. Before
employing 4,000 men, particularly in view of
the fact that lawyers of repute have expressed
some doubt about the matter, would it not
be right for this House to exercise its powers?
I know a general election is coming, but I
may tell the Government that for every man
they satisfy by giving him an appointment
they will make ten men dissatisfied. A great
Prime Minister of England once said that
he would agree to remain in power for ever
if the Opposition would only administer the
patronage. I think the Government would
do well to consider that remark, because there
will be many applying for jobs. I think I am
speaking in the interest of the Conservative
party when I tell them they would be wise
to hesitate.
The right honourable gentleman says this
is an ordinary measure. It is no ordinary
measure. I have been a member of this
House for thirty-five years, and this is the
first time I ever saw a Bill authorizing the
Government to employ 4,000 men right off.

it is not passed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My right honourable friend has made a reference to the
public that might stampede this Chanber.
I think it is our duty, the very essence of our
existence, to avoid being stampeded by
people outside, more especially at a time
when we are legislating for reasons which my
right honourable friend knows very well, as
does eve'ry other member of this Chamber.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I call the
attention of the right honourable leader of
the House (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) and
also of the Chairman of the Banking and
Commerce Committee (Hon. Mr. Black) to
what I think is a very unfortunate typographical error?
The 2Sth amendment. as
printed on page 195 of the Senate Minutes.
contains the word "or" where it should he
"are." I think it will be agreed that it is a
very unfortunate mistake. The amendiment
is to insert an additional paragraph in section 25 of the Bill. as paragraph (e), and I
think this paragraph should read:
(e) persons who by custom of their occupation. trade or industry or pursuant te their
agreement with an employer are paid. in
whole or in part. by the piece or on a basis
other than that of time.
As the paragraph appears in the Minutes the
Word "or" appears before the word "paid."
and this does not make sense. I think it was
"are" in the paragra.ph as agreed upon by the
committee.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think my
honourable friend is right. I have traced the
paragraph referred to and find it is a new
clause added to section 25, subsection 1.
There is a verb in the preceding paragraphs,
and necessarily there must be one here.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The Clerk of
the House bas just shown me the original.
and it contains no mistake. The word "are"

out the error in the Minutes, though.
Hon. W. E. FOSTER: Honourable members, even at the risk of being criticized as
one of those who do not wish this Bill to

301

MAY 28, 1935
pass, I desire, before the main motion is put
to the House, to make a few observations
in connection with what I consider was a
very important amendment made by the
Banking and Commerce Committee. I should
like to mnake some representations on behaif
of a great many people who under the amendment will have to pay a large sum,' which I
look upon as a tax, to support what 1 think
should be an insurance scheme and not a
taxation scheme. In view of the fact that
there are numerous applicants waiting to be
heard before the Banking and Commerce
Committee on another measure, 1 suggest to
the right honourable leader of the House that
we adi ourn the debate on the present motion
until to-morrow.
This Bill 8, honourable me-mbers, is a very
important piece of legislation, which will
involve an expenditure of some 550,000,000
a year. I think it is one of the most important measures that have come before the
Senate since I have been a member of this
body. It will affect a great number of people
from the Atlantic to the Pacifie. The fact
that there are before us 51 amendînents
demonstrates at ahl events that the Banking
and Commerce Committee did its work thorough*ly. At the samne time, the very fact
that so many amendmnents were Mequired

to the courts, which necessarily would have
to be final and would involve a delay destroying the usefulness of the Bill for its immediste object, whicha is so important, are in

under the guise of an attractive amendmnent.
But the desire to debate an amendaient is
a legitimate one, and I readily agree that the

for us to do likewise.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: The riglit honourable
leader of the House is quite correct in his
assumption as to the amcndment which I
desire to discuss. And my reason for wishing
to discuss it is that I may show the groundis
upon which 'I hold that the banks and other

EMPLOYMENT AND SOCIIAL
INSURANCE BILL
REPORT

OF

COMMITTEE

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of the motion for concurrence in
the amendments made by the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce to Bill 8,
an Act to establish an Employment and
Social Insurance Commission, to provide for
a National Employment Service, for Insurar.ce against Unemployment, for aid to Unemployed Persons, and for other forms of
Social Insurance and Security, and for purposes related thereto.
Hon. W. E. FOSTER: Honourable members,
althougb the Committee on Banking and
Commerce had made fifty-one amendments to
the Employment and Social Insurance Bill, the
right honourable leader of the House (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) during the course of his
remarks yesterday stated that in his opinion
only one of those amendments would affect
the Biil to any considerable extent. It is to
that amendment I desire to address myself.
The amendment to which I refer is No. 47,
which refers to page 31 of the Bill and
deletes paragraph (f) from Part II of the
First Schedule, with respect to excepted employments. If concurred in by this House,
it would have the effect of placing banks and
other financial institutions under the provisions of the Bill.
My reason for opposing adoption of the
amendment is that I cannot see why at this
time we should make such an important
change, a change which would affect some
twenty thousand voung men and women bank
employees receiving less than $2,000 a year,
and probably some five thousand others engaged in mortgage, loan, trust, insurance or
other financial institutions. They would have
to contribute to the insurqnce fund upwards
of $250,000 per annum, and there would be a
Right Hon. 'Mr. MEIGHEN.

like contribution from the banks and other
financial institutions, making a total annual
contribution exceeding $500,000.
The financial structure of this Bill. as all
honourable members are aware, bas been
worked out by an actuary. I hold in my
hand his report. It is not necessary for nie
to read the report in full, for the title tells
the story about as well as I could tell it. On
the first page I find this heading:
Actuarial
report on
the
contributions
required to provide the unemploy ment insurance benefits within the scheme of Bill No. 8,
being the draft of an Act entitled "The
Employment and Social Insurance Act."
This report is addressed to the Rigbt Hon.
the Prime Minister, presumably because of
the fact that the Bill appears in his name
and in order that he may be satisfied as to
its actuarial basis. The report starts inh
way:
In compliance with instructions in that
behalf, I have the honour to report on the
rates of contribution for the unemployment
insurance benefits within the scheme of the
draft of an Act entitled "The Employment
and Social Insurance Act."
And on page 7 there is this statement:
For the present, however, it is essentia: t:hat
the rates of contribution should, in the first
instance, be determined with all possible care
and consideration; and the core of this
problem is the actuarial computation of rates
of contribution based on the best statistical
data available and an actuarial appraisal of all
the facts and circumstances pertinent thereto
with a view to making allowance
the contributions.

therefor in

And a little further on:
In determining the rates given below the
objective kept in view was to make then
sufficient to provide unemployment benefits
over a period such as the eleven years ended
June 1, 1931.
Honourable senators will observe that
the actuary apparently lias made a calculatien of the amounts that will be required
from certain industries and certain classes oi
people in order to provide sufficient mony
at a fixed rate to pay the benefits enumerated .
The enumeration of benefits will be found on
page 35 of the Bill.

It is my contention, honourable members,
that although, under the amendment made
by the committee, the large sum that I have
mentioned, some $500,000 per annum, would
necessarily have to be paid in by these classes
of people, the unemployment benefits would
remain as fixed by the sohedule of the Bill;
therefore, if we brought in the banks and
other financial institutions and foreed them
to contribute, no greater benefits would accrue
than the amounts fixed in the Bill now before
us, unless the Act were changed at a later
date. I take my present position net simply
because the banks and financial institutions
are involved, but because I can sec no reason
for their inclusion at this time, particularly
in view of the fact that it changes the whole
basis upon which the rates of benefit are
founded by the actuaries.
The honourable member for Westmorliand
(Hon. Mr. Black), the Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Commerce, in presenting these amendments to the House a
few days age, made this statement:
Very strong arguments were presented' to
show that certain industries and parts of
others should be exempted, and I think the
majority of the committee were convinced that
if w-e did recmmend the exemption cf tanks,

senators, that I bold no brief for those
institutions. Thcy are pretty well able te

employe,
m
an wmen,
in these institutions ant who, because they
reccive lcss than $2,000 per annur, would
come under the provisions of this Biii. As
I said before, this elass of empioyees wouîd
be calld upon to pay a sum in exceas of
8250,000 a year. We shoult bear la mmd
that it la not the high-salaried officiais wbo
would pay this assessment, but some twcaty
thousaad of the lowcr paid empioyees of the
banks and perhaps five thousanti of the
lower paït empioyees of the other financial
institutions involved.
My sympathies are
with those iow-salaried people, who would
be caliet upen te meet, in addition to present
salary dedtctions for pensiea funtis, group
insurance. and the like. a deduetion cf core
$13 per year cadi, or, in the aggregate,

by the time these prop.osed deductions were
made they would not have very much left
to live on. Therefore I say that these lowsalaried people who woudd be asked to pay
this assessment are as mujch entitled to
consideration as are those so often referred to
by my honourable friend here (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) when he appeals on behalf of
the under dog. I do not think honourable
members of this House should pass this
recommendation of the Banking and Commerce Committee without giving very careful
thought to the effect that it would have upon
these employees.
The fact that there is a very low percentage of unem.ployment in financial institutions is, I think, a strong argument in
favour of their remaining in the exempted
classes. I should ýlike to point out that the
banks, in their presentation, said that for
the year 1934 the number of employees of
all banks who were receiving nat more than
$2,000 was 19,436, of which number the total
unemployed during that year was 407, or but
two per cent. I think honourable senators
will sec the point I am trying to make.
When only two per cent of these low-salaried
employees would receive benefits from this
unemployment insuýrance fund, it is most
unfair to ask them ta pay some $250,000 per
annum.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That was for
1934. Could the honourable member give us
the number let out from the banks in 1930,
1931 and 1932?
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: The right honourable
leader of the Government cannot deny the
statement which I am making, that the risk
involved in that class of employment is far
below the risk in many of the other classes
included in the Bill. I have no reason, honourable senators, to doubt the statement of
the bankers who came before us. In my
opinion they would nat be any more likely
to make a false statement to us than to expect us to make a false statement to them.
They say:
About one-quarter of the total number of
these' eiployees consisted of women, and on
the basis of the contributions required under
the Act, the banks would have been required
to pay $242,108,
and the employees an
equivaient amount, making a total payment
fromi these sources of $484,216.
The total
benefits which these 407 employees would have
received under the Act on the assumption that
their contributions had been paid for a period
of one year would have been $29,886, or 6-1
per cent of the contribution.
So, although there would be a tax of about
8250,000 on these low-salaried people, according to the statement of the bankers only six
Hon. Mr. FOSTER.

per cent would be returned in the way of
benefits.
I contend, therefore, honourable
members, that this assessment, as it is called,
is nothing more than a tax, and I do not
believe it is a good thing that there should
be an unfair system of contribution under an
Act of this kind. If we are going to adopt
the principle of taxation, we should adopt the
good old system of taxing those who are best
able to pay.
The contribution of some $250,000 per
annum which the banks are asked to pay is
no small amount in these days of financial
strain. All honourable members of this House
know as well as I do that we are passing
through quite strenuous times, and I think
no one can predict what is ahead of the
financial institutions of this country. Because
of the need of money to pay for unemployment relief and similar things, the municipalities and provincial governments have
been increasing the taxes on banks, insurance
companies and financial concerns to a very
considerable extent during the last four years.
And we must nat forget that we have established in Canada a Central Bank. Who knows
what effect this Central Bank will have upon
the profits of the other banks? In my opinion,
the position of the banks as to the earning
of profits is rather precarious.
As every
member of the Senate knows, commercial
loans are not in demand to-day and the
securities which the banks have to purchase
in order ta employ their money yield but a
small return. Therefore I think we should
consider carefully this amendment, which
would impose an additional taxation on the
banks as well as on their employees.
ýI submit to honourable senators that there
is all the more reason why we should be careful about this when the actuary does not say
that it is necessary to include the banks. The
actuary says that the Bill should apply to
certain classes of people and industries in
order to produce an estimated sum of
money. We see the picture presented by
him of the estimated income from assessmennts on one side of the ledger, and on
turning over to the other side we sec the
amount which the actuary fixes as probable
payments to the beneficiaries. And the Bill
is founded upon the actuary's report. So I
submit it is not necessaïry at this time to
adopt this amendment made by the committee and bring under the Act -the banks and
financial institutions, when the actuary had
calculated on the financial operation of the
scheme without contributions from these
classes.
The effect of this measure will not be felt
for some little time. No doubt the Act will

MAY 29, 1935
be put into force promptly, the Commission will be set up and assessments made,
but no benefits will be paid out of the fund
for some two years at all events. It will
probably be three or four years before we
are able to find out rwhether the actuary's
calculations were right-whether there is
sufficient income from the classes which he
said it was necessary to include under the
Bill in order to meet the paymeant of benefits. So I thinik it will be time enough two
or three years hence to consider whether or
not the banks and financial institutions should
be brought within the scope of the Act. If
for two or three years, while we are waiting to sec the results of the practical application of the law, we can postpone the
imposition of this tax on twenty or twentyfive thousand people who are in receipt of
smalil salaries, and upon their employers as
well, we shall be doing something. As time
goes on and, payments come in, the Commissioners, with actual experience behind them,
will be in a position to consider whether or
not it is necessary to bring these financial
concerns into the scheme in order to make
the fund strong enough to withstand payment
of the benefits provided for. Section 7 of
the Bill provides:
7. (1) In addition to the powers and duties
of the Commission as otherwise provided by
this Act, the Commission shall, as soon as
practicable after appointment, undertake investigations for the purpose of making proposals to the Governor in Council for(a) providing unemployment insurance for
the employments excepted from the operation
of Part III of this Act, or for any of them,
either by extending thereto ihe provisions of
that Part, with such modifications, if any, as
may be found necessary, or by special or

supplementary schemes.

So this Commission will have all the powers
necessary to bring under the provisions of
the Act any classes of individuals or corpora-

tions which they deem necessary in order
that sufficient money may be provided for
the payment of benefits. I repeat, honourable members, that if for at least two or
three years it is possible to save from this
additional taxation the banks and other financial institutions, as well as twenty or twentyfive thousand employees who receive small
salaries, the Senate should not approve of
this amendment made by the Banking and

Commerce Committee. I for one am in
favour of anything that we can do to avoid
any further taxation, whether of banks or
other concerns or of individuals.
I am in favour of the principle of an
unemployment insurance bill, but I believe
that in order to make a scheme of this kind
effective in this country an intensive study

305

should be made of any suggestions or plan
for improving the scheme or extending its
scope. I urge honourable members to give
careful thought to this recommendation of
the committee before we make up our minds
whether we want to include within -the provisions of the Bill this army of twenty-five
thousand low-salaried employees and ask
them to make a contribution. As I have
already said, I am in favour of an unemployment insurance scheme. But this Bill
does not provide for what I call an unemployment insurance scherne; rather it provides for something which is more or less a
taxation scheme. As we all know, it is a
principle of insurance that the premium paid
or the contribution made should be on the
basis of 'the risk involved. That principle, I
think, should obtain in this Bill, but such is
not the case. I am in favour not only of the
principle of unemployment insurance, but of

the extension of that principle.

But I want

a bilil which would put into effect a echeme
more equitable than this one would be, particularly at the present time. And the point
I am endeavouring to make is that in the
future we could make any changes that
experience might show to be necessary.
I therefore move that the committee's
amendment number 47, which is to leave
out paragraph (f) in the First Schedule, Part
I of the Bill, page 31, be not now concurred in.
Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH: Honourable
senators, since it was I who in the Conmittee on Banking and Commerce moved to
strike out paragraph (f) on page 31 of the Bill,
which exempted banks and other financial

institutions, I feel called upon now to offer
a few observations as to why ¶ think the
committee's report as submitted should be

adopted.
In approaching the question of unemployment insurance we have to bear in mind that
we in Canada have had no experience whatever in this field. In England, on the other
hand, they have an unemployment insurance
scheme in operation and have been struggling
with the matter for nearly a quarter of a
century. The last bill on the subject passed
the English Parliament in 1920. Therefore it
was only fitting that those who were proceeding to draft an unemployment insurance bill
for Canada Éhould avail themselves of the results obtained from the experience in England.
Since 1920 the operation of unemployment
insurance in that country has been investigated by at least three royal commissions.
By the ternis of the Act of 1020 certain institutions were permitted to contract them-

92584-20

SENATE

selves out from the operation of the general
unemployment insurance scheme. That is to
say, under the direction of the Commission,
they could carry on a plan of insurance for
their own employees, with, it may be assumed,
a preferential rate based upon the relatively
smaller incidence of unemployment. Since
that law was passed the royal commissions
to which I have referred have all agrecd that
the law of England should never have permitted any particular corporations or individuals to contract themselves out, and that
unemployment insurance should be conducted
upon a flat-rate basis and should include all
the industries to which it was intcnded to
apply. The royal commissions have gone on
to say that now it is too late to make a
change, and they assume that the scheme will
be continued along the same lines as in the
past. I draw the attention of honourable
members to the regret which the royal commissions expressed that those interested were
ever permitted to contract out. and that nothing could be done about it now. This is
very important to remember, because we are
to-day about to launeh our unemployment
insurance law. and if we make the mistake
wbich was made in England, we shall probably find that we bave committed ourselves
to a policy which ultimately will be disastrous
to the whole scheme.
The present Bill is based upon the English
experience and upon actuarial calculations
based in turn upon that experience, with
respect to the classes of persons to come
within its scope. Therefore when we came to
consider the Bill in the Committee on Banking and Commerce we felt at the outset that
we dare not except any classes which had
been included. Had we donc so we sbeuld
have seriuisly impaired its financial structure.
On the other hand, we found among the
excepted employment that covered by paragraph (f) in Part Il of the First Scheduleemployment in banking, mortgage, loan, trust,
insurance or other financial business. I draw
the attention of the House to the fact that
my honourable friend from Saint John is
merely discussing banking business, but within
the exception there are also these other
financial businesses. They are excluded from
the operation of the Bill; but ineluded within
its operation are clerical employees of the
railways, the Bell Telephone Company, the
Imperial Oil Company, and other large concerns, whose incidence of unemployment is no
higher than that of the institutions covered
by paragraph (f). If those exempted classes
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

were properly exempt, then common sense
and justice would demand that the clerical
staffs of the railways and the other great
institutions should be excluded as well. As I
have said, we dare not exclude from the Bill
any of the classes that were included, Had
we attempted to do so the rates chargeable
against those remaining within its operation
would be so prohibitive as to destroy the
scheme entirely.
I draw the attention of honourable members to the incidence of unemployment in
tanks. As I have already pointed out, the
exceptions covered by paragraph (f) include
also mortgage, loan, trust, insurance or other
financial business. Surely there is no honourable member who is net aware that in consequence of the financial crash in 1929 there
are to-day large numbers of unemiployed persons from many of our financial institutions.
When the Bank of Canada Bill waS before
the Banking Committee in another place one
of the arguments put forward again-st the
measure was that owing te the taking away of
their privilege of issuing notes, th banks
would be struck such a hard blow as would
to some extent compel therm te reduce their
operations and close their branches in many
of the smaller towns and outlying settlements.
That withdrawal has actually been going on,
and to-day there are in every community unemployed young bank clerks. I venture te
say that the incidence of unemployiment in
banks is as high as, if not higher than, in the
institutions whiich are included within the
scope of the Bill.
My honourable friend fromi Saint John is
exercised over the faet that the unemployment
insurance levies fall upon young men in our
chartered banks in receipt of low salaries. I
am going te read from the submission made
by Mr. Jackson Dodds, President of the
Canadian Bankers' Association, wten te
appeared before our committee. This is what
te said about the class of people who are
being let out by the banks:
It is most untikely that any person who lias
been employed by one bank and found to be
unsatisfactory would ever be employed by
another bank. There is therefore no pool of
temporarily

unemployed' bank clerks w-ho may

tope eventually to be re-employed by the bank
with whichl they tad served or by some other
bank.

The

employees

whose

services

are

terminated are usually young men or women
who have been taken on in the hope that they

could qualify as useful members of the staff.
When it appears that this hope is not weil
founded they are told to find employment

elsewhere and are given generous allowances
to enable them te support themselves until
they find other work.

MAY 29, 1935
Speaking of -those who are discharged, hie said:
They are usually youug men who can
nornially find clerical or other employment in
0other industries.
IL will be seen thýat Mr. Jackson Dodds
.specifies the classes of persons in the empley
of banks who are most likely to be discharged. I venture te submit that if it were
possible to-day te take a poll of young bank
clerks they would be f ound to be entirely
favourable te the sch-eme of unernployment
insurance and would welcome the security
whîch it weuld give them.
There is another point the Huse must
seriously consider. The banks have put f orward a proposed amendmeint te the affect that
they sbould be allowed te centra-ct eut. I
have aiready drawn attention te the fact that
there are included in the Bill, and net. in any
sense remevable frem its ternis, the cerical
staffs ef ether great institutiens. If we pass
the amendinent prepesed by the henou-rable
gentleman frem Saint John and permit banks
te be exempted from the operatien of the
Bill-and, I take it, the other financial institutiens refarred to fin .paragraph (f), al'thougb the
heneurable member did net mention themthen frem time te time we shall have applications froma institutions now included for the
right te contract. eut; and tlhey will have just
as seund arguments to advance in support ef
their stand as have the banks.
So I say that. in view ef the strong reports
by royal commissions in England against the
prepriety ef allowing banks and similar institutions te contract eut, and the regret expressed, that, the principle having been
allowed, it is now practically impossible te
bzing those institutions within the scope of
unemploymant insurance, the proposal now
made by thse henourable gentleman from
Saint John is full ef danger. This is a serious
moment for the Bihl and for the whole priticiple cd unampleyment insurance. If we stand
fast on this report we shaJI launch. the Bill
with averybody in it who ought te be In it,
and with a provision for the Advisory Board
te investigate the tamnis and conditions upon
which classes ef indus'try now lefttout maiy
be brought in. But if to-day we adopt the
proposai of the hionourable gentleman from
Saint John we shall establish a pre:cedent
which Nvdll be of the utmeost value te. others
who may saek te centract, themselves eut frem
the eperatien ef ,the Bill. Indeed we may be
laying the foundation for an attack upon it
wliich will ultimately destroy the wh.ole scheme

Hon. JAMES MURDGCK: Honourable
senators, we are, 1 think, under obligation te,
my honourable friend from Saint John (Hon.
Mr. Foster) for bringing this matter te our
attention te-d-ay. He is a member of the
Committee on Banking and Commerce. I
amn net, but I have tried te attend on every
occasion wben the Bill was being discussed.
Wbile listening te my honourable friend I
could net but regret that he had not been
present te bring bef are the cemmittee the
eloquent representatiens which hie bas made
this afternoon on behaîf ef tbe banks and
otlier financial institutions.
1 doubt whether my honourable triend
knews tbat tbis particular question came te
a, vote-I thi-nk, twice-in tbe committee.
On the latter occasion a motion was made
te reinstate paragraph (f).
Mr. JTackson
Dodds, President ef the Canadian Bankers'
Association, was present and told the committee just what it should do and wbat it

sheuld not do. In fact he argued almost
identically as lias my bonourable friend this
afternoon. The bonourable gentleman wbo
then made the motion was the only one who
voted for it. Se, virtually, the committee was
unanimously opposed to it.

But Jet us go a little furtber witlî the
argument of the heneurable senator from
Saint John. He says in aff ect, 'SI am in
faveur ef an unempleyment insurance seheme;
but do net include tbe banks and ethcr
financial institutions." Wby net include the
banks?

Hon. Mr. FýOSTIE.R: Do net include the
hanks now.
Hon. Mr. MURD)OCK: Do net include the,
banks new-why? Bacause, according te the
statement of Mr. Jackson Dodds, there are
19.t36 bank employees wbo are working practically the year reund and are drawing the
salaries incident te their work. The banking
institutions say: "Tbey do not need unemployment insurance. We will take care of
them." Would my bonourable triend from
Saint John be prepared to carry that principle further: would he exelude the Esaton
Company and its 23,000 employees? The
company bas said that it needed ne assistance
from. an unemployment insurance scheme;
that it could take care of those empleyecs.
And we bad similar representations from

tien. They al argued that they should not
be within the scope of the Bill. So I ask
my honourable friend, where should we get
the wherewithal to take care of those who
surely need insurance against unemployment?
Who would pay if those who have will not
give for those who have not?
Hon. Mr. POSTER: The actuary has told
us who would pay.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Oh, yes, the actuary
prepared the scheme that was originally
intended to exclude the banks, insurance
companies and other financial institutions.
But the Committee on Banking and Commerce found a golden egg in paragraph (f).
The committee decided to expunge the paragraph and so bring within the operation of
the Bill a considerable number of citizens of
Canada who should be interested in the welfare of their less fortunate fellow men and
wonen who do not hold jobs the year round
and are not drawing heax v salaries. The
19.436 bank employees enjoying continuous
salaries will contribute to the unemployment
insurance fund $13 a month for each man
and less than that for each woman.

is a tax. Of course it requires that those

Where in the name of good, kind Heaven
would you get any of the wherewithal to
carry on an unemployment insurance scheme
if you did net get it from those more favoured

persons?
my honourable friend's argument simply
means that the banks, the insurance companies and other financial institutions, Eaton's,
Simpson's, the retail merchants and the
lumbermen would take care of their employees, but the poor sucker with nothing
in sight would have to lift himself by his
boot-straps.
A few months ago, sitting in the quiet of
our homes, we heard some very eloquent
representations about the failure of the
capitalist system. If ever I saw a demonstration of the selfish greediness of the capitalist
system, I saw it in the Banking and Commerce Committee the other day when Mr.
Jackson Dodds acted as though he were the
last word on everything and the members of
the committee were ignorant, and I distinctly
heard him say-I took it he meant if the
commitee did not accept his view-that it
Hon. MUr. MURDOCK.

Right Hon. Mr. MEFIGHEN: T think my
honourable friend is doing Mr. Jackson Dodds
an unintenided injustice. He did not say he
had never been turned down before. He said
he never stopped because he had been turned
down once.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: My distinct recollection-and my hearing is very goodRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It will be on
the record.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: My distinct ,recicdllection is that he said, "This is the first time
I have been turned clown." To me it sounded
ridiculous coming from a gentleman representing the capitalist system of Canada., the
system that now tells us: "We have 19,436
employees that we ourselves will take care of.
You go sweat for the rest of the citizens of
Canada." That is what the capitalist system
represented by Mr. Jackson Dodds-is
-as
prepared to nontribute to the health and
happiness of the unemployed workers of this
country. The citizens of Canada are entitled
to something better than that by way of
contribution from the capitadist system. My
honourable friend said a little while ago that
the rest could take care of themselves. Of
course they can. Then let the other citizens
take care of our unemployed. That, in substance, is what it means. That is the logical
conclusion.
'So I think the action of my honourable
friend from Saint John (Hon. Mr. Foster) in
bringing up this matter is of some value.
The matter was threshed out in the Banking
and Commerce Committee, and I was highly
gratified to find that the great majority oi
the members of that committee were heartily
in favour of taking from those who have,
in order to help those who have not; and
I did not hear any such argument as I have
listened to from my honourable friend to-day.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Why stop at the
smalil-salaried man who is receiving up to
$2,000?
That is another
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
question that came up in the Banking and
Commerce Committee. I am ready to agree
with my honourable friend on that, and to
second a motion to take from the high-salaried
man-yes, from the senator who draws $4,000
a year; but for shame's sake let us not go
so far as to say that 19.436 reputable citizens
of Canada who are drawing salaries that are

MAY 29, 1935
regarded by the capitalist system as sufficient
should not pay one cent towards helping their
less favoured fellow citizens.
I do not think there is the slightest danger
of the motion before us passing, but I think
it is a pity that the question brought up in the
Senate to-day shows the inherent selfishness
of human nature, and the disregard by the
capitalist system of the rights of the rest of
the public in Canada. It shows nothing more
and nothing less, and I am quite sure the
motion will be turned down, as it deserves to
be.
Honourable
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN:
senators, I should like to advance a few
points in connection with the amendment
proposed that I do not think have been considered up to the present time. The banks,
as 'I understand it, are claiming exemption
because of the very small amount of unemployment in the banking institutions of the
country. That unemployment relates largely
to cierical staffs-accountants, cashiers, bookkeepers and employees of that character.
Now, if that class of employee is to be
exempt from this legislation, I think it is
fair to argue that an industrial institution
that has one or two hundred employees of
the same character in its branches throughout 'the country, and that may be in exactly
the same position as the banks in relation to
unemployment, could justify an application
for exemption. I happen to be associated
with an institution that has probably three
hundred or four hundred employees spread
throughout the country, and I may say that
during the entire time of the depression there
was not one single case of unemployment in
that institution. Now, if the argument of
the banks is sound, that they should be free
from this legislation, I think these other
institutions are justified in asking to be
exempted.
My own view is that if the fund established
to provide for unemployment insurance is
to be substantial there should be as few exemptions as possible, and I am not in sympathy with the proposal that these financial
institutions should be exempt. I may go
further and say that by this time next year
there may be in this Dominion a province
that has brought into existence a Government which assures the people of that province that there shall be no unemployment at
all, and then you would have all the industries of that province sending representatives
down here to ask for exemption. I am afraid
that if we listen to these claims for exemption we may damage the legislation. I am
in favour of accepting it as it comes from
the Banking and Commerce Committee.

309

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, before the question is put
I would ask the House to bear with me while
I place on record the view that 1, as a member of the Government, take with respect te
this measure, which is one of considerable
importance.
I do not quite agree with the honourable
senator from Saint John (Hon. Mr. Foster)
that the amendment referred to is the only
important amendiment made by the committee. Doubtless it is of far-reaching consequence, but there are other amendments of
front-rank importance among the fifty-one inserted by the committee and now before us.
For example, the committee abolished the provision that anyone who had an income of a
certain fixed amount outside of his earnings
should not be ineluded within the terms of the
Bill. In doing this the cormittee recognized
the taxation feature of the measure. The
omission was a most important one, and I
think that amendment is valuable and sound.
The com.mittee also made the Bill adaptableto that great area of employment which works.
on a mileage basis rather than on an hourly
basis--an amendment net only necessary but
of consequence. In other respects the measure
now differs substantially from that first submitted te this House. In clause 25 there is
a very important addition te the exceptions.
It is net for the purpose of lightening any of
the obligations under the Bill, but rather for
the purpose of making the Bill workable. In
fact-and this would be of importance to the
honourable senator from Lethbridge (Hon.
Mr. Buchanan)-the only exceptions which
the committee recognized at all were those
which appeared to the committee to be valuable because they made the Bill a practical
working measure. In determining the exceptions the matter of administration was in the
minds of the committee.
One, of course, could go much further and

point to other changes, but possibly that is
not necessary at this time. Where payment
by stamps would net be convenient other
methods were provided; the Commission s
powers were extended; control was retained
over the purchase of real estate by the Commission, and so forth.
But what is immediately before the House
is the question whether or not the exception of banks, insurance companies, trust
companies, loan companies, mortgage cepanies andl other financial institutions-an
exception which had been recognized in the

English Aot-should be adopted in Canada
from the commencement of operation. That

310

SENATE

problem occupied many a day of the long
weeks during which the committee sat.
I approached the discussion of this subject
strongly inclined to the view that insurance
should be on a merit rating basis; that a flat
rate was inherently unjust. I was in hopes that
we might be able to improve the measure in
com'mittee by inserting the merit rating principle, which has worked so successfully in
workmen's compensation laws of our provinces.
Representations made to the committee, however, soon changed me from that view, and I
became convinced that no system of merit
rating could possibly work in unemployment
insurance, but that there must be a flat rate.
As time went on, the underlying idea, the
basic rock beneath the measure, appeared in
relief. This is a taxation bill for insurance
purposes. The honourable senator from Saint
John (Hon. Mr. Foster) likes the insurance
feature of the Bill, but does not like the
tax. We are ahi the same as far as that is
concerned. But we cannot have insurance
without the taxation feature. The only question is as to the circumference of the taxation-what territory should be taxed. Some
say the tax ought to be based on ability to
pay. That would' mean, of course, that the
Government would pay everything, including the insurance necessities, from general
revenue. It would mean an increase of taxation in various spheres. The Bill was founded
on another principle-just as were the English Act and, German Act-the principle of
taxing the area to be benefited for the purposes of those benefited. What is that area?
It is the area of the employed who are not
receiving enough money to be reasonably
expected to look after themselves if misfortune should overtake them and they should
find theinselves out of work. We are not
concerned at the present time with the area
of those who can reasonably be expected to
look after themselves. We deal with that
in general taxation. But if by reason of the
smallness of his salary a man cannot look after
himself, the State undertakes to help him over
bis troubles; and it taxes all wlho are in that
class, and their employers, and makes a contribution of its own to meet the situation.
The committee felt that the upper limit
of $2,000 was probably about right; that men
receiving more than that amount could be

expected to take care of themselves, but those
receiving less could not. So the general view
of the committee was that we should tax
all w-ho have a right to expect benefit, that
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

their

employers sbould

share

equally

with

them in that taxation, and that the State
should contribute one-fifth of the amount furnished by the other two, and should pay
administration costs. That is the entire Bill.
There were certain exceptions based upon
administrative necessity-temporary employment of a seasonal character, employment
on piece work, employment on farms, and
in places far distant in the country, where
administrative costs would be out of all
proportion to benefits that would be obtained.
These exceptions were recognized as sound
and just, and in certain cass were amplified.
But tliere was one exception which had no
such basis. It was recited in clause (f) on
page 31:
oan
Eiploymcent in banking, mortgage,
trust, insurance or other financial business.
The reason presented for excluding these
institutions from the Bill was that they had
not been included originally in the English
Act; that from the commencement, indeed
before the operation of that Act, they had

made an arrangement whereby they insured
their own employees. They presented that
arrangement to the committee, or to the
minister in charge, and it was agreed that

they should be exempt because they were
ready to look after their own unemployed.
But, as the bonourable senator behind me
(Hon. Mr. Griesbach) has said, and as must
be quite plain to the House, that exemption
did not prove satisfactory. It was net that
it did not prove satisfactory to employers
who were excepted and to their employees,
but it was out of harmony with the general
scheme of the law a.nd added to the difficulty
of administering it in relation te other persons
who claimed the right to contract out. The
commissions who reported on the working of
the English law, one and all, deplored
exceptions. While tley said it would not be
iwise te cancel exceptions already in existence,
they were strongly opposed to any more being
allowed.
The English example doubtless had for its
base mucli of the philosophy presented to the
House to-day by the honourable senator from
Saint John. In England, no doubt, as here.
banks and financial companies came and
said: "Our ratio of unemployment is very
siall. We lase been able to take care of it
generously. We have no ill or disease te
cure. We are all right oursebves, so why tax
us four or five times the amount of any
benefit we can obtain?" On tînt plea thcy
were excepted, and on that plea it was sought
to continue the exception here.

MAY 29, 1935
But our comniittee was immediately faced
with other comipanies w.ho were in just the
samne position. It was faced first with the big
department stores;, whose clerical staffs number thousands, and who -said: "We now have
a plan whereby we look after our unemp'loyed.
We do nlot want te pay to this fund five times
the amount"ý-I tbink that was the figure they
gave-"-ýthat it now takes to look after our
men, or five times what they wou'ld obtain
if they came in under this law." Next we
had before us the Bell Telephone Company,
whose clerical staff also runs into thousands.
Their scheme seemed to be just as generous
as that of any of the banks, and their. unemployment ratio ju.st as low, and they protested against certain other classes being excepted when they were included and as a
ýmatter of feet ail the reasons behind the
exception applied with equal force in their
case. Next came the Rai-lway Association,
representing bot-h railroads. They protested
against inclusion of the clerical staff in the
Windsor Station in Montreal, whose positions
were j ust as secured and permanent as those
of the staff of any bank, trust company or
financial institution.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER:
part of the whole.

Except that they were

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I shall corne
to that. That distinction, which seemed to
me a very arbitrary one, was advanced later.
They said: "We are cha.rged four, five, six or
seven timýes ail that we cati receive on our
ratio of unemployment, while across the
Square is the Sun Life Insurance Comipany,
which, though in no be'tter position than we
are, is -omitted." The representative of a
manufaoturing institution in a speciai line
came before us and showed us from their
books that for more than five years not a
single one of their employeca would have
received benefit had this Bill been in effect.
The representations were net limited to
,those. but I think I have gone far enough.
So we feu-nd ourse1ives confronted with this
question: if we continue this exception,1 what
is our answer te the railways, what is our
answer to departmnent stores, to the Bell
Telephone Company, to any company which
can corne forward and show that it is on
exactly the same footing as those alreacly
exce<pted? 1 could not give an answer, nor
could I suggest what to say to them.
Mr. Jackson Deodds was more rcsouroeful.
He said: "Yeu cati tel the Canadian Pacifie
that if they will look after their brakemen,
their firemen, their engineers, thcir conductors,
their working men gcnerahly throughout the
whole system, that is, look after not onlY

their clerical staff, but everyone they employ,
yeu will let them. out. We are looking after
ail ours. If they will look after ail theirs,
then they cao say their oilaim is on an equa.lity
with ours. And teli the Bell Telephone Comnpany the same-that if they will look after
al theirs you will let them out." But te
me that answer did net seem at ai1 adequate.
I do not say there is not something in it;
ccxýtainly on the surface there appyears to be.
But is net that a distinction with.out a
difference?
In the first place, suppose we pcrmittc-d
companies te contract out. I do net doubt
that it woul pay the Bell, Telephone Comr,
pany, for instance, te take care of ail its
empiloyees. -CertainIy e'vcry company with
an unemployment ratio beloîw the average
wouid find it profitable te oontract out. And
where weuld the scharnme be then? Only the
worse hall of the risk wetild be left. What
tax would then be nccessary? And what
about the actuarial calculations? Thcy would
be upset by the exceptions, andi the scheme
would crash.
In the aiex place, is there any real virtue
in saying this te the Caniadian Pacifie Raihway,
"We cannet exempt your
for example?
olerical. staff, though they have permanent
employment, becoause yeu have other cmployees, those, on your trains. It is truc that
your clerical staff are in the samne class as
those in the banks and financial comîpanies,
but your other employees are net. If you
decide te leok after them all, then you cati
corne agd, say that you are just as generous
as the batiks are and you would be entitled
te exemption." I do net sec why that should
be said te, thcm. What reason is contained
in that statement? Is it not mere.ly an
enticing forin of worde rather than an ex-.
pression ef a sound distinction? If the Canadian Pacifie Railway has an armny of several
thousand employees iwhose jobsa arc permanent
and secure, oertainly as secure as the jobs
in banks and trust and insurance compatiee,
why should you refuse te exempt thein simply
because the railway has other classes cf
empl-oyees? When you give snme pcnctrating
thought to what sappeared te be a reason,
it is founid to be not a) reason at ali.

SENATE

in this case? It is the sphere of those who
need the benefit. And you cannot except
those who need it least, and who therefore
can pay the most readily, simply because
their employment is more permanent. If you
commence leaving out some of those, you
must leave out all who can present the sane
claim for exemption. And as time went on
you wouild eliminate one dlass after anoth'r
until only the very poorest risks were left.
Such was the reasoning that appealed to us.

brokerage offices, security companies and
financial concerns of all kinds. Is there any
class of business in which employment is

Hon. Mr. FOSTER: I suggest only the same
exemptions that the actuary djid.

always felt myself bound by a precedent
which has worked and the wisdom of which
has been established, but I never felit myself
bound by an error, even if made by an actuary. What have we to show that there is
any special permanence of employment in
security companies and brokerage concerns
or partnerships? Why, they were reduced te
a skeleton in the darkest days of this depression, and they are little more than a skeleton
yet. Still my honourable friend says:
"Exempt these people. Let the poor fellows
who are thrown out of employment in such
businesses look after themselves, because,
forsooth, the actuary d'id not include them."
It is for us rather to try to make the
scheme impregnable, securely founded on
sound principles. I think that by its long
and painstaking work the Banking and Commerce Committee has donc a very grea.t service, the practical results of which are now
evidenced in the construction of the measure.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Foster was
negatived.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Black for concurrence in the amendments made by the Committee on Banking and 'Commerce was agreed
to.
THIRD

READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIHEN
third reading of the Bill.

noved the

-HonourHon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
able members of the Senate, the Banking and
Commerce
Committee
gave
considerable
study te this Bill, and we have listened to
an interesting debate this afternoon.
But
there is a feature which has not been stressed,
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

although it was mentioned by one of the
speakers. Contributors under this Bill will
pay a flat rate. |Employed persons earning
$600, $1,000, or $1,900 a year, as the case
may be, will alil alike be required to pay 25
cents a week. At least two-thirds of the contributors will, happily for them, never be
beneficiaries of the fund. I estimate that
in a time of great crisis perhaps 20 per cent,
or at the most 25 per cent, of the conýtributors
would become unemployed. I know of institutions--my right honourable friend has
mentioned some-in which there bas been
no unemployment during the four or five
years of this depression. I can point to sone
firms which employ hundreds of persons and
have not had a single instance of unemployment over the last fifty years, even through
the present critical period.
Employces in
these companies real'ize very well that under
this scheme they would contribute
not
towards their own benefit,, but that of other
persons who happen to be so unfortunate
as to be thrown out of employment.
I am thinking at the moment of in.titutions in which some employees begin their
service at, say, $600 a year and are gradually
moved uip at tihe rate of $100 a year as their
position improves. I know of hundreds
of these people who will feel the injustice
of being made to pay the contribution
called for under this Bill, since they have
no fear of losing their posts and would
not vountarily take out unemployment insurance. They will wonder why they should
be called upon to pay $13 a year, which is a
considerable sum for one earning less than
S2,000, while their fellow employees who have
risen to higher positions and are earning
more than $2,000 will be free from this element of taxation. For there will be people
by the thousands who will sec in this scheme
only an element of taxation, since they will
not be likely ever to draw any benefit from
it. And those with modest incomes, to whom
I am referring, are less able to pay the tax
than are persons earning more than $2,000.
So with a view to overcoming the objection which would be widely felt towards the
ineasure as itv now stands, I will move that
this Bill be not now read a third time, but
bc amended by striking out paragraph (n) of
the excepted employments in Part II, page
32. That paragraph reads:
(n) Employment otherwise than by wav of
manual labour and at a rate of remuneration
exceeding in value two thousand dollars a year
or in cases owhere such employnent involves

part time service only, at a rate of remuneration which, in the opinion of the Commission,
is equivalent to a rate of remuneration exceeding two thousand dollars a year for full time
service.

MAY 29, 1935
Provided that any person in respect of whom
contributions have been pa.id as an insured
contributor for not less than five hundred
weeks may continue as an insured' contributor
notwithstanding anything in this paragraph
contained.
The question may arise in the minds of
some honourable members why anyone earning more than $2,000 a year should be required to pay 25 cents a week to this unemployment insurance scheme.
It may seem
extraordinary and even nonsensical that the
head of a company, whose income is perhaps
$25,000 or $50,000, should have to contribute
$13 a year. Well, the Bill provides for payments on the flat-rate basis, and my object
is to put all employed adulte on the same
level, as contributors. There are thousands
of men earning but $12 a week, that is $600
a year, who will be obliged to pay 25 cents
a week. I repeat that to the man earning
above $2,000 the contribution would not be
a heavy one; in fact if he receives a big
salary the payment of 25 cents a week would
be a mere gesture; but those earning below
$2,000 would have the satisfaction of knowing
that their insurance was being paid for in
part by recipients of larger incomes.
I do net know whether I should speak of
anything that was said in eommittee. In
both Houses there is a tradition of long
standing, which I think comes from the
Mother of Parliaments, that we must not
refer to what took place in committee. However, I can repeat a statement that I myself
made there. I pointed out there that since
the early days of Creation it had always
been regarded as a penalty that man should
earn his bread by the sweat of his brow, but
now it is regarded as a privilege te work,
and we all should be happy to pay something
for that privilege. With a view to equalizing
contributions under this Bill, I now move
that paragraph (n) in the schedules of exce;pted employments, on page 32 of the Bill,
be stricken out. If this is done we shall all
subscribe our 25 cents a week.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I am net opposing
the amendment, but may I ask the honourable
gentleman a question? Who would collect
the 25 'cents weekly?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It would be
collected in the same way as the ether contributions.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Who would collect
it from the individual employer? And who
would collect it from me, for instance?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
I had a chance.

I would, if

313

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My honourable friend is employed somewhere, and he
would be required te contribute his share,
his $13 a year.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
But am I net
exempt because I am employed here?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I am trying
te keep within the four corners of the Bill.
I confess that my intention was te requirE
a contribution of everyone, and in committee
I moved an amendiment that every person
who made an income tax return showing
net receipts of more than $2,000 should add
te his tax payment the sum of $13 as a
contribution te the unemploymnent insurance
fund. But I was told by my right honourable friend opposite (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
that such an amendrment went beyond the
scope of the resolution which preceded the
introduction of the Bill in the House of
Commons. Se I was precluded from reaching
all those who have incomes of more than
$2,000. I should very much have liked te
reach them,, for everyone in that class should
be as deeply interested as those earning less
than $2,000 in coming te the rescue of the
unemployed. I shoulid have been very heppy
te reach everyone, but since I am precluded
from doing se under the terms of the resolutien which preceded the Bill in the other
House, I have moved te strike out the exemption of those earning more than $2,000
a year.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable meibers, I think if the honourable
senator who moved this amendment (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) had been in the place he
long occupied, and which I have the honour
now te fill, he woulid have been more circumspect and pondered the Bill before undertaking the responsibility of proposing the
change.
He has net told us where the amendment
would leave the Bill. He wants te strike out
the exception of employed persons, other
than manual labourers, getting over $2,000
a year. We will say a man is getting $15,000
a year as an employee and is contributing
25 cents a week te the unemployment insurance fund. I suppose the employer has te
collect it and deduct it from the employee's
salary. But is that employed person to be
insured under the Act? What is the intentien of my honourable friend? Is the $15,000
a year :man to be insured against unemployment? Are we going te take hirm under the
wing of the State and look after him in his
misfortune when he is out of work? If my

SENATE

314

honourable friend will tel me what is his
intention, I wii tell him what the law is.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The intention
is to put him on the same footing as those
who are earning less than $2,000 a year and
who, although coming within the area which
my right honourable friend has mentioned,
and contributing their quarter a week, are
not benefiting therefrom. The $15,000 a year
man will be on an equal foo.ting with them.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is, he
will be insured?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: He will be insured; but he will draw no benefit, like 75 per
cent of the people under the $2,000 figure.
Rigit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If he is to
be insured he will draw unem;ployment insurance when out of work. Many $15,000 and
even $20,000 men get out of work. There
have been a number of such cases during the
last few years. So the honourable member
seriously suggests that Parliament make provision for those fellows in receipt of a paltry
income of $20,000 or $25,000, for fear that
some day they may be out of work. And
he is going to insure them against unemployment because we want ýtheir 25 cents a week?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
of taxation.

The incidence

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: To even up
and make the Bill equitable? But the fellow
who does not work-who, born rich, is in
receipt of an income of $25,000-would not
pay a nickel. There is no equity in my
honourable friends proposal, for after ie bas
deformed the Bill by seriously proposing unemployment insurance for rich people, he
leaves out the class whose income is obtained
by tnem by way of interest from investment.
Those persons do not pay at all.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
fault.

That is not my

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is the fault
the amendýment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Nýo; it is the
fault of the resolution passed in the other
House.
It will be
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
seen that my honourable friend has lost
sight of the scope and purpose of the Bill.
It is not taxation at all except for insurance.
You can argue all possible methods of taxation, of course. You can say, "Why not tax
those with $100,000 incomes?" That should
come before us wnis we are dealing with
taxation pure and simple. Tien we could

af

Right Hon. Mr.

IEIGHEN.

discuss whether they w'ere paying enough
taxation, and whether if further taxation were
imposed they would get out of the country
and the tax go somewhere else. Here we
are dealing with taxation for insurance. If
you tax those who are not insured, then to
that extent it is not insurance at all. My
honourable friend seriously says that because
the only class he can get at are those whose
big incomes are from big salaries he is ready
to make them pay 25 cents a week and go
througlh all this paraphernalia, but he will
not tax at all the feliow who happens to have
an income from investmeats. The amendment
is anomalous and wholly foreign to the Bill.
I think it is simply a plan to enable the
honourable gentleman to say, "I want to tax
the big fellow." It is the kind of speech
made under certain auspices, but I think it is
one he reluctantly makes himself. I would
impress upon my honourable friend that I
oppose his amendment not because I do
not think the bigger salaries are able to pay
25 cents a week. Certainly they are. But
it is foolish to insure those who need no
insurance, who can reasonably be expected
to look after themselves without any help
at all from employer or State, and who cannot ask us to pay seven or eight million
dollars on an organization to look after them.
Are we actually going to put on our Statute
Book a law to insure them? The thing is
absurd. If we just tax them without insuring
them, we are outside the purview of the
Bill altogether and are dealing with something foreign to its purpose-with taxation
alone.
But my right
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable friend admits the $2,000 is but
an arbitrary mark.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It has to be
put somewhere. The Bill would not be foolish
if you put the mark at $2,500 or $1,500. The
committee felt $2.000 was about as near the
proper place as we could get it. We were
guided to some extent by the measure of the
salary in England to which the insurance taxation applies.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable senators,
I am not a member of the Banking and
Commerce Committee, and as a consequence
I have had no ýopportunity whatever to
follow all the discussion in connection with
thiS Bill. I followed the argument on the
previous motion, but I am not quite certain
what the position is with respect to this particular amendment, and I want to be put
right if I am wrong.
I understand the effect of the amendment
to be this. At present the Bill provides for

MAY 29, 1935
a tax on all who receive wages or salary up
to $2,000Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
out that maximum.

And I strike

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: All those
get the benefit.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I understand that if
this maximum is struck out a tax will be
imposed on all persons who receive a wage
or salary in excess of $2,000, but none of them
will corne under the benefit of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Oh, no; they

do.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: They do come under
it? There is, I presume, a maximum amount
of insurance to be paid, and those who
receive a salary above $2,000 would get only
that maximum.
Right 'Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

That is all.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I am quite clear on
tiat. Now the other point. My honourable friend said he knew of groups of employees who for long periods had suffered
no unemplýoyment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Yes.
'Hon. Mr. CALDER: It seems to me that
does not enter into the question at al. This
is a general scheme of insurance; all the
insured will have the benefits provided for by
the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAN(D: lif they have the
misfortune to be out of work.
lHon. Mr. 'CALDER: It seems to me
nobody can telli who is going to be unemployed to-morrow. It is quite -true a concern may have run along for twenty-five,
thirty, forty or fifty years without a break.
But what may happen five years from now?
That concern may become bankrupt and the
employees may be thrown out of work. The
very fact that you can pick out isolated cases
and point to them as examples showing where
there is no necessity for this Bill at all, and
where the employees should not be made to
pay at all, since they are going to get no benefit, is, as my right honourable friend has said,
beside the question. (What -the State is doing
ib to provide a blanket insurance for ail of
a certain class, and, no matter what the circumstances are, whenever anyone in that class
becomes unemployed he gets the benefit. The
mere fact that it does not operate here or
there is of no consequence at all. Therefore,
so far as that phase of the argument is concerned, I can see no necessity for the amendment. As regards the other phase, if those

fellows who have $20,000 salary are to pay a
quarter a week and get compensation of only
$30 a month, it is hardly worth their while.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Dandurand

LIMITATION OF HOURS OF WORK
BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. F. B. BLACK presented the report of
the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce on Bill 21, an Act to p'rovide for limiting the Hours of Work in Industrial Undertakings to eight in the day and forty-eight in
the week, in accordance with the Convention
concerning the application of the principle of
the Eight Hour Day or of the Forty-eight
Hour Week adopted by the General, Conference
of the International Labour Organization of
the League of Nations, in accordance with the
Labour Part of the Treaty of Versailles of
28th June, 1919.
He said: Honourable senators, the committee made a large number of amendments te
this Bill, but as a whole they are of a minor
character. We listened to delegations representing businesses in practically all parts of
Canada, and pleas for relief, if I may use
that word, were made on behalf of certain
industries. On the advice of its counsel the
committee felt, though, that we were unable
to provide in the Bill for any particular difficulties and that special, cases would have to
be taken care of by regulations made by the

HIS MAJESTY'S SILVER JUBILEE
THE KING'S REPLY TO THE JOINT ADDRESS
OF CONGRATULATION

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, the following message bas been received from His Most Gracious Majesty the
King, signed in his own hand:
Menbers of the Senate and of the
House of Conînons of Canada:
I thank you with a full leart for the loyal
and affectionate ternis of your Address, which
was presented to me by ny Prime Minister of
Canada at St. Janme's Palace on the historie
occasion on the 8th May, wheu the representatives of all omy Dominions overseas
gathered to greet the Queen and nsyself and
to offer us their united congratulations and
good wislies. So long as we live the Queen
and I will never forget that unique and
wonderful occasion and tie moving words
spokeen by M1r. Bennett and by those who
Right hon. MIr. MEIGHEN.

followed him. In my reply I endeavoured to
express the thoughts that filled my heartthoughts of thankfulness, of pride in all my
peoples and of my gladness that their representatives were gathered together to greet us
in our home in the spirit of the family.
Your Address recalls the eventful years
through which we have passed; the years of
war followed by years of economie difficulty
and distress. History will never forget how
my people of Canada stood side by side with
all my other peoples when danger assailed us.
At this time of thanksgiving, let us not forget
those maimed or widowed by war, or those
who are suffering from unemployment in these
anxious years of peace. It is only by mutual
help that depression can be fought, opportunities for work increased, and happiness and
prosperity restored.
Your Address speaks also of the changes in
political relation that my reign has witnessed.
Of my many causes for glad'ness there is none
greater than that while the hounds of freedomn
and self-government have been enlarged, so
t'ht Canada and the other oversea Dominions
have now attained the fullest nationhood, yet
they remain united by a common allegiance
to the Crown, and the ties of friendship and
J
brotherhood stand fast as never before.
rejoice that my Silver Jubilee has afforded
a signal examxple of that family feeling. Let
us keep that spirit and together fulfil that
great task that is laid on all the nations of
the British Empire, to hold higrh the ideals
of service, liberty and peace.
J am touched by the kind and affectionate
words in which you refer te the Queen, w ho
throughout my reign has shared my joys and
my sorrows, my labours and my leisure.
J
thank you also for your reference to visits by
menmbers of my family; through them J am
enabled to keep in close touch with the development and progress of mîy peoples overseas.
I thank you for your prayers, and I pray
that the blessing of Divine Providence may
rest on my people of Canada and give thein
happiness and peace.

sav a word on this subjeet. The proposed

receipts and expenses of the Canadian National Railways by provinces. I have before
me a letter written by the Chairman of the
Board of Trustees in which hie says it is quite
impossible to divide either the revenues or
the expenses on that basis. It will be readily
understood that revenues are net divided by
provinces. There is a great deal of intraprovincial traffic, but there is also a vast
amount of interprovincial traffie, and the
ra 'lway books are not, and could net be,
kept in nine different sections showing the
figures accordiug to provinces. Therefore it

would be impossible to answer the question
as now put.

SECOND R~EADING

Rigýht Hon. ARTHUJR MEIGIHEN moved
the second reading of Bill E2, an Act to
amend the Admiralty Act, 1934.
H1e said: ilonourable senators, this Bil11 contains two amendments to the Admiralty Act.
Thc first one is adequately explained by the
note printed opposite clause 1. In section
24 of the Act the word "debtors" was by
inadvertence used instead of "creditors." It
seems strange that the original measure could
have ýgot through with this errer. Plainly the
word "creditors" was meant, and the amendment substitutes that word for "debtors."
The second amendment is on a point which
had some consideration when the original
Bill was before a committee of this Huse.
This amendment is suggested by the President of the Exehequer Court, who is the head
of the court which deals with admiralty
Apparently the
matters in final appeal.
necessity of having two judges in appeal is
an onerous one. The committee desired that
if possible there should be two judges, as it
was feit that one would hardly be of sufficient
weight and status to sit in appeal from the
decision of a judge who has more frequent
dealings with admiralty matters than has a
judge of the Exchequer Court. But the difficulty of having appeals heard by two judges
blas proved too great, and the purpose of the
amendment is to do away with the present
requiremelit, 50 that only one appeal judge
will be necessary. 1 remember well the disand
cussion on the original B3411, I feel certain
that with the opinion of the President of the
Exehequer Court so firmly expressed as it
bas been on this point, the committee would
readily accede to the amendment asked for,
if the present Bill were sent to it for consideration. J therefore hope that the motion
for second reading will carry and that we
shaîl go on to third reading to-morrow.

318

SENATE

Right Hon. G. P. GRAHAM: Honourable
senators, I remniember very well the discussion
fhat we had in a sub-committee, and the feeling was exactly as the right honourable leader
has just outlined. Not being a legal man, I
can only say that the question of having a
fully qualified appeal judge was under consideration. I mean not merely a judge
technically qualified, but one who has the
status that would be thought necessary for a
judge who sits in appeal from another judge.
The difficulty of having two judges was mentioned, but if I remember rightly the subcommittee rather inclined to the view that it
would be wise te have both, and the cormittee approved of that view.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Tbat is right.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: If in the
circunstances it bas become almost impossible
to carry on with two judges, I cannot sec that
we are able to do anything but amend the
Act.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Is it customary for
one judge alone to upset the opinion of another judge? We have two judges on the
Exchequer Court now, and without any extra
expenses they are available for appeal.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Exchequer Court is composed of Mr. Justice
MacLean and Mr. Justice Angers. They are
peregrinating, going all over the country, and
I imagine no busier judges could be found
in Canada. The President of the Court says
that it cannot bc arranged to have them both
sit in appeal on admiralty cases. I tbink we
had better meet the situation. It will be recalled that a judge at one of the extremities
of Canada, wio was sitting pretty regularly
in admiralty matters and had made a considerable study of the law on that subject,
did net like the possibility of being reversed
by a single judge who was more rarely dealing with admiralty law. That consideration
certainly influenced thc committee. But what
are we going to do? We have only two
Exehequer Court judges.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Could they not
come te -Ottawa? We go to England for
appeals, and they might come to Ottawa.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They are
here. I am ready to accept the word of the
President of the Exchequer Court that the
inconvenience at the present is great and that
the Act should be amended.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Right Hon. Mr. G'RAHAM: I would rather
have this Act amended than another Exchequer Court judge appointed.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: There are two now.
The motion was agreed te, and the Bill was
read the second time.
POST OFFICE BILL (NEWSPAPER
OWNERSHIP)
SECOND READING

Hon. JAMES MURDOCK moved the scond
reading of Bill 50, an Act to amend the Post
Office Act (Newspaper Ownersbip).
He said: Honourable senators. to-dayv I find
myself in a rather peculiar position, having
undertaken a few weeks ago te father a private
member's Bill that came to us from another
place and appeared about to pass out bccause no one would accept responsibilirv for
moving its adoption in this House. The m1easure was, I understand, passed unanirnouly by
the elected representatives of the two or three
parties in that other place. The Bill is entitled, "An Act to amend the Post Offie Art
(Newspaper Ownership)," and in effect it is
somewhat in line with the order of tih d:y-if, as I think we can agree, the orde r of the
day, not only in Canada but in other countries
of the world, is regulation, control, and in mnv
cases domination or dictation as to the. acts
or rights of thc subject.
In this Chamber at prescnt we have severral

capable and representative senators, with long
nembership, whbo are personally intere ed in

or to dominate a newspaper.
Involved in this measure, as I read if. i- th1e
question of the freedom of the pres, or the
rights of the press. For a few moment, I am
going to undertake te discuss what unde.r the
changed conditions of to-day, in relation to the
conditions of bygone days, are the rights of
the press, and whether it would be, as it has
been held, inconsistent with those rights for
us te pass the Bill. The Bill provide-, in part:
The editor, publisher, business manager
or owner, of every newspaper, magazine,
periodical, or other publication, shall file with
the Postmaster General and the postmnaster of
the post office designated by the regulations.
not later than the first day of April and the
first day of October of each year, on blanks

additional information concerning the interest,
direct or indirect, of any person in such
publication or its stock, bonds, or other
securities as the Postmaster General shall by
regulation require, such information to disclose
the ownership of such publication.
In the light of some of the legislation that
has been before us in this Senate and before
the elected representatives of the people in
another place during the present session. of
Parliament, I am unable to see anything
radical or unreasonable in the proposals that
I have just read. But we Canadians in years
gone by have, and I think very properly,
taken considerable pride in the independence
and freedom of the press of our country. Generally speaking, we have had little to complain
of as to inequities, improprieties, and, shall
I say, camouflage on the part of our press;
though there has possibly been some ground
for complaint, as I shall in a few moments
undertake to show.
Whence comes the Bill, and why? So far
as the people's elected representatives in another place are concerned, it is almost in the
class of a perennial. I find that in 1925 it
was proposed in that other place by the same
honourable gentleman who sponsors it at the
present time. That year the Bill made no progress beyond first reading. The same honourable gentleman renewed his efforts in 1926
and 1927, with the same result. But in 1928
the measure was passed and sent over to the
Senate of Canada, this body of distinguished
thinkers answerable only to their conscience
and their countryHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: -who were expected
to deal equitably not only with newspaper
owners, but with the general public. But
what did they do? They did what they had
done in some other cases and what I am told
is soon to be moved for in this case: they
gave the Bill the six months' hoist. They did
not undertake to deal with the merits or the
equities of possibly regulating the freedom or
No.

just pushed the Bill aside for six months,
which meant its sudden death, and, they
got out of an unpleasant incident. So the
Bill died.
In 1929 a similar Bill was received from
another place by this distinguished body of
representatiýve Canadian :citizens answerable
only to their conscience and their country.
It is not my right, I presume, to criticize what
they did. But they did not go so far even as
in 1928. The Bill was chloroformed in the
Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills on
the ground that the preamble was not proven.
In 1930 a similar measure came to us from
the other Hose, and again it was chloro-

319

formed-is it unfair for me to say?-from
lack of courage to allow it to come before the
Senate for a proper discussion. Why that
lack of courage? Your answer is as good as
mine.
We are now in the thirty-fifth year of the
twentieth century. The years have brought
to Canada, yes, and to the whole world, many
remarkable changes. During the present
session bills have been presented to Parliament that would not have been dreamed of a
few years ago; bills to dominate and control
the individual and the corporation. If Parliament is consistent in placing upon the
Statute Book this social legisliation, is it
unfair to ask, why should nat the press of
Canada be given a little of the same regulation
prescribed for others in a less favoured position?
Is there any necessity for a Bill of this kind?
Some of us when talking about the other
fellow strenuously oppose his camouflage, fourflushing and bluff. We do not like him to
try any of that on us or on the people of the
country generally. But is it possible that
these many years same of the press of
Canada has been getting away with just that
kind of thing? Right here and now let me
say that if it has been done, it has been the
exception and nat the rule, in my judgment.
Far be it from me to charge that the press of
Canada generally undertakes to camouflage
and four-flush and bluff, to present opinions
different from those they really entertain.
But what is the condition? Is it unfair for me
to suggest that in one particular case I have
in mind the London Free Press, a dyed-in-thewool Conservative paper for many years past?
It dominates and controls unquestionably the
London Advertiser, which is supposed to promuligate Liberal views. I think virtually
everybody is familiar with that situation in
London. If this is so, are not the people in the
neighbourhood of that city, whether dyed-inthe-wool Conservatives or dyed-in-the-wool
Liberals, entitled to know how much camouflage or bluff or four-flushing may be contained in the editorials of either paper? It
seems to me they are, and that this Bill would
smoke the nigger out of the wood-pile and
,place the onus for the editorials or the news
published in either paper just where it
belonged, and would thus give them the weight
they deserved, coming from that source.
Then let us go to a place a little closer. Is
it unfair for me to suggest that the Montreal
Star, a dyed-in-the-wool Conservative paper,
dominates and controls the Montreal Herald,
a supposedly Liberal paper?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I rise to a point
of order.

320

SENATE

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I am making this
speech.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I was for eight
years president of the Montreal Herald.
During that time I never found out who
owned it, whether the Montreal Star or any
other interests; and I do not know yet.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I do not know any
distinguished gentleman in Canada better
fitted to occupy a dual position of that kind.
I think my honourable friend could do it with
credit to himself.
But I give those two illustrations as reasons
why this particular Bill should be placed on
the Statute Book. I expect of course that no
word of mine will convince certain distinguished representatives in this House that
the Bill is at all necessary. I expect shortly
after I sit down to hear a motion moved,
possibly by an honourable member directly
interested, to give the Bill the six months'
hoist. I serve notice now that I shall take
the position that under the rules of the Senate
any honourable mernber directly interested is
not qualified to make such a motion.
But let us go a little further and see what
we are undertaking to do with the other
citizens of Canada, and if it is not fair for
us to administer regulation of a similar sort
to newspaper owners or publishers. Section 7
of Bill 22, which provides for a weekly day
of rest in industrial undertakings, is in these
words:
Every employer who violates, or fails or
omits to comply with any provision of this
Act shall for ecli offence be liable on
suniary convietioin to a fine not exceeding
One hundred doHlars and not less than twenty
dollars in addition to any other penalty
preseribed by law for the same offence.
What offence? For neglecting to see that a
printer, a type-setter, a linotype operator, or
a reporter, I presume, has had a weekly day
of rest. Surely we have a right to ascertain
definitely, under the Bill now before us, who
it is that is liable to the fine.
Then we come to Bill No. 8, which was
before a committee of this House for a long
cime--the Bill to provide for unemployment
insurance. Therein it is provided that any
person knowingly making any false statements
or representations shall be liable, on surnmary
conviction, to imprisonment for a term not
exceeding two months, with or without hard
labour. How are we, under existing conditions, te find out who it is that the law
-hould be invoked against with respect to
newspaper publications?
The Bill contains
other penalties.
Hon. Mr CASGRAIN.

Then we come to the Bill, now before a
committee of this House, to provide for
minimum wages. It contains this clause:
Every employer is guilty of an offence,
punishable on summary conviction, and liable
to a penalty not exceeding one thousand dollars
or to one month's imprisonnient or, if a
corporation, to a penalty not exceeding five
thousand dollars, who pays to any worker
wages at less than the minimum rates of
wages.
How can we adopt that provision without also
accepting the present measure, so we may
smoke out those who are in control of the
press of Canada?
Another piece of social legislation is Bill
No. 21, an Act limiting the hours of work
in industrial undertakings to eight in the day
and forty-eight in the week. That Bill too
contains very drastic penalties for violations
of its provisions.
Therefore, honourable members, it seems to
me that if we have reason to believe that
this free and independent press that we cater
to, or nurse, or in many cases tolerate, has
been camouflaging, we should pass this present
Bill. I refer to some of our newspapers, not
all. Let nobody in front of me object, for
I am not speaking to any individual member,
but we know that some of our newspapers
have accepted pay for editorials that their
management did not believe in, just for the
purpose of feeding to the uninitiated citizen
something that it was thought would gratify
him.
Are we, representing the Canadian
people, and answerable, as I have said, only
to our conscience and our country, justified
in permitting a condition of that kind to
continue longer when in every walk of life
we are undertaking to regulate what the
employer, yes, and the employee, shall do?
I repeat, honourable senators, this Bill is
not of my choosing. I am simply moving its
second reading lest it should fail for lack
of a sponsor. Personally I think the purpose of the Bill is absolutely right, and in
my judgment the press of Canada will make
a m'istake right here and now if it does not
rise up and support a measure of this kind.
I want to know how the press in any part
of Canada can undertake to back up the
social legislation that has been before Parliament in the past few weeks and at the
same time say, "We will have no regulation;
we decline to let you know whom or what
we are connected with, or how much interest
we have in this, that or the other paper." It
seems to me that the people of Canada are
entitled to a practical dernonstration from the
press of the country that the great amount
of regulation that is good, for the ordinary
citizen is also good for those who in years
gone by have been in a specially favoured

tioned by the honourable senator who moved
the second reading of the Bill, and I do not
think this legislation would improve their
knowledge. I do not think it would be revealed that a newspaper owned a competing
newspaper. It would be possible to disguise
the fact, more or less, by showing that it was
owned by a trust company, or by someone in
trust. There are only one or two cases of
that kind in the whole Dominion of Canada.
I would not object so much to the publication of the lists of shareholders; but why
should a newspaper be picked upon and compelled to reveal its internai affairs to the general public? If it is necessary for me to place
a mortgage on my newspaper business, why
should I have to reveal that fact when soreone else, in some other business, is not required to do so? So far as the ownership of
newspapers of Alberta is concerned-and I
think perhaps the same is true in every
province of the Dominion-this information
has to be revealed. We are compelled to give
this information under provincial legislation.
In the province of Alberta, at any rate, the
information is given to a government departnient, and is available to anyone who wants it.
But I think it is absolutely unfair to demand
that newspapers should reveal their private
affairs by publishing a notice, if they are
compelled to place a mortgage on the business.

I suppose the newspaper business is being
singlel out because it is believed to have an
influence upon the public mind in regard to
public questions. But why not select the
radio? We are told tbat radio is a great
moulder of public opinion. Do we know
who are tie owners of the radio stations, or
who are tie sponsors of the speeches that are
broadcast? Do we knov who is paying for
some of the radio programmes in which public
questions are discussed? We in the province
of Alberta at the present time are hearing,
almost entirely over the radio, tirades by
different persons

on publie questions.

The

people there are asking how these broadcasts
are being financed. Would it not be just as
fair to demand a disclosure of the names of
those who are providing the money for these
broadcasts as to compel the newspapers of
this country to reveal all the intimate details
of their business?
I would go as far as to say that I have no
personal objection to this Bill. I am prepared, if it is necessary, to reveal all that is
asked. But as a ncwspaper man, and the
publisher of a newspaper, I do not tbink it is

newspaper, that we should be asked te do
something that is not demanded of other
private businesses. If there are ulterior motives behind the placing of some of these
mortgages. is this legislation going to help
to disclose the fact? I do not think so. The
stock of a newspaper might be held in trust
b some individual on that newspaper, or
some individual interested in it, and that
someone night be the power bebind the
throne, but I do not see how this Bill can
force revelation to be made. I do not think
there are many instances of the kind mentioned in the whole of Canada; I think the
actual ownership of nearly every newspaper
is known by the people living within the area
in which it circulates.
Now. I want to repeat that because I have
what might be called a personal interest in
this Bill I prefer to leave to those members
of this body not actively engaged in the
business aimed at. the decision as to whether
this measure is justified or not.
There is just one matter on whxbich 1 should
like to ibe enligbtened. I sbould like to know
whether this legislation is aimed only at newspapers that circulate through the post office,
or wheber it is intended to reacb all newspapers, whether circulated by express or truck,
or in some other way. There is in the country a type of newspaper to wlhich the people
generally, I think, object. I do not think
axny of the newspapers of that type are circulated through the
epost office. They are
simply sent out to news agents. and arc sold
on news stands and by boys on the street.
This legislation would not affect such newspapers. Thev could evade this legislation,
I think. and it would reach only newspapers
tran-smitted througb the post offices of Canada.
I do not want to influence the minds of my
fellow members in respect to this Bill. If
they feel that it is in the public interest that
the information sought should be given to
the public, I am prepared to submit to the
legislition; but I do feel that there are strong
objections to one business in Canada being
singled out and asked to give so much publicity in regard to its own internal affairs
when others are bing overlooked entirely.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: When the honourable
member from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan) rose. I was about to ask the honourable
senator wo i moved the amendment (Hon.
Mr. White) a question. He stated that this
field of legislation is covered, to seme extent
at least, by the present Post Office Act.
Hon. Mr. WHITE:

Yes.

JUNE 4, 1935
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I should like to know
to what extent the measure now before us
varies from the existing Act. What is required under this Bill that is not required
under the Post Office Act?
Hon. Mr. WHITE:
The Post Office Act
necessarily deals with the conduct of the
newspapers, speaking generally.
This Bill
applies largely to the finances of newspapers,
the set-up of the shareholders, and so on,
though, as the honourable member from
Lethbridge has said, we have to make returns.
I think we make four or five government returns annually to different departm.ents, showing the list of shareholders and the annual
statement of the company, and giving practically all the information asked for.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: But those returns
are confidential, are they not, in the same
way as an income tax return? It is proposed
to let the public know what the information is.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
May I ask
the mover of the motion a question? Will
this apply to foreign newspapers-to papers
from the United States?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I am sorry the
right honourable gentleman asks that question, because all I know is that the Bill says:
The editor, publisher, business manager
or owner, of every newspaper, magazine,
periodical or other publication, shall filethe information as set out in the Bill. I do
not sec anything making it necessary for the
publication to go through the mail before the
statement must be filed.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
It does not
come under the Post Office Act at all unless
it goes through the post office.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am becoming more mystified as the debate proceeds.
I must say, first, that I have not made
up my mind about this measure. There is
one clause that appeals to me as right,
namely the one which forbids newsapapers te
publish ostensibly as the opinion of the
owner or owners of the paper what is really
paid-for advertising matter.
To make it
appear that such material emanates from the
brain and judgment of the owner, and is net
advertising matter, seems to me to be misleading and deceitful, and to be guarded
against by legislation. Of that I arm already
convinced. As to the rest of the measure I
am open te conviction, but I am certainly
mystified.
The honourable senator has given quite a
history of the legislation. Perhaps this legislation was before Parliament when I was a
menber of the other House. When was the
first time-.

only

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do net
recall taking a stand upon it. Had I done
se, I should just have to depend upon my
judgment being now the same as then; otherwise I might be very inconsistent.
Now, let us examine the Bill. If the Bill
is right, it is for us to pass it. If it is fundamentally wrong, or if I deem it te be not in
the public interest, no matter how often it
comes from the other House, I shall take
whatever means are offered-whether it be
the six months' hoist or "preamble not
proven"-to vote against it.
What is the function of Parliament with
relation to all these questions? The honourable member who moved the second reading
of the Bill dwelt for some time on the inroads that legislation is making day by day
and year by year upon private rights. More
and more a scrutiny of private interests is
being exercised, and more and more limitations
are being placed upon ýprivileges and what
have long been regarded as innate human
rights. As civilization .advances we find this
necessary in order that vastly greater rights
may not be damaged. The purpose to be
kept in view is to protect the public initerest
in the light off advancing times. If we can
do this and improve the position of the
readers of a newapaper in relation to
that paper, it is our duty to do se, and
no solicitude for the special desires and
special powers of newspaper owners-and
they are very great-should dater us at all.
To my mind we ought to go to the full
extent of seeing to it that the utmost good
faith is observed between the newspapers and
the public. Subject te reasons te the contrary,
net only do I see no harm, but I see good te
be obtained by making certain that a newspaper does net publish as its own view something that is merely an advertisement for
which it is paid.
But when there is a proposal to go further
and say, " You must let the public know all
the details of the ownership of your paper,"
it is necessary for us to inquire what object
we are going to reach by such legislation, and
what the cost of reaching that object will be.
I am very much impressed by what was said
by the honourable senator from Lethbridge
(Hon. Mr. Buchanan). He pointed out first
that we do net make any such requirements
of other private interests. Well, sometimes it
is necessary to distinguish. But if we distinguish we must be careful that there are

SENATE
rules which when applied to newspapers will
be for the public benefit, but which would not
be for the public benefit if applied to other
private institutions. Suppose we passed this
Bill, what would be the first thing to happen?
Newspapers would be required ta supply the
Post Office Department with a list of their
owners, their bondholders, mortgagees, stockholders, and so forth; and the only hold the
Department would have on the newspapers
would lie in its power ta forbid the use of the
mails to any publication which did not comply
with the law. If it were nat for that suzerainty
of the mails we could not enforce such legislation. What a newspaper does in this respect is a matter of civil rights, and within
the demain of the provinces. But we have the
post offices under us and we can say what may
and what may net go through the mails, and
we are asked by this measure to exercise our
control of the post offices as a means of seeing
to it that certain information is given to the
public by the newspapers.
Then if the Bill were passed the foreign
newspaper would be compelled to supply this
data. Or I presume it ought to be so compelled, if the Canadian newspaper is; otherwise a distinct advantage would be given to
the foreign competitor. Is it going ta comply?
It is not. Does the honourable member think
that the public of Canada would sit silent
while the great newspapers and magazines of
England, France and the United States were
shut out of this Dominion? Just for the sake
of their Canadian circulation they are not
going to reveal all the details of their ownership and control. But this Bill in its practical
effect, as I interpret it now-I may be corrected
as the debate goes on-would put a wall
around Canada and shut out the literature,
magazines and press of other lands. Would
not that be the effect?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I think not. I think
if the right honourable gentleman would read
these amendments to the Post Office Act he
would see that they apply to those publications, magazines or periodicals printed in
Canada.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What horn is
the honourable gentleman on in that case?
He would pass a law which says: "You, the
New York Times, the New York Journal, the
Hearst press of the United States, can circulate
in Canada without any restriction at all. You
do not need ta reveal who owns you, or what is
behind you, or what interest, openly or otherwise, is directing your conduct. You have a
free hand. But if you come here and employ
people in Canada, if you invest money in our
country and establish a paper, we will put ail
these chains around you and you cannot pubRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

lish unless you do this, that, and the other
thing." In other words, this Bill would give a
great measure of encouragement to outside
newspapers, magazines and publications, and
handicap our own.
Another point raised by my honourable
friend from Lethbridge is very important. I
know a newspaper, or at least a publicationI am not sure what would be the right name
for it--which never uses the post office at all,
yet circulates through the whole Dominion.
By adding ta this Bill we may include it, but
our addition would be utterly without any

about it. It is beyond us, being wholly a
matter of civil right. So the effect of the
legislation would he to declare: "If you are
among the submerged tenth, a more or less
free lance whose purpose is, to say the least,
doubtful and distasteful, and if as a consequence you do not need to use the mails, go
ahead and publish. We will put no limitation
at all on you; we cannot. On the other hand,
if you circulate in the ordinary way, as the
respectable press does, we will tie you up with
the chains of this Bill."
These are the two dilemmas which face us.
I do not know what considerations moved the
other House, but I have never heard of either
of these matters being raised there. They
seem to let the measure go through on the
understanding that there is some popular demand for it. But these points that we have
to consider are serious-tremendously serious.
A still further point raised by the honourable senator from Lethbridge is the question
whether the public would be any wiser after
the information was given. If I owned a
newspaper it would be for me to say whether
the public was a particle wiser or not.
And if the state of ownership was such that
I did net want to disclose it, the disclosure
could very easily be avoided. Why not
formulate a little company to own the stock?
That is all that would have to be done. Or
there could be two or thrce or half a dozen
stockholiders. And I should be solemnly
stating to the Post Office Department and
publishing in the press that John Doe Securities was the owner of so many shares of the
stock of this newspaper. Sa the public would
be just as wise as it was before. That cannot
be covered, for the reason that the editor,
owner, publisher or other official may make
the affidavit, and the fellow who knows the
least will make it. He will tell, the truth as
he knows it, and the publia will not be a bit
better informed afterwards.
So I say the proposed legislation is discriminatory against Canada and would produce
a state of affairs to which the Canadian people

paper with the object of influencing public
opinion, bis case may be mentioned. He
used the paper, it was said, to boost the bonds
and stock of the Erie Railway and other railways in which he was interested. With al]
his money and all the power that he had
through it, he was able tn build up the circulation to somewhere about 30,000. Well, the
time came when he made up his mind that
he was net getting anywhere in trying to improve the value of his stocks in this way; so
he sold the paper to Mr. Pulitzer. Within a
few months the circulation went up to 200,000,
and 'later of course it went far beyond that.
Jn Canada everybody knows to-day who
own the newspapers. In Toronto we know
who own the Globe, the Mail, the Telegram
and the Star. It is common knowledge who
own the Montreal Star and the Montreal
Herald.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Who knows who
owns the Montreal Herald? I do not know
yet, and I do not suppose I ever shall.
Hon. Mr. HOCKEN: Reference was made
to ownership of the London Advertiser by
the Free Press. Notwithstanding that factat any rate I believe it to be a -fact, although
I have no personal knowledge that it is-the
Advertiser publishes to-day editorials which
are as strongly Liberal as are those in the
Globe or any other Liberal paper in Canada.
If the Free Press really d'oes own the
Advertiser, it apparently exerts no influence to
control the editorials. And I know that the
editor of the Advertiser would not submit to
any such control.
He left one newspaper
because he felt he was not given as free a
hand as he should have had in expressing his
opinions. He is a Liberal by conviction, who
writes Liberal editorials, and he writes them
well, for what they are worth. Everybody in
Toronto and London knows about the ownership of the London Advertiser. You cannot
keep a thing like that a secret, and I do not
sec any reason why anyone should try te. For
if a person wants to know the facts he has
only to go to the office of the Rogistrar General
in the Provincial Secretary's Department,
where he will be able to findi the name of
every stockholder and the amount of stock
he holds. So I do not think it would do any
harm to the newspapers if all that information
provided for in the Bill were published twice
a year.
If I were running a daily newspaper I
would not objeet at all to legislation of this
kind. But I think we should not pass it until
we can get a measure that will control publications of the character of the Ca'lgary Eye
Hon. Mr. HOCKEN.

Opener. I was prepared to support this Bill
because I was convinced it would do no harm
to the newspapers, while doing no particular
good to the public, but the point raised by
the honourable senator from Lethbridge makes
all the difference in the world to me.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question? He seems
to make a point about who oewns a paper.
What does it matter who is the owner? Why
should a man not own a good Conservative
paper and at the same time a good Liberal
paper? It is a matter of business. However,
I an against this Bill because it is one of
those silly things resulting from some of the
public wanting to mix in private business.
It costs a lot of money to run a newspaper.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: The honourable
memiber does not mean to suggest that any
newspaper man in Canada would run two
papers, one supporting the Conservative
party and the other the Liberal party?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I fail to see anything wrong in that. I coultd publish a
Conservative paper, and give good reasons
for doing so.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: And the same with
respect te running a Liberal newspaper. Take
an editor who for years bas been writing
editorials for a Conservative paper. He finds
he .can get a better salary on a Liberal
paper, and he does as conscientious work there
as he always did on the other. This holds
good from the reporters up to the chief
editor, and J know it makes absolutely no
difference in the scrupulous discharge of their
duties. I know a man who worked for the
Gazette for some months and next year
for a Liberal paper. The Gazette is pretty
Liberal just now.
There is a tendency at the present time
on the part of some persons to step in where
they have no business to be at all. It makes
no difference who owns a newspaper; it is
what it prints that counts. If a reader likes
the editorials he continues to be a subscriber;
if net, he transfers his support te another
paper, whose views are more in harmony with
his own.
Right Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM: Honourable members, notwithstanding the vigorous
remarks of my honourable friend from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock), I still think my
business is a respectable one.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Hear, hear.

JUNE 4,1935
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAiM: 1 imagine the
speech will not change the view of any
bonourable mamber who th-inks as I do. This
question of regulation of newspapars had its
origin in the city of Toronto. The one instance there of double ownership, which. it
was intended Vo investigate an'd expose, bas
been given Vo, the House by my bonourable
friand from Parkdale. 1V was for a long time
one of tbe bo'bbies of the father of this Bull,,
but it is no longer a matter of public importance.
To my mind tbe important question is,
is this Bill going to do anybody any good?
If it is, a member's personal relaVîionsbip with
the press sbould noV at ail affect h.is liberty
of action. I might say tbat it doas noV affect
me one iota. I feel myseif Vo ba just as
free in discussing this B.ill as my bonourable
friend undoubtedly feels in addressing the
Committea on Banking and Commerce on
bebaîf of the railwaymen. He doas noV thin,
hae is violating Vbe Independence of Parliament Act at ail by tbeing a railwayman.
The newspaper business in Canada is, Vo
my mmnd, having a very bard struggle. As a
newspaper man, I believe the standard of
.iournalism in. this country is noV excelled in
the known world. Althougb it bas only a
arnali population Vo appeal Vo, and altbough
aV times there may be great temptations Vo
relieve the financial stress, yet, knowing Canadian newspaperdon, I arn confident that it
stands on a very high pedestal for bonesty
and inVtegrity, and is determined Vo uphold
tbe public weal. Soma persons entertain the
idea that the owner runs his paper. Why,
bines their souls! The editor bas more power
than four owners. No newspaper owner in
these days uses the iron fist on bis editorial
staff. He engages men in wbom hae bas confidence, and at least seventy-five par cent
of the policy of Vhe papar is dominated by
the aditorial staff, noV by the owner at all.
My honourable frien-d from Parkdale rather
sougbt Vo convey the impression that printing
shops and newspaper establishments do not
corne within -tbe provisions of the proposed
social legisiation now 'before Parliament.
Every printer cornes under that legisiation;
so does every owner of a newspaper, wbetbar
a company or an individual. But this B .Il
is in.tended Vo apply Vo newspaper owner
over and aboya the social lagishation hy wbic
tbey are Vo ha affected. The only reason
given is that under existing conditions te
publie cannot find out who owýn our newspapers.
Non. Mr. 'CASORAIN: IV is none of their
business.

Z

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It is even
suggested that, in sorne instances the publie
should know who is the writer of au editorial.
That, in my opinion, is not the bast view
to take on. behaif of the public. Suppose 1
have in mind a man who, I believe, could
write a splendid article on some subject that
I desire to discuss ini my paper. He may
ha a university professor or a clergyman. He
does flot. want, his naine handed out Vo the
public-unless hie is vain, as sorne writers
are. Undoubtedly the publie tbrough im.personal journalisrn get benefits that they
could not geV through a.ny other channel.
Now, is t'nere any difficulty in 'finding out
who is the owner of a newspaper?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Not in a libel
suit.
*Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It is flot very
difficuit to find out then, nor on any other
occasion. In this connection there is perhaps one publication, or there are at rnost
two publications, in view. Iu Ontariu, if a
printing or a publishing company is incorporated, it is com.pelled Vo, make periodical
raturn-s to the Provincial Secretary. These
are not secret raturns, and the details can ha
easily sacured for the benefit of the public.
Hon. Mr. CAISGRAIN: So the ow'ners cau
ha sued.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: May I ask a question that I think goes Vo the root of thýis
Bill? As a matter of fact, in evary province
are not newspaper owners obliged under the
Companies Act to file with the registrar
much of the information required, by this tBill
-information both as to staff and ownership?
Rigbt Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I tbink so.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Than iI canuot see
the purpose of this Bill at al].
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I arn glad you
do not. What I have said of Ontario applies,
I think, to ail the other provinces. The
information is filad annually with the Provincial Secretary. It is idie Vo suppose th-at
you canuot ascertain who is the ownar of a
nawspaper just as readily as if hae were the
ownar of any other property. Thare is no
dishonasty on Vhe part -of newspaper owners
in filing those raturns.
It was charged at one tima that newspapars
did not give thair trua circulation Vo the
advertising public. I arn surprised that my
honourable friend did not rafer Vo it. A
newspaper would dlaim a larger circulation
than its rival whan perbaps ite circulation
lista would not confirm the dlaim. To-d!ay

SENATE

we have what is called the A E C audit,
and it is made under oath. Newspaper
owners have to keep a day-by-day account of
the number of papers issued and paid for.
No credit is given for free circulation. An
inspector attends regularly, checks the circulation books and accounts and certifies
there is a paid circulation of so many copies.
It is on that circulation the newspapers base
their advertising rates.
So far as I can see, there is no detail of
newspaper information of interest to the
public which is not already accessible. The
name of the company is printed at the head
of my paper. That company is responsible
for the contents and can be sued. Many
papers give the names of their lead'ing
officials. If I believed this Bill could be of
any use to the public, or would be a bit of
annoyance-as it was intended to be in its
original form-to certain persons who do not
care to disclose themselves for fear they
might be served with a writ, I should not
mind supporting it. The ,Bill would not
affect me in my busincss in the least; so 1
can talk freely as one who is not interested
personally.
But, this being a ineasure to
apply to a special case and not generally, I
think it is not good legislation, and therefore not in tbe public interest.
Hon. JAMES A. CALDER: Honourable
niembers. I was somewhat in doubt as to
the facts at first, but it strikes me the whole

situation has betn made quite clear, and
that, except as to two points, what is sought
co be effected is covered by the existing law.
As to the public being able to ascertain
the ownership of anv newspaper, any person can get the information. In my own
province of Saskatchewan, for example, under
the conpany law every newspaper is required
to file with the Provincial Secretary full
detatils as to ownership, and who would be
responsible in case of an action for libel.
In addition, certain financial statements are
required.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: The newspaper
owners have to file a financial statement and
also a list of shareholders, with their holdings.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes. If the ownership is in an incorporated company annual
returns bave to be filed containing all necessary information.
What are the two points not covered by
the existing law? One section of the Bill
requires every newspaper to disclose the
names of its bondholders, mortgagees or other
security holders. Why should a newspaper
Righit Hon.

Mr. GRAHAM.

owner be placed on a different basis in that
respect from every other business concern in
the country? Suppose a man is running a
joint stock grocery store in this city, and he
borrows money. Must he disclose all the
details of his borrowing in order to run his
business? I should say not.
Right Hon.,Mr. GRAHAM: The public can
go to the registry office.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes, if the public are
interested in ascertaining his position they
can get the information, because the general
law provides for it. I submit that in so far
as that feature of the Bill is concerned it is
objectionable, and that the newspapers should
not be called upon to furnish information
that general business concerns are not called
upon to furnish.
The other point is that raised by the honourable member from Letibridge (Hon. Mr.
Buchanan) and the honourable member from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hocken) with respect to
objectionable newspapers. My right honourable leader (Riglit Hon. Mr. Meighen)
thought the situation should be dealt with in
some way. Such newspapers do not circulate through the post office. We might deal
with them by an amendment to the Criminal
Code, but I think there would be objection
on the ground that the matter, being merely
one concerning civil rights, is within the jurisdiction of the provinces. I think honourable
members will agree that those newspapers
could be suppressed by the Provincial Secretary taking the requisite stops.
After analysing the situation I fail to sec
any necessity for the Bill. As to the first
phase, as I have said. objectionable newspapers should be dealt with by the province,
or by amendment to the Criminal Code, not
the Post Office Act. As to requiring newspapers to give information respecting their
financial standing, such information is not
require(d fron any other business concerns.
It is class legislation.
I am not quite sure that I agree with those
honourable members who have spoken about
everyone knowing who own our newspapers.
At the outset of the discussion my honourable friend directly opposite (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) stated he had for eight years been a
director of the Montreal Herald. and did not
know yet who owned the paper.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is right.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: So the statement of
my honourable friend from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hocken) is not borne out by the honourable member from De Lanaudière. Doubtless

JUNE 4, 1935
persons can get the information if they put
themselves to the trouble; but nobody wants
to know.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I will make a little
wager with my honourable friend for the
benefit of the Cancer Fund or any other fund.
You cannot find out the ownership.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: We are against
betting.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: All right. You cannot find out, for instance, the ownership of
the Toronto Telegram, the Mail and Empire
and half a dozen other papers that I can
mention. Let us not fool ourselves by saying
we can get this information. We can net.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I am not going te
make any wager across the floor; in fact I do
not like the suggestion at all. I have made a
statement, and I think it is correct. I am
speaking of my own province, and take as
an example the Regina Leader. It is required by law te send te the Provincial Secretary a full statement of its ownership, including the names and holdings of its shareholders. Does the honourable gentleman suggest te me that if that information is not
forthcoming the local Government does net
take steps te secure it?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Net at all; but I
do suggest, if that is good for Saskatchewan
why is it net good for Ontario?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: But we have the same
thing in Ontario.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Yeu say we have.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The right honourable
gentleman from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr.
Graham) had already stated that you had the
same thing in Ontario, and I went further and
said I did net doubt that it was the law of
every province in Canada. I have no doubt
that every province in Canada requires a
statement of the ownership of newspapers. It
is years since that law was adopted. I understand the same thing is true of the United
States. I have a very distinct recollection of
taking up magazines recently and seeing on the
page that is devoted te the business of the
paper a statement showing the names of the
business manager and the editor, and everything of that nature, and a reference te the
law which required the publication of that information. Se, as far as I can see, there is no
necessity for this Bill at all.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it your pleasure, honourable members, te adopt the motion?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am prepared
te vote for the second reading of the Bill and

329

te support its reference te the committee; net
that I faveur what seems te be the real principle of the Bill, but because there is a feature
of it that seems te me te be worthy of consideration and deserving of reference te the
committee.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Personally I am
net concerned with whether the Bill passes
or net, but I think it would be a great mistake
net te permit it te go te committee. Some
honourable gentlemen have said that certain
things are se which I think are net se at all.
The question can be developed in committee
and settled.
The motion was agreed te, and the Bill was
read the second time.

how would it be te let it go te the Railway

fact that the Banking and Commerce Committee has been dealing with all this social
legislation, and that it was stated that this is

DIVORCE BILLS
SECOND READINGS-DISCUSSION

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS, Chairman of the
Committee on Divorce, moved the second
readings of the following bills:
Bill F2, an Act for the relief of Muriel
Mabel Muttart.
Bill G2, an Act for the relief of Emile
Fossion.
Bill H2, an Act for the relief of Eva Bennett.
Bill 12 an Act for t'he relief of Helen Gertrude Bryant Wilson.
Bill J2, an Act for the relief of Gladys Sarah
Jenkinson Weeks.
Bill K2, an Act for the relief of Mary
Elizabeth Taylor Nicholson.
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourable .memaers, I wish to call your attention to what
a.ppears to be a very anornalous state of
affairs under the bills now before the House.
I will take one, which is a specimen of all
the others. Each bill consists of two clauses,
the second of which authorizes the innocent
party to marry again. Is that clause necessary? The Bill gives one person the right to
marry. but it does not give the guilty person
the right to do so. I understand that hundreds,
perhaps thousands, of these guilty persons in
Canada have gone through a form of marriage.
If this clause of the Bill is necessary to give
the innocent party the right to marry, surely
a similar clause is necessary to give the guilty
party the same right.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
both marry.

But they can

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: This Bill does not give
them both that right, and to that extent is
defective as I sec it.
That is the point I
wish to raise, and to call to the attention of
the right honourable leader of the House.
Further, I wish to call his attention to the
fact that a few weeks ago, when we were discussing this very question of marriage and
divorce, he said that once a divorce was
granted both parties were single again and
could marry whom they wished. If that is
good law and a sound statement, this clause is
net necessary at all. I think that if these
bills are loosely or foolishly drawn we should
not proceed any further until we get this
matter cleared up. It is worthy of consider-

ation.
Right Hion. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: All I have to say
about the remarks of the honourable gentleman is that this form of divorce bill has
been in existence ever since there was parliamentary divorce. Where it is taken from I
do net know. I suppose it came te us from
the British Parliament. It is the usual form
of bill. It has always been the same, and I
suppose the idea is that a person filing a
petition setting out certain facts, and having
his petition granted, can remarry.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Then why this clause?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: It follows the precedent in force from time immemorial. If the
honourable gentleman wants to remodel these
bills he will have to do it on his own account,
because, as I say, this has been the form
from time immemorial.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it your
pleasure, honourable gentlemen, to adopt the
motion?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I should like, if I
may, to have the opinion of the right honourable the leader of the House, because really
and truly this provision seems to me to be
entirely unnecessary.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have net
changed from the view I expressed before. If
the legislation stopped at the divorce, undoubtedly the guilty party would be free te marry
again. That is to say, exactly the same result
would then.flow from the legislation as flows
froin it in its present form. Consequently
there is no need of the section te which my
honourable friend objects. One can understand, though, how it came te be there, and
vhy the right of the party securing the divorce
took the form of a specifie right. Doubtless
the reason was that as one party petitioned
Parliainent and the other did net, the legislatien dealt only with the rights of the petitioner.
No doubt the petitioner preferred that the
legislation should be specific as to him or her,
and that provision was asked for down
through the years, and was granted. There is
no particular objection te the legislation in its
present form, but elearly it would be just as
effective if that clause were net included.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES:

It is useless.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

It is useless.

Hon. Mr. COPP: I am informed that at
one time this clause was cut out, and that
the House of Commons put it back.
The motion was agreed te. on division, and
the bills were read the second time.

MINIMUM WAGES BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. BLACK, Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Commerce, presented
the report of the committee on Bill 40, an
Act to provide for Minimum Wages pursuant
to the Convention concerning minimum wages
adopted by the International Labour Organization in accordance with the provisions of
Part XIII of the Treaty of Versailles and of
the corresponding parts of the other treaties
of peace.
He said: I may say that those who refer
to this Bill will not recognize it at ail, as the

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
the Chairman of the Committee says that the
Bill has been so transformed as to be unrecognizable. I wonder if the father of the

HON. SENATOR SIR THOMAS
CHAPAIS
CONGRATULATIONS UPON RIS ELEVATION TO
KNIGHTHOOD

Before the Orders of the Day:
MEIGHEN:
ARTHUR
Right
Hon.
Honourable members, I wish to take advantage of this opportunity to call attention to
an honour done a very distinguished member
of this House. The honourable senator from

331

Grandville (Hon. Sir Thomas Chapais) has
been included in the list of persons upon
whom distinctions have been conferred on
the occasion of His Majesty's birthday, and
we find his name among those of that very
small circle who have been elevated to the
rank of knighthood. I am certain to be reflecting the feeling as well as the sound judgment of all honourable members of this
House when I say that no one upon whom
this distinction has been conferred in our
time has been more worthy of it than is the
honourable senator from Grandville.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: His services
to Canada have been varied and eminent,
but I fancy that which was chiefly in mind
in the decision to honour him was his service
to the cause of learning and of literature,
particularly of historical literature, in this
Dominion. None is more generally recognized in this country as an authority on the
subject of Canadian literature than is he: I
believe he stands at the head of the historians
of Canada.
I can well imagine that possibly he accepted
with reluctance the distinction accorded him,
but I am very certain that sueh reluctance
would come only from his well-known modesty, for he would naturally shrink from publicity and from this very conspicuous designation. But certainly none more than he
respects, honours and reveres the Throne from
which this distinction comes. I congratulate
him warmly and hope that he may long live
to enjoy the rank and title which for the rest
of his life are his.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
Honourable members of the Senate, I rise with
pleasure to support the views expressed by
my right honourable friend. Although I happen to belong to a school which seems to
have consistently adhered to the resolution
moved in the House of Commons in 1919
by Mr. Nickle, of Kingston, asking His
Majesty to dispense with the granting of
titles to his Canadian subjects, I must confess that my opposition to titles as expressed
some forty years ago has been somewhat tempered by the subsequent history of this
country. At the beginning of my career and
in the years that followed I felt that titles
granted to Canadians on the recommendation
of the Imperial Cabinet could not be easily
approved of, inasmuch as there was danger
that persons thus honoured might become
subject to a divided rather than an exclusively
national interest when dealing with political
questions. During recent years, and more
especially since the Statute of Westminster.

SENATE
all such recommendations concerning Canadians are made to His Majesty by his Prime
Minister in Canada, and those receiving titles
of honour are not thereby influenced in the
discussion of political or other questions. For
the first time in this Parliament I am expressing the reason why, in 1897, I reproached Sir
Wilfrid Laurier for having accepted a knighthood. But in view of the fact that the
authority exercised in recognizing the merits
of a Canadian is now a Canadian authority,
the main objection on this score, which I
entertained from the beginning of my career,
has been to a degree moderated.
I may say that the honour which lias come
to my colleague and friend from Grandville
(Hon. Sir Thomas Chapais) is especially well
deserved.
The honourable senator lias by
tradition been interested most intimately in
Canadian history. His worthy father and himself. both as parliamentarians and Ministers
of the Crown, have helped to frame and to
interpret the Constitution of Canada. He has
thus had the advantage over historians who
are but theorists observing from afar the
action of governments. Engaged in the practire of legislation, he lias brouglit te the
examination of historical events a knowiedge
possessed only by those who have been statesmen as well as historians. As an historian
he bas done well by Canada, and I can but
repeat what my right lionourable friend lias
few Canadians writing Canadian
said, tit
history have established such a reputation as
lias my honourable and distinguished friend
from Grandville.
Honourable
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN:
members, may I be permitted to add one
word? I am ven proud te say that for nearly
sixty years the new knigbt and I have been
friends-I miglit say close friends. Our forbears resided in the same Iocality in the good
old province of Quebec, and when young we
were members of a literary circle.
Some
were poets, others recited poetry, and we all
discussed literary works. Sometimes we dined
and afterwards we wined, but when we were
having a very good time my friend used to
say: "Bon soir, mesieurs; I hope you vill
have a nice evening": and h.e would go back
te his books. Perhaps if we had done likewise we miglit have been similarly honoured.
He occupies a unique position in Canada.
He is the only living Canadian to-day who
lias the honour and privilege of sitting in two
legislative assemblies.
He is also a distinguished member of the Legislative Council
of the province of Quobee. I may add he is
the only man who could hold that dual position without any criticism from friend or
foe, politically speaking. Wlien he was called
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

to the Senate no one thought of asking him

contrary, everybody was very happy to have
him there.
His Gracious Majesty must have been very
well advised, for in our part of the country
we consider him a national glory; we are
proud of him. I join with both leaders in
praying Divine Providence that lie may yet
be spared many years to enjoy the honour
he so well deserves.
Hon. D. O. L'ESPERANCE (Translation):
Honourable senators, it is my pleasant duty, as
dean of the Queibec district, to add a few words
to the congratulations my illustrious leader bas
so felicitously epressed on the occasion of the
high distinction granted by our gracious
Sovereign te our distinguished colleague from
Grandville (Hon. Sir Thornas Chapais).
I have just corne from Gaspesia, the picturesque division I have the honour to represent
here. It is therefore without preparation that
I rise to add a few words to the eloquent
tribute paid by those who have spoken before
me. I need make nxo rhetorical effort in reminding nmy .old friend, the honourable senator
from Grandville, of my affection and esteem,
and in telling him liow happy I feel over the
high bhonour he bas just received. I shbould,
however, require the eloquence of my right
honourable leader himself (Right Hon. Mr.
Neighen) to express properly to this House
the feelings of the Quebeckers towards our
national historian. Although I recognize I am
but a poor interpreter of tlicir sentiments of
esteem and veneration, I .considered it my
duty to tell alil my colleagues in this House
tliat, of all the decorations granted by His
Majesty, no other was received with the
and joy which greeted the
enthusiasm
announcemenet of the recognition granted our
honourable friend from Grandville.
Hon. Sir THOMAS CHAPAIS: Honourable
members of the Senate, I tender my heartfelt
thanks te the honourable leaders of this
Chamber for tlieir kind words, and to my
other colleagues for their friendly contribution to the congratulations whicl the leaders
have extended te me in their usual felicitous
style. I could not expect that His Majesty
should bestow this honour upon my humble
person. I know perfectly well that it is
intended net as a personal honour, but rather
as a compliment to my province and to the
French Canadian race.
Honourable members, I am deeply moved
by the warmth of your congratulations, and
again I pray you to accept my most grateful
acknowledgment.

not also be considered in the estimates?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I presume
they would be as well, but of that I am not

been so considered in other years, but I cannot
sec why there should be necessity for two
measures in order to make the same appropriations.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Nor can I.

SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the

contemplated.

Council, delay would be injurious to the public
interest, or in which from the nature of the

I do not think the tender system affords
any more protection to the Government than
it does to a private individual-and that is
no protection at all. Although no Governmen-t would dare go so far as te
award a contract on the basis of an arrangement made with a reliable contractor, I
believe such a method would give the contractor a fair price and would enable him to
pay fair wages without stinting the work. An
arrangement with a reliable contractor is far
better than a contraet with an unreliable
contractor.

dangerous crossing the question was referred,
if I remember correctly, to the Board of
Railway Commissioners, and that Board
assessed the cost among three parties-the
Government, the railway company and the
municipality. Some progress was made under
that system. Municipalities, of course, were
somewhat careful about applying for the removal of a level crossing if the cost was
going to be very high. I agree that under
the old system probably not much money
would be spent on this type of work in times
of depression, because, no matter how strong
the pressure or how valuable the work might
be, the municipalities are not in a position
to pay. While the present proposal looks
like a departure from the responsibilities
under the, statute, I am not sure that under
presenit conditions the change is not perfectly
defensible.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES
INVESTIGATION BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN moved
the second reading of Bill 71, an Act to amend
the Industrial Disputes Investigation Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this Bih is
one of the first products of the Price Spreads
Committee to reach this House. That committee made rather sweeping recommendations with respect to the Industrial Disputes
Investigation Act, the manifest design of the
committee being that there should be a wider
range of governmental control of industrial
disputes. The reference of those recommendations to Council, however, and to the
Justice Department, resulted in a unanimous
verdict that they could not be implemented
within our constitutional power.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Because of the
judgment of the Privy Counnil on that very
Act.

335

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That opinion,
no doubt, is based in large degree upon the
judgment of the Privy Council declaring that
in many respects the Industrial Disputes Investigation Act is invalid.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The right
honourable gentleman bas been referring te
the Price Spreads Committee. He will know
the reason why he ought te adhere te the
word "Commission," if he has read the daily
papers.
Right Hon. 'Mr. MEIGHEN: No, I have
nlot.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: A committee
is required te report te the House, but a
commission does not have te do that.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, yes.
was a committee-

It

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: In the beginuing.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: -but
at
about middle life it was transformed into a
commission. The report is from the Commission.
This Bill is designed te go in the direction
of amending the Industrial Disputes Investigation Act, as far as can be justified by the
constitutional authorities.
It does not go
very far. That is te say, it does not sweep
over a wide area, but covers merely such industrial undertakings in Canada as are subject te the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament. The opinions given us, which I do
not doubt are correct, are that in respect of
the particular phase of the Act which is
covered by this Bill we cannot go beyond
those industries, such as the railways, which
are subject te our jurisdiction. The measure
provides that a commissioner or commissioners may be appointed under the provisions of the Inquiries Act, not only at the
request of those affected, but without any
request at all. It provides also that complaint
may be made to the Minister with respect te

acts of discrimination alleged te have been
perpetrated by either side, and the Commission may be authorized to examine into
the complaint and report upon it.
There is in this measure nothing which will
revolutionize anything. Maybe it is a further
interference with the subject, and perhaps
there should be amendments protecting the
subject. However, after second reading is
given, a motion will be made te refer the
Bill te the Committee on Banking and Commerce, where we shall be able te hear the
views of all honourable members and of
persons from outside who may desire te
make representations.

SENATE
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable members, I have been unable to make a
minute comparison of the single clause of
this Bill with the Industrial Disputes Investigation A-et, so as to find out exactly what
point is covered by the amendment.
I
wonder if the whole amendment is not to be
found in the first three lines of the clause:
Where in any industry subject to the legislative jurisdriction of the Parliament of Canada
(whether or not it be an industry to which
other provisions of this Act apply)These words seem to extend the scope of the
Act, and I am unable to find anywhere else
in the Bill a material modification of the
present law. Of course there is an extension
in these words, which follow immediately after
the lines I have already read:
-any strike or lockout lias occurred, or seems
to the Minister to be inminent, or complaint
lias been iade to the Minister that intimidation lias been practised or other discriminatory
action taken either by employers or employees.
This is a change from the section that is
sought to be repealed, which is printed in the
explanatory note.
I cannot exactly see what ground is intended to be covered by this measure, unless the purpose is to create a new criminal
offence. Would this override the rigbt of
labour to do aggressive picketing, which
is very often done by employees and complained of by the employer? I cannot say,
but it looks as if it would. Perhaps my right
ionourable friend can tell us exactly the real
importance of the proposed amendment.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: As I understand it, the Act was declared invalid in that
it purported to cover all undertakings, whether
thev were within the federal pale or not;
that is. whether or not they were of the
lharacter of railways, with respect to which
the federal jurisdiction is plenary. In order
that there may be no question as to the
constitutional status of the measure, the new
clause reads:
Where in any industry subject to the legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada,
and so on. Wien the industry is subject to
that jurisdiction, tben under the finding as to
constitutionality we can legislate with respect
to disputes occurring in it.
The next purpose of the Bill, as I understand it, is to permit the Minister to act on
complaint being made to him that intimidation has been practised or other discriminatory action taken either by employers or employees. Heretofore the Minister has not had
authority to act merely on a complaint of that
character from an individual, or from one
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

side or the other. It has been suggested to me
that the effect of the language in this respect
is to authorize investigation of a complaint
based only upon such picketing as is allowed
by law, by virtue of recent legislation. If
there is an implication to the effect that that
kind of picketing is illegal and may be inquired into as such, then perhaps an amendment would be necessary in order to remove
the implication. However, honourable members will sec that the second purpose of the
legislation is to enable the Minister to act
upon complaints of the character I have indicated.
Another object is to enable the Minister to
act on his own initiative, without application
at all, if he conceives it in the public interest
so to do. He may recommend the appointment of a commissioner or commissioners
under the Inquiries Act to investigate disputes and make findings thereupon.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

deals with a subject which ham been before the

been here. I think it was during hast session,
or at. ail events a very recent session, that we
passed an amendment ta the Act. That
amendment has nat been enforced in the

question in the Attorney-General'a Depa.rtment as ta its effect. The Departrnent olaims
the present Act is subject ta two interpretations. The purpose af this arndment is to
rernove the question and ta enact that the

'Right Haon. Mr. MEIGIIN: My information is that there has been no real change
made in the suibstance of the Bill. There

I arn correctly aàvised as ta their nature,
there sh'ouid be na objection. However, it

The Patent
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Bill was firet brought down in the flouse ai
Gommons, wh*ere it was withdrawn in order
ta permit the introduction of the measure
in the Senate. Bill A was afterwards intraduced in this Chamber, but as a mattetr af
fart, it was a flouse af Cammons Bill. It
was referred ta aur Standing 'Committee an
Banking and Commerce, whicha devoted to
it,' for weeks, very close consideration and
hard work, and made numeous amendînents.
These were presenteà ta the Senate and
adopted, and then we gave third reading ta
the measure and sent it over ta the other
flouse. I have not heard af a single reference by any member ai the Commaons ta the
work whicha we did on this Bill. It seems ta,
me that sametimýes that Hause should give
a_little credit ta the Senate for good service
performed, but I have scarcely ever known
any honaurable member of the otheT place
fa mention this Chamber except by way af
criticism.

PRIVATE BILLS
REPORT OF COMMII'trEE

Private Bills on Bill D2. an Act respecting
the Portage la Prairie Mutual Insurance Company, and moved concurrence therein.
He said: The Bill is reported with an
am(nlindent which does not in any way affect
the purpose of the Bill. It is precisely the
same as a bill adopted by the House last
session in respect to another insurance company. and is approved of by the Insurance
Departient of the Government.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
quite understand the significance of the
amendment. It strikes the nanie of Arthur

Should they not all be referred ta the same

REPORT OF OOMMITTEE
Hon. Mr. TAINNER presented the report
of the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous
Private Bills on Bill B2, an Act respecting a
patent of Lillian Towy, and moved concurrence therein.
He said: This Bill relates to an invention
in respect of whicli a person resident in the
United States obtained, in December, 1931,
a patent in that country, but never applied
for a patent in 'Canada. The time has long
expired when such an application could be
made. The purpose of the Bill is to permit
the inventor to make an application. The
committee is reporting unfavourably in respect to the Bill.
The motion was agreed to.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall Bill
N2 be read a second time?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Would it not be
better to suspend the rules, so that the Bill
might have a chance to get through in another
pla.ce?
Hon. Mr. GORDON: There is opposition to
the Bill. The parties want to appear before
the Railway Committee.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Generally I
arm a stickler for observance of the rules, but
this Bill must be given second reading before
it can be referred to the Railway Committee.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: As I understand the
situation, the Committee on Standing Orders
considered the petition and found all the
rules had been complied with, except as to
notice ta the Quebec Government. The report of the committee recommends that notwithstanding this lapse the Bill be proceeded
with. If the House does not object, I will
move the second reading.

THE RAILWAY PROBLEM IN CANADA
DISCUSSION-MOTrION WITHDRAWN

On the notice of motion by Bon. Mr.
Çasggra;in:
Tha.t he will cail the attention of the Senate
to the railway problem in Canada and will
move that an Order of the Senate do issue
for a return giving the gross railway receipts
in each of the nine provinces, separately, the
number of miles of rail-ways in each province,
also the railway expenditure for operation in
each province.
He said: Honourable members, I was not
surprised to get from the .right honourable and
distinguishied gentleman who lea.ds this House
his very un.satisfactory answer to the effect
that the Canadian National Railways management, because of the way they keep their
books, do not, know rby provinces wheTe
they have Iost or made any money. I have
a.sked the same question many times, and
have~ always received the saine answer. 0f
course, that is public ownership. If the
Canadian Pacific Railway were asked for
similar information they could tell you to a
dollar where they were losinig or making
money.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Net by provinces.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: More than that, by
every branch line.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Not by provinces.
Hon. Mr. 'CASGRAIN: AIl they would
have to do would be to get the mileages in
the provinces.
Right Hon. Mr. MEI'GHEN: Provinces
are not branch uines.
fHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It is a contentions matter, and I will not argue about it;
but I think that to say they do not know is
a very poor answer. At one time Sir Edward
Beatty said that the gross receipts per mile
on the lines in the Northwest amonnteà to
$8,000, an'd on the lines in the East to $1,1,000.
He must have found, that ont. How he

me to withdraw the motion.

I have looked

railways do more than two dollars' worth
of business in Ontario for every dollar's

SENATE
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I knew you would
not understand it. I am not surprised. It
is a very strange thing that the honourable
member for Grandville (Hon. Sir Thomas
Chapais), to whom I showed this book when
we were coming up here, knew all about it
before he got off the train.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
reader.

He is a good map

He knows I am
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
speaking the truth. Let him get up and
contradict me if he will.
In the United States there are 497 persons
per mile of railway, but for the last twentyfive years the United States have been decreasing their mileage while we, even up
to as late as 1930, continued to increase ours
at an enormous rate. We were all drunk
with prosperity and we thought it wouldi last.
I do not blame those who were responsible,
whether they were my political friends or
not. I hope I have no political foes. While
there are 497 persons per mile of railway
in the United States, Canada bas only 222.
In the United States I do not think there is
one railroad west of the Mississippi that was
not put into the hands of a receiver three
or four times during its lifetime. We should
have done likewise witýh our railways. It
was a mistake that we did not, as sene of
those who are near me know.
In the four Western Provinces there is a
mile of railway for every 136 persons; and if
we assume that a family consists of five, that
means there is a mile of railway for every
27 families. How can you expect 27 families
to keep up a mile of railway?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
during the golden age.

That was done

I am very glad
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
the honourable gentleman has brought up that
point. It will lengthen my remarks. I will
take the Drayton-Aeworth report on this question, which was pr esented to the Administration of which my honourable friend was a
member. That report said that there were
24,000 miles of railroad in this country in
1911, wien Sir Wilfrid Laurier went out of
power. In 1917, when the report was made,
there were 42.000 miles of railroad.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I shall be into
this in a minute.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

You will. Every-

body accused the Laurier Government of
building too many railways. I am quoting
almost verbatim from the report when I say
that there were so many persons per mile
when Laurier was in power. During his golden
reign the population jumped, in a decade,
from some five million odd to seven million
odd, or about forty per cent. Fancy what
the situation would have been if that increase had continued. Fate seems to bear ill
will to honourable gentlemen of the other
persuasion, for every time they come into
power everything goes down. Sir Henry
Drayton said that in the six years following
Laurier's defeat in 1911 there had been no
appreciable increase in the population of
Canada. The number of persons per mile of
railway was considerably diminished. Anybody can make the calculation for himself:
wien we had 24,000 miles of railroad the
number of ýpersons per mile was 284, I think,
and when we had 42,000 miles of railway that
number had- dýwindled, to 222. Such was the
position we were in. I am very glad that my
good friend from Alma (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) brought up that point. I think it is a
rather good one.
Now, as I have said, tfle four Western
Provinces have 136 persons, or 27 families, per
mile. Do youî think that 27 families can
maintain a mile of railroac? It cannet be
donc.
Ontario is not so badly off. In that province there are 225 persons, or 45 families, per
mile of railway. But in Quebee there are 550
persons per mile of railway; so that for every
mile there are 110 families. From the beginning Quebec bas always got the short end of
the stick, and even that is given grudgingly.
In th Maritime Provinces there are about 230
persons per mile. The situation there is very
much like that in Ontario. It is in the West
that there are not enough people for the
mileage.
Hon. Mr. CORDON:
the number of families?

HowI do you get

They had
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
been contracted for before the election.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
The hcad of a
family is supposed to have a wife and three
children. Surelv it is not too much to expect
that a man should have thrce children. He
may have the-m all at one time.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Sir Wilfrid Laurier was out of power long before that.

JUNE 6, 1935
Hon. Mr. iCASGRAIN: Honourable, members rnay be surprised to learn that in the
United St.ates, even though there bas been
a big reduction of mileage, and certain roade
have been scrapped, there are 248,000 miles of
railroad. That aggregate is equal to ten
tirnes the distance around the earth at the
equator.
I Russia, which is the country
having the next greatest mileage of railway,
there are 48,000 miles, and in India, there are
42,961 miles. Canada cornes f ourth with
42,364 miles. 1 may say tha.t these are
officiai figures. I had placed Canada in third
position, but I took the trouble to have the
figures verificd 'hy the Board of Railway
Commissioýners, and I find Canada cornes
fourth in mileage in the world.
It has recently heen said by the Prime
Minister of this country that the credit of
Canada io London was flot as good as he
wouid like to see it. Hie gave as the reason
sonme legisiation that had reccntly been passed
in this country-which, by the way, bas flot
yet bc-en put into force. Pcrhaps I shall be
permitted to say why, in my opinion, the
credit. of Canada, is flot good. Tbe people
be-hind the old Grand Trunk Raillway came
to Canada and almost begged for the privilege
of spending their good moncy in this country.
Their lawyer was Sir Etienne Cartier-the
firmn wa.s Cartier an~d, Pominville-and,
aithou-gh h& was Sir John A. Maodonald's
ri'ght-hand man, hie had the greatest difficul'ty
in securing for these English people the privilege of spending their money 'here. In the
fif tics they invested at one time 6,000,000
pounds sterling, or $30,000,000. That investment was ahsolutely wiped out, and these
people neyer rceived a cent efê return.
You ma.y say that, is ancient history; but
when the English people lose moniey they
remember it for a long tirne. We bh&l'
the h-enefit of that $30,000,000.
And how
was it spent?
As usuel, Quebec got
very littie. Both sides of the Saint Lawrence wcre thickly se-ttled, and, great care
was taken flot to run the road there. I
do not hiame th-ose, p-eople. They wanted
to anýglicizie the -country, and it was only
natural that they shoulsd want to do so.
They ran the road from Quc;bec to Richmond, which woul-d be about in the middle
of the Eastern Townships. They hoped to
establish an English settlernent there and
divide the French people into. two sections.
Thcy did not, know what they were doing,
for the French wer-e the most loyal people.
I think it would flot be indiscreet to relate
a certain incident here. Before Lord Bessborough left Englanýd to come to. tbis .country

341

His Ma e.sty said to hirn: "When you go to
Western Canada the people will talk to you
about wheat, but the people of Quebec will
talk to you about. loyal-ty. They are my
most loyal subjeats." I think that is a high
tribute, and I arn glad to repeat it here.
Neyer mind where I got my information.
Anyway, the Grand Trunc kapt on after
losing that $30,000,000 and spent more money.
They built frorn Quedsec to Richmond and
from Richmond to Montreal, and then they
had to build the Victoria Bridge. They could
have gone up the north shore, wbere the
Province of Quebec burnt its fingers :by buildinýg a railway which. cost $14,000,000, and
which it reýquired a lot of persuasion to ge.t
the Canadian Pacifie to take over for
$7,000,000--just fifty cents on the dollar.
What happened after the Grand Trunic
gaxe good railway facilities to ail the principal
oentres in Ontario?
Wa.s their territory
respeeted? It was flot. The Government
actually subsidized the Canadian Pacific to
compete by running into every little; town
where, the Grand Trunk Railway already waz.
I wîll give you a littie instance. I do flot
know whether many honourable members are
acquainted with Goderich. I know something
about it, because I invested saine money
there once. In the town there is a place
where sait is made, and I was interested, in
that. There neyer was enougli business in
Goderich to make one line pay. Yet nothing
would suit the Canadien. Pacific but to go
there.
However, the Grand Trunk did de'velop
Ontario wonderfully. That province to-day,
as I have said, does two and a hall dollars'
worth of business for every dollar's worth we
do in Quehec. It bas flot two and a hall
times our poulation, but the Ontario people
are more industrialized and 'have a higher
standard of living. The average French
Canadien wants 'but littie here below-and
ha gets it.
If I had gone on with this speech I shouid
have told you ail about railroads in South
Africa, in India and in Australia, but I did
flot want to proceed.
Now rnay I ha allowed to make a short
digression? It will flot take a minute.
His Gracious Majasty King George bas heen
pleased to recognize in a marked manner the
able Minister of the Canadien Lergation at
the Court of Japan. The Hlonourable Hlerbert
Meredith Marier, Privy Councillor, bias been
created a Knight -Commander of the Most
Distinguished- Oirder -of Saint .Michael and
Saint George. I 'have heard -Vhat at a meeting of the diplomatic corps in the preseýnce of

SENATE
the Emperor of Japan, Sir Herbert and Lady
Marler were the most distingué couple. All
of us who remember the queenly appearance
of Lady Marler, and the8 dignified demeanour
of Sir Herbert when he sat in the House of
Commons as a representative of Montreal,
will readily believe this. The magnificent
residence of the Canadian Legation, erecteid
on a large estate in Tokyo, was built by our
Minister himself. All this gives prestige to
Canada. And prestige to a nation is just
like credit to a large financial institution.
Thank you, honourable senators. I now
ask that my notice of motion be withdrawn.
The notice of motion was withdrawn.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I desire to

to-day.

WAGES

BILL

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. BLACK moved concurrence in
the amendments made by the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce to Bill 40,
an Act to provide for Minimum Wages pursuant to the Convention concerning minimum
wages adopted by the International Labour
Organization in accordance with the provisions of Part XIII of the Treaty of Versailles and of the corresponding parts of the
other treaties of peace.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Would it be too
much to ask that consideration of these
amendments stand over until a later sitting?
Hon. Mr. BLACK:

Until the next sitting?

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
That would depend upon when the next sitting is to be, but
I should like a postponement until next
Tuesday if possible. The reason I ask this
is that the amendments contain some language
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

which is totally unintelligible to the average
representative of labour, the average man
who has had dealings with labour. For instance, I find in these amendments a reference to "rateable trades." Now, that is entirely over the headsRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
fined.

That is de-

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I know it is, but, if
you will pardon me, the definition does net
convey the understanding--shall I say?-that
we are used te. It .may be the proper term.
Then we find the word "machinery" used here
very often. That word in certain cases, I
think, unquestionably means agreements; in
certain other cases it unquestionably means
regulations. Now in connection with this
Minimum Wages Bill I am sure that the right
honourable leader of the House and all concerned, desire above all things that the language
of the measure shall appeal to the knowledge
and intelligence of the ordinary workman who
is reading it. And I frankly state, honourable
senators, that I do not find it intelligible.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have no desire to rush the matter over the head of
anyone, especially of one so interested as the
honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock). But let me deal with the question that he raises, taking the last point first.
I too was struck by the use of the word
"machinery" when the Bill was in comnmittee.
"Machinery" is used in the sense of an organizing entity or organizing entities for effecting
certain purposes. The reason we retained the
word was that it is the word of the convention adopted at Geneva, and we cannot
escape it.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
Is the word
"eoperation" also in the convention?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. I say
it is, because I am sure it would be, though
I cannot recall it exactly. But we all know
what "operation" meana.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Take the first three
lines of section 4, subsection 1:
The Governor in Council may on the recomiendation of the Minister create, and by
regulation provide for the operation by or
uncder the Minister of, machineryRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is right
out of the convention.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That word "machinery" surely means agreements.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I should presume so. Anyway, it is the word used in the
convention; so all the labour representatives
must have agreed to it.

JUNE 6, 1935
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Maybe it is absolutely essential to have that kind of language,
but it is different from the tongue in which
those dealing with such questions have been
wont to talk. I find the expression "rateable
trades" referred to ten times in the first two
pages. The question would naturally arise:
What about the other trades? I agree that
"rateable trades" is defined here. Paragraph
(e) of section 2 says:
"Rateable trades"- means those trades or
parts of trades (in particular, home working
trades) in which no arrangements exist for the
effective regulation of wages by collective agreement or otherwise and wages are exceptionally
low.

Now I do not know if I am losing my grip,
Dut that is entirely over my head. It sounds
to me like absolute nonsense. I am sure I
must be wrong, but I am also sure that there
are a great many other so-called labour skates
who would look upon the language as I do.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I cannot say
definitely "rateable trades" is defined in the
convention, but I do know that this particular
language of the definition of "rateable trades"
is right out of the convention. That in the
main is the reason for the committee's amendment. I will read the definition. I do not
know why it should be so obscure. Possibly
it would be obscure to me if I had been
accustomed to other methods of expression;
but I have no.t been so accustomed. Here is
how it reads:
"Rateable trades" means those trades or
parts of trades (in particular, home working
trades) in which no arrangements exist for
the effective regulation of wages by collective
agreement or otherwise and wages are exceptionally low.
That is exactly the language used in the
convention to designate the trades it is intended to oover by special safeguarding provisions. In article 1 of the convention I find
these words:
trades or parts of trades (and in particular
in home working trades) in which no arrangements exist for the effective regulation of
wages by collective agreement or otherwise
and wages are exceptionally low.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Is there not a
definition of "rateable trades"?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. The
convention provides that the governing authority in the country shall, over that area
of rateab trades where there is no protection
for workers by agreement between organized
employees and employers, select trades to
which the provisions are to apply. Therefore we define specified rateable trades, and
in another section we say the Government

343

may select those trades. In a word, the
answer to the honourable senator is this:
whatever his difficulty may be, it is a difficulty brought on us by the convention. We
have remodelled the whole Bill so it- may
stand four-square upon the convention.
Throughout consideration of the Bill I have
been very careful, as the honourable member
knows, to take no unnecessary chances of its
being defeated before the Privy Council.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: For example, "machinery" is used very often in the redrafted
sections, 4, 5 and 6.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In every instance the word is taken from the convention.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I think I see what
it means now, but I fancy a layman would
use another word. If it is necessary to adopt
"machinery," why not define the word?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That would
be a perilous thing to do. Suppose we define
"machinery" in more restrictive terms than
the court at Geneva thinks we have a right
to: our legislation is gone.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: "Machinery" in
one place unquestionably means agreements,
in another place regulations.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But in both
cases the word is taken from the convention.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I am not asking
that the Bill be referred back, but if the committee is going to meet next Tuesday morning, I should like to have an opportunity of
saying a word or two there.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In Committee of the Whole?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: No; the Banking
and Commerce Committee.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Then it would
be necessary to refer the Bill back.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not recall such a case. Presumably the committee
would have to be instructed.
Hon. Mr. MURDOOK: The reason 1 make
the suggestion is that Mr. Tom Moore does
not know that these amended sections were
adopted.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: He was before the
committee.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think Mr.
Moore was there all through the discussion.
Hon. Mr. MURDOOK: I had his word,
just before the House opened this aftemoon,
that he was not present.

344

SENATE

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Then I am
wrong.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable members will recall that the committee began its
consideration of Bill 40 some days ago, and
counsel was instructed to redraft sections 2
to 8. Yesterday morning the redrafted sections were considered by the committee and
adopted. I was not present at the time. I
am not complaining. but in some way some
of these things may have slipped by. They
may be entirely right, but I think we should
be better satisfied if we had an opportunity
to look into them a little further.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I have a very distinct
recollection of Mr. Moore being present when
the clauses to which the honourable senator
from Parkdale refers were adopted by the
committee. I do not remember Mr. Moore
being present yesterday morning, but what
little was done then did not change the wording of the Bill. I think both the honourable
senator and Mr. Moore were in the cornmittee when the word "machinery" was discussed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I raised the
objection.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Yes, and there was considerable discussion on it. It was gone into
fully.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I think it but
fair to confirm what the chairman of the committee has just said. "Machinery" struck
every member as rather peculiar, and the
right honourable leader of the Government
immediately questioned the use of the word.
On reference to counsel it was found to be
the language of the convention.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In each case.
Right Hon. Mr. iGRAHAM: Yes; and we
could not very well get away from it. I
wondered, as did several other members of the
committee, what was meant by "rateable
trades." It was explained that though we
might not like the term, it was the language
of the convention and must be accepted. I
am of opinion that a good many terms in the
Bill would noit he there if we were not tied to
the convention. But in fairness this must be
remembered: Pa.rliament would not be passing this legislation if it were not based on the
convention; there would be no authority to
do so. I have never seen any Bill more
thoroughly threshed out in the Banking and
Commerce Committee. It was practically rewritten in order to bring it within the terms
of the convention.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: If the Bill were
referred back, I do not know what the committee could do but reaffirm its report.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I am only asking
that further considenation of the Bill be held
until some time on Tuesday. Then if our
represenitations would not justify the right
honourable leader of the House or the chairman of the committee in recommending any
changes, the Bill woruld have to be adopted in
its present form.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If it were
earlier in the session I would not hesitate
to accomnodate the honourable gentleman,
but -I do not want this legislation fto be held
here and so have the other House unnecessarily
crowded. My apprehension in this regard may
bu entirely wrong. I have no direct intimation of there being any hurry to get the Bill
in the Commons. I had intended to move
adjournment of the Senate until Tuesday. I
frankly say I cannot be here on Monday; I
have an important engagement that I must
keep. However, I will meet the convenience
of the honourable senator from Parkdale to
the extent of remaining over to-morrow if the
House is agreeable. Then we can discuss the
Bill in Committee of the Whole after the
honourable senator and I have had a full
opportunity to ascertain from Mr. Moore
whether there is aniy real difficulty. To refer
this Bill back to the Banking and Commerce
Committee would be an intimation that we
are net satisfied with it. I particularly want
to see Mr. Moore and discuss with him
whefther the Bill can be improved. My
recollection is that he was present when the
committee dealt with the Bill, but of that I
am net absolutely certain. I remember the
honourable senator from Parkdale was net
the whole discussion.
present
<during

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Would not the right
honourable leader give us one further opportunity to discuss the word "machinery"? It
is used so often, and apparently it means one
thing in one place and another thing in
another place. Why cannot a definition be
given te it?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It covers more
than one thing.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The word
could be defined, but, in my judgment, if the
honourable member understood the position
as I do he would be the last one te wish for
a definition, because he woul:d be endangering this measure. He may be right that where
"machinery" is used in, say-

JUNE 6, 1935
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Take the first three
lines on page 2 of the amendiments.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable meinber is referring to clause 4:
The Governor in Council may on the recommendation of the Minister create, and by regulation provide for the operation by or under the
Minister of, machinery whereby minimum rates
of wages can be fixed for workers employed in
rateable trades.
Here is the convention. I will show him why
we were compelled to do just what we are
doing in this clause. The convention is headedi,
"Draft convention concerning the creation of
minimum wage fixing machinery.", The word
"machinery" appears in the title and recurs
all through the convention.
It will be apparent to honourable members
on reference to article 1 of 'the convention why
we define rateable trades. The article reads:
Each Member of the International Labour
Organization which ratifies this convention
undertakes to create or maintain machinery
whereby minimum rates of wages can be fixed
for workers employed in certain of the trades
or parts of trades (and in particular in home
working trades) in which no arrangements
exist for the effective regulation of wages by
collective agreement or otherwise and wages
are exceptionally low.
We group all those together and call them
rateablIe trades, and we define rateable trades
exactly as the term is defined there. What we
do is dictated to us by the convention. We
follow it with such slavish exactness se there
may be no possible vulnerability in our legislation.
The word "machinery" occurs again in
article 3:
Each Memiber which ratifies this convention
shall be free te decide the nature and form of
the minimum wage fixing machinery, and the
methods to be fbllowed in its operation:
Provided that,
(1) Before the machinery is applied in a
trade or part of trade, representatives of the
employers and workers concerned, including
representatives of their respective organizations, if any, shall be consulted as well as any
other persons, being specially qualified for the
purpose by their trade or functions, whom the
competent authority deems it expedient to
consult.
That will be found worked into this Bill.
Article 3 continues:

(2) The employers and workers concerned
shall be associated in the operation of the
machinery, in such manner and to such extent.

but in any case in equal numbers and on equal
terms, as may be determined by national laws
or regulations;
and so on all through. I undertake te give
to the honourable member the basic parallel

345

article in the convention for every clause of

this Bill.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Black was agreed
te.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall the
Bill, as amended, be read a third time?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Even yet I
will agree te defer third reading until temorrow if the honourable senator from Parkdale se desires. If not, we had better proceed
with third reading now, in order that the Bill
may be sent to the other House. There are
se many amendments, affecting nearly all the
clauses, that if Mr. Moore or the honourable
senator or others interested feel there is any
error te be rectified or improvement made,
there will be ample opportunity te discuss it
in the other House.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
third reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed te, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.
SUPPLEMENTARY PUBLIC WORKS
CONSTRUCTION BILL
CONSIDERED

IN

COMMI1rTEE

On motion of Right Hon. Mr. Meighen,
the Senate went into Committee on Bill 63,
an Act to create employment by public works
and undentakings throughout Canada and te
authorize the guarantee of certain railway
equipment securities.
Hon. Mr. Gillis in the Chair.
Section 1 was agreed te.
On section 2-authority to execute and complete works:
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Is there any
description of what the equipment is to be?
I cannot lay my hands on the Bill at the
moment.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I did net give
a general review of the Bi-l yesterday: perhaps
I should do so now. It is recited that in
pumuance of a previous Act certain public
works aggregating approximately $30,000,000
are under construction, and' that certain other
public works should be undertaken.
By clause 2 authority is given te execute
and complete the works speci6ed in schedule
A, but it is provided that as far as is
practicable and consistent with reasonable efficiency and eonomy first consideration shall

346

SENATE

be given to local workmen, with pueference to
unemployed ex-service men and unemployed
married men and single men with dependents.
Clause 3 provides for acquisition of the
necessary lands.
Clause 4 provides for an appropriation, not
to exceed $18,000,000, exclusive of obligations
for railway equipment as provided for in
clause 9.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That is what
I had in mind.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We shall come
to that later. That is in addition to the
$18,000,000.
Clause 5 provides for the supervision of any
individual work or works by such Minister
as may be deemed appropriate.
Clause 6 provides that tenders shall be asked
for, except as set out in clause 7. Where the
Governor in Council is of opinion that the
work is of such a nature that it would be
injurious to the public interest to proceed by
tender, or that it could be more beneficially
executed under the direct supervision and control of the officers and employees of the department, there must be a certificate of the
chief or assistant chief engineer or architect
in charge of the work for the department.
As to clause 7, I was asked yesterday by the
honourable the leader on the other side (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) what would be contained in
the certificate. The question is a most
pertinent one. I do not see after a careful
reading of the clause, that the certificate
need contain any specific information. If the
engineer were to certify that there were 365
davs in the year, that would be a compliance
with the clause. The clause should be
amended to indicate what the certificate is te
cover.
In section 7 there is this proviso:
Provided that in the case of any one work
the cost of which is estinated to be less than
fifteen thousand dollars, the Minister of the
Departnent in charge of such work may proeeed witi such work under the direction of
sueh Minister or Department.
I do not know why the word "one" is used in
line 42. I suppose it means any single work
where the cost is under the sum mentioned.
Hon. Mr. BLACK:

Anv individual work.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Yes, any
one specified.
Clause 8 provides for the employment of
such assistants as may be necessary.
In clause 9 there is a sort of doubleheaded provision whereby the Governor in
Council may guarantee principal and interest
of securities the proceeds of which will be
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

used for the purpose of acquiring or repairing equipment for either of the large railways, and, further, the Governor in Council
may pay interest on bonds so guaranteed,
without recourse, for a period, of two years.
In the case of the Canadian National it
may be extended. This is a means of providing work by merely furnishing, out of
the treasury, two years' interest on the cost
instead of the whole of the capital required.
Emphasis is laid on the necessity of providing for the continuance, and against the dismantling, of our present equipment shops.
Both railways definitely say that this is
essential, because their own equipment plants
can provide them with only certain parts of
the equipment necessary.
Therefore it is
the part of wisdom, if it can be done at
not too great a cost, to see that these outside equipment plants are not dismantled.
There is provision for the form of guarantee, -and the Governor in Council may insist on security, as against that guarantee,
from each of the railroads. Then it is provided that, in lieu of that method, equipment may be purchased and leased to the
railroads at a fair rental, except for the first
two years. during which there may be no
rental. That is merely another way of
accompli'shing the same en'd. Whichever
method is more economical will, I presume,
be adopted.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: What is the
equipment te be-cars or locomotives?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
I presume
it would ho both, and also, in the first case,
that repairs to existing equipment would be
covered. Of course, repairs could not be included under the alternative plan.
Clause 10 contains a provision whereby
orossings are to be made safer for 'the public.
The distribution of the cost will be determined by the Governor in Council, and the
Government will establish a fund to be
dirawn upon, under certain conditions, to the
extent of the share assessed to the Government. The distribution could not be made
by the Railway Commission in accordance
with the usual method, or the legislation of
1928, for the reason that you could net now
get municipalities to assume their share, and
consequently you would just be blocked.
Furthermore, the process of sceuiring the
approval of the Railway Commission, even
if the municipalities were ready to share in
the cost, would be a very slow one.
Clause 11 merely provides that all Orders
in Council made under the provisions of this
Act shall be laid before Parliament within
the specified time; and clause 12 provides

JUNE 6, 1935
that a full report of everything that has been
done shall be made within thirty days of the
beginning of the session.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Can my right honourable friend say why the preamble refers to
the 1934 Act? Why is it necessary?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I presume
it is by way of historical backiground.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: The 1934 Act is
referred to in item 10 of the scheduie.
Right Hon. Mr. MEI3GHEN: Yes. There
is an additional reason for the reference to
the Public Works Construction Act in the
preamble. Paragraph 10 of the qchedule
reads as follows:
Alterations, improvements and additions to
public buildings and to supplement where
necessary, upon the authority of the Governor
in Council, specific amounts provided in the
schedule to the Public Works Construction
Act, 1934, $4,000,000.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I am not just
sure how this will work out in regard to rolling stock. The method of financing the purchase of rolling stock is entirely different
from that applied to the financing of any
other part of the railways' borrowings.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: If I remember
rightly, you issue bonds for rolling stockRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Equipment
bonds.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: -and you
pay down twenty-five per cent of the principal,
and the lenders of the money take rolling stock
as security for the balance, so much of which is
to be paid off every year.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGiHEN: Lien agreements.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That system
will not apply in this case.
Right Hon. 'Mr. MEIGHEN: No, I should
not think that system would be applied at
all.
Section 2 was agreed to.
Sections 3 to 6, inclusive, were agreed to.
On section 7-cases in which tenders may
not be required:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: 1 would put
after the word "certificate" in line 36 the
words "as to the wisdom of such recommendation made by," and strike out the
word "of."
The amendment was agreed to.

347

The CHAIRMAN: Are you going to
change the word "one" in the proviso?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I suppose it
will do.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It could not
be misconstrued.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It struck me
that the Minister could pick out any one
work, but he could not do it again. We will
leave it as it is.
Section 7, as amended, was agreed to.
Sections 8 to 12, inclusive, were agreed to.
On schedule A:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I will give
any particulars that may be desired as to
any of these items. I have the particulars
here.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: We are sure
of the Toronto tunnel, are we?
Right Hon. Mr. MEI'GHEN: I notice it is
not described as the "Island Tunnel."
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That is the
tunnel that is referred to here, of course.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, yes. It
is not built yet.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: There may be
a lot of weary wai.ting.
The schedule was agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed to.
The Bill was reported, as amended.
THIRD READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
third reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.
PATENT BILL
CONCURRENCE IN COMMONS

AMENDMENTS

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved concurrence in the amendments made by the
House of Commons to Bill A, an Act to
amend and consolidate the Acts relating to
Patents of Invention.
He said: As I explained yesterday, these
amendments are not consequential in the
sense that they substantially alter the Bill
as it emerged from our Banking and Commerce Committee.
The most important
amendment is made on page 7, lines 16 to 26,
where clause 2 is struck out and a rewording
substituted. After reading it I cannot see
that it alters the meaning. The same state-

348

SENATE

ment applies generally to the other amendiments. There arc six in all. This is fairly
satisfactory in relation to a Bill thirty-five
pages in length and of great complexity.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I agree with
my right honourable friend. There is only
one question in my mind. In the beginning
there was so much discussion, with such
difference of opinion on maiy points, between the Secretary of State and the men
interested in the patent business, that I think
we ought to be careful to see that the agreements reached in committee are not overridden, even by the House of Commons.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: On the main
subject of contention. where the committee
acted against the advice of the Minister, there
has been no change.
The motion was agreed to.

Seminary of Learning of the Sisters of Charity
at Ottawa, Canada.-Hon. Mr. Coté.
Right Hon. Mr. MIEIGHEN.

SUSPENSION

OF RULE

Hon. Mr. COTE moved:
That Rule 119 be suspended in so far as it
relates to the Bill intituled: "An Act to inceorporate The Commnnity, General Hospital,
Alms House and Seminary of Learning of the
Sisters of Charity at Ottawa, Canada."
le said: The purpose of my motion is to
enable this Bill to come before the Committee
on Miscellaneous Private Bills without going
through the formality of posting for seven
days. If the Bill had to be posted for seven
days it could hardly reach the committee
before the end of the session.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
Would the honcurable senator kindly let us know what the
Bill is about?
Hon. Mr. COTE: It is simply a Bill to
give federal incorporation to the community
commonly known as the Grey Nuns. They
have been incorporated for many years. The
first Act of incorporation was passed by the
Legislature of the old Province of Canada
in, I think, 1849. That Act was amended
from time to time. Recently, when it was
found necessary to amend it further, counsel
on behalf of the corporation advised that
there was great doubt as te the legality of
an amendment by this Parliament of the Act
passed by the old Province of Canada. So
the petition for such an amendment was
withdrawn and a new petition, seeking federal
incorporation, was filed. The chief purpose
of this Bill is to change the provincial incorporation to a federal incorporation, and
to re-enact, to all intents and purposes, the
provincial statute.
The motion was agreed to.

JUVENILE DELINQUENTS BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Right Hon. Mr. Meighen, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill L2, an
Act to amend the Juvenile Delinquents Act.
Hon. Mr. Gillis in the Chair.
On section 1-summary trials:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will the right
honourable gentleman tell us how the Act is
modified by this clause? The new words are
"save as provided in section thirty-three hereof." I do not know of any explanation having
been given by my right honourable friend on
the second reading.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: I have before me section 33 of the Act, which would be
repealed and replaced by clause 3 of this Bill.
As regards clause 1, I have a letter from Mr.
W. L. Scott, K.C., who, as everyone knows, is
a citizen actively interested in the law on
this subject and particularly in its enforce-

349

ment by the proper authorities. He writes as
follows in explanation of the change desired:
Referring to our conversation of yeeterday,
you will recall the amendments to subsections
2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of section 215 of the Criminal
Code, which gave so much trouble in 1933. You
will find the subsections as amended in section
3 of chapter 53 of the statutes of that year,
23-24 George V. As I mentioned to you, Mr.
Humphries, Deputy Attorney-General in Ontario, considered subsection 3 obscure in meaning, and otherwise unsatisfactory, and owing
to bis opinion it has not so far been made any
use of.
Right Hon. Mr. Bennett, at the time when
the last amendments were adopted, told Miss
Whitton if the section as amended did not
work, to come back to him and he would ses
that it was further amended, but both he and
the Minister of Justice are now, I believe, too
ill to give the matter attention.
I therefore enclose, for your consideration, a
proposed new subsection 3, which, as I told
you yesterday, has been submitted to Mr.
Humphries and approved of by him. If you
can see your way to having this substituted this
session for the subsection 3 adopted two years

ago, I will appreciate it very much indeed.
So honourable members will see that
clause 1 is introduced merely because of the
obscuri'ty of the present Act. The only
change that this clause would make is found
in lines 19 and 20, where these new words
are inserted:
save as provided in section thirty-three hereof.
That is to say, there is no change at all
down to the word " adult," at the end of
line 18, which is the end of the main part
of the clause. All that is changed is the
proviso, which hitherto has read:
Provided further, that section one thousand
one hundred and forty of the Criminal Code
shall, mutatis mutandis, apply to all proceedings in the Juvenile Court.
Section 1140 covers nearly two pages, and
I do not need to read the whole of it. I
will read merely enough to give the House
the purport:
No prosecution for an offence against this
Act, or action for penalties or forfeiture, shall
be commenced
(a) after the expiration of three years -from
the time of its commission if such offence be
(i) treason ...
(b) after the expiration of two years from
its commission if such offence be
(i) a fraud upon the Government ...
(ii) a corrupt practice in municipal
affairs ...

(iii) unlawfully solemnizing marriage ...
(c) after the expiration of one year from
its commission if such offence be
(i) opposing reading of Riot Act ...
(d) after the expiration of six months from
its commission if the offence be
(i) unlawful drilling ...
(e) after the expiration of three months
from its commission if the offence be
(i) cruelty to animals ...

350

SENATE

(f) after the expiration of one month from
its commission if the offence be improper use
of offensive weapons under sections one hundred and sixteen and one hundred and eighteen
to one hundred and twenty-four inclusive.
2. No person shall be prosecuted, under the
provisions of section seventy-four or seventyeight of this Act, for any overt act of treason
expressed or declared by. open and advised
speaking un-less information of such overt act,
and of the w-ords by which the same was
expressed or declared, is given upon oath to a
justice within six days after the words are
spoken and a warrant for the apprehension of
the offender is issued within ten days after
such information is given.
Now, one of these clauses for the limitation
of action would apply to the prosecutions
referred to in this Juvenile Delinquents Act.
But the proviso in clause 1 of the Bill says:
Provided further, that save as provided in
section thirty-three iereof, section one thousand one hundred and forty of the Criminal
Code shall, mutatis mutandis, apply to all proceedings in the Juvenile Court.
That is to say, the limitation of actions, as
provided for in the general section of the Code,
applies in respect of actions to be taken in
the juvenile courts, except as provided in
section 33 of the Juvenile Delinquents Act.
The real effect is that hereafter the only limitation with respect to prosecutions under the
Juvenile Delinquents Act shall be as follows:
(1) Any person, whether the parent or
guardian of the child or not, who, knowingly
or wilfully,
(a) aids, causes, abets or connives at the
commission by a child of a delinquency; or
(b) does any act producing, promoting, or
contributing to a childs being or becoming a
juvenile delinquent or likely to make any chilýd
a juvenile delinquent;
shall be liable on suimmary conviction...
(2) Any person who, being the parent or
guardian of the child and being able te do se,
knowingly neglects to do that which would
directly tend to prevent said child being or
becoming a juvenile delinquent or to reiove
the conditions which render or are likely to
render said child' a juvenile delinquent shall
be liable on sumiary conviction ...
(3) The Court or magistrate may postpone
or adjouirn the hearing of a charge under this
section for such periods as the Court may deem
advisable or may postpone or adjourn the hearng sine die and may impose conditions upon
any person found guilty under this section and
suspend sentence subject te such conditions, and
on proof at any time that such conditions have
been violated may pass sentence on such person.
This means that there will be no limitation
at all as to the time at which a prosecution
may be entered, and wide power is given to the
magistrate to make postponements and to impose conditions ipon any person found guilty.
I must say I am quite clear as to what the
Act means in its present form, which Mr.
Humphries could not understand, but I am
utterly bewildered as to what it will mean
if this new section passes.
Right Hon Mr. MIEIGHEN.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am sorry to
find that this Bill, which originated in our
Chamber, is not accompanied by a brief explanation such as our rule calls for. The only
explanatory note is:
The words underlined in the text of the Bill
are new.
We take it for granted that they are; but if
that particular section which is meant to apply
had been succinctly set out in the explanatory
notes, my right honourable friend would not
have had to delve into the statute.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: But we all know that
the sponsor of the Bill means well.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I depended
upon that. I sent his suggestions to the Department of Justice and found that they were
approved. The situation is this, as I understand. The Juvenile Delinquents Act, section
33, gives certain privileges to the magistrate
as to adjournment and conditional release.
The amendment says that the provisions of
the Criminal Code respecting procedure shall
apply to prosecutions under section 33, but
subject to these special privileges given the
magistrate under such section.
I move that the committee rise and report
progress.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Would the right
honourable gentleman explain why this session we are so frequently amending the Criminal Code? Has the country under the present regime become so bad that such amendments are absolutely necessary?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The country
is so enthusiastic over the fact that our penitentiaries are half empty that it is urging us
to keep up the good work.
Progress was reported.
CRIMINAL

CODE BILL

CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Right Hon. Mr. Meighen,
the Senate went into Committee on Bill M2,
an Act to amend the Criminal Code.
Hon. Mr. Gillis in the Chair.
On section 1-irrebuttable presumption:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The original
subsection is set out in the explanatory notes.
The proposed changes are underlined in the
amending section. The intention of the amendment is to except a certain case-a case which

JUNE 11, 1935

was under discussion when a similar amendment

was last before

us.

This exception

reads:
Provided that this'subsection shall fot apply
in the case of two persona who, though in fact
living in adultery, are living together as man
and wife and are reputed so to be and where
the chid so affeoted is the chulld, of sucli union.

I cannot compliment the diraftsman. It has
been pointed out to me by the honourable
senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. McMeans)
how hopelessly wrong in meaning this proviso
is. The two persona would not be living in

adultery if neither was married, and therefore
the Criminal Code would not apply. Then do
the words "are reputed se to be" refer to
their living together or to their being man
and wif e?

Probably the meaning intended is,

they are reputed to be living together as man
and wife. Anu amendmnent lias, been prepared
by the honourable senator to, al'ter thse wording.
Hon. Mr. M'URDOCK: Is not this Bill
predicated upon the passing of Bill L2, which
was before Commîttee of the W'hole a few
minutes ago?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGEEN: Oh, no. The
two are associated, but this Bill would be of
value even thougli the Juvenile IJelinquents
Act were net amended as proposed by the
other Bill.
Hon. Mr. McMEA.NS: Honourable senators, I move the following amendment:
Strike out ail the worda after the word
"1provided" in the sixteenth line and substitute

the following:
Provided that this 4subsection shall not apply
in the case of two persona who are net married
te each other, but are living together ais man
and wif e and reputed to be mean and wif e, and
where the chil'd s0 affected is the chi'ld of the
two persons se living together or either of
them.
1 have adidied the words "or either of them"
because I thin'k it would be zeasonable s0
te extend the proviso.
'Right Hon. Mr. MEIGEEN: When the
honourab.e member showed, me the amend"ment I made no objection, bu.t it strikes me
now that the addition of the words "or
either of these" is da.ngerous. Suppose some
woman with a child chooses te lýive with a
man in a most. demoralizi-ng manner: the
Children's Aid Society would- be powerless to
rescue the chuld. If thse sean and woman are
the parents, the child shoul'd reýmain witli
them; but I wouli net say that the child
should be left with the mother if she is
behaving as I have d-esori'bed. I arn afraid
the main purpos of the section weuld be
de'feated.

Hon. M'r. McMEANS:

351
I cannot see the

distinction. Take a man whýo lias a child';
lie gees te live with a weman, and she keeps
lieuse for him. I think h.e is entitled) te the
custody of lis child. He is bound- to provide
it with tlie necessitioe of làle and educate it.
We koow that throughout the leingth and
breadtl of this country there are many unmarried couples living together as hiband
and wife, m.any of tliem in good society, tee.
I have liad experience and I lcnow it.
Some Hon. SE4NAffORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mir. MoMEANS: Well, net personally. MVen and women are living' together
without geing through the form. of marriage.
They could go before a ceunty court judge
snd get married, but some of thein think
there is ne neeessity to do se. They are
living together as respectable members of
Society. The father of a child, thougli living with a wornan other th-an it.s mother, is
entitled! te the custedy of that child, just the
same as if it we're their joint offspring.
Hon. Mr. M'URDOOCK: Will the honourable gentleman reverse the situation and
th-en argue the point?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS.: Ne.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCR: Suppose the
weman had a child and, as the rigit, honourable leader of the H-ouse lias said, she takea
a man te live with lier.
Hon. Mr. MeMEAiNS': She is providing
for ber cbild--the man she is living with is
supporting her and the child. I do not see
why there should lie any distinction draÀwn
between týhe ehild of both persons and thie
child of one of these. I cannot fellow the
reasening of the right honourable leader in
that respect.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The point raised
by the honourable member frese W.innipeg
(Hon. Mr. MeMeans) is worth considering. I agreé with hiým that the condition
described dees exîst.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Where?
Hon. Mr. CAILDER: Ail over thse country. Men and wemen have been living tegether for years without getting married.
They are net vicieus; they a.re good-living
people, except fer net being inarried. Suppose the mean or the weman happens te, have
a dhild and, later they decîde 'te live together.
After they have been living together for six
or eight years, is the Child'ren's Aid Society
te have the riglit te step in and. take th-at
child away? If the chuld is the child of such
union, the section dees net appJy; but in

SENATE
the case I have cited, where a man and
woman are living together peaceably as
decent citizens-you may say as man and
wife-the child is to be taken away from
them. I doubt the wisdom o-f it.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX:
Apart from the
question of morality, I shou'ld like to know
from
the
righb
honourable
gentleman
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), who is thoroughly familliar with our criminal law,
whether a man and woman living together,
but not in the bondis of matrimony, can
establish a. legal domicile.
Right fIon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Whether the
couple are legally married or not does not,
I think, affect the question of domicile in any
province. Domicile is determined by other
factors altogether. I may point out that under
the section the case wbich the honourable
senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. McMeans)
has in mind would not be a reason for taking
the child away. I have to admit that the
section provides an exception only where the
child is the child of the couple living together
as man and wife. In the case referred to by
the honourable senator from Winnipeg (Hon.
Mr. MeMeans) and the honourable senator
from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder), adultery
is not a necessary element in the situation.
If neither of the parties is narried, under the
law there is no adultery. Consequently we
have to assume that what Mr. Scott intended
by the amendment did not contemplate that
in such a case the child should be taken away;
but I am inclined to think Mr. Scott did not
apprehend the full meaning of the amendment.
I do not suppose he would be satisfied to
allow a child living in such circumstances as
have been described by my honourable friends
to be put beyond the pale of the Children's
Aid Society. I do not think it was ever intended that the child of a woman who deliberately went to live with a man not her
husband should remain under her control
without being in some way subject to the
control of the Children's Aid Society. I should
be in favour of the amendment moved by the
honourable senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
MeMeans) if he would leave out the words
or the child of one of them."
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Honourable
members, the breaking up of a family, even
if that family does not comply with our
matrimonial laws, is a serious matter, and
you cannot justify it simply because you do
it by statute. The Children's Aid Society in
Ontario is a very enthusiastic organization, but
it is possible for it to go beyond what is best
in the interests of the children, and even of
the parents.
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

Years ago I learned a lesson from Sir Wilfrid Laurier in regard to matters of this
kind, and ever since I have been somewhat
chary of legislation which breaks up a family,
and depends for its justification on the conduct of a man or woman, or both of them.
The Moral Reform Association, as you know,
is composed mostly of clergymen. A deputation of that body came down to interview Sir
Wilfrid Laurier. I happened to be with him.
The deputation asked two things: first, that
legislation be passed to make adultery a
crime; and second, that horse-racing be curtailed. I well remember Sir Wilfrid Laurier
turning to me and saying: " George, perhaps
we can meet them part way on horse-racing,
but I am not so sure about the other." I
thought the remark a strange one, but Sir
Wilfrid explained to me that in thousands of
families, some of them even in the province of
Quebec, the parents had never been married.
Men and women in remote sections, where a
priest or a clergyman would come perhaps
only once in a year, had lived together and
raised families. Many of those families were
thoroughly respectable; some of them occupied
some of the highest positions in the country.
When I went home I made some inquiries
and found two or three such families in my
own county. The point stressed was that
legislation of the kind asked for would enable
busybodies to declare illegitimate whole
families, and even second generations of
families, who had ahvays thought they were
legitimate. Another phase was perhaps just
as alarming, namely, that such legislation
would enable a community of blackmailers to
prey upon respectable people by threatening
to expose them as having committed the crime
named in the law while, morally, they had
comnitted no such crime. These blackmailers
would be able to follow such people to hotels,
ascertain how they registered, and then start
action against them.
This is a delicate subject. I think it is a
good thing to give the Children's Aid Society
all the power necessary to rescue children who
are liable to be contaminated; but in giving
them that power we shall have to be discreet
in order ta prevent the breaking up of the
family, as pointed out by the honourable
senator from Winnipeg, when it would be a
much greater crime than loaving the children
where they were.
Some of these unions,
though not legitimate, are respectable, and I
am not sure that man-made moral laws should
override all the rights of our citizens.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: There is another
classical case that we should be careful about.
Let us assume that the woman has married
a man and borne him a child, that the man

JUNE 11, 1935
turns out to be a very vicious character, and
that, in the course of three years or so, either
he leaves her or she must leave him. He
disappears. She then becomes acquainted
with another man, and with her child she
goes to live with him. In so doing she commits adultery. What is to become of that
child? Is the law to say that the child in a
home such as referred to by the right honourable senator from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr.
Graham) is to be taken away from its mother?
I do not think it should.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The case my
honourable friend has just given was in my
mind when he rose. During my practice at
the Bar I came across one or two cases in
which a man had assumed the responsibility
of caring for a woman and her child, and had
become a very good father to the child, and
it was only when it became necessary to produce a certificate in order to marry that the
child discovered the true situation of affairs.
It would seem that there is cause for reflection, because under the Act as it is-and the
Bill would not improve the situation-the
society is allowed to take a child away from
one who has been its protector and a good
father for fifteen or twenty years. The Act
says:
In any prosecution under subsection two of
this section, that the child was in danger of
being or becoming immoral, its morais injuriously affected and its home rendered an
unfit place for it to be inMust all of those conditions obtain before the
magistrate is entitled to take the child away,
or is any one of them sufficient to establish
an irrebuttable presumption? If all of them
are necessary there is some protection for
the child; but if cohabitation alone is
sufficient, I think we had better pause and
ask ourselves if the Act cannot be revised
in sueh a way as to enlarge the discretion of
the magistrate.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Proof of any
one would be sufficient.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAjND: Then there
would be very great hardship to the child in
cases such as those to which I have referred.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Would the
child be the child of one of the two persons,
or of both?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Of one.
Right Hon. Mr. M'EIGHEN: Then I think
the amendment of the honourable senator
from Winnipeg should carry, if the argument is good.

353

The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: It is moved
that al] the words after the word "provided"
in the sixteenth line be struck out, and that
the following be substituted:
Provided that this subsection shall not apply
in the case of two persons who are not married
to each other, but are living as man and wife
and reputed to be man and wife, and where
the child so affected is the child of the two
persons so living together or either of them.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
suppose I have the right to moive an amendment to the amendment, but I may say that
I should be prepared to accept the amendment proposed if the last four word were
struck out. Otherwise, I .am afraid that it
would be beyond the power of the Children's
Aid Society to rescue the child of one of the
parents, even though its surroundings were,
in the opinion of the society, detrimental to
its wellbeing. It must be presumed that
the Children's Aid Society will not interfere
if the home is a respectable one, such as bas
been desoribed by the honourable senator
from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder) and the
right honourable gentleman from EganviHe
(Right Hon. Mr. Graham). The purpose
of the society is to look after homes that are
not of that character, and dhdldren who are
in danger of being demoralized. Consequently, we can probabdy depend upon the
nembers of that organization not to act as
mere busybodies. They have enough to do
in looking after bad cases without interfering
in cases where no improvement can be made.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would suggest to my right honourable fmiend that we
suspend consideration of this Bill in order
to see if sme disoretion cannot be granted to
the magistrate, and this expression, "It shall
be an irrebuttable presumption"Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: That is governed
by the words "upon proof." You muÊt give
the magistrate a chance to exercise his judgment. These facta must be proven. A
judge would not interfere with the status
of the child unless they were.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But I draw
attention to the fact that if one of the conditions appears to be established, for instance the cohabitation of the two persons,
it is an irrebuttable presumption that there
is danger of the child being or becoming
immoral, or its morals be.ing injuriously
affected. What troubles me is the fact
that the establishment of cohabitation alone
creates an irrebuttable presumption.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I quite agree as to
the point raised by my right honourable
leader (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen). It seema

to me that somne provision sh.ould be made
to the effect, that something -more than mere
cohabitation should have te be proveni; for
instance, that the home is tota.hy undesirable.

Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Hear, hear.
Huon. Mr. CALDER: The me-re fact that
there is proof of cohabitation should not be
sufficient grouind for taking away the child.

INCOME

WAR TAX BILL

SECOND R<EADING

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGIIEN moved
the second reading of Bill 8(ý, an Act to
amend the Inceme War Tax Act.
H1e said: Honourable members, the tuagie
purpose cf thîis Bihl is written in almost eveuy
pauagraph.
It adds to the list cf incemes
appearing in pauaguapha A of tbe Firat SoheduIc of the Income War Tax Act of 1932-33
those set out in the table undeu pauagraph

AA of the Bill. It imposes a tax of two peu
cent on incomes of from $5,000 te $10,000;
thuce peu cent on incomes of from $10,000
te $14,000, and se on.
Under clause 2 of the Bill. pauagraph C,

the corporation tax is increased fuom 1212 peu
cent to 131 peu cent; itnd under paraguaph

is a eonsolidated balance sheet of the p îrFrt

coropany and its subsidiaries there i.. au
increase frorn 1312 per cent to 15 per cent.
The rcason is that if balance sheets and
reports are macde separatelv by constituent
companies of the organization, tho;se tii t
make money will hav e to pay the tax. w ile
those that do flot make money will flot hav e
to pay it, biu in the censolidated baîlance
sheet the loser is set off against the wimier,
and in that way the assessment is reduced.
As an offset to that advantage the rate is
increased to 15 per cent by this paragraph D.
In clause 3 a distinction is drawn foi, the
first time in ýCanada between earned and
unearned income. Earned income is dc-ýcibled
in pauagraph (m) as meaning salary. wag-es,
and so forth. Everything in excess of S14.000
is unearned income. Earncd income up to,
$14.000 is put in a favoured position.
Would a
Right Hon. Mu. GRAHAM:
senator's ind.emnity be classed as earnied ou
uneauned inceme?
Righit Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: That would
be earned income. In this respect 1 miay say
that while I suppose there are manv cas.es
wheue a distinction can be made, 1 cannot
becorne very enthusiastie about the x irtue
of a distinction. If a man works liard ail bis
life and accuimulate.s7 somnething fromn wlich
he cani draw an income, it is pretty sev ere to
tell Iiixn that lie did flot earn that income.
Nevcrtheless it appears to be the habit of
I fln sîîme
to distinguish.
other couintirse
there are cases whiere through inheritatice
men have incomes xvhich they do not earn,
and in such cases there possibly is, justification
for drawing a distinguishing line. Perhaps on
the whole the best compromise is to say tlîat
income up to a certain anîounit shall le considered in one class. and income abox e that
in another class. Tlîat is wihat this Bihl does
in providing that incomes over $14.000 shall
be uated as uneauned.
Paragraph (o), which will be new paragraph.
(o) of section 2 of the Act, provides that
interest paid by a company on an ixîcome
debenture shahl be regarded in just the same
light as a dividend paid on stock. I tlîink
that is quite rigbt. So that honourable members wiIlI sec the real effeet, I xvill give this
explanation. A company has a bond issue,
a pueferred stock issue and a common stock
issue-the usual set-up; there are many complications. The interest on the bond issu.re
is obligatory; it is a mandatouy charge, and
in estimating the company's profits this
interest is deducted. But any dividend which
may be paid on pueferued stock is not deducted; that is net a charge against the comnpany, and the company bas the option of

JUNE 11, 1935
paying it or flot, if it is earned. New let us
say that a company h-as a bond issue, with
obligatory interest, but instead of issuing
preferred stock its directors say: "We would
not pay any dividends on sueh stock unless
they were earned. So why flot issue inceme
debentures instead and provide that they
shall pay 6 per cent, but only if the 6 per
cent is earned?" In other words, tbe incomne
debentures would really be preferred stock,
but under the present Act interest paid on
such income ýdebentures bas been deducted
from earnings. Se the company escaped taxation on its earnings which, in effeet, went
out as preferred stock dividends.
This amendment would prevent any evasion of that kind. There are provisions for
special cases, where bonds did exist and bave
been converted into income bonds in order
to enable a company to carry on. There are
many such instances with respect to concerns wbich bave got into financial difficulties. The Minister can rule that the
interest paid on such income bonds may be
deducted from earnings. This is quite right.
Every honourable member knows that during these times the companies are legion
whicb bave been reorganized and have given
income debentures or income bonds in place
of bonds on whicb interest was mandatorily
payable. As I say, for such cases exception
is provided.
'Clause 4 excepts the income of religious,
charitable, agricultural and educational institutions. boards of trade and charnbers of
commerce. The income of such institutions
is exempt in the present Act, and the only
dlifference is that this: amnendment makes the
exemption subjeet to the proviso that no
part of the income of the institution, board
of trade or chamber of commerce shaîl go to
the personal profit of, or be paid or payable
te. any proprietor thereof or sharebolder
therein. 'I suppose it is conceivable that
shareholders of a chamber of commerce might
get a dividend. S'hould that bappen in any
case. the income would not escape.
Clause 5 provides further detail as to
exemptions fromn surtax.
Paragraph (i) of clause 6 gives power to the
department-it says to the Minister, but it
will of course be exercised by the Commissioner of Income Tax, Mr. Elliott-to protect the revenue in cases like this. A very
large United States corporation-I could namo
onýý. but I do not want to indicate that any
particular company bas been an offender-has
j subsidiary in Canada. It is to be presumed
that this subsidiary is a profit-making enterprise. Against tbe earnings of the subsidiary
92584-23 J

355

the corporation always charges a certain proportion cf its own overhead, its costs for
engineering, research, supervision and se on.
Suppose it wanted to keep down appai-_nt
earnings of the subsidiary so as to avoid
certain taxes in Canada. It could do se by
over-assessing such charges as I bave mentioned, by making the balance sheat of theCanadian branch bear the burden cf an excessive proportion cf the parent compan<g
expenses. In that way it would deprive the
Canadian treasury cf its fair share of taxes.
This clause enables the Minister týo reviz5e
such charges and reduce them to what lie may
deemn a fair level.
Paragraph (j) cf this clause 6 is designed
te remedy a condition whereby Canada bears
the burden in time cf loss and receives smal
taxes in time of profit.
Paragraph (k) is very important. It deals
witb dividends on income bonds or incomne
debentures, in the distribution cf earnings by
any corporation to holders cf its income bonds
or income debentures. I explained the essence
cf this in my first outlîne.
Clause 7 bas te do with the limitation cf
earned incemes in certain cases. This is
easily understood on reading. It provides
with respect to Canadians a centrol exactly
analagous to that provided in the previcus
clause with respect to American or other
foreign companies.
In order to avoid incorne taxes after this Bill becomes law, wvherr
there is a distinction between earned and unearned inceme, a company wvhich is owned
Iargely by a man and his family might increase the salary cf the man se that lie would
receive his remuneration in the form cf salary
rather than cf dividends.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

That bas been

Riglit Hon. Mir. MEIGiHEN: WeIJ, this
clause will prevéent any escape in that way.

Clause 8 provides that the folloýwing subsection shail be added te section 9 cf the

cf certain copyrights. It is pretty much a
matter cf technical detail.

SENATE

In clause 10 there is a further provision
against evasion in the case of non-resident
companies.
Clause 11 has to be kept in mind in respect of a point which I know will come
before the oommittee when this Bill is referred to it. The clause amends section 12
of the Act by adding this subsection:
For the purposes of this Act any anoma
amounit -received in respeet of an ineome bond
or income debenture shall be deemed to be a
dividend.
And there is a clause later on, No. 16, which
reads:
Sections one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, ten, eleven, twelve and thirteen of this
Act shall be applicable to incone of the 1934
taxation period and fiscal periods ending therein
and of .al suiseq-uent periods.
As I read the Bill, I received the impression
th a t the effect of clause 16 and other clauses
to which I have referred is to provide that
what was paid in 1934 as interest on an income debenture shall be considered as having
been paid in 1934 as a dividend and therefore shall be taxable. Of course, most legislation of this kind is retroactive, but this
is retroactive in a sense and witih an effect
which are pretty severe.
What clause
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
is my right honourabe friend referring to?
Righit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am calling
attention to the effect of clauses 11 and 16
when read in relation to the income debenture
paragraph at tie end of clause 3.
There is a provision in -clause 12 for an
exception from the 12, per cent deduction.
That is not so important; it is a detail.
Clause 13 'is a further provision with respect to the consolidated returns of unit
companies in an organization entirely owned
or controlled by a parent company.
Clause 14 amends the Act by adding a new
Part XII, which imposes a tax on gifts. This
willi be very interesting to all honourable
menmbers of philanthropie mind. Hereafter
their philanthropy is to be taxed.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: To what extent?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: On gifts
aggregating in a single year 825,000, but not
more, 2 per cent; on gifts between $25,000
and 850.000, 3 per cent; between $50,000
and S100,000, 4 pe, cent. The rate gra.dually
increases until between 8500.000 and $1.000.000
it is 9 per cent, and on gif-ts exceeding
$1.000.000 it is 10 per cent. This tax will
apply to the aggregate gifts in a single year
t
o all persons, outside charitable institutions,
of couirse. But there is an exception. Gifts
aggregating not more than $4,000 in a single
year are not taxable.
R ght

.1EIGHEN

I think this provision for a gift tax is quite
necessary. In our income tax law there is
such a heavy gradation upwards that a head
of a family will sometimes avoid taxation by
distributing some of his assets among other
members of the family, and while the group
as a whole receives perhaps the sarne income
as before, the head bas less and the weight
of supertax is reduced in his case. That kind
of thing bas been pretty well provided against
in previous years by other amendments, but
this amendment is needed aI the present time
because of the distinction drawn between
earned and unearned incomes. All such gifts
are liable to succession duty taxes, the same
as if transfer had been made by will. Gift
taxes are payable when the gift is made, and
if not so paid the tax will bear interest at
the rate of 10 per cent from that time on.
We are all agreed that with the advance
in the unit of capital, the tremendous invasion of machinery into our complex econonic system, and the vast and powerful lever
thereby given to individuals of superior
capacity and enterprise, heavier and still
heavier taxes must fall on the successful. I
<lo not think tiere is any real resistance to
that principle anywhere. But let noue of us
think that there must not be a limit. I am
afraid we in Canada are already losing some
of our heaviest taxpayers. Nevertheless the
country's obligations must be met. And
I am sure it is only the desire of everyone
who has had sone success that such laws
should be enacted as will enable the burden
to be sustained by those who can sustain it, care being taken that legitimate
reward of enterprise, effort and work is not
so far removed that people abandon all
thought of toil, danger and risk rather than
give the whole proceeds of their earnings to
others, and that those who now bave to pay
the largest share of the burden are not driven
away from our land.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: I highiy approve
of the right honourable gentleman's language.

not apply to gifts to universities.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: I woul'd nlot libel

universities, irrespective of creed or language.
Our universities are in a sorry p!ight to-day.
The better endowed arnong themn can continue to function only by exercising the strictest economy. In former years the rich men
of this country gave willingly and generously
to our large institutions of learning. I arn
afraid th-at the sev.erity of ouTr constantly inicreasing taxation will soon deprive us of
those generous donors.
There is another point which I should like
the right honouraible gentleman to explain.
Everybody aecepts the burde.n of taxation,

But it is urged that the end of i.ncreasing

colleet $1,000,000 or more without expending
one cent for radio broadcasting. Wbat is the

Commission is costing $2,000,000 over and
aboya its incane £rom licence feas. I hope
I arn wrong. It is nostinýg the coountry
$2,000,000 anyway. Therefore. instead of reoeiving a revenue -of $1,000,000 a year, we
are paying out $1,000 000. For what? For
ýmaking the Governiment very unpopular

358

SENATE

There is this further danger. It is said that
when French songs and French speeches are
heard over the radio in some parts of
Saskatchewan and in certain Orange lodges
in Onta.rio, ·the auditors become so excited
that there is grave danger of their dying of
apoplexy! The Government might be guilty
of manslaughter, at least. Speaking seriously,
I believe that radio broadcasting should be
put back where it was before it was placed
in the hands of the Radio Commission. It
.s bad enough to have to pay a $2 radio
tax each year, without the Treasury paying
out $1,000,000 annually. I do not think that
is right.
As to the $14,000 income exception, most
incomes have been reduced to one-third of
what they were a few years ago. Then many
men earned much ýmore than $14,000 a year,
anrd maintained their dependents. Now they
have the same dependente to maintain, and
by the time they have cleared expenses they
may have to borrow money to pay income
tax. If those who had a good income, on
paper at least, in the good old dayts when the
Liberals were in power-$or instance, in
January, 1930-now have one-third of what
they were earning then. they think they are
doing well. Therefore I submit tihe exemption should apply to a much higher figure
than $14,000 in justice to those who, as I
sav, formerly had an ample income, but have
not nearly so much to-day and yet have to
meet the same charges to maintain their
dependents.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The right honourable gentleman has given a very illuminating explanation of every clause of the

that business will recover so rapidry as to
wipe ont these recurring deficits. I doubt
it, and I confess one of my grievances against
the Administration is that it is apparently
helpless to do anything to solve the problem.
We are not even told when the Government
expects that it can be solved. If we allow
things to drift as they are now drifting, we
shall have to a.dd fifty, seventy or a hundred
million dollars annually to cover the rerurring deficits; which means that the people
must be asked to pay more taxes to meet
interest on the increaseid load. I wonder i.f

of hope to the taxpayers.

That i recog-

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:-it is an Income Tax Bill. I devote myself first to the

operated exclusively as such and not operated
for the benefit or private gain or profit of
any person, member or shareholder thereof.
Consequenotly the mcasure offers no discouragement to ouir universities. On the contrary. they are put in a favoured class, and
whereas a wealthy man would have to pay
$100,000 on a gift of $1.000.000 to a relative
or friend, to a university it is free of tax.
Thus encouragement of the most distinct and
prartical character is offcred to those able
to make such gifts.
It will be with a consolatory reflection that
honourable members will notice the next
exception:
(d) gifts or donations oade to the Doiniion
of Canada or any Province or political subdivision thereof.
We now know that we shall not have to pay
a tax on any sum of money we give to the
Dominion.
The honourable member from Rougemont
makes a plea against the cost of the Radio
Commission. I cannot come prepared to
answer all possible allegations against Government measures and activities. I do not
think, from my knowledge of the Radio Commission, that there is any loss at all; indeed,
I think there is a revenue to the Commission
over and above all its expenditure, except

JUNE 11, 1935
possibiy certain capital expenditure. Nor do
1 corne prepared to argue in favour of the
principle of publie control of radio broadeastrng through the Radio Commission, as against
the cost of radio service to the people of
Canada when that service is lef t to private
enterprise. But I would recaîl thîs to my
honourable friend. The problern is a most
complicated one, and large considerations are
involved looking to the whole future of this
tremendous new human activity. The problem is involved to a degree flot exceeded perhaps by any other problern facing civilized
communities to-day. Some countries have

that the party which hie represents, and which
lie has adorned for so many years, will. after
perhaps sorne vilification and some questioning. continue the policy of governrnent supervision through a commission similar to that
in existence to-day. There is no danger at
aIl lhat it will depart from, this policy. If

sueh is the hope of my honourable friend, it
will be dashed. 0f course, it will be rnany
years from now before his f riends gain power,

but mark my words now and judge me by
the prediction when the hour cornes.
My honourable friend is very strong also
for econorny. He has always been of that
mood. I cannot hold hirn toi aocount as I
could if hie had been a member -of the late
Government. I have not the least doubt that
in private hie read it ma-ny lectures on the
extravagance of those times. But 1 do plead
that during the past five yearsi of administration the most extensive and severe economies bave been practised. Let him look at
the Civil Service roll and compare it with
what it was. Let hirn look at the subventions
which bave been struek out, and which may
accotint for a certain degrce of unpopularity
which the Governrnent now suffers. Those
are economies. True, 'they have been offset

by new measures, but these are designed to
take care of problemis such as unemployrnent,
fromn which we ca.nnot escape. Truie, the
Canadian National Railways are a heavy
charge. My honourable friends opposite will
please listen while I just rernind thiem that
noV less than $50,000,000 to $60,000,000 of
that charge, or over haîf of it, is due ta
the $M0,000,000 odd of additional capital
poured ino that system. during their nine
ye-ars in office. Intiereot on that sumn
accounts for over haîf. The difficulty is indeed great, and the last $60,000,000 is the
hardest part of it. But that difficulty is anc
for which the honourable gentlemen's friends
have the responsibility, and if the responsibility ghould corne again to themi, as it probably wiIl, far off as it may be, I hope it will
corne to a party chastcned, refornied and
regenerated by long years of suffering and

a reduetion of revenues, both provincial and

is te reverse that teodýency, and to bring the
liquor trade into legitimate ehannels, where
it w~ill be subject to these taxes. This purpose will neyer be iachie'vedý, of course, if

The right honourable gentleman niiglit tell

et conessions being
made by Order in
(Couneil te the ncighhcuring republic il it
gox es us a reductýion cf duty on somr ef our

I draw the attention of the Senate te the
tact thiat in 1879 Sir John A. Maedonald teck
power toe nahle bis Government te deal in
a siouilar manner with concess;ions. shuuld
they ýbe granted by the United ýStatel. In
tact, if my memnory doses net fail me, al
the articles emcbodied in the Reciprocir.y
Traaty ot 1854 were duly enumerated. and the
Dominion Government et thnt da,,y n'as entitled, if the American Gou crnment gave us
reductions on those goods, te grant reiluctions
on American goods. That legisla tien remained on the Statute Bock until. I think,
1889, when it was dropped because Sir John
Macdonald ne longer entertained any hope
cf the United States reducing the duties on
the natural produetýs which we xxanted te
expert.
Perhaps my righit honourable friend would
teiýl us if tliere are any negotiatio-ns taking
place, and what hope there is thiat tihey will
mature.
Right Hon. Mr. MEJGHEN: The boueurable gentleman discusses this clause as if it
were new. I may observe that only the wd
"ýcencessions" in line 8 is new. At least, I
take it te ibe new, because it is underlined.
The tact is that the statute read as follows:
The Governor le Council roay by Order in
Council make such reductiens of duties on

JUNE 11, 1935
goods imported into Canada from any other
country or countries as may be deemed reasonable by way of compensation for reductions on
Canadian products granted 'by any such country
or countries.
It wil} be noted that the change is only at
the end of the clause. Where previously it
said "compensation for reductions on Canadian products granted by any sueh country
or countries," it now reads, "compensation

for concessions granted by any such country
or countries." This, and this alone, is the
difference.
I have not had the time to read the debate
in the other House, but I presume there
could be concessions without reductions. For
example, there might be tariff increases
against our chief cornpetitors, or concessions
by way of quotas. The means of regulating
trade nowadays are so numerous that "reduction" is not a sufficiently wide term to
embrace all the concessions that may be
made.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The removal of restrictions.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: As my honourable friend suggests, the removal of restrictions would be a concession. All that
has been donc is to make wider the power to
give reductions or concessions in return for
concessions, in whatever form they may be.
My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) asks, "What is the progress of
negotiations?" I am leader of the Senate,
not Minister of Finance, Minister of Trade
and Commerce, nor minister of any department. In fact, I concentrate entirely on this
body. It is most inappropriate that I should
be the confidant of the Prime Minister on
taxation and trade matters, which are peculiarly beyond -the cirounference of our deliberations, whether by law or by custom; consequently I cannot satisfy my honourable
friend's curiosity. He can be certain, however,
that the Government of the day, even in this
the fifth year of its life, has not lost any of
its enterprise or energy.
Hon. RODOLPHE LEMIEUX: It is true
that the right honourable gentleman is not
the confidant of the Prime Minister or the
Minister of Finance; nevertheless he is one
of the important members of the Government. It is not a portfolio, but his ability,
which gives the right honourable gentleman
his status or his standing in public life, and
as far as that is concerned, we all know that
the right honourable gentleman stands second
to no one in the Government. Therefore,
being the mouthpiece of the Government in

this Chamber, he ought to give us perhaps a
few more explanations in regard to the negotiations with the United States. Every now
and then we read in the papers that Mr.
Herridge has been in Ottawa and has returned to Washington, and that something
will be made known to the Canadian people
at some date, which is not mentioned. Some
people think the present Government has
not much sympathy for a reciprocity pact between Canada and the United States. I do
not know. I am only surmising. 1 know that
if it had been left to my honourable friend
the senator from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder)
twenty or twenty-five years ago, or to a
younger leader of the Senate when he was a
radical fresh from the West, we should expect
more sympathy in these matters.
But, really, we are speaking of taxation and
reductions in expenditure. Trade, after all,
is the soul of government, and if the stream
of trade is given a chance to flow, so that we
can exchange our products with the United
States, and sell our surplus cattle, grain, etc.,
it will certainly bring to this country the
beginning of a prosperity which will develop
as years roll by.
It seems to me that the most important
declaration the right honourable gentleman
had to make to the Senate this afternoon
was the one concerning this Bill. We do not
object to the changes in the tariff, as contained in the Bill, but as to this little clause
which raises the question of reciprocity with
the United States, we are entitled, perhaps,
to a little more information from the right
honourable gentleman. The old prejudice
against trading with the United States has
gone. To-day, I believe, our people are
ready to "truck and trade" with our neighbours, and the sooner we realize this the
better for Canada. As long as there is a
barrier between Canada and the United States,
how can we expect reciprocity? It is truc
that we have a large trade with the Mother
Country, but she is six or eight days removed
from Canada, whereas we can deliver and
sell our products across the boundary witbhin
a few hours. It seems to me, therefore, that
the Government might get better results if
it exercised a little more ingenuity in relation
to our economic relations with the United
States. It looks as if the Government were
simply marking time. The West is very
intent on having the American barrier razed.
But there is a feeling that in Toronto, and
even in Montreal, there might be some
objectors to freer channels of trade. I beg
my right honourable friend to remember that
public opinion on this question has completely
changed and that the country is ripe for a

3'32

SENATE

reai reciprocity pact with the United States.
The late Mr. Fielding was a good Canadian
and a great Imperialist. Yet in 1921 or 1922,
when, as Minister of Finance, he was presenting his budget, he included a clause offering
reciprocity to the United States. He thus
reaffirmed his faith in reciprocal trade relations,
although he had been defeated on that issue
in 1911. And back in 1879, when the National
Policy was introduced, Sir John A. Macdonald himself, the great apostle of protection,
embalmed in the Statutes a standing offer of
reciprocity. It seems te me that the time has
now come for carrying out the promises that
have been made and realizing the hopes of the
Canadian people by the establishment of reciprocal arrangements with the United States.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This House
iS undoubtedly entitled te know anything
whi:h the other louse is entitled to know in
r e.pect of the progress or result of negotiations,
but no honourable member would suggest that
information should be presented here in
greater detail or at an earlier date than in
the other Cha mber. I have looked through
the records and I find t4hat I have given to
the Senate every particle of information
which was given to the other House on this
uimiediate question when the matter was
lro ught up there.
lon. Mr. LEMIEUX: In the other House
re was a long debate on reciprocity in the
early part of the session.

MEIGHEN:

Yes, but
there that I

The honourable gentleman begs of us te
he ingenious and resourceful, not merely
marking time in this matter of a reciprocal
arrangement with the United States. The
position of the Government in a general way
was very clearly announced senoe time ago.
There
are reciproca1 arrangements
and
reciprocal arrangements. Very great care
must be taken in this country te sec that
any arrangement which may be made is
acceptable te the people of Canada and is
a step forward rather than a step backward.
It is possible te have a reciprocal arrangement which woulid be very detrimental. The
muani.fest truth of that assertion needs no expansion at my hands.
As regards using 'resourcefulness te get
-mcthing

I wonder whether the
ionourable gentleman's memory is failing
im. For nine years he was a distinguished
ornament of a party whieh had pledged its
faith te this principle of reciprocity. But
wlhure was its resourcefulness? Where was
Ion. Mr. LEMIEUX.

its ingenuitv in getting results? The tariff
erected against us by the United States was
almost twice as high when that party went
out of office as when it came in. There was
one elevation after another, and finally the
Hawley-Smoot tariff of 1930. That did not
indicate resourcefulness on the part of the
Canadian Government. It is true that Government passed a sort of open-door Bill,
which said, "'We are ready te meet and talk
with you at any time." But no progress was
made beyond the mere opening of the door.
The American tariff shut out our goods one
after another-forty cents a bu.shel against
our wheat, three cents a pound against our
cattle. My bonourable friend's party showed
no resourcefulness. its ingenuity was dormant,
it got no results at all; it did not even mark
time, but slid backwards. Things got worse
year after year and were at their peak of
disadvantage to Canada wben that party went
out of office in 1930. Se it is pretty bard te
take lessons in resourcefulness and ingenuity
fron honourable members opposite.
I hope a good reciproecity treaty can be
made. Nobody ever talked against truck or
trade with the Yankees. All that was just a
hallucination, a phrase invented by bonourable members opposite. None but honourable
members opposite ever used it.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: It was the stock-intrade argument of 1911.
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: Certainly it
was the stock-in-trade argument of honourable members opposite. But no one else
ever used it, no paper ever published it. It
was a pure invention.
Undoubtedly we
should like te trade, but we want an agreement which is fair and just te our country.
I venture te say t1hat if an agreement is
arrived at-and I personally hope one will
be-it wiil not be of a kind te bring about
emaciation of the great highways of this
Dominion, nor depopulation of our immense
fruit areas.
The motion was agreed te, and the Bill was
read the second time.

INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES
INVESTIGATION BIIL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. F. B. BLACK presented the report
of the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce on Bili 71, an Act to amend the
Industrial Disputes Investigation Act, and
moved concurrence therein.
Perhaps the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
right honourable leader would like to explain to the House the reason for the committee's recommendation that the Bill be
rejected.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The report
recommends that the Bill, which originated
as a Government measure in the other
Chamber, be not now proceeded with, and
gives as a reason that, in effect, it is not in
consonance with the spirit and purpose of
the Industrial Disputes Investigation Act
itself, the aim of which is to effect, by faceto-face consultations and negotiations, friendly
settlements of apprehended or existing industrial disputes, and thereby to prevent
intenferenoe with regular industrial operations and avert possible breaches of the peace.
The purport of the Bill, freed from its
rather circumlocutory language, is that even
when there is no cause to fear a lockout or
strike, if complaint is laid, say, by an
individual employer or employee, "that intimidation has been practised or other discriminatory action taken "-these are the
words employed in the Bill-the Minister
may appoint a board of conciliation for the
purpose of trying to effect a settlement: not

364

SENATE

necessarily of a dispute .threat-ening a strike or
lockout, but more probably of a difference
between one section of labour and another,
or one employer and another; that is to say,
a difference more or less local or domestie,
and consequently within the realm of civil
rights, which is a provincial jurisdiotion. The
committee felt that to invite reference of
disputes of that kind to a Minister, and
thus to impos-e on him almost a direction to
appoint a board unless be couldt give reasons
to the contrary, would not only throw upon
him an unnecessary burden, but would, place
a weapon in the hands of an employer desirous of preventing what lie regarded as discrimination by workers, or in the hands of
a worker trying to prevent what lie thought
w-as discrimination on the part of a labour
organization. Aside from any constitutional
feature, it was fet that it would be unwis-e
for Parliament to attempt to invade that
field. and that such questions shoultd be
settled in other ways.
The constitutional feature did interpose
itself. It was considiered that the establishment of a conciliation board to deal with
any such complaint would be entirely foreign
to our jurisdiction under the British North
America Act, and consequently the power
of a board to sec-ure witnesses, or resist
interference, or deal with refusal to testify,
would be very doubtful. I want to emphasize,,
however, that neither I nor any other member of the committee expressed the view
that the constitutional daniger alone was
sufficient ta warrant us in not proceeding
further with the measure. Nor was any
final view expressed on that phase.
The
measure, on its merits, was considered to be
unnecessary and unwise, because the Industrial
Disputes Investigation Act gives the Minister
ample powers in all cases where, in the general
public interest, there would bu any reason
at all for the exertion of efforts at conciliation.
That is why the committee acted as it did.
I may say it was influenced in no small
degree by the judgment of those most closely
associated with Labour, not only within this
House, but without-by the honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) and
Mr. Tom Moore-who stated definitely that
there was nothing in the Bill worth saving.
In that I was compelled to agree.

UNITED STATES AIR BASE
CHAMPLAIN

ON LAKE

ANSWER TO INQUIRY

Before the Orders of the day:
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, yesterday 'I promiied to
make a statement witb regard to a que-tion
put by the honourable senator fron Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Lemieux) as to the truth of
reports that the United States contemplated
establishing an air base on an island in Lake
Champlain, and the attitude of the Government of Canada in respect thereto.

JUNE 12, 1935
There is no information to the effect that
sucb an air base is in actual contemplation
by the Government of the United States. I
believe the newspaper report was founded
entirely on a statement by a member of a
committee of Congress wbich was dealing with
the subject. A Bill was passed by Congress
and became effective on June 5, authorizing
construction of airports and defining areas
within wbich major construction might take
place. One of these areas was described as
the northeast area, and the purpose of construction there was indicated. Beyond that
nothing bas been done.
I do not want my words, however, to be
interpreted as even an indirect intimation
that Canada would be interested, in an international sense. were such construction in prospect. The disposition of this country is to
view the matter as entirely one of domestic
policy on tbe part of the United States.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: I may lie
permittcd to add that when, behind closed
doors. an expert, I think, of the Admiralty
Department, recommcnded to a committee
of Congreas that an airport be built near the
Canadian border, and tbe recommendation
was published in the press of both countries,
the President of the United States declared
emphatically it was inconceivable that bis
Qovemnment should consider such a safeguard neccssary in view of possible strained
relations between the United States and Canada; and his declaration was welcomed on
both aides of the line. When I saw a report
of the incident in the newspapers, I was meminded of a pungent remark made by Lord
Robert Cecil in 1927, after the failure of the
Naval Conference at Geneva, where naval
experts bad dominated the proceedings. He
said he believed in experts, but hie wanted
them on tap, not on top.
Hon. W. A. GEffESBAC¶I: Honourable
members. I may lie permitted to add a few
wvords to the discussion. In lcoîmor1 with
the people of Canada, I welcomed the friendly
observations of the President of the United
States, as repeated by the honourable gentleman wbo leada the opposite aide (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand). I think, however, we should
try to face the situation in an atmosphere of
reality rather than of unreality. Theref ore
I intend to touch upon an aspect of the
matter wbich bas been taken up by tbe pres
of tbis country.
It bas been observed by our newspapers
that inasmuch as we in Canada have five air
bases wiLhin 100 miles of tbe American
frontier, we are precluded from discussing in

365

a critical mood the proposai of the United
States to establish an air base on an isiand in
Lake Champlain.
First of ail, we should get cleariy in our
minds what sort of air base we are talking
ab-out. The air bases in the United Sitates are
bedng established in accordafice with a grant
of 334,000,000 made by Congress, and are
more oT iess standard in formi and construction. The air base that we miglit expect to
see iocated on an island in Lake Champlain,
two and a haif miles wide and nineteen miles
long, wouid, on tbe standard formi of construction, accommodate 100 planes, witb sukiterranean aerodromes to protect tbem against
bornbing and gas attacks and to provide
stoirage for supplies of oil, gasoline, grease and
ainmunition, and an -establishmnent 'Lo repair
planes aimoet to the point of reconstruction.
There woul be a garisoi, of perhaps 4,000
men, since it ta.kes seven -men on the ground
to mnaintain one man in tbe air. There
would be in addition powerful searchliglit
equipment and anti-aircraft g=n protection,
compirising probahly fifty or sixty guns. Ini
point -of faiet, it wouJd be a large fortified base.
The cities of Montreal, Kingston and Ottawa,
and a,11 canaIs, Jocks and -publie buildings and
institutions within this area would be within
the radius of action of that f ortified base.
Ninw, in view of the suggestion put forward
that we have already five air bases within 100
miles of the American frontier, it beco-mes
interesting to examine just what these bases
are. We have a base at Jericho Beach, with
five or six rather wabbly aeroplaines, none of
tbem standard or modemn, in charge of perhaps
fifteen. or twenty men. There are no antiau'oraft guns or search¶igbt proteetion. Ini
Winnipeg we have a similar base-even or
eight plaines, flot standard, not capable of
maiioeuvering, and ten or fifteen men. ln
Ontario we have three baises of the same sosrt.
In no sense are these bases comparable with
the standard United States bases; they are
merely an accumulation of old planes in charge
of .fromi half a dozen to a dozen men. It is
welJ that we shouid have this information in
mind when we are disoussinýg the establishment
of the United States station on Lake Champlain.
1 do rot contend for a moment that we
have any right tn intervene, to object to the
establish'ment of that station. We bave a
treaty with the United States, known as the
Rush-Bagot Treaty, which prohibits f ortifications on the frnntiers of the two countries,
and the use of armed vesselýs upon the lakes.
That treaty bas been in operation. for more
than 100 years. I am n.ot prepared to say

36c,

SENATE
SENATE

36f

that tie establishment of the Lake Champlain
base violates the tre'aty. As the right honourable leader of the Government has said,
the establishment of an air base on Lake
Champlain is a matter of domestic policy on
the part of the United States. I merely draw
the attention of the House, first, to the fact
that a station established there of the magnitude that I have described would leave Montreal, Ottawa and Kingston completcly at its
mercy. That is the firsit fact to bc realized.
The second fact to be borne in mind is this.
When our newspapers talk in comparative
terms about the five air bases that we have,
they are talking absolute nonsense.
Let me carry honourable members a step
further, 'to the discussion which took place in
the rommittee of Congress to which my honourable friend the leader on the opposite side
referred. The grournd upon which the station
was to be established was discussed quite
freely: our incapacity to maintain neutrality.
That was the basis of the discussion. Members of that committee frankly dealt with the
question which I raised last session, our
failure to provide the equipmenit necessary to
maintain our neutrality as a sovereign state.
I pointed out that in the event of a conflict
betw,een the United States and some ot'her
country. we might find that our failure to
maintain neutrality, our incapacity to carry
out our obligation under international law,
woulid necessitate the United States taking
steps to protect itself. As I say, that question was raised in the discussion of the Congressional committee, and one of the arguments in favour of ,the establishment of the
station on Lake Champilain was that inasmuch
as we could not maintain our neutrality, the
United States must protect itself, not against
this country-its neighbour-but against our
incapacity to maintain neutrality, and the consequences which would flow therefrom. That
is the situation which confronts us to-day.
That is what all the discussion is about, but
it is being camouflaged by our newspapers, for
the reason that they do not seem to know
any better. I am sorry that in the statement
supplied to my right honourable friend by the
Govemment these various aspects of the
matter were not raised et ail.

Economy and Contingent Accounts.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I shoukl like
to draw the attention of my right honourable
friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) to the
fact that very often such reports contain a
financial element. When I led the House
I was often reminded that to the representative of the Governunmt appertained the duty
to supervise, from a budgetary point of view,
any expenditures that might be recommended.
The responsibility wvas then thrown upon my
shoulders; I pass it on now to my right
honourable friend.
Right lion. Mr. MEIGHEN: I ccrtainly
do not resent the sugestion of my honourable
friend opposite. Yesterday I listened carefully when these reports were presented. and
I realized that undoubtedly there is a responsibility on the representative of the Government here to watrh carefully all expenditures
to be authorized by the House. I was in
hopes that to-day the honourable senator
froi Manitou (lion. Mr. Sharpe) would give
us some detail as to these reports, so that we
might know to what extent, if at all. the
figures eon-tained in them follow the figures
of preceding years, what savings. if any. have
been effected, what additions have been made,
and at what points.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: I do not think there
is very much change. WVe have been holding
the expenses down. and following as nearly
as possible the line of previous years. As
a matter of fact, the committee has done
some very close figuring, and in some respects
has improved on what was done previously.

number of divorce petitions that have come

still await adjudication?

367

JUNE 12, 1935
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: The list is practically conipleted. One case is set down for
Saturday of this week, which will run some
risk of not being put through the Senate and
the House of Commons before prorogation.
The number of the last report of the Committee on Divorce shows the number of cases
that have been heard by the committee.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I think it is thirty-six.
Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: Then if the case I
have referred to is heard on Saturday, the
total will be thirty-seven. I am glad te
inform the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) that business is falling off.
I may say, for the information of the
honourable gentleman who is inquiring (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand), that it is extremely difficult
te obtain a divorce in the Parliament of
Canada if the petition is contested. There
are, I believe, only two parts of the British
Empire where parliamentary divorces are
granted-the Irish Free State and Canada. I
believe the only other place in the world
where there is parliamentary divorce is
Georgia. One reason why it is very difficult
te albtain a parliamentary divorce in Canada
if the case is contested is that in the iother
House, where there is no committee on
dýivorce, bille of divorce are referred to the
Committee on Private Bills, where they are
voted on by gentlemen whose religious
principles are similar to those of members
of this House who refrain from voting on
suoh matters. In saying this I do net wish
to cast any reflection on anybody. I think
two of the cases tried by the Senate committee were thrown out there.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Some time ago
I suggested that perhaps the situation could
be improved if an effort were made te set
up a joint committee on divorce, composed
of members from both Houses, te sit in judgment on these cases in the same way as our
own committee does.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I think the suggestion is a wise one. I suggested te the
Minister of Justice that the House of Commens should have a special committee on
divorce te deal with these matters, rather than
that they should be dealt with by the Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: A joint committee would be better.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Honourable menbers,
the Chairman of the Committee on Divorce
says that the difficulty of getting a divorce
bill through, if the case is contested, is one
of the reasons why there are so few con-

tested cases. It has been suggested that
recently that feature has given rise to collusion in an increased number of applications.
Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: Did the honourable
gentleman say collusion?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Collusion between the
parties to a divorce suit-that collusion is
now more frequent than formerly. That
statement has been made in the press, at
all events.
Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: Let me correct the
honourable gentleman. You cannot have
collusion in a contested case.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I know. The probabiiity of divorces not being granted gives
rise to collusion between the parties in a
much larger nunber of cases than formerly.
The motion was agreed te, and the bills
were read the second time.
CRIMINAL CODE BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

The Senate again went into Committee on
Bi}l M2, an Act to amend the Criminal Code.
-Right Hon. Mr. Meighen.
Hon. MT. Gillis in the Chair.
On section 1-irrebuttable presumption:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Are not Bills
L2 and M2 correlated?
IRight Bon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Even though
they are related, that need not prevent us
from going on with this one now. The explanation of this Bill will be given by the
honiourable senator from East Ottawa (Hon.
Mîr. Côté). As to the other Bill, neither
I nor the honourable senator to whom I have
referred was able to see Mr. Scott.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I shouldi like te
say a word of explanation in regard to this
Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Which Bill?
Hon. Mr. McMIEANS: Bill M2, an Act
to amend the Criminal Code.
When I picked up this Bill and read the
words "two persons who, though in fact
living in adultery, are living as man and
wife," I immediately perceived that it was
badly drawn, because if neither of two
persons living together as man and' wife is
married they are net living in adultery.
My amendment covers the case of "two
persons who are not married to each other,
but are living together as man and wife
and reputed to be man and wife, and where
the child se affected is the child of the two

368

SENATE

persons so living together." I added the
words "or either of them."
Upon reading the Act I find that what
is prcposed by the Bill relates not to the
chil, but rather to the offences created
under the legislation of 1932-33, which provides:
Every person who, in the home of a child,
participates in adultery, or in sexual immorality, or indulges in habitual drunkenness or
any other forme of vice, thereby endangering
the morals of such ohild or rendering the home
of such child an unfit place for such child to
be in shall be guilty of an offence and liable,
uîpon summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars, or to imprisonment
for a period not exceeding one year, or to
both fine and imprisonment.
In reading that clause it is perhaps a little
difficult to say what "child" means. I take
it to mean any child. The purpose of the
present Bill is to provide that if the child
is the child of two persons who, though not
married to each other, are living together
as man and wife, there shall be no prosecution under the Act.
I think the whole situation is worthy of
serious consideration. I am withdrawing the
last four words of my proposed amendiment,
the remainder to be su'bstituted for the proviso in subsection 3 as it appears in clause 1
of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Honourable senators, the
amendment of the honourable senator from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. MeMeans) makes it
almost unnecessary for me to speak to this
measure. I may say, however, that since the
discussion of yesterday I have had an opportunity of interviewing Mr. W. L. Scott, K.C.,
who is honorary counsel for the Canadian
Council of Child and Family Welfare, as well
as for the Canadian Association of Child Protection Officers. It was at the instigation of
these organizations that the present amending
Bill was submitted. Mr. Scott pointed out
to nie. and I think properly so, that the aim
of section 215, which was added to the
Criminal Code in 1919. was not to disrupt
homes and enable the Children's Aid Society
to add to the number of its wards, but, on
the contrary, to reduce the number of those
wiards. The main purpose was to break up
illicit relations and re-establish normal homes.
in the interest of children, and thus to avoid
the necessity of taking children away from
their parents and making them wards of
societies, as would otherwise have to be donc.
Children's aid societies all over Canada have
been performing very useful work in re-establishing families. May I read an extract from
the last annual report of the Toronto Childrnns Aid Souiety. which states that the Onlion.

Mr.

McMEANS.

tario Court of Appeal interpreted section 215
of the Code in such a manner as to render
it practically nugatory and to make an
amendment essential. The report says:
With reference to our efforts to minimize
the making of wards. we cannot omit mention
of an important legal decision given during
the year, which threatens to offset in the future
much of what has been accomplished in this
direction. The judgment of the courts in the
case of Rex vs. Vahey . appealed by this society
for the purpose of clarifying the law, rendered
section 215 of the Criminal Code practically
inoperative as an aid in the prevention of
moral neglect of children. In many serions
cases the removal of the child by ward action
wiill now be the only recourse unless some
comprehensive amendment is passed by the
Dominion Parliament.
Yesterday some of us were under a misapprehension when we thought that this
amendment would result in the Children's
Aid Society removing children from their
homes. As 'I have pointed out, the purpose
is the very contrary, namely the breaking up
of illicit relationship and the re-establishment
of normal homes where children may bu maintained by their own parents.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Is not the
right to take away the child founded entirely
on provincial legislation?
Hon. Mr. COTE: Yes, the right arises
from provincial legislation. In every province
of Canada ·there is legislation giving the
Children's Aid Society the right to remove
children from their homes if they are living
under conditions which imperil their moral
welffare.
Section 215 of the Criminal Code has been
in opera.tion with good results ever since 1919,
when it was passed. Under it the societies
have dealt with hundreds of cases every year.
Subsection 3, which this Bil would amend, is
reprinted in the explanatory note. As honourable members will observe, it provides
that in certain circumstances there shall be
"an irrebuttable presumption that the child
wvas in fact in danger of being or becoming
immoral and its morals injuriously affected
and that its home had in fact been rendered
an unfit place for it to be in." Unfortunately,
the Ontario Court of Apipeal recently interpreted that subsection as still leaving to
it a certain discretion. In the case which
wvas before the court the children were quite
young, and the court said it was unable to
find they would be injuriously affected, because they were too young to appreciate what
was going on. That decision has rendered
the subsection nugatory. Se representatives
of children's aid societies recommend that
what has been considered as the spirit of

JUNE 12, 1935
the law, ever since 1919, until the recent
court fanding, should be -made definitely
effective by an amenciment to the code. It
seems to me quite proper to ioll-ow this
recommendatian..
I agree with the amendment moveci by the
honourable senator from Winnipeg (eon. Mr.
MeMeans) in -lieu of the praviso ini subsection 3 as appearing in the Bill. The
language in the honourable gentleman's
amendmnent is more apt. I a]so think he was
right in withdrawing the last four words of
his amendment as first proposed, namely, the
words "or either of them."
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: May I ask the honourable gentleman if it would noyt he better
to strike out the wordts "and where the chilci
so affected is the child ai the two persans
so living together"?
Hon. Mr. OTE: If those wards had been
lef t in I shouki have faund difficulty in conceiviog of a case that ceuid came within the
scope of the subsectian. It. would have applied
only te couples who lived together and
adopted a child that dici net belong te either
cf them. That daes net happen in practice.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I think the hanaurable gentleman misun-derstood my question.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: If my honaurable friend frorm Leedis (Hon. Mr. Hardy)
had been present he perhaps wauld have discussed this question, and mare intefligently
than I can. Recently he and his geaci wife,
who are deeply canterned with child welçfare,
bought a beautiful home fer the Chilren's
Aid Seciety in Brookville.
1- want te make it clear that I am net
cpposed ta this legislation, which tends te
make the law stronger in the interests of
children. For a few ýmanths-a very brief
period, it is true-I was a member of the
Ontario Goverument, and child-Ten's aid
actii-ities came under my supervision. That
was one branch of my wark which I regretteci
leaving, and I have maintained an interest
in it.
This measure andi the one pre-ceding it an
the Order Paper, 'the Juvenile Delinquents
Bill. are pretty closely connecteci. Althaugh
technically the abject of this preposed legislation is ta referma the heade of families who
are living under certain conditions, the underlying motive is protection of the child's wellare. Sa I think it is quite proper te discuas
the interests of chilciren when we are dealing
with this measure, althaugh, strictly speaking,
the subject should perhaps be discusseci on
the Juvenile Delinquents Bill.

369

My anly interest in this legisiatien is ta
sc that chuldren are protecteci with as fittie
friction as possible, and that in an attempt
ta get et a man and waman the future ai
chilciren is net wrecked or ta some degree
impaired. Some people are very enthusiastic
over an idea, which they get in their mincis;
anci I do nat blame them, because there is
ne success without enthusiasm. Sa long as I
am assured that the amenciment is te benefit
chilciren rather 'than te aid in enfarcing the
law against men anci wamen who are living
as heads of families in certain circumstances,
I shaîl be periectly satisfied. But I want lit
made very clear ta my minci that protection
af the interests of children net an-liy is the
object, but wil¶ be -the result of the legislation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: At this stage
I shaulci like ta make a comment which will
apply ta, this measure as well as te the Juvenile
Delinquents Bill. I think that when any
society is recemmending some change in aur
legislation, and a bill is prepared, it would
be wise ta senci the bill ta a committee, ta
whom representatives of the saciety caulci
describe how the existing law b&%been warking andi state the reason for the propased
amendment. It is perhaps tao late ta fallow
this ceurse in connection with the measure new
under cansideratian, but I wonder whether
the Juvenile Delinquenta Biih caulci noat be
sent ta a cammittee andi representative.s af
the Children's Aid Society be invited ta
appear.
Right Hen. Mr. MEIGIIEN: When the
Juvenile Delinquents Bill cames up for censideration to-morrow, if it seems ta me that
there is any substanýtial question at issue, I
shaîl move fer reference ta a cemmittee.
But I sliould be in doubt as ta the proper
cornmittee. I keep in minci the admonitian
oi the honourable senater iram De Lanaudière
(Hon. Mr. Casgrain) that the proper cammittee fer the cansideration of ail public
bills is the Cammittee of the W'hole. Na
doubt that is true, but persans who are
interesteci cannat be heard in this Chamber.
There will be a reference to anather committee if that is thought necessary.

SENATE
MEAT AND

CANNED FOODS BILL

SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 25, an Act te amend
the Meat and Canned Foods Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
very simple Bill. which we do not need to
delay at all. It authorizes the imposition
of fees for the inspection of canned fish and
shellfish. A tariff of fees has been in effect,
but there is doubt as to .authority to impose
them. Inasmuch as any fees already paid are
net recoverable, there is no need of the
amendment being retroactive.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Perhaps next
session some of us who are privileged to
return to this Chamber might ask the Government for a list of the various inspection
services that are carried on throughout the
country, and study the whole field witli a
view to saving money by combining some of
them. Frequently when we have had before
us bills providing for inspection of certain
goods it has been stated that no extra cost
would be incurred, because the inspection
vould be done by a staff already in existence.
[t is generally felt that commissions in this
country bave incrcased to a formidable number. Inspectors are even more numerous.
All these officials may be doing valuable
work, but I think it should be the duty of
Parliament occasionallv to make a general
survey as to what could be done by way of
amalgamation. I know there are certain inspections for which a fee is paid, but if anyone asked me to describe the general field
covered by inspectors J could give but a
very incomplete answer.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think a
committee of this House might well do a
useful work by hearing witnesses from the
different departments which keep inspectors
on duty throughout the country the year
round, and by endeavouring te conclude
whether or not there should be an amalgamation of services. We have inspection under
the Meat and Canned Foods Act, under the
Weights and Measures Act, under the Excise
Act, under the Live Stock Branch and other
branches of the Department of Agriculture,
and under branches of various other departments. It is manifest that in certain cases
the qualifications required of inspectors are
exceptional, but I do not know why a man
who can inspect canned meats could not also
tell whether scales were right or not. A
saving undoubtedly could be made.
Possibly if a committee were formed and reported, a bill founded on its report might be
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

introduced here. I suggest to my honourable
friend who will be leading the other side next
session that lie mention the matter early in
the session, for it will take up some time.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Are tie fees to br
pulblished in special regulations or in the
Canada Gazette, or are they set out in the
Aict?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They are not
in the Act. They would be published in special
regulations. They would not appear in the

SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 72. an Act to amend
the Live Stock and Live Stock Products
Act.
He said: Honourable members, this Bill is
also part of the harvest from the Price
Spreadis Committee. Its purpose is te carr
out a portion of the committee's recomIt provides that stockyards of

packing companies shall be subject to inspection by the Department of Agriculture
the same as public stockyards. It provides
also. in co-operation with the provinces. for
licensing truckers, and for further inspection of live stock and live stock produets.
I think the Bill shouldi be referred te the
Committee on Agriculture and Forestry, for
it is net at all unlikely that interests affeeted
may desire te make representations.
I am sure
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
members of that committee aire familiar
with live stock and live stock produets. I
hope other members .of the Heouse who may
also be interested will, take an opportunity
of attending the meetings.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Meat is one
of the chief live stock produets, but its inspection is covered by the Act dealing with
meat and canned foods. There would appear
te be overlapping.
I do net
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
think there is. The purpose of the Meat
and Canned Foods Act is inspection from

JUNE 12, 1935
the standpoint of hea]th. I do n.ot think
that is the puýrpose of this mneasure.
Right Hon. Mir. G'RAHAM: The committee couki look into that feature when the
Bili is before it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. The
two measures are pretty clob-eiy al'lied, but
they are really different. This Bill has to
do more with the standardization of produjets,
facilities for sale, and protection of the producer. I arn sure the honourabie senator
from Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair) wouid be
able to explain, probabiy better than I
couid, the difference between the two Aetà.
Hon. Mr. SINICLAIR:
The Live Stock
and Live Stock Produets Act bas to d'a
largely with marketing and offering for sale.
Right Hon. Mir. MEIGHEN: I tivought an.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR. The Meat and
Can.ned Fonds Act is administered by officieis
of the Heai.th of Animais Branch and pertains
more to the adjulteraition. of foods.
I might point out that 1ast session when the
Fruit and, Honey Act was before us we found
that the word "export" was defrned to mean
interprovinciadi trade as weii as export, out of
Canada. I see a similar definition is contained in this Bill. I think anme other word
shouild bc used wi.th respect;to interprovinciai
trade. This shouid be conside.red by the
oommittee.
Thie motion was agreed to, and the Bili
was read the second itime.

the Bill be now referred to the Standing

error. The Interpretation Act lays down
definite ruies for the interpretation of our

wage clause be inserted in contracts for railroad or canal construction whenever the Government contributed to the cost, although
there was no provision to that effect in the

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHIEN: That is quite
wrong. It is so rep)ugnant that it just wars
against the truth. The sole purpose of the
Bill is to protect the revenue of Canada. The
excise revenue fron matches has decreased
far more than one would expect, owing to
use of these devices. Other countries have
found it necessary to protect their revenue,
Great Britain having imposed a shilling
tax and France a tax of thirty-two cents.
Canada in its magnanimity imposes a tax ni
only ten cents.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That is more
than most lighters are worth.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: The lighter itself is

EXCISE BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 82, an. Act to amend
the Excise Act. 1934.
He said: Honourable members, one of the
purposes of this Bill is to reduce the excise
tax on spirituous and malt liquors, and to
eradicate, as far as possible, i'llicit or bootleg
dealings in these articles. The real object
of the Bill, of course, is to try to protect
the revenue, which has suffered from impairment and almost annihilation by reason of
the illicit traffic in liquor.
I am informed that since the date of the
budget speech, when the reduction of duties
went into effect, the governments retailing
these articles have made proportionate reductions to the consumer. This is essential, not
that the people may have cheaper liquor, but
that the purpose of the Act may be realized,
narnely, that the price of liquor may become
so reasonable that the bootlegger will have no
incentive to carry on his trade.
Certain other reductions of a minor kind
are still to be made, but a bill bas already
been passed under which the Governor in
Council bas power whereby, if reductions in
price do not equal the reduction in duty,
the old charges may be restored in respect of
any offending province.
This Bill bas
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
a double advantage: it suits those who want
cheaper liquor. and it suits those wlho are
opposed to bootlegging.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Do I understand
that if any one province does not purvey
cheaper liquor it will be subject to a higher
duty? How are we going to enforce a law
of that kind? I do not sec how we can
charge one part of Canada higher duties than
those charged to another. I think the higher
duty wouild have to be imposed on the whole
of Canada.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
The Bill
speaks for itself. It may be that my honourable friend is right. The other measure,
to which I referred yesterday, speaks for
itsilf in this way:
In the event of any duty imposed under this
Act upon spirituous or alcoholic liquors having
been reduced, if it is made to appear to the
Governor in Council that in any province the
prices of such goods to the consumer have not

JUNE 12, 1935
been reduced to, or are not being maintained
at, levels which will give the consumer the full
benefit of any such reduction, the Governor in
Council may order that such reduction shall be
no longer in effect and, upon publication of
such order in the Canada Gazette, the full
rates of duty theretofore payable on such goods
shall again be in force and effect.
Apparently the offence of one province will
cause a removal of the reduction throughout
the whole of Canada. The Minister of
Finance said in the other House:
I can assure my honourable friend, however,
that in those instances where the provinces
have not carried out the full spirit of the Act,
it will -be our purpose to sec that they do.
I do not know just what the weapon will be,
other than the general provision here.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: A gentle warning.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill

have the 'third reading of this Bill deferred.
Objection has been raised to the use of the
word "films" in the twelfth line, page 5. I
want to take the objection into considieration,

and so would ask to have the Bill stand, in
the hope that I may be able to move the
third reading before we rise to-day.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The debate on
the motion for the third reading is adjourned?

Hon. Mr. BLACK moved concurrence in

Thle Standing. Comimittee on Ba nking and
Commerce beg leave to report that th wovrk
of the committee is such that legal assistance
is essential, and recommend that representatiens be made to the Gevernment to forthwith
restore the salary for the vacant position of

Ail which is s espectfully submitted.
He said: For the information cf honoiirable nacmbers wvho have not bee:n present at

Committee 1 would expiain this recommendation. Formerly the, Senate hiad' a Law Clcrk.

O'Connor has rendered ve.ry valuable services
to the com'mittec in the capa-city of diraftsman

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
1 have been a
memýber of this Chamber long enough te
1Know the importance cf a Law Cl'erk of the
Senate. For a number cf years we wondered
what we shotîld do when Mr. GCreighton lef t
us, for hie had ne assistant who was prepared
to, step into bis position. At one time it was
proposed that there shoul'd be a Law Clerk
cf the two Houses, but this was rejecteu by
the Senate, I think unanimously, it, being
thought unwi.se that the Sonate should net
have a Law Clerk, of its own. The reason
wiii, I think, býe obviouis--that it is the, duty
cf this Chamber te reviso measures whieh
cerne frein the other House and, have been
approved Nbythe Law Clork of that bouse. A
dluty whiech the Sonate heids te be specialiy
its own is that cf keeping a watchful oye
ever thie rights cf the Foderal Parliament and
cf the provinces, with a view to preventing
confliots cf jurisdiction. For instance., duuring
a numiber cf years we frequentl'y had, before
us railway legi.slation in which the question
cf provincial jurisdiction was very important.
Thýat question was cften lest sight of in anether place whcn the measures w'ere being consideired, but the Law Clerk cf the Senate
kncw exactly the viens cf this Ch-amber and
netifleel our cemmittees wheýn there was any
trecipass, upon provincial rights, whicha we
wesc afeguarding. As te the valtie cf any bill
whieli icmos from the otisor place, a Law
Clýerk cf the Se.nate weîild Ne much freer te
express an opinion fer etîr guidance than
would a Law Cleirk who had alreadvgena
faveurablo opinion upon it. For these reasens
the Sonate is alwavs censidered it nemewsarxte Nave its own Law Clerk, upon whem it
euld depcnd for adu-ice. I st-ili agree with

Hon. Mr. CALDER: May I inquire as te

Lot me say that, spoaking generally, I
thcrcughly agiuec we sheuld have a legal
adieri for the Sonate. I suggest an additional
icason te these that have Noon mentioned.
At the prosont timo thero is ne one te

by our Internai Economy Committee, or by
the Government? Speaking frorn experience,
I eau say 'that in connection with preparatien
of statutes nothing ie more important to, a
legislative body of this kind than that it
have a first-ciass legal adiviser, aind partieularly one who knows how to draft -bills.
People with the best qualifications for that
work are, in a senise, not made; they are
hemn. Good draftsmen of statutes are exceedingly rare. Seo I trust that if an appointment is to be made, this fact above aJ4, others
wilýl be taken into consideration. We wish
t o have flot merely a legal expert or adivieer,
but the proper kind of mani for our 'work.
And the necessary steps sbould be taken, to
secure ene.
Rigbt Houi. Mr. MEl1GHEN: Honourable
members, I arn in agreement with, the report
and with what has been said hy the henourable senator opposite (Honý. Mr. Dandurad).
1 wish. now to, say a few worde on the rem.arks
of the honourable senator Voa
my 'left (Hon.
Mr. Calder).
Without doubt we sheuld have an independent Law Clerk. Three years here have
oonviriced me of that. As a matter of fact,
we have had ene, in a fashion. But we have
flot enjoyed the full benefit of bie services
becauee it bas flot been possible for hirn te
make himself available at ail times for coneultation by honourable members. Hie is
flot here between sessions, when hie might
welil be very usefui. Furthermore, we have
bad te draw on contingencies. The arrangement has been entirely uneatisfactory; oertainly I think it bas, been se to hiin.
Now, the a1lPiîmportant question is who the
Law Clerk shahl be. I would rather h-ave
noue at ail than flot get someone who we
1<now ie of real value. The s.ppointîment, I
understand, ýcornes under the Civil Service
Commission. I express ne want of confidence in the Commission., but necessarily
we who have bad experience kinow a great
deai better than it possiblr couki wbat are
the essential qualifications for the position.
1 arn told the Commission ls power te
del-egate its authority teo this flouse, and
that it has donc se, in parallel cases. When
the money is voted--of course there is no
use in doing anytbing until it is voted-we
shall ask that the appointment be left te
the flouse. No one can have any dou'bt as
te my intention, and I arn sure it will meet
with the full approval of bcoth sides of this
Chamber.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
The motion was agreed te.

,CIVIl SERVICE GRADE IV
ALLEGED

DISCRIMINATION

Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. CAIRINE R. WILSON: 1 sbouId
like te ask a quest.ion of the rigbt honourable
leader of the flouse. Yesterday I received a
communication from the Canadian Federation
of University Women, saying that according
te their information there was te be establisbed in the Civil Service a new ciass, Grade
IV, te which university graduates above the
average standing would be eligible without
having te pass tbrough the junior clerkships,
but that the appointments would be restmicted
te men. The Fedemation desire that this unfair discrimination be inquired into.
~Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have ne
knowledge at ail of the proposed grade, uer,
of course, of the pmoposed distinction. I shall
inquime into the matter and make a reply
next Tuesday.
THiE ROYAL ASSENT
The Hon. the SPEAKER informed the
Senate that he had received a communication
from the Assistant Secretary te the Governor
General, acquainting hirn that the Right
Honourable Sir Lyman P. Duif, Chief Justice
of Canada, acting as Deputy of the Governor
Genemal, would proceed te the Senate Charnber this day at 5 p.m. for the purpose of giving the Royal Assent te certain bills.
PRIVATE BIIL
REFUND

0F FEES

Before the Orders of the Day:
ýHon. Mr. COTE: Before the Orders of the
Day are called, I move:
That the parliamentary fees paid on Bill
02, an Act te incerporate the Community,
General Hospital, Aims Heuse and Seminary
of Learning of the Sisters of Charity at
Ottawa, Canada, be refunded te the solicitor
of the petitioner, less printing and translation
caste.
In explanation I may say that the purpose
of this Bill is te incorporate a religieus and
educational institution, and in such cases it
is usual te remit the pamliamentary fees, less,
of course, the cost of printing.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: fias this
been adopted by the committee?
Hon. Mr. 'COTE: The Bill has been read
the third time.
Right lion. Mr. MEIGHEN: But bas the
recommendation been before a cornmittee?

Hon. Mr. PARENT: So that there may
be no trouble about this Bill, which is a
very important one, may I ask the honourable
gentleman whether the Archbishop of Ottawa
and the Cardinal have any knowledge of it?
Hon. Mr. COTE: In answer to the honourable gentleman I may say that I am in complete ignorance of the attitude of His Excellency the Archbishop of Ottawa and of
His Eminence the Cardinal with respect to
this Bill. It was read a third time, and
passed, by this House yesterday. My motion
simply goes to the question whether we should
follow the usual practice by remitting the parliamentary fee to this corporation, which is
a charitable institution.
The right honourable the leader of the
House has asked whether this motion is
My
based on a report of a committee.
answer is no. The solicitor in charge of the
Bill has requested me to make the motion.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Having no
knowledge at all of the rule, I asked whether
a committee had made the recommendation.
No doubt my honourable friend has looked
up the rule, and if the honourable the leader
of the other side (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), who
knows a great deal more about the practices
of this House than I do, says that this proposal is in accordance with the rule, I have
no objection to the motion. In the case of
bills on behalf of charitable, religious and
educational institutions or associations, is it
the rule to remit the fee, less the cost of
printing?
As to similar
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
cases that have come before the Senate, it
is my impression that the answer is in the
affirmative.
Very well.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Let it go.
The motion was agreed te.
DIVORCE BILLS
THIRD READINGS

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS. Chairman of the
Sommittee on Divorce, moved the third readings of the following bills:
Bill P2, an Act for the relief of Jean Taggart
Harfield.
Bill Q2, an Act for the relief of Lily Usheroff
Bruker.
Bill R2, an Act for the relief of Hilda High
de Boissière.
Hon. Mr. COTE.

Hon. Mr. PARENT:
I should like to
make just one remarke about the de Boissière
case. The respondent in this case was present
at the meeting of the committee when the
evidence was heard, and assented to ev-erything that took place. It would appear to
me, therefore, that there was collusion, and
I do not know whether we should pasS the
Bill.
The motion was agreed to, on division. and
the bills were read the third time, and pased.
CRIMINAL CODE BILL
THIRD READING

Bill M2, an Act to amend the Criminal
Code.-Right Hon. Mr. Meighen.
JUVENILE DELINQUENTS

BILL

FURTHER CONSIDERED IN OOMMITTEE

The Senate again went into Committee on
Bill L2, an Act to amend the Juvenile
Delinquents Act.-Right Hon. Mr. Meighen.
Hon. Mr. Donnelly in the Chair.
On section 1-summary trials:
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
have some amendments?

Did we not

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. I was
not able to explain the Bill to the Committee
on Tuesday.
Section 1 is unchanged but for a parenthetical exception in the proviso, which reads:
Provided further, thatThen follows the parenthetical exception.
-save
as provided in section thirty-three
hereofAnd the proviso continues:
-section
one thousand one hundred and forty
of the Criminal Code shall, mutatis mitandis,
apply to all proceedings in the Juvenile Court.
Section 38 of the Code is quite lengthy.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The right honourable gentleman might give the gist of it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It provides
that adults who contribute to delinquency of
children shall be liable, and it fixes the liabilities and penalties of parents and guardians.
It will take only a moment to read it. It
says:
(1) Any person, whether the parent or
guardian of the child or not, who, knowingly
or wilfully,
(a) aids, causes. abets or connives at the
commission by a child of a delinquency; or
(b) does any act producing, promoting, or
contributing to a child's being or becoming a
juvenile delinquent or likely to make any child
a juvenile delinquent;

37ý

JUNE 13, 1935
shall be hiable on sumanary conviction before a
Juvenile Court or a magistrate to a fine not
exceeding five hundred dollars or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding two years or
to both fine and imprisonment.
(2) Any person who, being the parent or
guardian of the child and being able to do
so, knowingly negleets to do that which would
directly tend to prevent said chihd being or
becoming a juvenile delinquent or to remove
the conditions which render or are likely to
render said child a juvenile delinquent shall
be liable on summary conviction before a
Juvenile Court or a magistrate to a fine not
exceed'ing five hundred dollars or to imprisonment' for a period flot exceeding two yeaTs
or to both fine and imprisonment.
(3) The Court or magistrate may postpone
or adjourn the hea-ring of a charge under this
section for sucli periods as the Court may
deemn advisable or may postpone or adjourn
the hearing sine die and may impose conditions upon any person found guilty unde, this
section and suspend sentence subject to such
conditions, and on proof at any time that such
conditions have been violated may pass
sentence on such pers-on.
By the second proviso contained in clause
1 of the present Bill we are amending that
section of the Juvenile flelinquents Act which
established summary trials for these offences.
Section 140 of the Criminal Code, respecting limitation of actions, is to apply except
where it confiots with section 33 of the Act;
and it will he observed that section 33 gives
certain powers to make conditional adjournments and conditional releases, which powers
would nlot be ohtained from section 1,140 of
the Code. The resuit of the amendment is
that these powers are preserved.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-probation officers under control of judge:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Section 2
places ail probation officers under control of
judges. These officers have always heen under
sucb control except in the province of Alberta.
Wby there was an exception there I cannot
tell. At any rate, Alberta is benceforth to be
in the samne position as ail other provinces
in this respect.

One cen see the difference at a glance.
Under the present Act, in a case where it
could he shown that at the time of the
alleged offence the cbild was of such tender
years that it was not likely to become a
juvenihe delinquent, the accused escaped. But
the amendment will cut off that avenue of
escape. In future the accused wihl be barred
from pleading either that the child did not
actually become a juvenihe delinquent-as
would be the case if it was too young-or
that the child was too young to realize wbat
was going on. 1 think I have now succeeded
in understanding the Bih, and I hope I have
been able to make it plain to the Committee.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: What would
he the interpretation of the words "father"
and "mother"?
Wouhd a step-father comne
under this statute?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: 'Oh, yes. A
step-fatber would he a guardian, and hie must
s0 conduet hiimself as not to contribute to>
the delinqucncy of a child. That obtains
under the present law, and will continue ta
obtain after this Bill is passed.
Section 3 was agreed to.
The preamible and the tithe were agreed to.
The Bihl was reported.
THIRD READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
third reading of the Bill.
The motion was agrccd to, and the Bill
was read the thîrd time, and passed.

Section 2 was agreed to.
On section 3-no defence if cbîld does not
become deinquent:

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

At first sight one would think that was quitc
sufficient.
But Mr. Humphries, Deputy
Attorney-General of 'Ontario, bas taken the
view that it is not strong enough, and he
wants it worded this way:
Lt shahl not ba a valid defence to a prosecution uuder this setioni either that the child is
of too tender ycars to understand or appreciate
the nature or effect of the conduet of the
accused, or that notwithstanding the conduet
of the accused the child did not in fact becorne
a juvenile delinquent.

The tixird

clause is of some importance. Mr. Scott has
written me fully about it. The subsection to
be repealed reads as follows:
It shaîl not be a valid defence to a prosecution under this section that notwithstanding
the conduct of the accused the child did flot
in fact become a juvenile delinquent.

INCOME WAR TAX BILL
MOTION FOR THIRD READING

FURTHER

consideration to the objection raised in respect of the word "films" in the 12th hîne on

378

SENATE

page 5. section 9, of Bill 80, the Income War
Tax Bill. People interested in films want
tiis word stricken out. If it is retained it
will mean a change in the law respecting the
tax on transmission of earnings from the
rental or licence of films in Canada to foreign
owners. The Chairman of the Committee
has been unable to get from the Department
of Finance such word as would permit us to
make an intelligent recommendation; so I
think, to prevent any complaint, the motion
for third reading had better be postponed
until Tuesday next.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The Bill will be

At any rate, as there is danger that we may

MOTION

FOR

THIRD

READING

POSTPONED

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: With the leave of
the Senate, I should like to move the third
reading.

JUNE 18, 1935
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Is there any
particular object in having the third reading
given the day the report is received? Some
honourable member mnight want to give the
matter consideration.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: The only reason
for wanting the Bill passed to-day is the possibility that any delay might prevent the
measure from getting through the Commons.
If the right honourable leader thinks there is
plenty of time before prorogation, we do not
need to give third reading to-day.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I should
think there is time enough left to insure consideration of this Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There is a certain advantage in, and perhaps a necessity
for, a study by the Senate of bis in general
-I arn not speaking of this one particularly
-after they have been eonsidered by a coinmittee. I have known of a report being
brought in and adopted and the bill in question given third reading on the samne day.
In such a case our Minutes contain no record
of the measure until it is passed.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I wîll postpone the
motion for third reading until to-morrow.
FAIR WAGES AND HOURS 0F LABOUR
BILL
REPORT 0F COMMITTEE

Right H.on. Mvr. GRAHM presented the
report of the Standing Committee -on Banking
and -Commerce on Bill' 75, an. Act respecting
Fair Wages and Hourg of Labour in relation
to Public Works and Contracts, and moved
concurrence therein.
Right Hon. M.r. MEIGRIEN: I do flot
think the amenclments can be said to be
important. The first amendment makes more
certain that the effeet of the Bill as ta wages
shall continue throughout the continuance of
a contract, andl so permit oïf adjustments from
time t.o time. The second amendment relates
ta a clause which enables the ýGovernor in
Couneil in special cases to exempt a contract
from the effeet. of the Buti. It provides that
such exemption must be made before the
.
contract is executed.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable senators, I think that generally the Bill as
amended is somewhat improved, but in respect to the hast three lines in section 8 I do
not think I should be doing my duty if I did
flot bring to the attention of honourable
miembers what, from my experience, I believe
wvill be the result of the amendment. Section 8 reads:

379

This Act shahl corne into force on -the first
day of May, 1936, but shahl fot apphy to, any
contract with the Government of Canada existing at the said date, nor to any contracta,
agreements or works thereafter made or undertaken which are by order of the Governor in
Council declared ta be excepted from the operation of the provisions of this Act.
What is possible un-der that language?
Whether a Liberal1 or a Conservative Government is in power, the door is wide open for
its friends to corne and ask: "Give us a
show here; don't exact fromn us the full
application and operation of this measure."
I do not say the Governor in Council will
coinply with the request, but there is full
Qpportunity for the Gavernmnent to, favour
its friends instead of treating ahI contractors
alike, as 1 think every honourable senator
expects. I repeat, the language leaves the
door wide open -for the Governor in Council
to be influenced ta grant special favours. I
have n.o objection ta the other sections of
the Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable senator raised the saine objection before
the committee. At first I feht disposed ta
agree with him that the licence to exempt was
rather too wide; that at ahi events there
was sufficient, power of exemption in clause 3
in -cases of emergency. When, however, it
was .pointedout that that. power of exemption
applied o>nly ta the time featureHon. Mr. .MUR'DOCK: The hours.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: -the fhours,
my view altered, and 1 feit we eould flot
very well take the responsibility of putting
it beyond the power of the Governor in
Counecil to exempt as respects the wage
feature. I do not know that 1 could give
an impressive instance of a situation in which
the Governor in Council would be j.ustified
in making s-uch an exemption. As respects
hours. one could easihy do so. It may be
that in the far North men would much rather
work longer hours-being paid for their time,
of course-and *get the work finished. This

feature was brought home to the committee
in its consideration of another bill. Mine
operators emphasized the fact -that men. in
the northi country had nothing ta do and

nowhere ta go in their off time, and were
desirous, therefore, of working longer hours
in order to make aIl the money they eould
while they were there. A similar condition
might prevail in the case of a contraot. I

realize that this wouhd not apphy ta rates of
wages, but 1 do not hike ta take the re9ponsibility of saying there could flot be a case
in xvhi'eh exemption would bc demanded by
the workmen as welh as by the contractor.

SENATE
I do not think there is danger of any Government opcning the door to aoything like
a general exception. To do so would be
to defy Parliameot in a most vital matter.
Parliament has here laid clown a principle,
and governments would nced to have spccial
resens for mnaking a n exception fromn a
measure nf thjs kind. The exception would
ho onpopular; compliance with the provisions
nf the Bill would be pepular. Gox ernments
seek to, be popular. But as there could be
instances, it se-ems to me, in which the mon
as wveli as the ýcompany might desire to ho
excepted. the door should nnt bo entircly
closed, e'specially during the early operation
of the Act. If the donc were closed wo might
encounter more difficulties than wo otherwise
should. This was my nnly reason for agreing to lot the Bill go througha in its present
form. At first I was of the same opinion as
the honourable gentleman.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
Could the righit
honourabie gentleman tell uis wli this new
provision is inserted? It was not in the nid
Act. What is it for?
Rght Hon. Mr. MEICHE-N: I know whiat
it is for, but at the moment I cannot t.hink
nf a situation in whieh it could ho used with
respect to rates of wages. As I say, I can
s0 far as hours are concorncd. I nma informcd that this prox ision xvas inserted in
the Bill in Council. It may be that xvhat
they had in mind relatcd to heurs, not wagcs,
and that t.hoy did ot rcalize that hours were
covered by clause 3. I feol thoy prnbably
had in mind instances in whicha it would be
necossary. I am ot afraid of any Government
uising t.his clause to defeat the purpose of the
measure in the slightest degree.

CONVENTION FOR REGULATION
0F WIIALING
BESOLUTION

0F

APPItOVAL

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGIIEN moved:
That it is expedient that Parliament do
approv e of the International Convention for
the Regiation of Whaling signed at Geneva
,on the twenty-fourth, day of September, 1931l,
and that this, House do approve of the same.
H1e said: Honourable senators, the convention appears on the Order 'Paper, and, I have
no doubt, bas been read by ail honourable
senators. It covers a kind -of world-wide regulation of the whaling industry. That industry
has been pretty much under the control of
two nations: Great Britain, which can usually
be found active in ail matters of far-flung
trade, and Norway. Whales are sought for
oil; for other purposes too, but almost wholly
for oil. The supply, like that of ail things
found on the land and in the water, bas its
limitations. Until the beginning of thiseentua'y
nlations had littie cause for apprebension as to
there being a sufficient supply of whales for
ail commercial purposes. For example, from
the time of Confederation until the year 1900
the total number of whales caught in the
world was 20,025. Those were cauglit mainly
in the Antarctic, which is for the most part
the home of the whale. But during the tan
years before the War the nurmber of whales
killed averaged more than 12,200 annually;
and fromn 1920 to 1932, up to the time when
the nations began to see tha. 0 omething must
be done, the annual catch ran over 22,500.
Indeed, in 1930, whicba was the year of maximum production of whale nil in the world,
the catch reached the tremendous total of
40,000.
The result of killings on so large a scale bas
been a serious depletion of these animais in
the waters of the world. Accompanying this
depletion there bas been a surplus of the product, se that the peoples of civilization now
flnd themseives in much the same position as
Canada is in with respect to ber pulp and
paper and forests. We bave been in such a
hurry to destroy a limited natural resource
that we bave hurled it on the markets at a
loss. Consequently the League of Nations,
tbrough its proper instrument, began a study
of the subjeet, and the consequence of that
study is this convention. The nations which
bave executed it are named on the first page
of the convention, fromn which it will be seen
that it is already binding on the greater part
of the world.
We in Canada are interested in whaling in
the North Pacifie. 1 helieve none at ail is
done in the Atlantic off our shores. There

381

are four posts in Queen Charlotte Island, out
of wbich whalin-g vessels proceed, but the
number of whales captured by these vessels
is negligible when compared with the destruction wbjcha bas been going on elsewhere. The
United States has heen intensely interested.
Indeed, since the adopton of this convention
that country bas made an additional agreement with Great Britain andl Norway for
still further limitation in regions to the south.
Those tbree countries bave undertaken to
submit the additional pact to other nations,
and it bas been submnitted to us.
The metbod of carrying on the whaling inHundreds of
Justry is very interesting.
vessels go out froma many posts every year.
So evolved bas the method become that some
vesseis are equipped to carry on botb slaughtering and manufacturing operations. Tbey
catch the whales, extract the products and
tbrow away the refuse. In fact they now
perform most of the operations at sea.
There is an exception to the general scope
of the treaty. It covers all whales except
wbat is called the toothed whale. Whaies of
that ciass are not protected at all because,
I presume, they have not been worth chasing. The protection applies to what are
called baleens, or wbalebone wbales, of ail
kinds. The killing during a deýfinite season
of certain types which have become nearly
extinet bas been entirely forbidden. What
the convention does with respect to most
varieties of haleens, though, is to prevent the
capture of the yauýng, wbich are cailed calves,
and of feanales when attended by the young.
As I studied the treaty I was struok by this
fact. The whaling industry is in some respects analogous to our paper and lumber
industries, and it is precisely analogous te
the oil industry of this continent. The UJnited
States of America realized that its oul resources were fiowing away in ail directions,
and indeed during latter years almost universally at a ioss. This limited natural resource was heing depleted day by day, and
necessarily sO under uncontrolled competition.
So that country set to work to control the
production and exploitation of its oil wclls,
and after many years of difficulty, entailed
mainly by constitutional restrictions, it bas
succeeded in gaining control. Now, as regards
the whaling industry, all countries seek te
take steps such as the United States took
with respect te, oul.
There is ne use in one country limiting its
catch of whales unless all whale-seeking countries do the same. And they ahl have agreed
te limitation, as stated in this treaty. It is
lef t toecd country te decide as te thc ma-

SENATE
chinery by which it will execute the agreement. It is required to file with the League
of Nations a statement as to the executive
machinery in operation, so that every signatory may know what is being done by all
other signatories. It would seem that this is
a definite and conspicuous instance illustrating where practical co-operation can have results. I have no doubt at all that this House
will ratify the convention with enthusiasm,
and will hope that it may be followed by
other acts of international co-operation productive of equally beneficial results.
Hon. A. D. MacRAE: Honourable senators,
undoubtcdly the effort to save the whale
from extinction is a miove in the right direction, but it does seem to me to be largely
a matter of sentiment rather than of commercia. importance. Two generations ago
whale oil occupied a very important place in
the commercial life of the world. In -the old
days sperm whale oil was used for lighting
purposes, and at one time it was worth as
much as a dollar and a quarter a gallon in this
country. To-day, of course, it is unsaleable as
an illuminant, for the simple reason that the
oil .companies have pe-rfected substitutes.
Whale oil is very different from what it used
to be. Modern refining practice turns it out
almost as clear as water, and the higher grades,
being free from acid, are used in the manufaeture of oleomargarine. But even, for this purpose it is of relatively sligh-t importance, compared with the competing vegetable oils derived from cotton-seed, coco-nuts and soya
beans. The production of soya bean oil has
increased tremendously in recent years.
Thiere is a good deal -of romance attaching to
whale hunting. I was interested in what the
right honourable leader of the House said with
respect to the whale catch previous to 1905.
On our Pacifie coast we caught as many as
2,000 w-hales one year. Next year our catch
was very much reduced, and it has inever come
back to that high figure.
These great mammals are easily caught
witdh modern equipment. Steel craft, somewhat similar to tug boats and capable of
sixteen knots an hour, are equipped with
harpoon guns. A bomb is attached to the
end of the harpoon, and the explosion instantly
kills the whale if a vital part is struck. I
know of an instance where a sperm whale, after
being harpooned, towed the boat for twelve
heurs even though its engines were running
full speed astern. This will give honourable
members sema idea of the immense strength
of these huge mammals.
According to biologists the whale was at
one time a land animal. Whale meat conRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

pares favourably witb horse flesh, and I know
of attempts to -distribute it on a commercial
basis. Its nutritional value is as high as that
of beef, but it has a flavour all its owyn, andto my taste-not very agreeable.
I -do net know hiow w-halers will be able te
distinguish female whales with calves. When
born, the calf measures from filfteen, to twenty
feet, and six weeks or two months later it will
have grown to twenty-five feet. Then it can
be seen. But once you kill th-e mother whale
you might as well kill the calf, for it usually
goes into the station with ber.
I think the romance surrounding whale fishing justifies this treaty, even though, as I say,
the fishery is declining in commercial importance.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
I should
like to ask my right honourable friend -to what
extent aborigines on the coasts of the territories of the various high contracting parties
engage in the killing of whales. I see the
convention does not apply to
aborigines dwelling on the coests of the
territories of the High Contracting Parties
provided that:
(1) They only use canoes. pirogues or other
exclusively native craft propelled by oars or
sails;
(2) They do not carry firearms;
(3) They are not in the employment of
persons other than aborigines;
(4) They are not under contract to deliver
the produets of their whaling to any third
person.
I do not know of any whale hunting by
aborigines on the Atlantic coast, but I imragne
that on the Pacifie coast it is carried on to
a fairly large exteut.
I notice the use for the first time of the
word "baleens" as a synonym for whalebone
whales.
We have in French the word
"baleine" only.
Can the right honourable gentleman inform
me what are right whales, menti-oned in article
4?
Hon. Mr. MacRAE: I ,think I can answer
the honourable gentleman. The right whale
is the reali whalebone whale. It is found only
in the Aretie. I -have known of only one being
captured in the Pacifie. Right whales do not
frequent temperate waters.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
be found in the Antaretic.

They are to

Hon. Mr. MacRAE: Probably. The whales
caught by Scotch and Bioston whalers are
known as right whales. They are the sole
source of whalebone. However, whalebone is
out of vogue, for it is no longer needed for
stays. At one time it was worth £3,000, or
about $15,000, a ton. Now it is unsaleable.

JUNE 18, 1935
Hon. Mr. DANDURArND: This -convention
shows what ca-operation wjll do and' to what
extient it can be oa-rried out under the
League of Nations-in spite of what my
honourahie f riend to my righit (rH.an. M-r.
Casgrain) thinks of the League.
Hon. Mr. 'CASORAIN: I should like- ta
know what provision is made ta punish those
who break the law.

It is not provided

Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: Y.es; each
nation agrees ta take withiýn the limits of its
jurisdiction appropriate, measures. ta insure
application of the provisions of the conventier
and punishment of affenders. I believe the
Fisheries Acet is wide enough ta enable Canada
ta carry out the provisions af t'he treaty. I do
flot think an(y further legisiatian will be necessary-something which, no doubt, the honourable senator will be pleased ýta hear.
The treaty also provides; that there must be
complete use as far as passible of ail products
of the whalýe. It f orbidts the practiýce ai eatracting only what is immediately valuable and
throwing away th-e rest of the carcass.
Han. Mr. GRIESBACI1: I notice amang
the high contradlting parties are several cauntries whose natfonals neyer caught a whale
in thýeir lives-Aiba-nia, Poland, Rouinania,
Switzeriand. But there is a significant omission: Sweden is flot a party ta the convention. My recallection. is that Sweden has a

TRAIL SMELTER
RUEOLUTION

CONVENTION

OF APPROVAL

Right Hon. ARTHUTR MEIGHEN moved:
That it is expedient that Parliament do
approve of the Convention between Canada
and the United States relating ta certain
complaints arising fram the operation of the

smelter at Trail, British Columbia" signed at
Ottawa on the l5th day of April, 1935, and
that this Ilouse do approve of -the same.
He said: Honourable menibers, this is
another convention which we are asked ta
ratify. We ail know the very large smelting
plant at Trail, British Columbia, known as
the Trail smelt-er, situated in the valley ai
the Columabia river and only a few miles
fi-rn the United States border. This industry
has grown ta enaormous proportions over a
long period af years and is engaged in smelting ares of British Columbia and of certain
northern parts of the Prairie Provinces.
In its operations the smelter emits suiphur
dioxide from its smake stacks. I have heard
of the effects cf this chemnical upon verdure
in the neig.hbourhood of the smelter, but it
appears that the prevailing winds carry the
fumes south tawards the State of Washington.
Injury claimed ta, be done by this suiphur
dioxide, dhiefly in the State cd Washington,
and altagether in the United States, is the
subjeet-matter of this treaty.
I tbink it was in 1927 that the United
States Consul in Canada first called attention
ta the grievance, and as a result a reference
was made ta the International Joint Commission by bath countries with a view ta
The
finding a remedy for the grievance.
Commission cmplayed experts, supplied by
tbe twa Governments, who examined inta
what scicntific rnethods; might be adapted ta
diminish, if not entirely negative, the hanefiil
effeots complained of. Finally, after several
years, the Commission made a report, which
it submitted ta each Govcrnment. It assessed
at $350,000 the damage done in the United
States up ta, I think, September, 1931; at
any rate, very close ta the end of that year.
The United States Gavernment declined ta
accept the report, and continued ta insist
upon an adjustment at tbe expense of Canada.
As a consequence, thbe treaty we are now asked
ta ratify was entered into with the United
States.
Under this treaty a judicial tribunal is ta
be erected, ta consist of a chairman who is
impartial and disinterested, being neither a
British subjeet nar a citizen of the United
States, and two ather members, aonc from
Canada and one fi-cen the United States. The
business of this tribunal will be ta answer
four questions ta be submitted ta it. This
suibmission, I arn glad ta say, is based an an
acknowledgrnent by the United States of the
correctness of the sumn of 8350,000 asc representing the damages up ta the end of 1931.
As ta the future, t!he International Joint
Commission's repart recommended certain
methads f or reducing the effect ad this poison.
and in this respect the treaty meets the views

3s4

SENATE

of the United States. By the treaty the
ntew tribunal is asked to determine whether
or not operation under conditions that permit
of the emission of this chemical should be
prohibited. Then, assuniing that the answer
is in the negativ e, and that it would be
unfair and inequitable to put a stop to the
industry, the tribunal is asked what ought
to be done to reduce Ioss te a minimum, and
what provision should he made for assessing
the loss and collecting damages as time goes
on. The questions all appear in the treaty.
I need net read them.
It onlv remains to be added that Consolidated Smelters freely acknowledge liability
to the extent that Canada is liable, and agree
to indemnify this country in respect of anything it may have to pay. Provision ha.
already been made, I believe, for the payment of the $350,000. I understand that Consolida:ed Snelters have acquiesced, perhaps
not without reluctance, in the form of the
questions to be submitted to the new tribunal.
At all events, they will e responsible for
assessments that follow reference to the
tribunal.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: I do not
suppose any exception can be taken to this
agreement with the United States. I only
wish that our friends to the south would
agree te a tribunal to assess the damage
occasioned to Canada by the diversion of
water at Lake Michigan.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should like to
ask my right henourable friend to give us
a statement as to something which may net
ferm part of this convention, but which is
very close to it and very close to our own
treasury. What arrangements, if any, have
been made with the company operating at
Trail to compensate the Government for its
disbursements to date, and for future disbursements if the damage continues?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do net
know just what security has been given, if
any, but I know it is provided for. The
Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company,
the only Canadian interest which is primarily
affected, has concurred in the conclusion of
this convention and bas undertaken to indcmnify the Government in respect of aIl
the resuiting financial or other obligations.
Consequently, while from a theoretical point
of view the convention imposes obligations
on the Canadian Government, there will be
practically no burden upon the treasury.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

The convention, which was approved by
the Senate of the United States on the 5th of
June this year, provides for a division of the
expenses.
I quite concur in the remark of my honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand).
I hope that our example will be followed by
the United States, and that it will show a
willingness to deal with the long-standing
and vexed question of the Chicago diversion,
unless we can ,hope for its settlement by the
St. Lawrence Waterways Treaty, which has
not yet been ratified by the United States.
The motion was agreed to.
PRIVATE BILL
COMMONS AMENDMENTS

CONCURRED IN

The Hon. the SPEAKER informed the
Senate that he had received a message from
the House of Commons with Bill C2, an Act
respecting the Wapiti Insurance Company,
to rwhich that House had made certain
amendments.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved concurrence in the a.mendments.
He said: I see no objection, to these
amendments being taken into consideration
now. Through some error of the draftsman
this Bill referred to " the Insurance Act." As
everyone kneows, we have three or four statutes
under different titles, dealing with insurance,
but no Insurance Act. The Bil should have
referred to the Canadian antd British Insurance Companies Act, which governs the
Wapiti Company. That our committee did
not observe this is a mistake for which I am
responsible.
The other amendment made by the Commons merely giives the correct title to the
certificate. It is a certificate of registry, not
a licence, and the change is a proper one.
Ion. Mr. DANDURAND: It just happened
that we did not have the Superintendent of
Insurance by our side. He would have drawn
attention to those ,matters.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
The motion was agreed te.
WEIGHTS AND MEASURES BILL
MESSAGE

FROM COMMONS REFERRED
COMMITTEE

TO

The Hon. the SPEAKER informed the
Senate that he had received a message from
ti House of Comimons reading as follows:
That this House bath agreed to all the amendments made by the Senate to amend Bill No. 70,
an Act to amend the Weights and Measures

JUNE 18, 1935
Act, except sub-clause 5 of section 10 proposed
to be added te the Bill by the sixth amendment.
which is not agreed to for the following
reasons:If allowed to stand, this section would
practically nullify section 63 of the Weights
and Measures Act in so far as its enforcement
in connection with pre-packaged articles is
concerned.
Evidence of short weight under the Weights
and Measures Act must be obtained by a test
purchase,
usually
made
by
independent
shoppers.
Such being the case, it is pointed out that
to get the "average weight or measure of a
reasonable number of other articles of the
same kind on the same occasion" is clearly
impossible. It is net practicable to purchase
what -might be considered "a reasonable number
of articles of the same kind" and an inspection
of pre-packaged articles in a store by an inspector, either before or after the making of a
test purchase, is not "on the same occasion."
The trader is adequately safeguarded against
picayune or vexations prosecutions, by the fact
that all proceedings under section 63 of the
Act must receive the consent of the Minister
of Trade and Commerce in writing.
The amendment proposed' by the Senate is
substantially the same as section 10 of the
Imperial Sale of Foods Act. In addition that
Act provides that an inspecter can compel the
trader 'to sell him short weight articles as
evidence for prosecution when short weight in
pre-packaged articles is found on inspection on
the trader's premises.
Such authori-ty is not contained in the Canadian Weights and Measures Act, which renders
the proposed amendment unnecessary while
making the enforcement of section 63 extremely
difficult in se far as pre-packaged 'articles are
concerned.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members of the Senate committee will have
no difficulty in understanding the effect of the
amendment made by us, and the reasoning
now adivanced by the other House against that
amendment. At the moment I am not prepared to say just how this matter should be
dealt with. We might meet the objection by
incorpcrating the British provision. I know
there is a feeling that it is going to be very
diffieult, if net impossible, however good' the
intent, to comply with this 'new law in such 'a
way as to avoid prosecution. Therefore I
want to explore to see whether it is not
possible to retain the Senate amendmient, and
te overcome the objections advanced, by incorporating tsomething like the British provision.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Could not this
message from the other House be referired to
our Banking and Commerce Conmittee?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If it is in
order, I move that the message of the other
House be referred to the Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.

I

not

Right Hon. Mr. MIEIGHEN: Perhaps I
may explain the measure.
The Bill provides a stabilization fund of,
I think, $62,000,000, the amount accruing to
the treasury of Canada by way of profit resulting from taking over of the gold of the
chartered banks at the price at which it then
stood in the banks' books and the sulbsequent
rise of about 75 per cent to the present
market price.
The source of money, of course, is one
thing; the principle of stabilization is another.
Everyone knows that in the present chaotic
condition of exchange virtually all countries
of the world-most of which are off the gold
standard-maintain some sort of stability in
the value of their currency in relation to
that of other countries by means of a stabilization fund, buying and selling as may be
necessary te prevent wild and erratie valuatiens, which greatly disturb trade. We are
following that example. It is true the fund
we are establishing is net a huge one, but it
is hoped it will be sufficient. To date we
have got along without any special fund.
CIVIL SERVICE GRADE IV
ALLEGED DISCRIMINATION-REPLY TO

Before the Orders of the day:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, on Thursday last the honourable

information, was to be open only to male

REVISED
EDITION

SENATE
tor I cannot do better than read a memorandum furnished me at the instance of the Civil
Service Commission.
In connection with the examination now
being held by the Civil Service Commission
for clerks, grade 4, with university graduation,

there appears te be a certain amount of mis-

understanding. This is not a new class, but
one which has been in existence for several
years, and positions in the class in general ýare
not limited to university graduates nor to
members of the male sex. The positions for
which the current examination is being held,
however, are suitable for men only, and on
that account this particular examination was
limited to male candidates, the Commission
feeling that it would be unfair te invite
applications from female candidates when no
positions were at present available for them.
For positions in which female appointees will
be suitable, however, the examinations will be
open to them.
INCOME WAR TAX BILL
THIRD READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
third reading of Bill 80, an Act to amend the
Income War Tax Act.
He said: Honourable members, the third
reading was deferred on Thursday last in order
that we might, if necessary, receive submissiens from the film industry, 'which had raised
objection to the inclusion of the word "films"
in line 12, section 9, page 5 of the Bill. However, representatives of this industry have
since advised me that they do net wish to
carry their objection further. Consequently
there is no necessity of longer deferring the
third reading.
The motion was agreed te, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.
POST

OFFICE BILL (NEWSPAPER
OWNERSHIP)
REPORT

OF COMMITTEE

Hon. G. V. WHITE moved concurrence in
the report of the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce on Bill 50, an Act to
amend the Post Office Act (Newspaper
Ownership).
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, we are now gathered together for
the purpose of officiating at ,the funerai of that
stillborn Bill 50, which calme before the Senate
some few weeks ago. As previously stated,
this measure has passed the House of Commons on several occasions. But I have yet to
find any member of the Senate, other than
myself, who is in faveur of it. Personally, I
think the Senate is imaking a mistake. And
particularly I consider the report now before
us is coucbed in very unfortunate language.
Right Hon.

Mr. MEIGHEN.

Just imagine, if possible, the highest-class
representatives of the Parliament of Canada
undertaking to dissociate themselves from the
principle of a Bill-if there is a principle
involved-in thiE language:
The Committee recommend that the Bill be
not further proceeded with for the reason that
in the opinion of the Committee its passage
would, be ineffective to attain its purpose.
The man in the street and the man in the
back concessions-I think I have heard that
expression somewhere before-will ask, "If
the Bill would be ineffective to attain its purpose, why does the Senate net put the
language of the measure into such concrete
and definite form that the desired object
would be attained?"
What is the purpose of this Bill? So far
that has net been placed ibefore the Senate
of Canada, to my knowledge; and, having
heard some of the discussions before the committee, I do inot believe it was placed before
that body. The requirements of this Bill are:
(1) There shall be filed with the Post Office
Department a sworn statement showing the
names and post office addresses of the editor
and managing editor, publisher, business
managers and owners of publications using the
mails. (2) If the publication be owned by a
corporation, its name .a.nd address must be
given, and also, immediately thereunder, the
names and addresses of stockholders owning
one per cent .or more of the total amount of

stock. (3) The names of bondholders, mortgagees or other security holders owning one
per cent or more of the total amount of bonds,
mortgages or other securities rmust be stated.
(4) With respect to the second and third
requirements which I have just cited, the list
of owners, stockholders and security holders,
if any, as appearing on the books of the company, shall, in ea.ch case where a. namie is
shown as that of a trustee or in any other
relationship, disclose the identity of the person or corporation. for whom such trustee or
representative is acting. (5) There must be
a declaration of the average number of copies
of each issue of the publication sold or distributed through the mails or otherwise te paid
subscribers during the preceding six months.
And all this information must be printed in
the second issue of the publication after the
filing of the statement with the Lost Office
Department.
Those provisions do net appear to me to
be unreasonable. I think the man in the
street -and the man in the back concessions
-I repeat that expression-would regard it
as fair to them and all concerned to make
public the information that this Bill calls for.

JUNE 18, 1935
Is this proposed legislation something new?
No. Honourable members of the House of
Commons have on three or four occasions
passed a similar bill, which the Senate in its
great wisdom has turned down. In this partieular instance the Senate undertook to give
the six months' hoist to the measure without
any discussion at all, and then after a short
debate there was a reference to a committee.
And we now find the Bill sent back to us
with the committee's report, which I have
read.
Personally I am not concerned with the
passage of this Bill. It is no child of mine.
I happened to father this measure from another place because it appeared that if I
did not do so it would lack a sponsor. Again
I say that I have not found a single honourable member of this House, except myself,
who is in favour of it. But legislation to the
same intent is in effect in England, the
United States and Australia. Yet, although
the House of Commons has passed a bill
like this on three or four occasions, the Senate
says that we do not want it in Canada.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Does the
honourable gentleman say it is in effect in
England?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:'

I said so.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
that.

I never heard

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That is the trouble.
It would have been better, in my humble
judgment, that the right honourable leader
and other honourable members of this House
should get the facts with respect to this
situation than that the Senate should attempt,
as it did on the 4th of June, to shelve the
whole thing. I think that in consequence of
what has been done on the Newspaper
Ownership Bill, if the d'ay efver comes-and
I believe it will come-when there is a more
pronounced sentiment than there bas ever
been for the abolition of the Senate, it will
be said that this body of distinguished and
honourable representatives of the people had
no time nor patience to deal with a measure
intended for the protection and the information of the ordinary citizen, and that we
threw it to one side because we wanted none
Of it.
Let me put this question to some of my
honourable friends. Suppose that after we
went home or to hotel or office this evening
someone should telephone and give us a long
and exhaustive argument on some question
of considerable interest and importance. Unless we recognized the voice or were told
who the speaker was, our first question would
be, "Who is speaking, please?" And what
92584-251

387

should we be apt to do if the caller replied,
"Oh, never mind that"? I imagine we might
be discourteous enough to hang up the receiver and out off the lady -or gentleman who
undertook to a'pproach us in that way. And
if a stranger met us on the street and
attempted to expound certain views, no
matter how definite, consistent and logical
they might be, the first thing any one of
us would ask is, "Who are you?"
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: May I ask the
honourable senator a question? The honourable senator was present when the Bill was
being fully discussed by the committee. He
heard the statement made over and over again
that it was not humanly possible to find out
the real owners of publications. Will the
honourable senator please tell this House
whether or not it would be possible to find
out the real owners, if the Bill were passed
and placed on the Statute Book?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: If it is impossible,
as my honourable friend has stated, to find
out that information, then more shame to
this Canada of ours. It is pretty nearly time
that the man in the street knew it was impossible to find out who is paying for the
promulgation of ideas through the press. If
the honourable gentleman is right, as he likely
is, the more shame to Canada that we cannot place on the Statute Book a regulation
which will smoke out even the press of our
country. With the greatest respect to our
splendid press, this whole question can be
summed up in a few words: the power of the
press. That is all that is involved.
I think the average citizen of Canada will
not take too kindly to the attitude of the
Senate, which has dealt with this matter very
superficially. At least the Senate started to
deal with it superficially: in my opinion the
question has not been fully considered yet.
I do not know one-two-three about the newspaper question, as I am sure many honourable members of this House do, but I feel
that to adopt the report now before us would
be unfortunate for the prestige and future
status of the Senate. This broken crutch of
a report recommends "that the Bill be not
further proceeded with for the reason that in
the opinion of the committee its passage
would be ineffective to attain its purpose."
Are we powerless to frame a Bill that would
attain the purpose? What purpose? The disclosure 'of those who are promulgating ideas
in this or that paper here or there throughout
Canada. In other words, the purpose is to
give the average reader the very information
that we ourselves would expect if a stranger
communicated with us. I repeat that person-

388

SENATE

ally I am not concerned about whether or
not the Bill passes, but in my opinion the
adoption of this report would be to the lasting detriment of the prestige of the Senate.
JuAst a few words in conclusion. In the
course of my remarks on the 4th of June,
when I moved the second reading, I made
certain statements with reference to the London Free Press and the London Advertiser,
and also the Montreal Star and the Montreal
Herald. It has been brought to my attention
that from something I said it might appear
I was unfair or discourteous to Mr. Rossie,
the editor of the London Advertiser. While
I do not know Mr. Rossie, I am given to
understand that he is a high-class gentleman,
a man of independence and consistency, and
I want to assure the Senate that no word
of mine was intended as any reflection upon
him. I simply made a statement with respect
to the two papers in London because I
thought it was generally known that the one
interest, namely the Conservative Free Press,
was dominating the allegedly Liberal Advertiser. This is personal: I thought, and I still
think, that the readers of the Advertiseryes, and the readers of the Free Press-ought
to have properly before them from time to
time full information with respect to that
situation. There was no word of disrespect
or discourtesy intended towards Mr. Rossie as
a gentleman and as editor of the London
Advertiser.
I do not for a moment imagine that anything I have said will change the opinion of
any honourable member of this House. I
fancy that the minds of honourable members
on this question are the same now as they
have been for eight or ten years. But again
I express the prophecy that some day the
treatment this Bill bas received here will be
broadcast from one end of Canada to the
other as one of the substantial reasons for
the abolition of the Senate-which has been
advocated every once in a while.

a newspaper, either regularly or occasionally,
professionally or in any other way, had to
sign his name, readers would know exactly
who was addressing them. Sueh a requirement would have the further advantage of
establishing a reputation for the publicist,

world.
anonymously, no credit would attach to
writers whose culture, experience and knowledge of world affairs give value to their
opinions.
I attended the meetings of the committee.
I found that this Bill would apply only to
newspapers sent through the mails. I found
also that it would be easy for the proprietor
of a newspaper ,to vest nominal ownership
in a trust company. This, to my knowledge,
has already been done in certain cases. Consequently it would be very difficult for the
public to ascertain the real ownership. The
committee in'structed its legal adviser to
devise an amendment which would salvage
what was attainable by the Bill. The amendment was found to be no improvement, and
so we were faced with the necessity of voting
against the adoption cf the proposedi legislation.
I am ready to support any Bill which will
effect the object I have in view, that of
giving full publicity to the writers of newspaper articles. It is truc, as my right honourable friend from Eganville (Right Hon.
Mr. Graham) has said, that a paper makes
its own reputation and its views carry weight
regardless of who contributes to its columns;
for instance, the London Timess-or the
Brockville ýRecorder.

HonourHion. RIAOUL DANDURAND:
able members of the Senate, unifortunately
for myself, I was not present during the
debate on the motion for second reading of
this Bill. Had I been here I should have
stated my view, which I have frequently expressed, that the public are entitled to know
who is speaking to them. The question is
how to make sure that the real' identity is
disclosed. My wish weuld have been that
the procedure followed in some countries
should be adopted here. But that would
have been merely a wish, for the Federal
Parliament would not have power to give it
effect. If every writer who contributed to

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
not always so, and, generally speaking, I
hold firmly to the view that the public are
interested in knowing who is addressing them.
I recognize that this is a matter of provincial jurisdiction. This being the case, in
order to give jurisdiction to the Parliament
of Canada, the Bill seeks to rea.ch newspapers
which circulate through the mails; that is, it
is not general legislation to cover all the
newspapers of this country. But, as I have
said, even the proprietors of newspapers so
affected .could frustrate the purpose of the
Bill by vesting ownership in a trust company.

Hear, hear.

JUNE 18, 1935
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I have not a shadow of
apology to offer for the action of the Banking
and Commerce Committee in relation to this
Bill, nor for the framing of the report which
is now under consideration. It takes this
form at my suggestion, because it empresses
the reason why the commîittee felt it should
report against the Bill.
The honourable senator fron Parkdale
(Hon. Mr. .Murdock) says: "Shame on the
Senate! Shame on our brains, our resourcefulness, our ingenuity! that we cannot frame
a Bilil to meet this purpose, if we want the
purpose met." I did not introduce the
measure, and I was not responsible for its
introduction in the other House, but I am
prepared to assume that those wlio were
did the best they could. I do not think its
sponsor in the other House intentionally
brought in something defective and futile.
I think he consulted the best lawyers at his
command. He is himself a lawyer. I know
we have at the command of this Senate just
about as able a counsel as one would wish
for this purpose. But it is primarily the
duty of those members who introduce and
sponsor a Bill to see that it effects its purpose. Surely it does not lie in the mouth of
those members te cry shame on us because
we do not am'end and reform their ineffective
work. 'Before crying shame let them reform
the work themselwes.
Hon. Mr. MURDOOK: I have done quite
a lot this session already.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, I know,
but it was work that could be done. When
it is something that cannot be done lie cries
shame on us. He says: "Why can it not
be done? It is done in. England and in the
United States." I had not heard before that
such legislation was in effect in England; in
fact I had been informed it was not. But
whether or not it is on the Statute Book
there does not matter one iota. I have made
a study of its operation in the States, where
it is on the Statute Book. It has no effect
there at alil; in fact it is a farce in every
State of the Union. We have in this Bill
imitated the framers of that legislation. I
have no doubt they did their best. We
have copied it, and I assume it is our best.
Does anybody assert that this Bill wil enable us to get at the ownership of newspapers?
And can anybody suggest an amendment te
enable us to do se? It must be remembered
that this country is a confederation. The
Dominion Parliament has jurisdiction in respect of the Post Office. There our jurisdiction begins and ends. We can stipulate the

389

conditions which a paper must live up to in
order to be transmitted through the mails. If
it is necessary to stipulate those conditions,
somebody has to frame them. They must be
set out in black and white, and must be such
that the person reading the newspaper will
know who owns it. I should like to see some
responsible gentleman essay that task. I
wrote a newspaper yesterday inviting it to
get its lawyer to do so. I undertake now to
pay the expenses of that newspaper's lawyer
if lie wil draft effective legislation.
The Legislature of Ontario is in charge of
all matters affecting civil rights. This matter
affects civil rights. Therefore the Dominion
Parliament can legislate only from the standpoint of the Post Office. The Provincial
Government can hold an investigation, if
there is legislation for that purpose, and can
call on the officers of a trust company in
which a newspaper is vested, and find out
the names of all persons the company holds
for, then go to those and find out whom they
hold for, and continue the investigation for
six months, if necessary, until finally it gets
at the real ownership. I do not know of any
other way of securing the information. The
Legislature of Ontario has full jurisdiction
in respect te the Advertiser and the Globe,
as has the Legislature of Quebec in respect
to the Herald. They might get at the information in that way. If it is a matter of such
colossal importance that failure to act will
shake the very foundations of Confederation
and threaten the very life of the Senate, why
not go to .the provincial governments and set
them in motion? They have plenary authority; they cannot be stopped.
But neither the Legislature of Quebec nor
of Ontario can frame legislation that will
compel divulgence of the information sought,
though those who are required to furnish
certain particulars tell the whole truth.
It must be remembered that many newspapers, whether rightly or wrongly, consider this proposal a great injustice. I have
never argued it is unjust; I do not argue it
is just. There may be justification for a
rule to apply to newspaper corporations that
should not apply to other corporations, but
newspaper owners resent it as an invasion of
their private rights. Consequently they will
obey the law, but they will not do any more
than ,obey it. In short, they will comply with
the letter-and there is no dishonesty in so
complying-but that is all they will do. Yeu
cannot frame legislation that they dannot
comply with fully, yet without naming the
actual owners. I invite my honourable friend
te engage a llawyer and try to have such
legislation fraïmed.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: No chance.

SENATE
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Neither will
he try to draft it himself. Those who criticize
this House will not try it. It is one thing
to frame a rigid set of conditions a pa.per
must live up to, and we know they can live
up to well enough. It is another thing, with
plenary powers of inquiry, to dig to the
bottom. As soon as you have reached bottom
you may bave to start all over again, for
the ownership may change three days after.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: If the owners of
newspapers using the post office facilities
swear to the information that is proposed, why
will you not know?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Because they
swear to the ownership on file. We will say
a newspaper is owned by the Smithson Corporation Limited. But who owns the Smithson Corporation Limited? You will have to
invoke provincial powers and get the record
of its stockholders. You find that some of
the stock is owned by the John Jones Corporation, some by the Eriedale Corporation.
You are not a bit further ahead. Then you
proceed to find out who owns the Eriedale
Corporation. Perhaps an individual owns it
in trust. How wiil you frame legislation to
get down all those steps?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: If all those companies own one per cent or more of stock,
will the information not be valuable to the
man in the street-the ordinary citizen?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No.
My
honourable friend has not understood me at
all. The first company I spoke of owns all
the stock. Is it any good to the man in the
street to know that? Not the slightest, because the stock of that company may be owned
by threc, four or half a dozen other corporations. There may be trust company intervention, or there may be none at all. Now,
frame legislation, if you will, to lead from
one step to the next, from that to the next,
and su on to the end. Let us be practical.
I should like to see someone try it. The
United States tried it. An affidavit has to
be made that the information given as to
ownership is correct, but the information does
not tell anything that is of any value at all
to the public.
Now, that is my difficulty, and those who
say to us, "You are no good," I ask that they
do better. Let them draft legislation to effect
what they desire. When the Banking and
Commerce Committee says this legislation is
ineffective, it says the truth. But it is not
trying to hide behind its own impotence. We
invite others to do just a little better. We
say: "Go ahcad and frame conditions that
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

cannot be easily evaded." Remember this,
however. Those who feel such legislation is
unjust and discriminatory will obey, but
they will do no more than obey-they will not
go one inch further. You will have loaded
on the press of Canada considerable expenses.
You will have discriminated in favour of
those who do not use the mails at all, and
given them a marked advantage. You will
have ended exactly where you began.
If there is an instance where there is something in the nature of deceit, I do not know
of it. I think everybody lias an idea, rightly
or wrongly, that the majority stock of the
Advertiser is held by some persons who did
not own it before and who may have a Conservative leaning. Well, if it is of such
colossal consequence, the Legislature of Ontario, under its plenary power, can legislate
and go right down all the various steps. If
it is thought worth while, why not get it
done? But we are threatened with extinction
because we are doing what obviously is the
right thing tu do. I can remember when, in
years gone by, the Senate was cursed for rejecting a Bill involving tremendous railway
expenditure. But it is not now cursed for
so-called sins of that kind; it is blessed. I do
not think the public of Canada are very
much interested in this measure. I must be
a very ignorant, obscure person, for I never
knew before coming to the Senate that the
legislation was ever before the other House.
An Hon. SENATOR: What benefit would
the trutlh be if we did know it?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
know. I am assuming there is some tremendous benefit expected. I do not sec that
any great benefit could result. But I am
explaining the reason the committee did take
this course. I remember when, not twenty
odd years ago, everybody in the Dominion
knew who owned the Winnipeg Free Press.
If this proposed measure had been in effect
it would have appeared that the readers of
the Free Press were being taught their polities
and economics by Clifford Sifton; whereas, as
a matter of fact, although he owned the
paper, it was not his mind that spoke through
the Free Press in any way. Consequently the
information would have been a little misleading. In other cases the facts might have
been stated, and it might have been a good
thing. That point I do not stop tu argue.
lt bas been dealt with by the honourable
senators from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan) and Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham).
I believe the reason the committee
gave is the right reason, and therefore it was

JUNE 18, 1935

against the Bill.

HARBOUR

INQUIRY AND DISCUSSION
Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Honouraxble gentlemen, before the Orders of the Day are
called I should like to ask the right honour-

able gentleman who leads the Government
if he is aware of the present state of the
harbour of Montreal and the channel of the
river below that point.
Navigation companies, the Shipping Federation, boards of
trade, chambers cf commerce and business

men generally are gravely concerned about
the condition which prevails. The 'harbour
of Montreal is drying out. Whether this is
due to 'Chicago's interference with the waters;
of Lake Michigan-and I dare say it is partly
due to that-or whetýher it is due to the
damming of some of the lakes and rivers
flowing into the St. Lawrence river, or to a
lack of rain-something which cannot bp
complained cf to-day-the situation ie appalling. It is appalling not oniy to thŽ city
of Montreal, but also to the people of the
West generally, becausc Montreal, by reason
of its elevators and other facilities. which
have been provided under both administrations, is known as the Western h~arbour.
It seerns to me that something ought ta
be donie te correct the existing situation. It
has been said that the erection cf a barrage
in the St. Lawrence river below Montreal
would hold back the water so that the harbour and navigation would not be endangered.
I am bound to say that for ocean navigation
the old harbour of Quebec is taking the place
of the harbour of Montreal.

oniy to an accident. I am asking the right
honourable gentleman, when he has timiý, to
gather the lacts in regard to this situation
and te inquire whetber semething cannot be
done to prevent the disaster which threatens.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Bef are the right
honourable gentleman answers, would lie
allow me one word? I promise net to make
a speech. I have oocupied the attention of
this flouse for heurs and heurs on this same
subjeet in the hast thirty years; but the more
you know about a thing the more you learn
about it.
A captain on a boat going .to Chicago said
that for twenty miles before it arrived at
Chicago ail the ýbuoys were canted south.
One other thing. Lake Michigan used te
empty into the St. Lawrence. It is a very
large lake, some 225 or 250 miles long and
40 miles wide. That means there is a great
watershed. Ail that vast watershed peured
inte Lake Michigan and emptied into the St.
Lawrence. But now ail the water, inchuding
the ramn that fahîs on the surface of the lake,
is geing down through the Chicago diversion.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: There is no
question whatever that much of the low water
trouble we bave in Canada is due te the Chicage diversion. No oeecau estimate the proportion of the trouble which is due te that
cause. but it is a large proportion. I have ne
special information as te the present condi-

tion of the harbour of Montreal; that is to
say, I certainly could not add anything to the
knowledge of honourable senators from that
district. For the moment I can only call
attention to Bill 63, within the provisions of
which $3,500,000 is inserted for the deepening
of and other improvements in the harbour of
Montreal. That is the largest single item in
the measure, and it is in addition to the
$2,500,000 set aside for harbours and rivers
generally. I have no doubt at all that that
appropriation is mainly inspired by the very
situation to which the honourable gentleman
from Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Lemieux) calls
attention.
Hon. Mr. POPE: In March I asked a few
questions to which I have received no answer.
Whether this Government is dead or gone to
sleep, I do not know, but somebody is slumbering.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I shall look
into the matter. I am not sure that the
inquiry has not been answered.
Hon. Mr. POPE: I am very positive that
it has not been. An official report was sent
down, which does not arnount to anything. I
should have liked a report from the permanent
engineer of the harbour, as to its possibilities
of development. If you are going to get
more water down there you will have to go
above, where the water is; you will have to
take water from the north. A very competent engineer bas prepared a report, which
I am sure some honourable gentlemen must
have read, as to damming up that river which
runs to the north, into Hudson bay, and bringing water down at a cost of about $30,000,000.
That diversion would guarantee a permanently
higher level of water in the St. Lawrence
river.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, I was under the impression that the
questions which had been on the Order Paper
had been answered, and I am now advised by
the Clerk that my impression is correct. The
Clerk is not certain that the answer was
satisfactory. However, the inquiry has been
answered in the regular way, after special
efforts were made to get at the exact meaning
and intent of the questions.
Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: Honourable
senators, I am not an engineer, nor am I,
of course, as familiar as are some other
honourable members with conditions in the
harbour of Montreal. The Chicago diversion
may have something to do with the situation,
but competent engineers have expressed the
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

opinion that the deeper the channel ýis dredged
between Montreal and Quebec the lower will
be the level in the harbour of Montreal.

the second reading of Bilil 101, an Act respecting the establishment of an Exchange Fund.
He saidi: Honourable members, yesterday I
gave a brief explanation of the Bili. I have
since given closer study to it and believe it
should be referred to the Committee on
Banking fand Commerce. Possibly the committee could deal more intelligently with the
measure were an official of the Finance Department present. In order fully to grasp
the effect of this Bill, honourable members
will require to keep carefully in mind the
provisions of the Bank of Canada Act. The
more important of those provisions bearing
on the Bill appear in the explanatory notes
on the right-hand pages.
The purpose of the measure is as I stated
yesterday: to credit to a special account in
the name of the Minister of Finance, at the
current market price, the gold taken over from
the chartered banks, and to debit the account
with :the value of such gold on the basis
established by the Currency Act. The difference, aggregating about $62,000,000, will then
appear as profit.
It is also provided that the portion of this
gold held by chartered banks at the time of
transfer as a reserve against payment of
foreign liabilities sha.ll be valued, and paid for,
on the basis of the current market price.
The amount of reserve against foreign
liabilities is to be fixed by the Minister.
Section 6 provides that the fund may be
used for stabilization by purchase and sale
of gold and foreign exchange and by the
establishment of balances in New York and
London, and withdrawal of those balances.
Through this mechanism the fund will serve
its purpose of staýbilizing our dollar.
Section 10 provides for secrecy as to operation of the fund, and for penalties for
violation of that secrecy. It will be obvious
that if the operations were in any degree
made public the whole purpose of the Bill
would be frustrated.

particularly at the trade between France and
Canada, but it seems to me that if you want
to appreciate the Canadian dollar instead of
depreciating it, the logical remedy is to open
up the channels of trade and commerce. The
more you trade with other countries the more
your dollar will appreciate.
I am very sorry to notice that we are liable
to lose trade with Japan because the yen bas
gone down even more than the dollar. We
had a very munificent trade with our neighbour-for, though the Pacific is wide, we are
Japan's nearest Arerican neighbour. That
trade has fallen off by reason of the depreciatien of the yen.
It seems to me to be a homely truth, and
one which should be brought to the notice of
the Government and of Parliament as often
as possible, that when countries erect trade
barriers their moneys are depreciatedi. You
must trade to maintain the activity of your
dollar. It is true that at the present time
we are trading with Great Britain; but, I am
sorry to say, we are doing so on a limited
scale. If we would trade with the other
countries of the world, with the United States,
Japan, France and Belgium, and with the
northern countries of Sweden and Norway,

not be interpreted as evidence of a belief
on my part that I have command of the
subject. I have net. I know very few who
have. What I am about to say in answer to
my honourable friýend will reveal just how
far my command goes.
I do net think my honourable friendi would
have given utterance to some of his later
sentences if ie had thought very far on, the
subject. He says: "Open up the channels of
trade and you will improve the value of the
Canadian dolliar."
He says the Canadian
dollar is now very low, and that as a consequence a Canadian in France loses forty
cents on every dollar he has. That is a
fauet. but it bas no relation, or mighty little

relation, to our trade with France. France
is on the gold standard. The French franc
is defined by F'rench law as being of the
value of a certain quantity and weight of
gold of a certain fineness. Our dollar was on
the same base, but it is so no longer. The
consequence is that gold, in terms of our
dollar, is worth much more than it was,
being now valued at $35 an ounce, whereas
formerly it was worth 320.67-a variation of
forty pet cent. The franc stands where it
was; con'sequently, in relation 'to ithe franc
our dollar is worth forty cents less thýan it
was. What bas that to do with trade?
I do not say that the value of one country's currency in relation to that of another
country does net depend in some degree
upon trade; but it does net depend on the
quantity of trade. In se far as trade affects
the relative values of the currencies of, say,
the United States and Canada, the value of
our dollar in relation to the American dollar
depends not in the least on the volume of
trade between this country and the United
States, but on the balance of trade between
these two countries. That is not the only
factor; I will net say it is the major factor;
but, I repeat, it is a factor. If our purchase
of goods from the United States exceeds
our sales to that country the balance of
trade i's against us, aud' the relative value
ef our dollar ges down. I do not say it
goes down in proportion to the unfavourable
balance of trade, but that balance is an element affecting the value and tends to make
our dollar worth less in relation to that of
the United States.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Although there
is such a thing as a triangle in the settlement.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
In all this
one must remember what is in the mind of
my honourable friend. There is triangular
trade. We buy from a country which is
selling to the United States. All suob factors
enter into the caiculation. But to keep the
matter as simple as possible, it is net the
quantity cf trade that affects the relative
value of your currency; it is the balance of
trade.
My honourable friend says: "Open up the
channels of trade." That is easy. We can
open up our doors by means of legislation.
But that does net open up the French doors.
The honourable member learned that himuelf
when he was a member of the Governient.
That does net open up the doors of the
United States. Our legislative powers are
confined to Canada, and the opening up of

JUNE 19, 1935
our doors tends to turn trade, not in our
favour, but against us, and, therefore, to
diminish the value of ouT dollar in relation
to other currencies.
When the honourable
gentleman is able to endow this Parliament
with power to open up the doors of the
customs of the United States, of France, of
Japan, he will have put into our hands a
weapon whereby we can enlarge, almost ad
infinitum, the aggregate trade of this Dominion. But until that power is ours-and it
never can be-all we can do is to determine
what is best for us, having regard to other
nations. The honourable gentleman learned
too, through long and bitter years, just as it
was learned in England, that the continual
lowering or final elimination of tariff barriers
does not assist in'the least in opening up
the doors of other countries.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: It was on frec trade
that England financed the War.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Yes, and
now she cannot pay. When England was
free-trade other countries raised their tariffs
until she had to turn her face the other way.
I remember that in 1921, when sitting across
(Hon. Mr.
from my honourable friend
Lemieux), I dared to predict that the day
would come when Great Britain would be
compelled to reverse her .course. My remarks
were treated with laughter-loud laughter by
a very distinguished member representing a
Western city called Red Deer. But that day
came.
We can only determine our course in the
light of knowledge gained from the rourse
pursued by others, always having regard to
the necessity of maintaining our own balance.
So much for that.
I will now answer as best I can-and I have
no doubt it will be very inadequately-the
first question of the honourable gentleman.
He says that on the old valuation tha gold
which was the property of the banks was
worth so much; and that it is now worth
a great deal more. He asks if we are going
to turn over to the banks froin whom the
gold was taken the profits arising from its
increase in value. If we were, we could not
have this Bill, for we are intending to use
profits arising from that increase, aggregating
about $62,000,000, I think, for the purposes
of this Bill. We are not giving the banks
any part of that profit.
I will not discuss now the question whether
that course is right or wrong, but will proceed
to the only exception. In so far as the banks'
reserves of gold were held as reserves against
their foreign liabilities, the profitsHon. Mr. HUGHES:

On that part.

395

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: -on
that
part, go to the credit of the banks. To tte
extent that gold was held as security for the
Canadian note issues of the banks, the profit
is appropriated by the Government of Canada.
J am quite aware it is a bold-some would
say a shocking-thing to do. Certainly there
are those who could give a better explanation
than I can as to why it tas been done. I
put my explanation in this way, subject to
amendment and improvement, which anyone
else may be able to make, and which I know
I myself shall later be able to make. This
gold is regarded as not having been the property of the banks in the way of an investment for profit, an investment on which they
might have had a loss and on which they are
therefore entitled to the profit if there is
any. The Government says: "That was no
such investment. It was merely a holding
which under the law of Canada you were required to have in order that the public might
be protected when using your notes of hand.
For that purpose and no other you held it,
and you took no risk upon it. The law fixed
the value of the gold, and you could not
have suffered any loss in connection with it.
Now, when the law changes the value of
gold, we are not going to let you take any
profit: we take it for the benefit of the people
of Canada." Such tas been the reasoning,
or at any rate it is pretty close to the reasoning, under which the Government justifies its
course.
But, admittedly and frankly, the Government has, no doubt against the strong protests of the banks, appropriated that profit to
itself. That was done under the Bank of
Canada Act. And now, having appropriated
it, the Government proceeds to use it for the
stabilizing of the dollar of this country; that
is to say, so far as stabilization can be effected
within the limits of the fund. The dollar will
go down and nothing on earth can stabilize
it if your trade goes badly against you. If
you just took down the barriers to your ports

and allowed goods from Japan, from South
America, from Great Britain, from France,
from the United States and from all other
countries to come in without restriction, then
no fund that the mind of man can comprehend would ever stabilize the dollar of Canada. You would have free entry of imports,
and the volume might be large, and nothing
that we can possibly devise would stabilize
our dollar under such conditions. Assuming,
though, that we shall have sane and reasonable trade policies, that we shall continue to
do business on a basis of fairness with other
countries, the dollar will not fluctuate at al

396

frorn any such cause as I have just described.
We believe it can be stabilized by discreet
and prudent purchases and sales of gold and
foreign exchange, and by the establishment
and withdrawal of foreign balances.
The explanation I have given is brief and
incomplete. In part it may be wrong, though
I do net think it is. I hope that when the
Bill gets to the committee all honourable
senators, even those who are not members of
I
the committee, will be in attendance.
have no doubt that the Governor of the Bank
of Canada will be present, and that he will
give a far better explanation than I have been
able to give.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: May I ask the
right honourable gentleman whether the earnings of the banks will be affected to such an
extent that possibly their dividends to shareholders will be reduced and the market value
of their stock will drop?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIiGHEN: Does the
honourablie gentleman not realize that if I
made a statement about bank stocks there
would be a wild flutter? Of course the honourable senator knows-and perhaps far
better than I do, for he may hold some bank
stock-t'hat our larger banks have already
Indeed, I think
reduced their dividends.
there have been two reductions. Some of
the smaller banks, which perhaps are net so
badly affected hy the depression, have made
reductions to a lesser extent.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Will this have a
tendency to bring about a further reduction?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is now
about a year since this step was taken, and
I should think that the effect on the market
value of bank securities would already have
been feit. As regards earnings, the gold itself
makes none, but inasmuch as a bank can
use its own note issue as currency, and in
good times, with proper management, make
some profiit upon that issue, there will be a
lessening of earnings. The drop will become
more pronounced as the note issue is called
in, which must be within a period of ten years
from the taking effect of the Bank of Canada
Act.
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: May I make just one
or two observations? As I see it, the increased value of gold was caused by an action
of the Government and not by anything the
banks did or could do.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Which Government?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: The
ernment.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Federal Gov-

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Or the United States
Government?
Increased
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
value in our own country could come only
through action of our own Government; increased value in the United States would be
due 'to action of the American Government.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: The increased value
of gold in Canada was caused by action of
the Government. Therefore that increased
value should go to the Government, which
represents all the people. As J have already
stated, the increase was not caused by anything the banks did or could do; therefore it
did not belong to them.
I understand that Canadian currency is at
a premium in New York. The gold content
of the American dollar is lower than that of
the Canadian dollar. I think that !would be
a factor in causing our notes to be at a
premium in New York. On the other hand,
because the gold content of our money is
lower than that of French money, our notes
are at a discount in France.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There is no
gold content in either dollar now.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: It takes a certain
number of dollars to purchase a certain
amount of gold.
Right Hon.

Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, yes.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: That is what I
mean. And in the United States, I think,
it takes fewer dollars to purchase a certain
amount of gold than it does in Canada. I
am not sure of thaît; but the way I put
it first is quite correct: the gold content
of the American dollar is lower than the
gold content of the Canadian dollar. That
would be a factor in causing our money to
be at a premium in New York.
There was one other thing I wished to state,
but it has escaped me for the moment. However, I shall have an opportunity of piresenting it in the Banking and Commerce
Committee.
There is an impression among some Canadian people that the Government did the
banks an injustice.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: The banks say that.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: All right, the banks
say that the Government did them an injustice in taking over the gold at what it cost
the banks. Well, my contention is that that
was no injustice at aill. I want to repeat the
statement that it was an action of the Government itself which gave the increased value

JUNE 19, 1935
to this metal, and that the resulting profit
belonged to the Government, which represents
all the people of Canada.
Hon. Mr. CORDON: I am afiraid I cannot
agree with the honourahle gentleman. When
the gold of the chartered banks was handed
over to the Bank of Canada there was not an
ounce of it but could have been sold at
between $34 and $35.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Not until the Bank of
Canada gave it that value.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: The honourable gentleman is wrong there. The United States
had put a value of $35 on it. It just comes
down to this, that an amount equal to 70
per cent of the value allowed to the chartered
banks was taken away firom filfty thousand
persons in Canada and given 'to all the people
of Canada. It was absolutely taken from
fifty thousand.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: It was taken from
them at what it dost them.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: What is the use of
talking like that? If a man buys a horse for
$50. he is not obliged to sell it for $50.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: That is not the same
thing.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Yes, it is.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: That is a horse of
another colour.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: That is what
happ'ened, anyway, whether it was right or
wrong. The gold was worth at the time 70
per cent more than the chartered banks were
allowed for it.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Not in Canada.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: But there was a provision in the Bank of Canada Act, as the
right honourable leader has said, by which
chartered banks, if they showed they were
holding gold against foreign liabilities, would
be a'llowed the excess over $20.67 on the sale
of such gold.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: And that was a very
generous arrangement.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: It just comes down
to What I have said. It may be right to take
property away from one group of people and
give it to all the people of Canada, but to my
mind it is Socialism in the extremie. My
honourable friend, who is nearly always correct,
thinks it was right. But in my opinion it was
absolutely wrong.
I may be
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
allowed to repeat what was told me by a
prominent banker of Montreal. He said: "I

397

asked the Minister of Finance by what
authority the Government was taking our gold
at a given figure, and the Minister replied that
it was taken by virtue of the eminent domain.
Those two words, which I think corne from the
French language, were pronounced by the
Minister in suoh a solemn way that I was
awed and did not know what to say."
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
think the unjust impression should go out
that this decision on policy was merely a
wholesale eminent domain theft. It certainly was not that. There may be room
for debate; and there are those who could
debate the question mueh better than I,
because they have a greater knowledge of
the facts and perhaps a fuller understanding
of the system. But, in the main, what was
said by the honourable gentleman opposite
(Hon. Mr. Hughes) is right. Canada was
forced off the golid standard. The United
States went off-I presume that in a certain
sense it too was forced, off. Prior to that
time Canada had paid $20.67 for gold. Canada had empowered the banks of this country to issue notes, conditionali upon the
baniks keeping in their vaults gold reserves,
which had to bear a certain ratio to the
notes. In this respect the banks were given
a very valuable privilege. Then, in order
that the currency of this country should bear
something of a practical relation to the
new value of British currency and to the
new value of American currency, the Government saidi: "We shall have to pay more
for gold. We will, pay $35." I do not think
Lt can be seriously argued that this made
the banks' gold worth $35 to them.
Hon. Mr. GOŒRDON: If they wanted to
buy any more gold, how much would, they
have to pay for it?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Thirty-five
dollars, of course. But they do not need to
buy gold any longer. However, that is not
the point. The people of the United States
were forced by world events to pay a higher
price for gold, and thereby the price of gold
in this -country was raised, and the value of
our currency in terms of gold was reduced.
Now, the banks did not run an-y risk of a
loss. If they did lose as a result of governmental action, it would be the business
of the Government ito recoup them. But the
banks did ndt purchase the gold for the, purpose of making a profit, with the risk of
inleurring a losis. The gold was not property
in the sense that a horse is. A horse might
die or go down in value. The gold was
merely a holding requiredi by statute as a
reserve against a liability, which holding
existed because of a certain privilege given to

398

SENATE

the banks. It was a protection to the people
of Canada. Now, if the nation is bound to
give increased value to that holding, is the
nation not entitled to that increased value?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES:

Why, certainly.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have said
enough to show that this is not at all of
the nature of an appropriation froma those
who have, for the benefit of those who have
nt-a
principle with which I have no
sympathy whatever, and which if adopted
and put into general effect woulýd mean the
end of civilized society. I do not think the
Government of the day is capable of an
action of that kind. And it ceritainly is not
actuated, by any spirit which contemplates
surh a destructive and demoralizing action.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Was I not right in
my reference to the stipulaition in the Bank
of Canada Act as to any bank which could
show that it hel'd gold against foreign liabilitiecs?
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.

bank and no further profit with respect thereto
shall accrue to such chartered bank, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in section

with Canadian law, but in order that the
bank might do its foreign business better,

is being done?

Now what

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This is what
is being donc, if we pass this proposed logislation.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: What is the modus
operandi? How does the profit accrue to the
bank?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have just
read the section. It shall be paid to the
bank.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: How?

Hon. Mr. GORDON: They are not treated
accordingly.

Right Hon. Mr.
tender of Canada.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, in this
Bill.

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Do I understand
that under this arrangement the banks get as
much for the gold as they paid for it?

Hon. Mr. GORDON: No. Under this legislation the banks will receive this profit on
only 40 per cent of their gold. Every bank
is treated the same.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What the
banks held against foreign liabilities would
of course be due to action of their own, dissociated from Canadian legislation. And the
intent of the Government, as expressed at
the time the Bank of Canada Act was put
through, and as fully implemented now, was
to consider that gold in such light. If the
honourable member will look up clause 4 of
this Bill he will find it reads as follows:
(1) Any profit resulting from the valuation
of the gold in accordance with the provisions
of section three of this Act, being the difference between the value of such gold held by
the Bank on the date of the coming into force
of this Act as computed on the basis established
by the Currency Act and its value at current
market price, shall be credited by tie Bank
to a special account in the name of the
Minister: Provided, however, that in the case
of gold transferred under subsection one of
section twenty-eight of the Bank of Canada
Act which the Governor in Council has declared
under the provisions of section thirty of the
said Act was at the time of the transfer being
held by a chartered bank against liabilities
elsewhere than in Canada, the said profit shall
belongo the chartered bank and the Bank of
Canada shall determine the said profit on the
basis of the current market price for gold

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: They do nominally,

that the dollar they are being paid now is
worth only two-thirds of the dollar they paid
for the gold?
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is in terms
of gold, but not of commodities.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: With respect to the
statement of the honourable member froua
King's (Hon. Mr. Hughes), while I do not
hold a brief for the banks, I must say this te
their credit. When on the 4th of March two
years ago the President-elect of the United
States was appalled by bank failures in every
State of the Union, our chartered banks
passed through the crisis without a single
failure.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is right.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: We ought to bc
proud of our banking institutions and not
decry them.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Nobody that I know
of is decrying them.

it was felt that the banks were being deprived of their holdings of gold. The reserves
in their vaults were transferred to the Bank
of Canada. Of course, the chartered banks
were not deprived of that gold, but it passed
out of their custody. But they were deprived
of the right to issue notes. What has been
the result? Many branch banks, in the West
and in the East, have been closed. This is
not good for the country. I grant there were
perhaps too many branch banks, but the
farmer has been deprived of the convenience
of banking facilities in his town or village.
I have been told by bankers of high standing
that the transfer to the Bank of Canada of
their right to issue notes bas deprived the
chartered banks of a legitimate source of
profit, and as a consequence they have had to
close many of their country branches, to the
great inconvenience of our rural communities.
Hon. Mr. COTE: May I remind the
honourable gentleman from Rougemont (Hon.
Mr. Lemieux) that under the Bank of Canada
Act passed last session the right of note
issue is not taken away entirely from the
chartered banks. Their note circulation is to
be reduced by 5 per cent each year until the
reduction reaches 75 per cent; the balance of
25 per cent of their note issue the banks will
retain in circulation. So I do not understand
why our chartered banks have already been
dlosing up many of their branches on the
ground that they are losing money through
being deprived of this right.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: It is a fact, though.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved that
the Bill be refeirred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: There will be
one adjvantage, honourable members, in the
Bill being referred to the Banking and Commerce Committee: under present circumstances the chairman will be absolutely independent, because he knows nothing about
any of these things.
The motion was agreed to.

LOAN BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with BiH 110, an Act to authorize
the raising, by way of loan, of 'certain sums of
money for the Public Service.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of the Bill.
He said: I see no objection to dealing with
this measure right now. It merely provides
for raising a large sum of money for refunding purposes. There is no question every
honourable member wants the Government to
be in a position to take advantage of market
conditions and refund as rapidly and at as
low a rate of interest as possible.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: What is the
amount?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is not to
exoeed $750,000,000.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Is the fund to be
used to redeem loans which become due in
later years, or obligations maturing this year?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There is
nothing in the Bill about compulsory conversion, nor is anything of the kind contemplated so far as I know. Outstanding
issues that do not mature for somne time
can be taken up, and the fact that the new
issue will run for a much longer period may
induce holders of old issues to accept the new
issue although the rate of interest is lower.
Thereby we shall be able to put our refunding on a better basis.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: It has been done in
England.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: And it has
been donc here.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: What are the
approaching maturities?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have no details. I know of one large maturity in 1937.
It may be provided for this fall.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAEAM. The tax-free
bonds?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is the
last of our tax-free bonds. The maturities
this year are rather smalih. It is unfortunate
they are not larger.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bih
was read the second time.

WEIGHTS AND

MEASURES BILL

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM presented the
report of the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce on a message from the
House of Commons with respect to certain
amendments made by the Senate to Bill 70,
an Act to amend the Weights and Measures
Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should like the
right honourable leader to explain the amendments made by the committee.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The amendment to which the House of Commons took
exception was to the effect that in any prosecution under the Weights and Measures Act
for under weight or under measure, in the
case of pre-packaged goods, the court should
disregard any inconsiderable deficiency in a
single article, but should have regard to the
average over a number of articles of the same
class, sold or kept for purposes of sale on the
same occasion. The Commons gave as their
reason for objecting that this amendment
would nullify the effect of section 63, because
it would be impossible to show that there
was a prevailing deficiency over a considerable number of articles on the same occasion;
and they emphasized that the words "on
the same occasion" would make the clause
very hard to comply with. It will be recalled
that the Senate committee inserted this provision in order that there might not be penalties and punishments, which would do great
harm to the company or individual whose
conduct was in question, unless there was
evidence of a practice, or such evidence as
indicated a real failure to comply with the
law, not merely a nominal or technical failure.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Criminal intent.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am glad
the honourable senator has mentioned that
point. It must be kept in mind that in
these
prosecutions mens rea is banned.
Specifically the Bill says that it shall be no
defence for the person prosecuted to plead
that he was unaware of the deficiency, that
there was no mens rea on his part, that his
clerk did the act complained of. The banning of mens rea is an exceptional provision,
and while the Senate committee was pursuaded from the evidence given that it was
a necessary provision-for otherwise there
would be escape in almost all cases-nevertheless it did say that mens rea could be
pleaded and established, but only for purposes of diminishing the penalty. It would
be no means of escape from conviction. Now,
because mens rea was banned, the Senate
committee felt it had to be more careful to
protect against a conviction for an inconsiderable offence, or rather for a deficiency the
inconsiderableness of which was such as to
make it no offence at all.
I have detailed the reasons for the Commons' objection. We seek to meet the situation by providing, not as in the British Actwhich compels the merchant to sell any number of articles at the same time to an inspector or to anybody who comes in-but by providing that any pre-packaged goods of the

401

JUNE 20, 1935
same character as those that were sold under
weight, which are found for sale in the possession of the merchant within forty-eight
hours thereafter, shall be presumed to have
been in bis possession at the time of the
sale.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: On the same
occasion.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That would
be conside.red on the same occasion unless the
merchant shouldering the onus proved they
were not. So it will be possible for the Department to send what is called a "spotter"--I
believe, usually a woman-to make a purchase. If an article has been found to be
under weight, and an inspector returns within
forty-eight hours and finds in similar goods an
average deficiency, however smaill, the court
will hold that these goods were there on the
same occasion. To secure a conviction it must
be proven: (1) that there was a sale of the
pre-packaged article that did not measure or
weigh what it was stated to measure or
weigh; (2) that, within forty-eight hours,
actual weight or measure of other goods of a
similar character in the saine place showed
some deficiency, however small.
This, in brief, is the amendment we propose.
It certainly meets the objection of the other
House, and still it preserves some sort of
opportunity for honest-minded persons to
show they are not guilty in the case of a
mere technical offence respecting a single
article.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM moved that the
amendments be conourred in.
The motion was agreed to.
MESSAGE TO HOUSE OF COMMONS
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved:
That a message be sent to the House of
Commons to return Bill 70, intituled "An
Act to amend the Weights and Measures
Act," and to acquaint that House that the
Senate do not insist on subelause 5 embodied
in their sixth amendment, but have substituted other amendments in lieu thereof, to
which they desire their concurrence.
The motion was agreed to.

ST. LAWRENCE RIVER OHANNEL
ORDER

FOR

RETURN--SrrATEMENT

Before the Orders of the Day:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Possibly I
should make further reference to a complaint
voiced yesterday by the honourable sena.tor
from Bedford (Hon. Mr. Pope). In his statement to the House the honourable senator
mentioned a question which had been on the
Order Paper, allegedliy for a long time, and
was not answered. After consultation with
the Olerk, I reported to the House that the
question had been answered. It sulbsequently
develioped that what the honourable gentleman
was referring to was an order made by the
House for a return respecting dredging in the
channel of the St. Lawrence, and that, as a
matter of fact, the return had not yet been
brought down.
Having ascertained this fact, I interviewed
the Minister of Marine, who explained that the
return asked for was an exceedingly extensive
and intricate one and that its preparation
would take a considerable length of time.
Furthermore, he said that at this period of the
year bis engineers were engaged in outside
work and that the usual progress was difficult.
Just as soon' as the information can be fu'lly
systemat-ized and arranged, the return will, of
course, be brought down.
ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I move that
when the House adjourns to-day it do stand
adjourned until Tuesday next at 8 o'cl.ock.
The Senate, having entirely caught up with
its work, will not need to meet in the afternoon to ensure the attendance of members at
committees in the morning. Therefore the
convenience of honourable senators fron the
East can be met, and we shal meet at 8
o'elock in the evening.
Hon. Mr. DANDUIRAND: My right honourable friend .might have added that there
are no items of business on Tuesday's Order
Paper; so we are not delaying any legislation
fron the Commons.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Nothing is
being delayed. The Senate is abreast of its
work in every particular.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, June
25, at 8 p.m.

SECOND READING POSTPONED

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
Bill be read a second time?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: To-morrow.
This Bill, like the previous one, will have to
stand until to-morrow if the House expects me
to give any useful explanation of it. They
have reached me too late to be dealt with
to-day. The same is true of the Combines
Investigation Bill. I am prepared for the
others.
R:ght Hon. Mr. MEIGREN.

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN moved
the second reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable senators, this measure
is a combination of two bills which were
introduced into the other House and in process of consideration there were amalgamated.
It comprises rather extensive amendments to
the Code, particulars of which I can now
recite.
The first clause provides a change in the
Code provisions affecting racing. The underlined words clearly indicate the changes, and
no elaboration is necessary. They are intended to make more workable the facilities
originally enacted by Parliament in, I think,
1910, in the so-called Miller Bill, which is
better known as the McCall Bill.
Clause 2 provides that the Minister of
Agriculture may make regulations for the
working of the pari-mutuel system of betting,
which system is ,permissible under the Bill
to which I have just referred.
Clause 3 is intended to take away from
magistrates a power they seem to have felt
they enjoyed, of suspending sentence in a
case of conviction for driving a motor-car
while under the influence of liquor or narcotics. The clause makes it clear that magistrates shall no longer be guided by two
sections much later on in the Code, under
which they felt they had power to suspend
sentence. The intent of the amendment, of
course, is to make it still more difficult for
persons who commit this crime to escape
without punishment.
The fourth clause provides penalties for,
and makes an offence of, misrepresentations
advanced in order to secure a passport.
The fifth clause makes alterations in the
law with respect to advertisements and the
punishment for false advertising. It is one
of the many harvests of the Price Spreads
Commission. The first alteration is no doubt
a correct one, but is not very important.
The present law, seeking to give immunity
to a person who accepted an advertisement
in good faith, though the advertisement was
such as the law forbade, declared that any
newspaper which in the ordinary course of
business published an advertisement in such
circumstances should not be within the meaning of the section. It is pretty bard to con-

JUNE 25, 1935
ceive how a newspaper could be within the
meaning of any criminal section. The word
"inewspaper" is therefore changed to "person."
The next part of clause 5 is of considerable
consequence. It provides that anyone who
publishes, or causes te be published, an
advertisement containing a representation or
guarantee of the performance, efficacy or
length of life af any product for the purpose
of either directly or indirectly promoting the
sale or disposal of such product, if such
representatian or guarantee is nlot based upon
an adequate and proper test, shaîl be guilty
of an offence. That is to say, 'hereaiter if
anyone in an advertisement represents that
a certain article of commerce, intended for
sale, wilI last so long, unless that person bas
subjected the article to adequate and proper
test ta establish that it will last the time
stated, he will be guilty of an offence.
Similarly hie will be guilty if hie makes any
other representation or gives any other guarantee without a proper test preceding such representation or guarantee.
Would
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
cover the virtue of a patent medicîne?

that

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: That would
bie a very apt illustration. Paragraph (b)
ai subclause 3 simply states that a test
effected by the Honorary Advisory Council
for Scientific and Industrial Research or any
ather public department shall be considered
an adequate and proper test for the purposes
of this subsection. But the fact that the
Advisory Couneil bas given a certificate shaîl
not be advertised. The clause also puts the
burden of proof af adequate and proper test
on the defendant.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Would the
section a.pply to such an advertisement over
the radio?
Right Hon. MT. MEIGHEN:

No.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: There is a
good deal of that kind of thing donc over the
radio.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Apparently
it would apply only to publication. I should
not be prepared to say that an advertisement
over the radio is a publication.
Clause 6 makes other indictable offencee.
These flow, as do clauses 4 and 5, from the
report of the Price Spreade Comission.
Clause 6 makes it an indictable offence for any
person knowingly to pay a rate of wage less
than the minimum wage fixed by lem or any
campetent publie authority, inclusive, of
course, cf a provincial legislature. Paragraiph
U2584-261

402

(b) provides that no person ma.y knowingly
work any of his emýployees beyond the maximum hours fixed by law or by a-ny campetent
public authority. Paragraph (c) provides it
shaîl be an indictable offence to falsify an ernployiment record. Paragraph (d) makes it an
indictable offence ta punch a time dlock with
intent ta deceive. Paragrapb (e) mnakes it an
indictable offence knowingly to put -the wages
of more than one employee into the saine
envelope with intent to evade the provisions
of an-y -minimum wage law. Paragraph (f)
provides it shaîl be an indictable offence for
any person &o make "any deduction from eny
employee's wages for any purpose nlot
warranted by law, unfless such deduction bas
been approved first by a coxupetent public
au.thority." Paragraph (g) makes it an indietable offence knowingly to employ any
child or minor persan contrary ta 'law. And
paragraph (b) says that everyone is guilty of
an indictable offence who, knowingly "does any
other similar act contrary -to la.w or tihe rules
or regulations of any competent public
authority."
We naw corne ta section 7. This makes a
change of fia far-reaching importance, with respecet ta dealers in second-band goods. The
aanendment is ïmade necessary by court findings, which have given a restrictive .mesning to
the words "other mark," to the effect that they
must have the saine aharacteristices as a trademark duly registered. The result of these
findings has been ta impede the intention ai
the present law.
Clause 8 is new. 1 say that with eiuphaisis.
It provides:
Every persan engaged in trade or commerce
or industry is guilty of an indictable offence
and liable to a penalty not exceeding one
thousand dollars or to anc month's imprisonment, or, if a corporation, ta a penalty not
exceeding five tbousand dollars, who.
(a) is a party or privy ta, or assists in,
any transaction ai sale which discriminates, to
bis knowledge, against competitars of the
purchaser in that any discount, rebate or
a lowance is granted to the purchaser over
and abave any discount, rehate or allowance
available at tbe time ai sucb transaction to
the afaresaid competitars in respect ai a sale
ai goods of like quality and quantity.
Exception is made for the case of ca-operative societies which distribute earnings in proportion ta purchases.
This section also provides that every persan
is guilty ci an indictable affence who
(b) engages in a policy of selling goods in
any ares, ai Canada at prices lower than those
exacted by such seller elsewbere in Canada,
for the purpose ai destroying competitian or
eliminating a campetitor in sncb part of
Canada;

404

SENATE

(e) engages in a policy of selling goods at
prices unreasonably low for the purpose of
a
eliminating
or
competition
destroying
competitor.
I might say in passing that all this is
supplementary to, and concomitant and associated with, a bill to which we have given
first reading to-night, to establish a Dominion
Trade and Industry Commission.
I now come to clause 9. This alters the
wording of the first four lines of section 542,
which relates to punishment for cruelty to
animals. Under the law as it now stands, no
minimumpenalty is provided, but this amendment provides a minimum penalty of five
dollars and a maximum of five hundred dollars.
Clause 10 repeals subsection 2 of section
749 and substitutes a new subsection. The
old subsection, which relates to the power of
judges or stipendiary magistrates sitting in
appeal in Saskatchewan, Alberta, the Northwest Territories and the Yukon Territory,
provided:
The judge or stipendiary magistrate hearing
any such appeal shall sit without a jury at
the place where the cause of the information
or complaint arose, or at the nearest place
thereto where a court is appointed to be held.
The new subsection provides that the clause
in its original plenary effect shall apply to a
judge or stipendiary magistrate in the Northwest Territories a'nd the Yukon Territory; but
in so far as Saskatchewan and Alberta are
concerned the clause states only that the
judge or stipendiary magistrate shall hear such
appeal without a jury. As to where the
judge or magistrate shall sit there shall hereafter be no restriction in these two provinces.
I understand this new subsection is requested
by one of the Attorneys-General.
Section 11.-The purpose of this amendment is to limit the application of subsection
2 to the provinces of Ontario, Quebec and
Nova Scotia. It provides that
the jurisdiction of a magistrate who is one
of those mentioned in section seven hundred
and seventy-four is absolute and does not
depend on the consent of the person charged
to be tried by such magistrate in cities having
a population of not less than 25,000 according
to the last decennial or other census.
The law already applies to the other
provinces under another section, but there is
some slight contradiction between the two.
The amendment removes that contradiction.
Have the
Mr. DANDURAND:
Hon.
Attorneys-General of those provinces recommended the amendment?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This amendment is made at the request of the AttorneysAlberta,
Columbia,
British
of
General
Saskatchewan and Manitoba.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Section 12.-The old Manitoba Act requires
only six jurors to be sworn in civil and
criminal cases. The Province of Saskatchewan
is arranging now for only six jurors in civil
cases, and has requested that the same
procedure be followed in criminal cases. The
purpose of this amendment is to restrict jurors
to six in criminal cases in these two provinces.
Section 13 is merely an accommodation of
section 929 to the preceding amendment.
Section 14 is somewhat lengthy, but its
effect is simple. It provides that any person
undergoing imprisonment in a penitentiary,
reformatory or other like institution, who at
the time of his imprisonment is a mental case
and confined as such, shall on the termination
of his sentence, however effected, be under
the supervision and control of the Minister of
Health of the province concerned.
Section 15.-The object of this amendment,
which was suggested by the Attorney-General
of British Columbia, is to give to the Crown
the right to appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada on questions of law where there has
been dissent in the court of appeal.
Section 16.-The purpose of this amendment
is to limit to questions of law alone the right
of any person to appeal to the Supreme Court
of Canada against the setting aside of his
acquittal by the court of appeal of a province.
Any person tried jointly with such acquitted
person, and whose conviction was sustained
by the provincial court of appeal, may appeal
to the Supreme Court of Canada against the
sustaining of such conviction, but only on a
question of law.
Section 17. This amendment is a matter of
detail, to allow a magistrate under Part XVI
of the Code, on a conviction for an indictable
offence, to allow similar fees for justices,
constables, witnesses and interpreters as are
allowed under Part XV of the Code on a
summary conviction.
The House wil'l note that the amendments
are extensive, and that in some respects they
are exceedingly important. No doubt there
will be some discussion on the score of validity,
particularly with respect to sections 4, 5 and 6.
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND:

And S.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIHEN: Sections 4,
5 and 6 are the amend'ments which purport
to impose penalties fixed by the Parliament
of Canada in respect of violation of provincial statutes creating offences. We have for
some forty-five years, I believe, undertaken
to fix penalties for violation of such provincial laws, and our power to do so stands as
yet unchallenged. There are, however, those
who dispute that right. Any objections on
constitutional grounds to clause 6 would, I
I fancy, relate to our right to legislate on

JUNE 25, 1935
the ibasis I have men.tioned, ho-wever valid
that basis may be. Section 5, making it an
offence to adývertise a thing of such and
such quality, endurance and efficacy, without the prerequisite test by a propeïr authority, or by proper and adequate mneans, bas
also, been the surbject of som-e debate with
respect to its constitutionality. Honourab]e
members will have no difficulty in 'penetrating to the reasorss for the doubt. Some
peisons contend it is a matter of civil rights,
a-nâ therefore flot of such a character, that
the Parliament of Canada can make it a
criminal offence. I ar n ot seeking to intimate that I share in, any degree the doubt
as to the validity of this section on that or
any other ground.
Section 4, providing penalties for making
untrue or misleading stateiments to procure
a passport, has also had doubt 'thrown- npon
it. I say this because I notice the section
has been quoted in debates in another lace
as being attacked. For the life ýof me I can
see no reason in the world for questioning
its validity.
TIhe 'honourable senator opposite (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) bas indicated thýere may be
cloubt as to section 8. This is indeed a section of far-reaching -consequence. The section makes it an offence to, sell at different
rates of discount, rebate *or allowance goode
of like quantity or quality. The reasons for
attack wou'ld be analogous to those with
respect to section 5.
I have flot only outlined the effects of the
different sections, bust intimated certain
features to which honourable anembers should
give special attention. It is my purpose
af'ter the second i'eading to move that; the
Bill be referred to the Cornittee on Banking and Commerce. It does not, seem quite
appropriate that a Bill amending the Orimmnal Code should go to that comm'ittee, but
it is appropriate in this special case because
new offences are created in the realm of
commierce.
It is only fair to say that this measure
is an effort, possibly a strained, but uncloubtedIy a conscientious effort, to go the
full length 'this Parliament can go, even if
it subjects itself to, beng challengeà later,
in removing what the public thinks to be,
and what a commission appoin-ted- by the
Government of Canada found to be, uinfair,
unj'ust, deleteriaus and harmfdul practices
which have grown up in modern ind'ustry.
Hon. RA4OUL DA'NDURAND: 1 do not
in'tend to discuss this Bill clause by clause,
for imy right honourable friend ha.s aliready
thrown considerable light on the extent of
the proposed, amendments. H'owever, I know

that grave doubt exista as to the validity of
some of these sections. I understand that
in another place the Minister of Justice expressed some doubt, as to the constitutionality of certain sections and cited opinions
obtained from learn'ed counsel.
I thin<
before we proceed furthýer my right, hýonoura)ble frienýd should incorîporate those opinions
in Hansard.
Right Hon. Mr. MEI'GHEN: To save the
ime of the Houee, I wil1i asIc that the
opinions which I shahl hand in, be prin-ted in
to-day's report. AIl that I have are the
opinions of Mr. Tilley and Mr. Geoffrion.
For the convenience of honourable, Tnembers
who do not like to read legal ver.biage I
will summarize them.
As respects clause 4, although. apparentiy
it was referred for opinion, I find no opinion
which in any way irnpugns its vaLidity.
As to clause 5, officers of the Department
of Justice, I understand, are doubtful of its
validiity. Mr. Tiley is unequivocal in expressing the view that the clause is whohly
vabid. Mr. Geoffrion is doubtful, and inclines to the opposite view.
As to clause 6, the Department of Justice
bas expressed no opinion that I have been
able to find. Mr. Tilley expresses the view
that subclause (a) is quite doubtfuh, and
definitely says he is incli.ned to the belief that
iL is invalid. 'Clauses (b) and (c) he believes
to be within our powers. It only -remains
to give Mr. ýGeoffrion's opinion. Hie rather
groupa the clauses together, and it is difficult
to extricate just what be intends to apply
to clause 6 alone. His opinion on. any suzbject
of law is certainly of interest, and as this
opinion is brief, I shahl quote it. He says:
In conformity with your letter of the 6th
instant, I have read the Bill to amend the
Criminal Code, sections 4, 5 and 6, with a
viewv of giving my opinion as to the powers of
Parliament to, adopt iL.
I believe this is good criminal legialation,
therefore wit'hin the Dominion's powers, except
possibly paragraphs (a) and (b) of section
415A as enacted by section 5 of the Bill.
That is *my justification for saying he throws
doubt on the validity of section 5. He does
not go further in relation, to clause 6,, but
proceeds to give bis reasons. Inasmuch as
he says that the legislation is within the
power of Paýrliam-ent, except for paragrapbis
(a) and ('b) of section 415A as enacted by
section 5 of the Bill, it must be taken for
granted that he supports the validity of
clause 6.

Hon. C. O. BAiLLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I had neyer seen this Bill belore I
heard my leader read parts of it to-night.

SENATE

406

I sincerely trust that the validity of clause 6,
which amends section 415A of the Code, is
in question. Take paragraph (b), which says:
-permits
an employee to work beyond the
maximum hours fixed by law or any competent
public authority.
A miik driver, for instance, delivering milk
in the morning, may be delayed by inclrement
weather, heavy snow storms or something
of that kind. If lie is allowed to work beyond
the hour specified a severe penalty is imposed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That would
not lie a violation of the law, because it
provides for such emergencies.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Then we will
say the weather is fine, but that lie bas so
much milk to deliver that he runs an hour
over his time.
Hon. Mr. GALDER:

Another emergency.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not, think
that is covered. However, we shai come to
that in committee.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I may say that
I am going to have considerable objection
to some of these provisions, and more particularly to the one respecting section 498A.
It certainly was not a business man who drew
that section.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I suppose these
opinions willl be given to Hansard.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
OPINION OF MR. TILLEY
Section 4 is, in my opinion, clearly intra
vires. Section 5 is also, I think, intra vires.
Legislation regarding minimum wages and
maximum hours of labour must, except in
cases where the Dominion bas a special
jurisdiction, be enacted by provincial legislatures, and the legislature may of course
create sanctions for the enforcement of its
laws; but this does not prevent the Dominion
from making certain practices, in evasion of
provincial law, crimes and of punishing them
as such. The result may be an inconvenient
exposure to a double liability, but that possibility affords no argument against the right of
the Dominion to exercise its powers.
Subsection 1 of section 6 is, I think, of very
doubtful validity, but sections 2 and 3 are, I
think, valid.
Subsection 1 does not prohibit any contract
between the seller and the purchaser for the
sale of goods. It attaches penal consequences
to the seller granting more favourable terms
to competitors of the purchaser. It seems to
me to be an attempt to interfere with provincial rights and an encroachment on the
provincial legislative jurisdiction.
There is
nothing in the nature of the transactions themselves or in the language of the subsection to
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

indicate that the public interest is being protected or that a wrong against the community
is being prevented. The object seems to be to
compel traders to sell to all competitors on
uniformi terns having regard to quantity and
quality. It seeks to regulate dealings by a
trader with those who are as amongst themselves competitors, and will apply largely to
transactions entirely within a province. There
is no compulsion to sell to all such competitors
who desire to make purchases, but if sales
are made and the contracts are not on the
prescribed footing, the seller, according to the
subsection, commits a crime. No purchaser is
obliged to pay what his competitors pay and
may secure more favourable terms by purchasing from a seller who bas no transactions with
Accordingly, a seller may
his competitors.
commit a crime if lie meets the terms offered
by one of his competitors. It is somewhat
difficult to understand how such an interference with the contractual liberty of a particular
trader can genuinely be determined by Parliament to be in the public interest. The court
is entitled to consider whether Parliament bas
so genuincly determined or bas attempted under
the guise of criminal law to control the civil
rights of persons entering into commercial
contracts within the province. The subsection
does not prohibit transactions of a class
particularly described; indeed all the contracts
made with the purchaser and his competitors
would seen to be valid notvithstanding the
provisions of subsection 1. The sole test of
criminality is, bas a trader carrying on business
in competition with other traders given more
favourable terms to a purchaser than he bas
accorded to the competitors of the purchaser.
A trader making a sale on particular terms
may, therefore, commit a crime, whereas his
competitor iaking the same sale would not.
It is difficult to express an opinion on the
question whether the court will hold that
legislation which takes the forrm of criminal
law is colourable and is in substance an
invasion of the provincial field. All I can say
is that in my opinion the subsection is of very
doubtful validity, and I incline to the view it
is invalid.

Subsections 2 and 3 probibit engaging in
policies of selling at lower prices in a particular
area than elsewhere for the purpose of
destroying competition or eliminating a competitor and selling at unreasonably low prices
for a similar purpose. I think the court would
hold that Parliament genuinely determined
that the commercial activities described in
these subsections were t be suppressed in the
public interest and would maintain the validity
of the subsections. J am of opinion that the
,ourt would treat these subsections as separable.
If the provisions of section 6 were
embodied in three sections, they would clearly
be separable and I can see no reason for
making a distinction because they are in subsections. While the second and third subsections might not as between themselves be
separable, they are I think separable frem the
first subsection.
OPINION OF MR. GEOFFRION
Sir,-In conformity with your letter of the
6th instant, I have read the Bill to amend the
Criminal Code, sections 4, 5 and 6, with a view
of giving my opinion as to the powers of
Parliament to adopt it.

JUNE 25, 1935

1 believe this is good criminal legisiation,
therefore within the Dominion's powers, except
possibly paragrapbs (a) and (b) of section
415A as -enacted by section 5 of the Bill.
1 take it that, generally, these paragraphs
aim at punishment for violation of provincial
legisiation respecting minimum wages and
maximum hours. 0f course, there can be no
doubt in so far as federal legisiation on tbat
.suhject i.s concerned. The majority of cases
would, however, be covered by provincial laws
because the subject of minimum wages and
maximum hours of labour is, it seams to me,
normally a provincial subjeet.
1 know the Dominion Parliament bas already
claimed power to decree punisbment for the
violation of a provincial statute; section 164
of the Criminal ýCode is an example of tbat,
and this bas neyer been challenged, but I doubt'
the validity of such an enactmnent in view of
section 92 of tbe British North America Act,
paragraph 15, whicb gives to the provincial
legislature exclusive legislative power concerning the imposition of punishments for enforcing
afly law of the province, et cetera, et cetera.
If the Dominion can decree a punishment for
the breach of a provincial law, it can do so
whether the province bas decreed one or not.
The legislative power in that respect ceases to
be exclusive, notwitbstanding the terms of the
British North America Act, and the Dominion
statute must prevail, so that the provincial
legislature enacting mandatory or prohibitory
provisions will be axposed to have a punishment attached to its orders quite different
from the one it desired. The pewer, to order
and the power to punisb for disobedience sbould
logically be united.
1 would think the words "criminal law" in
section 91 should ha restricted b3' paragraph
15 of section 92, just as "marriage" in section
91 is restricted by 'solemnization of marriage"
in section 92, the general words in the assignment to the Dominion in both cases being
restricted by the special exclusive assignment
to the province.
I du not think, howaver, that these provisions, if unconstitutional, would affect the
validity of the rest of the .Act.
Yours truly,
A. Geoffrion.
SOLDIER SETTLEMENT BILL
FIP-ST READING

A message was received from the Housa of
Commons with Bill 62, an Act to, amend the
Soldier Settiement Act.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN moved
the second reading of the Bill.
He said: There is nothing difficuit about
this measure. It provides that certain arnployees under the Soldier Settlement Act who
hold positions of indeterminate duration shaîl,
upon çoncurrence by the Governor in Council in a certificate issued by the Director of
Soldier Settlement, become permanent arnployees within the meaning of the Civil

407

Service Act, and in all respects subject to
the provisions of that law. The Soldier Sattiement organization bas been in existence for
approximately fifteen or sixtean years. Soma
of the officiais have been in that employment
for a long time, and I presume it is thought
wise to have them put upon a permanent
basis.
Hlon. RAOUL DANDURAND: This may
ha very good law, but I arn not quite satisfied that it is. I fear that these ganeral anactments may go much beyond what one
would suspect. I should have thought the
right honourable gentleman would have stated
the number of employees or officers covered
by this legisiation. I remember the Calder
Act. This is a blanketing-in, as permanent
employees, of provisional employees who have
not been members of the Civil Service. Tbey
may ha few or they may ha many. My right
honourable friend bas said that Soldier Settiement bas been in operation now for soe
fifteen years, and bas intimated that wa can
well afford to hring into the Civil Service
and treat as permanent those employeas of
the Soldier Settlament organization who have
been with it fromn the beginning.
But 1
always fear the liberality of cnactmnents of
this kind at a time when we should expect a
reduction of staff rather than an increase. I
do flot know how long these people will ha
required, or whether they could ha drawn into
other services whan their Soldier Settlement
work is over. I arn a little fearful of the affect
of such lagislation upon the traasury.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The cmpîcyeas number 333. Ninety-eight par cent
are ex-service men. At the peak of Soldier
Settlament work the organization numherad
as bigh as 1,594. Of tha 333 now amployed,
only those whosc positions are considered
to ha of permanent nacessity will bacome
permanent amployees. Lately tha supervision
of the land sattlemant work of the Department of Immigration bas heen transferred to
the Soldier Settlement organization.
It is
axpactad that this work will last a considerable time. The Director bas under bis authority soma 21,000 properties.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: May I ask
why a statute is necassary? This hlanketingin of so-called temporary civil servants bas
bean going on for a numbar of years. Why
is a law necessary to bring in this class?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think the
situation is thîs. Under the Civil Service
Act certain tenmporary amployeas may ha
made permanent without statute; but the
Soldiar Settlament organization bas neyer

SENATE

408

been under the Civil Service Act in any way.
Doubtless a statute is nccessary or one would
flot have been int.reduced.
1 should have mentioned that in 1928 and
1929 the former Minister favoured such action.
A committee of the House of ýCommons examined into the situation and reported faveurIf the rigbt bonourable gentleman
ably.
reads the debates wbich took place in the
other House be wvill see that Mr. Mackenzie
was a member of that committee, and that
the legislation was passed ov-er owing to
pressure of business. I know the committee
agreed that such a Bill ougbt to be put
through.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Will this include the
class of officiaIs known as supervisors?
Rigbt
ployees.

Hon.

Mr.

MEIGREN:

All

em-

Hon. Mr. CALDER: I imagine this Bill
is very necessary for many reasons. When
this organization was started, about fifteen
years ago-Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN:
years ago.

Seventeen

Hon. Mr. CALDER: -about 1920, there
wvas a tremendous agitation to get soldiers
on tbe land. That agitation, wbicli was very
extensive and very persistent, resulted in the
creation of a large~ organization to carry on
the work. 'rbose responsible for the administration of affairs at that time felt, I tbink,
that tbis large organization would Dlot continue to ho necessary, and that it would
corne to an end, or at all events be greatly
reduced in numbers. ýConsequently tbose who
were employed were not ibrought in under
the Civil Service Act.
Tbat time bas long passed. There have
been one or twe drastic reductions in staff,
and I think this proposed action is past due.
There are, as the right bonourable gentleman
bas said, some 300 emnployee-scattered over
the Dominion, 1 presume-carrying on tbis
work. I doubt very mucb if tbey could be
drafted into tbe Civil Service witbout an
Act of tbis kind.
These men have been
permanent, in a sense, fromn the start, and
I doubt wbetber, iinless it is se provided
in the original leg-islation, tbev would be
entitled to the privilegs otber civil servants
enjoy. For instance, I do not think a man
wbo bas worked for fifteen years in this
department w-ould he entitled to superannuation.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. GRAHIAM:
mnany in a similar position new.
Righ Hlon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

There

are

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Tbere must be. So
I think tbe legislation is necessary.
I do
net think there is anything to be feared,
because tbere bas been a considerable weeding out, and tbe number of ernployees has
been reduced fromn 1,500 to 300. Tbat is an
But
indication of wbat bas taken place.
even under this Bill the Director must make
a recommendation to tbe Governor in Council,
and then tbe Governor in Council must decide
whetber or not tbe recommendation shaîl be
approved.
There are many similar organizations in tbe
service at the present time. I -can-not name
them offband, but I know they exist. I dare
say thait seme of the legisiation, going througb
Parliament at the present time will neýcessitate
just sucb a staff as was required for Soldier
Settlement. Tbose taken on -at first will be
temporary. and the Civil Service Commission
will bave nothing to do witla their appointment. I think that is advisable until those
who are oharged with the administration have
felt their way and know what is likely ýte be
required in the matter of staff. Then, in a
cam.paratively short time, there sboulid be a
dlean-up, as tbere bas been in this case.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Wbat I have
in mind is this. Is this but the start, of sometbing wbicb, it will be urged, should be applied
te every ýbrancb of the Government? We all
know tbere are men w-be have been employed
for twcnty years--some, of themn longer-but
have net been made permanent ini the
tecbnical sense.
Hoýn. Mr. CALDER: Do ycu net thin-k tbey
should be?
Rigbt Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I do. Governments have been blanketing employees in,
perbaps witb tbe consent ef the Civil Service
Commission. Wben it is discovered that one
class of c.mpleyee is being taken ini on the
recommendation of the Director, is it net
naturel that others should urge that legislatien be passed making tbern permanent?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The only obligation iýnvehved is in relation te pension. Apart
from that, ne great faveur is conferred. It is
my undýerstanding that one cf tbese empîcyces
bas te pay up the arre-ars of a.sessmenit in
order te se-cure any decent, sort of superannuation. Il he bas served for fifteen years,
in erder te retire witb a pension based on
thirty years' empîcyment he bas te, serve a
furtber fifteen years and make double contribution during that .period.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
vided in the statute?

Is it se pro-

JUNE 25, 1935
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Once he becomes a
permanent official he has that right.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: To pay up. When
the temporary employees of the Department
of Pensions and Health were taken in they had
some twelve years' servi.ce to their credit. In
order te be placed in the position they would
have occupied had they belonged te the
permanent service from the very beginning,
they have had te contribute ten per cent of
their salaries instead of the usual five per cent.
Se after all is said and done, you are not conferring any great privilege upon them.
Right Hon.
like it.

Mr. GRAHAM:

Still, they

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yea, they like it.
Hon. Mr. -GRýIESBACH: Yes. There is
another possibility, that some of these men
may receive more pay as temporary employees than they will as permanent employees
when 'bhey are properly classified. There was
thought te be a certainty of tenure of employment on the permanent staff, but the
last three or four years have disclosed that
there is no such certainty. Se 'the only privilege these employees receive is superannuation, and they have te buy that.
Hon. iMr. DANDURAND: I see no objection te dlassifying as permanent all those
who have been in the service fifteen years,
or ten. years, but I fear that if there is a
general blianketing-in it will cover many men
who have joined the service only lately.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I see nothing in
that. The first question is whether this is
a permanent service. Has it been dîsclosed
by experience that this service will be needed
for a considerable number of years? If that
question is answered in the affirmative, then
it is in the interest of the State te take into
the permanent service ail the employees,
even those who have been appointed recently.
t is not a good thing te have men in this
branch of the service paying ten per cent of
their salaries for superannuation, when other
employees are paying only five per cent. Ten
per cent is too large a deduction from a man's
pay, and it might result in repercussions of
an unpleasant kind. There should be no
undue delay in making these employees part
of the permanent staff, once it is established
that the service in which they are engaged
is going te be needed for a long time.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I do not wish
te be considered for one minute as objecting
te something of this kind, but I would point
out that this service has not as strong claims

for such legislation as have some other
branches of the Civil Service in the city of
Ottawa. Go into any department and you
will find some men, and perhape women, who
have been doing permanent work for years,
but have never been able te be blanketed
in, as we say. They have not the privilege
of promotion, to start with.
Hon. Mr. HARMER: The Printing Bureau.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: They have not
a statutory claim te promotion as provided
by the Civil Service Act. Now, it is a considerable handicap for a man who has been
employed many years in a department, where
he is perhaps almost indispensable, te have
no claim to promotion because he ik classed
as a temporary employee. I want te say
that I thinik it will come about in time-and
I am in favour of it-that every person who
is in fact permanently employed in the Government service will be made a civil servant
under the law, with ail the privileges that the
Law gives.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable members,
we are overlooking one feature. All who
enter the permanent Civil Service must pass
a competitive examination. They must show
that they possess certain qualifications. I
am not talking of the higher classes of
technical men, because I presume they are
accepted on the basis of their university examinations. But if anyone wants te join
the permanent Civil Service as a clerk,
stenographer, book-keeper or employee of aimost any other kind, he must pass an examination. Those who are taken on as temporary
employees are not required te pass such examination. Se if all temporary employees
wexe drafted into the permanent service we
should be taking them in without their having passed the required tests, and that in
itself would be a big thing. I quite agree
with the right honourable gentleman from
Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham) that in
the service a considerable number of employees classified as temporary have been on
the pay-roll for many years. I dare say that
some of those were appointed te temporary
positions simply because they could not or
would not pass the required examinations.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Many of them,
perhaps, before there were examinations.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes, some of them,
undoubtedly, before there were examinations.
It seems te me that there should be a cleanup, because in the public service of Canada
there are many men who have been employed
for twenty, twenty-five, and even perhaps

SENATE
thirty or forty years, who still are on the
temporary list. They are not entitled to
superannuation or any privileges provided by
the Civil Service Act with respect to promotion and other things.
In connection with this Bill, I do not know
what position these three hundred will be in
once they are drafted into the permanent
Civil Service.
What will be their rights?
Will they be entitled to promotion, and if so
will their past service be taken into account?
I think that what the honourable senator
from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) says
about superannuation is correct. Once they
are placed on the permanent list they will be
entitled to credit for the number of years
they have served, but if they wish that time
to count in connection with superannuation
they will bave to pay the full amount for
such time. I know of an instance out west.
One of our leading civil servants was in the
Government employ for thirty years, but he
was not under the Civil Service Act. He was
permitted to come in under that Act provided he paid towards superannuation the
amount that 1e would have paid had he been
contributing to the fund during all that
period. As a result he paid in about $5,000
in one lump sum. And I dare say that if this
Bill is passed these three hundred employees
in question will have the right to the benefits of superannuation provided they make
the required payment for every year they
have been in the service. Unless they make
that back payment, their time for superannuation purposes will cont only from the date
of their being placed on the permanent list.
However, there are a number of features in
connection with the Bill that should be explained before it is put through.
Now, as to a clean-up-I am sure there is
need for one in connection with most of the
departments-it might be advisable to have
the deputy ministers of the various departments, the Civil Service Commission and perhaps some other person decide who should be
blanketed into the permanent service. Under
this Bill the Director of Soldier Settlement
makes a recommendation as to any employee
whom it is desired to have made permanent.
It might be well to go further and have the
Government look forward to dealing with the
other branches of the Civil Service within the
year.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I realize that I
am speaking too often. At the present time
the Deputy Minister, I think, recommends to
the Civil Service Commission those emiployees
who he thinks ought to be blanketed in. My
honourable friend has brought up a new
Hon.

Mr.

CALDER.

feature of this Bill. It is the Director of
Soldier Settlement who makes the recommendation in connection with any employees
in that department, and it is made not to the
Civil Service Commission, but to the Governor in Council. That is a -different thing
altogether.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I see the point. Under
the present law, relating to all the departments, the Deputy may recommend to the
Civil Service Commission that a certain person
in his department be made permanent. Then
the Civil Service Commission .decides whether
to accept the recommendation or not.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Yes. Then, if
it is accepted, it goes to the Governor in
Council.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: But under this Bill the
Director of Soldier Settlement makes the
recommendation directly to the Governor in
Council.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Honourable members, if I understand the situation correctly,
all promotions have been suspended during
the last few years.
The honourable senator from Salteoats (Hon.
Mr. Calder) bas informed us that these employees of the Soldier Settlement Board have
been employed as temporaries, but not under
the provisions of the Civil Service Act. My
understanding was that the staff of the
Soldier Settlement Board were appointed as
temporaries, under the provisions of the Civil
Service Act, and that they came in after examination, as all who enter the service are
required to do. Now this bas opened up a
new question. If it is recommended that
people who have been taken into the department without examination be now placed on
the permanent staff, what check will there be
as to their ages? Some of them may be ovèr
the age limit and not eligibla to be blanketeld
in under the Civil Service Act. Is it the intention of the right honourable leader to refer
this Bill to a committee, in order that we
may have an opportunity of going into details?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That intention has been growing on me lately. I intend
to move that the Bill be sent to the Standing
Committee on Civil Service Administration.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved that the
Bill be referred to the Standing Conmittee
on Civil Service Administration.

JUNE 25, 1935

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This committee
has not been given very much work lately.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No.
,Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I hope the
committee wil1 be able to obtain first-hand
information frcm, the Di-rector of Soldier
Settiement as to the staff, how long they
have been empioyed, and so on. And perhape we should have a list of the salaries.
It seemns to be a rather important move
to bring into the permanent service sorne
three hundred persoins who agreed to accept
temporary employment, but I arn quite sure
that sorne of our misgivings will be removed
after the committee has, cone its work.
Hon.,Mr. MOLLOY: Il. might be interesting to have the House informed as to the
nunsýber of those employees who, are drawing
pensions.
Right Hon. M.r. MEIGHEN: Does the
honourable gentleman mean rnilitary pensions?
Hon. Mr. M'OILLOY: Yes.
Right Hon. M'r. -MEIGHEN: There are
bound to be somne, I should think. But since
the War-and ind*eed while the Wàr was on
-both House.s laid down the rule that the
right to pension is entirely independent of
any earnings a man is able to make in
addition. I h.ave not the required information now, but I arn sure it can be obtained
in the committee.
Right Hon. M.r. GRA'HAM: The pension
dependes on the ma-n's disability.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGtHEN: Yes.
The motion was agreed to.
COMBINES INVESTIGATION BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received%from the House of
Commons with Bill 79, an Act to amend the
Combines Investigation, Act.
The Bill was read the firat time.
SECOND READING

,Right Hon. Mr. 1M1EGHIEN moved the
second reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable members, this is one
of those meaurTes which I mentioned as
having corne over so late that I could not
understand their purport in time to make an
erplanation. However, with respect to, this
Bill I have'been able to overeome that handicap in the lasb fifteen minutes.
The Bill amends the Combines Investigation Act. E.veryone knows the putiposes of

411

that Act. It has been admi.nistered heretofore under the Minister of Labour, and the
chief officer bas 'been a registrar. There is
provision for the registrar's officiaIs, examinations by thern, hea.rings, reports to the 'Minister, discretion of the Mini.ster and so forth.
The whole system is altered by this measure;
it is alI delegated to a commission.
'Right Hon. Mr. GRAIIAM: The Tariff
Board.
Right Hon. M.r. MEIGHEN: I think it
is the Tariff Board which, becornes the commission in the premises.
It will be
Hon. Mr. DANiDURAN'D:
delegated to the Dominion Trade and Industry Commission, if 'the Bill passes.
Right Hon. Mir. MEIGHEN: Yes, the
Dominion Trade and I.ndustry Commission,
which is the present, Tariff Board. The
amendments9 almost entirely are incidental
to that alteration. There are, however, other
features. "Merger" is d'efined: it. is not
defined in the present Act. There are alterations to va.rious sections of the Act. The
duties of the Commission are set out in section 4, and they can be compared with the
duties of the registrar, which are given on
the opposite page of the Bill. Provision is
macle for applying to the Commission with
respect to a.ny agreement affecting indu.stry.
It appears to be recognized that some latitude miust be allowed. In fact, it lias a!ways
been an, becautse even under the present
rigid l'aw an agreemnent could not be banned
unless it was such as worked- against the
public intDrest. Provision is made for inquiry as to whether or noV any proposed or
existing agreement is against. the public interest. The Inquiries Act is made applicable.
and the Commission is given powers Vo conduct inquiries and to keep witnesses in hand.
They are not al'owed- to insult the commissioners.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: What is the
good of being a witness?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Privy
Council bas ruled that a commissioner must
noV insult a witness.

SENATE
It is the intention, of course, to refer the
Bill to the Banking and Commerce Committee
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I expect the
Minister will find Labour pretty strongly
arrayed against some sections of the Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I had not
heard of that. If it is the case, I think I
can assure my right honourable friend that
this House will be on the side of intelligent
Labour.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:

As usual.

The motion was agreed te, and the Bill
was read the second time.
FRUIT, VEGETABLES AND HONEY BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House
3f Commons with Bill 95, an Act respecting
Fruit, Vegetables and Honey.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of the Bill.
He said: This Bill will be referred to the
Committee on Agriculture and Forestry. I
am satisfied it will require amendment. Its
purpose is te consolidate the two Acts respecting vegetables and fruit and honey, and sQ
simplify their administration.
But it has
another purpose-to give effect to the report
of this illustrious and immortal Price Spreads
Commission; only, however, te the extent
of making inspection at canning factories
compulsory. I believe that in the past, when
voluntary inspection has become general, the
industry has desired that it be made conpulsory. That stage has been reached in
relation te fruit and vegetables and honey.
Consequently the Price Spreads Commission
recommended that inspection should be made
compulsory. Section 6 provides that produce
may be detained at the risk and expense of
the owner. Essential provisions of the other
two measures are re-enacted.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Is the word
"export" used for trade between provinces?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. I am
sorry te inform the right honourable senator
from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham-) and
the 'honourable senator from Queen's (Hon.
Mr. Sinclair) that the word is defined te
mean "export out of Canada or out of any
province te any other province thereof."
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I am net a
member of the Committee on Agriculture,
but I may say I am opposed to applying the
word "expert" te interprovincial trade.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable senator from Queen's is a memiber of
that committee.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It will be only
another step to raise a tariff between
provinces.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am sure if
the honourable gentleman fror Queen's cannot think of a better word no one else can.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I shall expect
my honourable friend from Queen's to find
a more suitable word te describe the sale of
a bushel of potatoes by a person in Quebec
te a persen in Ontario, or vice versa.
The motion was agreed te, and the Bill
was read the second time.
RADIO BROADCASTING BILL

He said: This is merely an extension of
the powers of the Radio Commission.
I
suggest that it be referred te the Banking and

that there important amendments will be
suggested.
The motion was agreed te, and the Bill

of Commons with Bill 100, an Act te amend
the Post Office Act.

Right Hin. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the

He said: The Post Office Act provides that

been the practice te interpret this as meaning

of a Franchise Comi.ssioner. Colonel John
Thorapson was, I believe, .appointed by unanimousm resolution of the House of Comamons.
Thatt House, of cou-rse, is the braneh- of Parliament affected by this mneasure. The Commissioner is empowered to appoint registrars.
Provision is -made for compiling lists of electors, and for the registrar to say whether a
prima facie case has 'been moade out for removal of any name. Having so deterrnined,
the registrar must send notice to the person
affected, at the address given in the voters'
list, to afford him or anyone on his behaîf
opportunity to rebut the prima fadie presuniption. Ini the event of an adverse ruling
it may be appealed before a judge. In one
case only-and my information cornes, though
not directly, from the Comnmissioner-a, judge
held that he 'had the right to review the decisioxi of the registrar, and, if in his judgment
there was no prima facie -case, to order the
naine to be retained on the list.
Hionourable meanbers will see at once that
under such a ruling the registrar would be
virtually functus officio from the start, and the
purging of the votera' lists would become an
absolute impossibility. If more than. a prima
f aciecase bas to be mnade out-if, for exa.mple,
a daughter produces an affidavit that her
mother died, and was buried on a certain date,
and the registrar decides that is a prima facie
case for the removai of the naine, but the
judge ruies that the registrar should require
production also of a death certificate and
probate of the ,will-I am afraid it wiIl be
impossible to toniplete compilation of voters'
lists.
This is the operative amendment:
Upon the hearing of any such appeal from

-of 1934 provision is made for the appointmnent

that at the end of each four years 'he contract may be renewed if considered in the
public intercst. To my mind no such interpret.ation is justifled. The section intended
that the contract be renewed for onl-y one
terni of four years. This Bill substitutes
for "term" the words "or terins," and thereby
enables subsequent renewa-ls to be made for
four years. It is to be retroactive in order
to legalize such renewals as have been made
in the past.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I notice that an
expiring contract may be renewed "for a
further terni or terras not exceeding four
years each." Poes that imply renewal on
the same conditions?
Right Hon. M.r. MEIGUEN: I should
think so. It would not be a renewal if a
new contract were made.

Rigit, Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think I

couki alter the contract so long as the change
was considered to be in the publie interest.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: What about

It is my information that
every other judge bas interpreted the law
otherwise. If we do flot make this provision
declaratory, where are wc to land? We could
never purge the lists in Mootreal if the judge

would ýbe the order of the day.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
0f course I
am in agreement with this declaratory meastire, but I feel some diffidence about making
it retroactive and wiping out a judgment that
bas been rendered on the baisis of a law
capable of the interpretation given.
As a
matter of fact, Parliament is now feeling the
uccessity of amending the Act by clarifying it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN:

That is rigbt.

Hon. Mr. DANDUR.AND:
That being so,
is it not natural to conclude that the judge
was ot wrong in bis interpretation of the
Act?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I do not
want to refle-ct on the judge, but simply
because we clarify the Iawv, it dons not follow
that there is groond for bis decision. I do
not know any other way of correcting the

there would be anme force to what my honourable friend says; but I am not sure that

POSTPONED

The Hon. the SPEAKER informed the
Senate that bie had rnceivnd a message from
the House of Commons rnading as follows:
That this House desires to acquaint their
honours that in respect to thn Senate amenfimients to Bill No. 21, an Act to provide for
Iiiniting the Hours of Work in Industriel
Undertakings to eighit in the day and fortyeight in tbe week, in accordance with tbe
Convention cnncerning the application of the
principle of the Eight Hour Day or of the
Forty-eight Hour Week adopted by the General
Conference of the International Labour Organization of the League of Nations, in accordance
witb the Labour Part of the Treaty of
Versailles of 28th Junc, 1919, this Honse agrees
with amendments one to eighit, inclusive;
Andi that with respect t0 Senate ailiendznent
No. 9, this House moves as a consequential
aindment thereto, that the words "six months"
be substitutcd for the words "three months."
Rigbt Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, it, is indeed a matter of
gratification that the extensive amendments
made by the Senate to the first tbree measures
on wbich we bave just bad a report from
His Honour the Speaker are wholly concurred in by the Commons. If really makes
one feel that the laýbours of our committee
have been worfh while. Even with respect
f0 Bill 21, in relation f0 wbich anc of our
ameodmeots is objecfed to, or is submitted
f0 further ameodiment by the House of Comnions, there is no reason for any greaf disappointmenf.

JUNE 25, 1935
As to the amendment we made, 'which is
an important one, I find it very diffleuit
indeed to accept the reasoning of the Bouse
of Commons. Honourable inembers will recall that in this Bill an exception was provided
to enable recognition, for a period, of agreements between the railways on the one hand
and the unions and employees on the ather.
This was to make, possible adjustmnent to
the new situation and to facilitate negatiatians
between the railways and their employees
wit.h respect to conditions under the new
eight-hour law. In the original Bill the time
stipulated was, in reality, a year. The Senate
committee. took the view that it could be
dane wibh-in a shorter timne, and made provision for a bhree-m'onth period aiter the
coming into force of the Act, which was to
occur three months after the Bill was assented
to. That is ta say, we eut in two the time
originaIly provided for by the Gommons.
1 arn not yet just su-re of the effect ai the
Commons amendment-I arn certain the hionou.ra.ble senator from Parkdale iýs--but it
certaiSly extends the time fixed by us. R[t
is very important that no unnecessary time
be given, because it is manifest that ail the
time allowed wiJ'l be taken. I was ready to
accept the opinion, expressed by those who
k-now a great deai more about the matter
than I do, that adjustments could be made
and agreements arrived at within the time
fixed 'by us. The Commons seem to be of
the view that this is not the case.
In this -connection I want ta advert to
certain very casual, exceedingly uninformed,
and, in-deed, exoeedi.ngly ignorant comments
that have been made with regard to Senate
amendments. Complaint bas been made of
the number af amendmen'ts, and it bas been
stated bhat they are emasculatory in character.
I put myseli in the bands of this House, and
indeed oi the country, when I say that ai
ail the âmendments we have mnade, be they
ta what are called reforma measures -or others,
nat one bas been emascuilatary in any sense
of the word. On the contrary, t.he important
amendments have been quite the reverse.
The most important of the fifty-one amendments made by t.bis Bouse to the Unemployment Insurance Bih!1 wa.s the one including
the banks and financial institutions ai Canada.
That amendaient was of more consequence
than any five others, though they also were
strengthening ainendments.
Our amendment to Bill 2:1 did not weaken,
impair or abbreviate the Bill, but extended
it. It made it operative aver a whole sweep
of employees much earlier than did the provision in the Bill as it came, fromn the Coin-

mons. But there are some who are determi*ned ta throw stones, and who prefer to be
absolu-tely biindfolded *befare they eseay the
act. I venture ta say there are critics ai that
sort who could nat for the hife af themn tell
about a single amendment of the hundreds
made 'by the Senate this session. This is an
instance in point. It is illustrative af the
whole character of the work dane.
I amn disposed to fsel that we ought ta
make anather effort ta have aur view
accapted by the Commons, 'but I amn nat hrepared with a motion ta that effect to-day.
Hon. JAMEBS MURDOCK: Hanourable
senatars, this. Bill came ta us frarn Vhs Bouse
of -Commons before the close af ýMareh. 1
arn advised that same few days priar ta that
time canierences were held between certain
representatives of Labour-Tam Moore tells
me that lie was ane-and certain ministers,
in which it was arguedr by the reipresentatives
af railroad organizations that there might be,
and wauld- be, seriaus difficulty in bringing
about a -rearrangement af schedule provisions,
conditions and aihowances, in such a way as
,ta permit ai the consistent application ai
this eight-hour day and, foxrty-eight-hour week
Bill' ta the railroad men!'s classifications ai
work. Raihraad men, bath in train and, engine service, usually work according to a
composite miheage and h'aurly arrangement
under which very irequently one hundred
miles is run in much less than eight hours,
but a one-hundred-mile run, with freight,
is synanymaus with eight actuel hours ai
wark. In fact, bath the aperating officers ai
the railroads and the men themslves, yes,
and the shipper and the public et large,
desire as prompt a transport af freight as can
be secured, and that bas always been held
out ta the railroad men as an incentive ta
get the trains over the road. The rule bas
been in effect for years, therefore, that eight
hours and one hundred miles shah! be
synanymous in reckoning a day's pay.
0f course the, rail.road campanies and the
raihroad arganizatians do nat want ta bid the
devil gaod marning, shall I say, until they
have ta. What do 1 mean by that? For
tbree or four years naw, by mutual agreement, the Iower-paid. men-the brakesmen,
yardrnen and firemen-h ave been giving up a
substantial. portion ai their monthhy a]howances ta the junior men, who are unemployed. For four years naw the yardmen
have said: "Take us out ai service as soon
as we have earned twenty-six days' psy."
Certain other arganizatians bave said: "No;
tiwenty-six days' pay is not sufficient." As
a matter ai fact, the scheduhe provisions on

41.

SENATE

the railroads usually allow for a minimum
monthly guarantee of compensation.
For
example-I am now speaking only fram recollection-it is $200 a month for a passenger
conductor. The lower-paid, men waived many
of the allowances, however, and said: "Put us
on a twenty-sixday month basis in yard service and give the rest, which we normally
made in years gone by, to our less favoured
fellow employees."
Some classes earn substantially higher daily
rates than others. For example, the brakesman's daily rate would be about two-thirds
of the conductor's daily rate; the fireman's
daily rate would be about the same proportion of the engineer's daily rate.
There
might be a little variation. Therefore the
engineer would make daily about one-third
more than the fireman, and the conductor
one-third more than the brakesman.
When this Bill came to us in the first place
a tacit understanding had been arrived at,
which was satisfactory to the gentlemen handling the Bill in another place. So they evidently said: "All right, we wilI give the railroad companies and these organizations a
year to reach an agreement whereby the
schedules in effect can be applied properly,
without any loss or without materially violating the principles of those schedules." And
all concerned seemed to be satisfied. Some
might say, su should we be. Perhaps. But
here is the question. By virtue of section 15
the Bill does not come into effect until three
months after it receives Royal Assent. Then
here in the Senate we shortened the time that
had been provided with respect to railroad
men, and we said that three months later than
that it should come into effect for them. But
the other House bas changed that to six
months.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is nine
months altogether.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That means nine
months from the date that the Bill receives
Royal Assent. A distinguished citizen, who I
am sure believed exactly what he said, used
this language in another place:
It has been felt that this is a matter in
which, as there is acute difference of opinion,
it is desirable ta arrive at some arrangement
that will clarify the situation without doing
injustice, either remotely or nearly, to any
interest that might be affected.
As I say, I am quite sure the right honourable
gentleman who made that statement believed
it was correct. But it is not so. If all conHon.

Mr. MURDOCK.

cerned were told to put this Bill into effect
it could be put into effect next Monday morning on the railways of Canada. And if it
were put into effect several hundred railroad men would be given work-men who
would like a meal ticket, who would like a
monthly wage. This talk about not being
able to put it into effect is simply not correct. Of course there will have to be some rearrangements, some changed understandings.
I think I personally have been involved in
making nearly every trainmen's wage schedule
on either of the railways of Canada for the
past thirty-five years. I know something
about the matter from the stand.point of the
trainmen. To argue that the Bill could not
be put into effect at once is simply an attempt to "kid the troops," as they tell me
the soldýiers used to say.
There should have been no exception at
all made for railroad men. I say that with al]
due consideration of the fact that railroad
men have interchangeable bases of pay-mileage and hours. The Bill, as I say, could be
put into effect at once, and it is just a question of whether we are going to hold out a
little hope to hundreds of men who have
been out of work for maybe two, three or
four years, that after New Year's Day they
will be able to get a job because about that
time the provisions of this Bill will come into
effect, with the result that some men will not
by making 35, 40, or 45 days' pay a month
while others are walking around.
I am not going to say much more on the
question. I do not know whether it is possible ta change understandings that evidently
are deeply imbedded in the minds of some
distinguished citizens in another place. But I
do say this, that if there is any sincerity-and
I know there is-about desiring to do no
"injustice, either remotely or nearly, to any
interest that might be affected," this amendment that comes to us from the House of
Commons ought to be amended for the benefit of hundreds of unemployed railroad men
who for the past few months have been looking with a little hope towards what this
Bill might do for them.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall the
amendment made by the House of Communs be taken into consideration?

Right Hon. iMr. MEIGHEN: The Radio
Act passed in 1932 provided for the creation
of a commission, and its indefinite operation
in the supervision of radio in Canada. The
powers of the commission were definitely outlined, and limitations imposed, but there was
no provision limiting the period of experimentation or the life of the commission. In the
early part of this year an amendment went

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Perhaps it
was 1932. The amendment was designed to
limit the life of the commission-or, according to my impression, to extend the life of
the commission. I ask the indulgence of the
House, because I have not checked the exact
history. We know that in the old Aot there
was no limitation at all. The amending Bill
contained provision for expiration at a certain
time, the intention being that this provision
should apply to the original Act. But somehow or other it was made to apply to the
amending Act. The error of the Commons
was not noticed in the Senate-as far as I
know, it has not yet been noted in the Commons-and the Bill went through. Consequently the amending Act was limited, which
made no sense at all. The intention of this
Bill clearly is to limit the powers of the present commission to the 31st of March next
year, in order that a new Parliament may be
free to deal with the commission and with
radio policy in general. But, owing to the

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the

The motion ws agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.
OMPANIES BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN moved
the second reading of Bill 85, an Act to amend
the Companies Act, 1934.
He said: Honourable members, it will be
remembered that a year ago a Bill making
quite extensive revisions to the Companies
Act was brought before the Senate.
My
recollection is that it was introduced in this
House and received its primary consideration here. The view I held at the time was
that the important amendments then effected
put the measure into very desirable form.
The Commission on Price Spreads and Mass
Buying has made recommendations, the implementing of which demands further reformations in the Companies Act. It is to be
presumed that these reformations are a selection from the report of the Commission,
based on merit. In any event, they are embodied in this measure, the features of which
I will now outline.
The purpose of the second clause-the first
being merely the title of the Bill-is to provide that nothing shall be included in an
application for letters patent other than those
powers which the company really requires for
the bona fide exercise of the business it intends to engage in. The clause also definitely
restricts, apparently more rigidly than heretofore, the operations of companies within
their charter powers.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: It does not affect
companies operating under provincial charter?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Our Companies Act cannot affect any companies other
than those under Dominion charter.
The third clause amplifies a phrase used in
the statement of the objects of the company,
so that it will read:

9258$ -27
R!SED

EDITION

418

SENATE

The purpose for which incorporation is
sought which shall be liinited to the purposes
and objects which it is intended that the
company shall actively pursue.
Clause 4 relates to the allotment of proceeds of sale of stock. Hitherto such proceeds
could have been allotted either to capital or
to distributable surplus, the part set aside
as distributable surplus being confined to 25
per cent. If this clause passes, there can be
no allotment to distributable surplus except
what is provided for in the terms of the contract of subscription, and it shall not exceed
25 per cent.
The fifth clause is new as to an important
feature. It is intended to bring about such
a state of affairs that the directors will be
compelled to see to the adequacy of all consideration given for stock of the company.
The responsibilities of directors under this
clause, as under many subsequent clauses of
the Bill, are made more onerous, more difficult. and, I think I might say, more dangerous.
The second subsection of section 5 forbids
the issue of what heretofore have been known
as management shares. The spirit of the
measure in this regard is that all shares shall
have equal voting rights. 'Of course, everyone closely associated with companies knows
that it would be an anachronism to provide
that all shares must for ever have equal voting rights. It would make impossible the
taking over of many concerns, and in the
event of failure of earnings would do gross
injustice to preferred shareholders. Saving
clauses, however, are contained in a later part
of the Bill, and I shall refer to them when
the proper time arrives.
Clause 6 puts in rather different and in
more restricted form the latitude of a conpany in respect of division or consolidation
of shares. Unrestricted classification of shares
is forbidden.
Clause 7 does away with deferred shares.
The House will distinguish at once between
deferred shares-very common in England
and very uncommon here-and preferred
shares. They are distinctly different. This
clause makes provision also for such conversions as hereafter will be permitted of preferred into common and of common into preferred; of course, with the consent of the
holders as set out. It provides as well that
preferred shares may be made redeemable.
This has always been the case if requested in
the charter, unless certain objections existed.
The extent te which this may be done is set
out in subsection 2.
Section 8 specifies the conditions under
which preferred shares may be redeemed or
converted.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Now I come to the more important features,
those relating to prospectus and sale of stock.
Briefly, the intent is to provide against what
the Commission found was an evil-sale by
Having first purchased from
underwriters.
the company itself by an underwriting contract the initial or treasury issue of stock, they
proceed as owners to sell to the public, and
the public do not get the protection afforded
by the Companies Act, of whatever information may be contained in the prospectus
as to the company's position. history, earnings,
liabilities, and so forth. This Bill seeks to
protect purchasers of stock from underwriters
in the same way as purchasers from the
original company lieretofore have been protected.
Every lawyer in the House-and most honourable members are now at least pretty
close to the high standing of the legal profession, because we have all the time to deal
with intricate legal matters-will be wondering whether we are not getting into the
question of civil rights when we seek to stand
between a bond house which owns the stock
or other security issue of a company and
that bond hous-e's purchasers. The Bill provides that before the company, which is
under our jurisdiction, as it is our creation,
sells its issue to underwriters as defined in
the Bill, it must take from those underwriters
a contract that they shall deliver a copy of
the prospectus to every person they approach
for the purpose of selling stock. They must
comply with relevant provisions of this new
Bill. Under these circumstances the underwriters are made the agents of the company
with respect to the sale of stock. I am not
arguing on either the constitutionality or the
merits of the proposed legislation; I am
merely seeking to make it understood.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The underwriter then would not become the owner.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: He does as
a matter of fact become the owner.

that I cannot see anything there which is
likely te be attacked. But when we come
to declare that the underwriter is an agentRight Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
I had in mind.

That is what

JUNE 26, 1935
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: -when in
fact he is not, I am not sure that we are
on very solid ground. However, without
doubt, there is a very laudable purpose to
this phase of the BillSome Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
-and, I
think, a very important purpose. I earnestly
trust it is secured by impregnable clauses and
verbiage.
I may say that one's task in absorbing a
measure of this kind for purposes of presentation to the House is much increased by the
fact that the rule of the Senate requiring
explanations on the adjoining page appears
now to be totally evaded. No explanations
are given, though we always find the opposite
page pretty well covered. The existing law
is set out, and the reader is left to worry
through the Bill to find out what changes are
proposed. There is a modest abstention from
making any explanation.
Section 12.-This again strengthens the law
on the subject of payment of dividende where
capital is impaired. Always it has been forbidden; indeed, until 'lately at least, the
penalty was so extreme as to be irrational.
However innocent the directors might have
been for years, they became immediately
liable for all the debts of the company; not
just for the amount voted for dividends.
My impression is that that fault was cured
in the last revision. But this Bill provides
that the directors cannot be paid if in any
way they impair the capital of the company.
In determining whether there is impairment
or insolvency no account can be taken of any
writing-up of the company's assets whdeh has
been done within a space of five years before
the date of the dividend declaration. It is
to be impressed on honourable senators that
this is irrespective of whether such write-up
of capital was justified or not. If made
within five years, no account can be taken
af that added asset in deciding the question
whether a company was solvent or its capital
impaired at the time of the dividend declaration.
Section 13 makes the elected directors of
a company liable for all the acte of the provisional direotors. I can see a good purpose
there, but I am inclined to think we are going
to end with dummy directors. It is entirely
wrong 'to ailow provisionali directors-who are
usually stenographers in the iaw firm instructed to get out the charter-to do aots
which they should not do and then have
the new directors come in and carry on
quite legitimately. This Bill seeks at al
92584-27J

419

events to obviate the evil, 'to make the new
directors liable for the conduct of the old.
Of course, it can be said they do not have
to take the position. But one has to consider the alternative.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Does that apply
right along :during the life of the company?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The direotors
elected at the first general meting are the
only ones liable. But, as far as I can see,
their liability continues throughout the life
of the company-throughout eternity. There
is no limit there that I can see.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Any stockholder can sue them.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: Any stockholder can sue them.
'Clause 14 makes it the duty of the officers
of the company to inform the directors immediately of any important impairment of
capital, or of any belief on their part of
the insolvency of the company. The directors
are thereuptn required to call a spécial
general meeting without deday.
Clause 15 is also distinctly new, and is
highly vital. Its purpose is to protect the
purchasing and selling public against speculation in the stock of a company by its directors.
This is a result, I presume, of certain investigations in the United States Senate. If
reports reaching us were correct, great wrongs
were done in the United States by directors
who, knowing all the perils surrounding a
company, and being aware of its ghastly
losses, unloaded their stock on the innocent
public, and later on, when there was a chance
of revival, bought it back, thus taking advantage of their peculiarly favourable position as against the public. This provision is
intended to cure that evil. Admittedly the
purpose is a splendid one if it can be accomplished. I am inclined to think the legislation is fairly skilfully designed to that end.
It provides that every director who deals in
the stock of his company must at stated
periods file in the records, so as to make
available to the shareholders at any time, a
statement of exactly what he has done. Furthermore, while not forbidden to buy or sell,
directors are forbidden to speculate in the
stock of their own company. Speculation is
carefully defined as buying and selling for the
sake of profit within a comparatively narrow
space of time.
Honourable members will recognize at once
that it would be entirely wrong or injurious
to forbid a director or manager of a company
to sell or purchase its stock. Much could be
said in favour of such a prohibition. It could

SENATE
be said that these men know the position of
the company better than do others. That is
true; but if persons interested in the management of a company are forbidden to own its
stock by purchase, which is the only way they
can become owners, the first condition of
Directors

often consider it advisable to protect their
own shareholders by buying stock before it
reaches an unjustifiably low level. On the
other hand, when in their judgment the
stock is above its natural level, they often
sell so that people may not be deceived by
market quotations. It is indeed hard to steer
the sbip of legislation between these two
rocks. This phase of the Bill is an attempt
to do so. I am not certain that an attempt
to attain a similar end bas been made in any
other legislation.
Further provisions have to do with the
adequacy of consideration paid for shares,
and the liability of directors if that conLimitations of
sideration is not sufficient.
that liability are set out in the later sections
of clause 15.
I now come again to the subject of voting
rights. All shareholders are given equal voting
rights, subject to the provisions of any bylaw of the company duly enacted under the
provisions of this Act. Obviously the modification is necessary.
Clause 17 refers to the contents of the
balance sheet. For a long time we have been
adding to the details of information that
must be included in a balance sheet. We
are now adding to then again. Bills receivable must be divided into current and noncurrent accounts. Inventories must be shown
in their various subdivisions. In giving the
value of lands, buildings and plant there must
be a specific statement as to how much of
the valuation is attributable to the writing-up
of assets. The other provisions of the amended
section are not changed in any important
respect.

A very important new provision is inserted
in clause 18. All sums paid to directors by
the company must be shown in the annual
statement. Salaries of executive officers and
salaried directous, and legal fees paid by the
company, must also be shown. The question
whether this compulsion should apply to
private companies will corne before the committee which will deal with this measure.
It is provi.ded, and more extensively than
ever before, that the balance steet and statements of income and expenditure, surplus, and
so on, must be sent in a prepaid wrapper or
letter to all shareholdes, once a year, before
the date of the annual meeting. A copy of

each of these documents is also to be .mailed
to the Secretary of State. Any holder of
debentures is entitled, on demand, to be furnished with a copy of the balance sheet, without charge. I think this provision should increase the postal revenues considerably.
The rest of the Bill .does not need any amplification. It simply refers to the application of the various sections.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: I am 'grateful to the right honourable gentleman for outlining, rapidly it iN true. the principal parts
of the Bill before us. I shiall not follow him
clause by clause. I recognize that the subject
dealt with is one which may quite reasonably
come before us from tine to time. The
activities of the public in companies are so
multifarious that new conditions frcquently
arise which call for new legislation.
I shall simply refer to thrce or four clauses

deals with shares of no par value. There lias
been considerable division of opinion as to
the fncrits of the no-par-value principle embodied in our legislation. In fact, I believe
the report of the Price Spruads Commission
declares against no-par-value shares. Yet that
principle is maintained hre. I know that

seemed to protect the public against the offering of shares whtich, although having a face
value of 8100, were in reality worth mueli less.
It put the public on its guard, and forced the
purchaser to examine into the company's
statenent to ascertain whether there was any
real value behind the shares. Apparently some
abuses have been noticed. I am not prepared
to say which side of the argument is the more
meritorious, and I am not yet disposed to vote
of no-par-value
against the maintenance
sharus. I believe the public should find a
safeguard in the fact that no face value is
stated in the share certificate. I realize, of
course, that the directors will have considerable difficulty in fixing a price for no-parvalue shares.
Clause 5 of the Bill says:
Shares in the tapital stock of the coempany

discretion of the management or the directors,

and if adverse circumstances develop it will
be very difficult for them to assert that their
judgment was sound.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Hindsight
will be better than foresight, and it will be
much easier.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It will.
Now I refer to clause 13, which sets out
the responsibility of elected directors. It
says:
The directors of the company elected by the
shareholders at the first general meeting of
the company shall be responsible for all
business transacted as a board of directors
by the first directors of the company.
My right honourable friend has had some
difficulty in reconciling himself to the fact
that the responsibility falls on the shoulders
of the new and permanent directors, and that
they become responsible for the actions of
the provisional board. I wonder whether this
legislation will not have the effect of wiping
out provisional boards and bringing into the
limelight the men behind the incorporation.
I know that in England people who are mentioned in a statute as the incorporators or directors of a company feel that they have a very
important right given to them, of having their
names set out on what is called a royal
charter. I wonder whether this amendment
will not have the effect of doing away with
the practice by meinbers of the Bar of
designating office clerks and stenographers as
incorporators of companies. If it does have
that effect, perhaps it will be to the advantage of the public.
My right honourable friend has spoken, of
the action of directors who deal in the stock
of their own companies, and the restrictions
and conditions surrounding such dealings,
under clause 15. I have not read the whole
Bill carefully. so I do not know the effect of
the limitations imposed. Throughout my life
I have had the feeling that it was a dishonest thing for a director to buy stock in
his own company prior to a declaration of an
increased dividend, if he knew, as he naturally
should, that the dividend was to be increased
and his brother shareholder who sold the
stock had not the same knowledge. Nor would
I take it to be an honest act for a director
to sell stock in his own company when he
knew that a dividend would be passed and
the public had no such information. I do not
know to what extent any such practices prevail in our business world. but rumour has
reached me of actions of this kind by directors of companies. I have no hesitation in
expressing my opinion as to that type of
ethies.

There are other clauses to which I thought
I should address myself, but I should have to
look through the Bill to find them. I shall
content myself with awaiting the examination of the measure clause by clause in committee.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Before the
motion is carried, it might be worth while to
place this consideration on the record. The
honourable gentleman criticizes quite frankly
the purchase of shares by a director who is
aware. of the probability of an increased
dividend. From a certain standpoint that is
subject to criticism; but it has to be remembered that a share cannot be purchased unless
it is offered on the market, and when it is
offered the owner is going to sell it if he can.
If no bid were made by a director, the owner
might sell for less than a director would
have paid. Personally I think a purchase is
somewhat different from a sale. The first
step in either case is the offering of the stock.
When some shareholder offers his stock he
takes what he can get for it, or what he
thinks is its value. It would be altogether
different if a director went to an owner and
tried to induce him to sell his stock at a
price below what the director knew it to be
worth. That would be absolutely dishonest.
But when stock is offered on the market for
sale at a price, a man has no way to find out
who is making the offer. So I do not see
how a director could feel he is doing wrong
when he buys stock on the market, merely
because he knows from inside information
that the stock will be worth more. He would
not be helping the shareholder in the slightest
by keeping out of the market.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will put a
question to my right honourable friend, and I
have no doubt as to what his answer will be.
Suppose he owned 500 shares in a company.
In the list of shareholders which is distributed
annually his name would appear as the owner
of that stock. Would he like to see in the
list for the following year the disclosure that
he had increased his holdings, if in the meantime he had voted for an increased dividend?
Would he feel like appearing before his
fellow shareholders in such circumstances?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Well, a
director in such circumstances may be subjected to criticism, but my point is that it
would be very unjust criticism.
Many a
time a man in charge of a company sees
stock of the company offered for sale. If
things are going well he knows that the stock
is worth more than the price at which it is
offered, and he would be only too glad to

422

SENATE

inform the shareholder that he is making a
mistake in selling at that price. But he has
no means of finding out who is putting the
stock on the market. So how would he be
helping the shareholder by saying, "I will
not buy it"? The shareholder would make a
still greater sacrifice of it.
These questions are not quite so simple as
they appear to higi-grade moralists who
make money by parading their demagogism
in the press. I an not rrferring to my honourable friend, of course.

known to every intelligent person, that under
such conditions a measure of agreement and
understanding must be considered as proper,
for without such agreement and understanding
there would be a continuous process of destruction of competitors, until in each field there
remained possibly only one survivor who,
though perhaps emaciated, would if left alone
grow to great proportions. Of course the Bill
recognizes frankly that no understanding or
agreement shall militate against the public
interest. Understandings and agreements shall
be placed before the Commission. Then, after
investigation, they may. on the recommendatien of the Commission, be acknowledged by
the Governor in Council as proper, useful
and necessary. I believe this is all in pursuance of the Price Spreads Commission's
report.
The Trade and Industry Commission is
charged with responsibility for the prosecution of offences against Acts of Parliament
affecting commodity standards, and may order
that criminal proceedings be undertaken for
the punishment of any such offence.

(c) analyze and report upon any commodity
as to its quality, properties and' content, and
as to whiiether and to what extent it conforms
to the requiremients of any recognized or geuerally aecepted standard.
This is amplified by clause 17, which provides for reports by the Council in respect
of any commodity forwarded to it by the
Commission or the Director of Public Prosecutions.
By clause 18 a new national trade-mark

that.

Mr.

GRAHAM:

I noticed

Honourable
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE:
senators, it is very seldom that I take up
the time of this House with speechmaking.
I have spent al my life, which has been a
somewhat long one, in business, and I am
very seriously perturbedi by this proposed
legislation. I intend this afternoon to address
myself as briefly as possible to the tasik of
discussing ,the principle of the measure.
First of all I wish to pay my tribute to
the members of the Price Spreads Commission for the painstaking way in which they
performed their arduous duties over many
long and weary months. I appreciate that
they uncovered certain unfair practices. However, I must say that I find myself at
variance with a great many of the Commission's findings and recommendations, some
of which have been implemented by bills
brought before Parliament.
I ask leave of the Senate to refer not only
to this measure but also to Bill 73, entitled an
Act to amend the Criminal Code, which we
had before us last night, because the two
I object to
measures are closely related.
clause 8 of Bill 73, which provides:

423

The said Act is further amended by inserting
after section four hundred and ninety-eight,
the following section:498A. (1) Every person engaged in trade
or commerce or industry is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to a penalty not exceeding one thousand dollars or to one month's
imprisonment, or, if a corporation, to a penalty
not exceeding five thousand dollars, who
(a) is a party or privy to, or assists in,
any transaction of sale which discriminates, to
his knowledge, against competitors of the purchaser in that any discount, rebate or allowance is granted to the purchaser over and
above any discount, rebate or allowance available at the time of such transaction to the
aforesaid competitors in respect of a sale of
goods of like quality and quantity;
The provisions of this paragraph shall not,
however, prevent a co-operative society returning to producers or consumers, or a co-operative wholesale society returning to its constituent retail members, the whole or any part
of the net surplus made in its trading operations in proportion to purchases made from
or sales to the society;
(b) engages in a policy of selling goods in
any area of Canada at prices lower than those
exacted by such seller elsewhere in Canada,
for the purpose of destroying competition or
eliminating a competitor in such part of
Canada;
(c) engages in a policy of selling goods at
prices unreasonably low for the purpose of
destroying competition or
eliminating a
competitor.
I take exception to that provision on four
grounds. First, it is very detrimental to the
consuming public. Their lot is hard enough
now, with unemployment and low wages,
without Parliament increasing the cost of living, for undoubtedly if this proposed legislation is enacted without amendment it will
have that effect. Indeed, it will increase the
cost of everything that the householder bas
to buy. Second, it will restrict domestic
trade. Third, it will increase our imports.
Fourth, it will reduce opportunity for employment.
Honourable members may wonder why I

make these statements. Well, we will say
I am a manufacturer in Montreal. My sales
manager in Halifax advises me that he can
get a very large order, several carloads in
volume, but at the price which I have given
him he is unable to secure the business in
competition with a similar article imported
from England under the Imperial preference
at a very much lower cost. Under this
measure I cannot authorize my sales manag9r
to quote a lower price. In effect, it compels
me to sell goods of the same quality at the
same price all over Canada. In other words,
I must sell in Halifax at the same price as in
Montreal. Consequently I lose the business. This, to my mind, is restriction of
domestic trade, since the goods are imported,

SENATE
and to that extent there is less opportunity
to employ Canadian labour. If I had been
allowed to sell at a lower price, would not the
consumer have benefited? It is a most preposterous proposition that throughout this
great country, 3,000 miles in extent, any manufacturer should be expected to sell his product at the same price, irrespective of difference in freight charges and other factors;
yet this Bill seems to say that ho must. A
manufacturer located in Montreal could not
possibly sell a carload of goods to a purchaser in Vancouver at the same price as he
could afford to sell locally. In short, if this
measure goes into effect in its present form
the cost of goods is bound to go up, to the
detriment of the ultimate consumer.
On the other hand, imports are certain to
increase.
The competition of the British
exporter will be very keen, and if our manufacturers are held to a uniform price throughout the Dominion they will find it impossible
to meet the low price of imported commodities.
There is another reason why this uniform
price requirement is unsoued. Take two
buvers, one who purchases in very small and
the other in very large quantities. It bas
always been customary in business to quote a
lower price to the large buyer than to the
small. But the Price Spreads Commission
seems to have been most concerned about the
smaill buyer, and its concern on lis behalf
finds expression in this forbidding of special
discounts. Certain manufacturers have appointed persons or firms in various centres to
sell exclusively the manufacturer's line at a
special discount. the consumer to get the
benefit. A competitor on the same street
might object to this. and thereupon, under
this measure, criminal proceedings might be
instituted against the offending manufacturer.
I would also direct the attention of honourable members to section 14 of the cognate
Bill 86, which I contend will also increase the
cost of living to the detriment of the masses.
This section provides:
In any case where the Commission. after
fuil investigation uider the Combines Investigation Act, is unanimoiusly of opinion that
wasteful or deimoralizing competition exists
in any specific industry. and that agreements
between the persons engaged in the induîstry to
modify such competition by eontrolling and
regulating pricesand so on. I know several large manufacturers who at the present time are engaged
in a price war. The article tbey manufacture
is to be found on the table of every bousehold throughout the country. Is not that
price-competition a benefit to the consumHon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

ing public? If large. financially strong organizations are able to stand the strain of a price
war, the masses are going to get the resultant
advantage in cheaper goods. But here again
the Price Spreads Commission, through this
measure, says no, prices shall not be lowered.
To recapitulate, I am opposed to the
recomniendations of the Price Spreads Commission as expressed in this proposed legislation, because it wilil inevitably increase the
cost of living; it will increase the cost of
many commodities; it will restriet the trade
of the Canadian manufacturer in his home
market te the extent that it will increase our
impoerts, all to the detriment cf workers,
who constitute the bulk of "the public."
Presumably the Price Spreads Commission
was appointed for the special purpose of
saving us ail from so-called predatory business,
but I do not think the majority of its recommendations will effect its purpose.
I pass now to the subject of large amalgamations or mergers. Let me say at once
that I entirely dissociate myself from what
I may term improper mergers. Some mergers
have been formed for exploitation, and are
undoubtedly detrimental to the best interests
of the country.

worked for long hours at very low wages. As
the years rolled by, Canadian manufacturers
found it impossible to compete wvith their
rivals in the United States, a highly developed
and specialized country indlustrially; they also
found it very difficult to compete successfully
with the manufacturers of Great Britain and
Germany. It became imperative that they

SENATE

Memorandium Outlining Industriýal
Relations Plans
Employee Representation Plan:-The purpose of this plan is to create and maintain
a feeling of trust and confidence between
employees and the company.
It functions
through the medium of works couneils, which
consist of representatives elected by the
employees and an equal number of representatives appointed by the management, thus
enabling employees to recommend to the
management any policies which they believe
will bring about better and closer relations
or improve thei efficiency and general welfare
of the emiployees of the company.
Accident prevention w-ork is carried on as
a corollary of the above plan, the mainten,
ance of up-to-date safety design in building
and equipnient being supplemented by first aid
instruction. safety educational campaigns and
a no-accident record plan which provides
aw ards to emîplo ees of a works enjoying
specified periods of time without accidents.
Co-Operative Savings Plan:-The object of
this plan is to encourage thrift among payroll
and the lower salaried employees of the company. An eligible employee may authorize
monthly deductions from his wages or salary
up to a maximum of $20 per month for deposit
with a trust cottpany, and at the end of the
twvelve-nonthly deposit period the company
contributes 25 cents for every dollar saved,
at which time the employee receives both his
savings pluis interest at the rate of four per
cent per aunutm, and the company's contribution.
Co-Operative Sickness and Non-Occupational
Accident Insurance Plan:-This plan enables
all employees who have had at least three
months' continuons service with the company
to msure against sicknesses or accidents for
which no compensation is granted under any
Workmen's Compensation Act. It is a contributory plan whereby the company bears
approximaately
one-half the cost of the
preniums. the weekly benefits payable varying
from $5 to $25 per week for a maximum of
thirteen weeks for each disability.
Vacation Plan:-The purpose of this plan is
to give annual vacations of one week with
vacation allowance to all payroll employees
upon completion of at least one year of con-

tinuous service.
The entire cost of such
vacations is borne by the company.
Employees' Benefit Plan:-The beneficiary of
any employee wholias bad at least six months'
tontinuous service and who lies while in the
service of the cotnpany (including pensioners
of the company), receives an amount varying
front $1.000 to $1.500, depending on the length
of service of the deceased. The conpany bears
the entire cost of this plan, and benefits are
paid fromn a fund set up for this purpose.

Pension Plan:--The object of this plan is to

The comupany bears the entire cost of this plan
and pensions are paid from a fund set up for
this purpose.
In the light of present demands for the
greater protection and security of the industrial worker, it is worthy of note that a
inumbr of the above and similar plans were
introduced

over

fifteen

years

ago

and

have

been in continuous operation since that time.
I am very glad indeed to have had this
opportunity of saying a word in commendation of the business men of Canada. It is
a long time since I have heard from a public
platfornm or in our legislative assemblies any
words in favour of that large number of
Canadians who for the last fifty years have
played a noble part in the development of
this Dominion. Great credit is due them, and
if they have made a little money by their
skill and ability, no criticism should be
levelled at them on that account alone.
When the Bills to which I have referred
are being thrashed out before the Banking
and Commerce Committee, I shall trust to the
sanity and flic ability of honourable members
to see that the measures are properly amended
-amended with no ulterior motives because
political passions may be drifting this way
or that, but so as to carry out what in their
judgment they believe to be best for the
Canadian people as a whole.
Hon. RALPH B. HORNER: Honourable
senators, J haid not intended to discuss the
proposed legislation, but after listening to
the honourable senator who has just taken
his seat (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) I feel I
should voice my disagreenent with his remarks. I may mention one industry in which
mass buying and mass production have worked
injury to the community. A large flour milling company in Western Canada, in order to
prevent a siall mill from operating, offered
to a community filfty miles from its plant
flour at $1 below the local price. Only last
summer, when the company was selling flour
retail at $2.25 a hundred, if shipped a carload
three hundred miles, paid the freight, and
sold the flour at $1.35 a hundred in a further
effort to put the small mill ont of business.
What does that mean to the comruunity? It
ineans the farmers pay twice the price for
their bran and shorts that they receive for
their grain.
Businoess has been referred to as a game.
In all our games. notwithstanding the fact
that the players are usually fine fellows, there
is a referee to control lie players and sec
that they observe the rules. Unquestionably
there are many fine fellows taking part in
business, in wheih, heretofore, there has been
no referee. The Government is now going

JUNE 26, 1935
to be the referee in control of business, to
see that the game is played according to the
rules.
I remember another instance, in which an
insurance company sold stock to the farmers.
The men who sold the stock-it may have
been that they lacked knowledge-represented
it as having a par value of $100 and a
premium of $35. The stock was sold on a
down payment of $45, and the impression
was left on the purchasers that when that
was paid they owed only $55. That was
twelve years ago, and the many farmers who
invested at that time have received no
dividends.
These are merely matters which have come
under my personal observation, and in regard
to which legislation of the kind proposed
would have been of great value.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators. if this Bill had emanated from
another source at another time I should have
been very enthusiastic about it. Even yet I
have some hope that it will accomplish what
I think it ought ta accomplish, because in
subsection 2 of section 3 I find the following
language:
The members for the time being of the
Tariff Board shall, by virtue of holding office
as members of the said Board and by virtue
of this Act, be the Commissioners, and the
Chairman and the Vice-Chairman of the said
Board shall be the Chief Commissioner and
Assistant Chief Commissioner respectively.
If ever anything was desirable in Canada, it is,
in my humble judgment, a determined, honest,
upright and experieniced board to deal with the
questions that are, or should be, dealt with
under the Combines Investigation Act. In my
opinion some if not all of the criticisms of the
Combines Investigation Act resulted from the
appointment of Tom, Dick or Harry, or of
some other person who desired to secure the
position, as a commissioner to investigate this,
that, or the other thing. I have in mind concrete cases in which some fine gentlemen,
quite capable in an ord.inary way, were
appointed to investigate something they had
never inquired into before, with the result
that their report did not do justice to industry
or to the business interests that had been inquired into. I am going to refer to one of
these cases.
An investigation was made into the Proprietary Articles Trade Association, an organization which had to do with the sale of druggists' supplies. In my humble opinion the
decision which finally came out was totally
wrong, and contrary to the interesta of the
consuming publie of Canada. Why do I say
this? I arm going ta refer now to one of the
points raised by the honourable senator from

427

Alma (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne). What was the
effect of that decision, which dissolved this
alleged combine for fixing the resale prices of
drugs and other articles handled n drug
stores? The effect of that decision was-I do
not think I exaggerate-to put out of business
hundreds of retail druggists throughout the
length and breadth of Canada. I think that
is a fair statement to make.
How did this come about? Under the resale
arrangement that had been in effect in the
trade the druggists had agreed to sell the
various articles handled in drug stores at certain fixed prices. They also bought at a
specific rate. As far as I had been able to
learn, the resale prices appeared reasonable
and fair, and in the interest of the consuming
public. But this organization was put out of
business by the report of a high-class gentleman who decided. unquestionably believing he
was right, that it was not legal to fix a resale
price. Then mass buying came into effect.
This permitted Eaton's and Simpson's and some
of the other department stores to handle
many of the articles which previously had been
handled, and to some extent are still handled,
by the druggists. The department stores, by
reason of purchasing in large quantities, were
able to sell at prices which would have been
ruinous to the average retail druggist. The
consequence was that many druggists were
forced out of business. In my opinion such a
condition would never have come about if the
investigation and the decision had been made
by a body like the Tariff Commission, composed of capable, upright business men who
had looked into every angle of the situation.
I think it would be all to the good if we
should never again have the opportunity of
appointing this, that or the other man to make
such an investigation.
When the honourable senator from Alma
(Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) referred to the N.R.A.
and to some of the things that were going on
in the United States, he evidently overlooked
the fact that for many years before the N.R.A.
was ever dreamed of there was in that country a Trade Commission whieh performed
very much the same work that it is now
proposed should be handled by this Trade
and Industry Commission. or by the members
for the time being of the Tariff Board of
Canada.
I am one of the individuals referred to by
the honourable senator as having had not a
great deal of experience in industry.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I was not referring to the honourable gentleman.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I fully realize that,
but I place myself in that category, because

SENATE

428ý

it is where I belong. I have not been engaged in business, but with the intelligence, I
possess I have had an opportunity to view the
matters involved from the standpoint of the
consumer-yes, and. I hope, of the producing
public. I agree absolutely with anyone who
says that honest, legitimate business should
not be interfered with. That could be taken
for granted. I think, without question. I
am sure the honourable senator from Alma
(Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) would not argue-in
fact I did not understand him to argue-that
every individual in business in Canada or
elsewhere in the world is absolutely honest
and on the level. Therefore it may be fully
as justifiable to provide for the correction of
individuals or companies that are not on the
level as for thu correction of those who break
the law which follows the commandment,
"Thou shalt not steal."
My honourable friend will recall an investigation which took place some years ago into
the handling of fruit products in Western
Canada. Eight companies were fined $25.000
apiece. They paid the fines. Why vas this?
If was because they had been bleeding the
consuming public; because thev had been
indulging in unfair practices.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Under what authority
were they investigated and prosecuted?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The Combines
Investigation Act was in effect at that time,
and is still in effect.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Is if not still sufficient?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: It appeared to be
sufficient. because 8200,000 in fines were collected froin eiglt companies. Nevertheless. I
stilI contend that it woild be preferable to
have
some
competent
board
that
is
thoroughly familiar with all phases of business to investigate this. that, or any other
matter. and I think this proposal is along
the right ines. My last word is this. If this
proposed law goes into effect it will not, as I
understand if. radicailly change the existing
law, apart from the fact that it will render it
unnecessary for the Government to call upon
Tom, Dick or Harry to make a particular
investigation, regardless of whether the person wanting the appointment is entirely
familiar with the question to be considered.
If is My hope that some day in tbe not too
distant future the Tariff Board will have
nothing Io do but deal with such matters as
are covecredl bv this Bill. My judgment leads
ml'e to ilie conclusion tliat in dealing with
unfair practices and combines and mergers,
Hon.

lr. MU'RDOCK.

if there are any-and I think even the bonourable senator from Alma will concede that
there may be some-and in compelling everyone to line up with the upright and honest
business men of Canada, we shall bu benefiting both the consuming and the producing
public.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: I wish to
say but a few words on this subject. For a
number of years we in Canada have had legislation prohibiting combines and mergers. Our
law bas been less comprehensive than that
in force in the United States. They had the
Sherman Act. we the Combines Investigation Act. I said this afternoon that the
activities of business, of commerce and of
industry were so varied and so changing that
it was not surprising that legislation also
should change occasionally. The first thing
Mr. Roosevelt did upon introducing his new
legislation was practically to suspend the
operation of the Sherman law and permit
combinations and the fixing of prices. We
in Canada. contrary to what appears to bu
the underlying principle of our Combines
Investigation Act, are apparently going in the
same direction.
In the present situation of affairs I am not
ready to exprcss a very clear opinion as to
where the line should bu drawn. I have been
broight up in the Liberal school of economics
and an not yet ready to renounce its doctrines. Nevertheless, I shall go to the committee with an open mind ind do my best
to help adjust our legislation to present-day
conditions.
The motion wis agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
LIMITATION OF HOURS OF WORK BILL
MESSAGE FROM COMMONS

The Senate proceeded
from the House of
amendients made by
Limitation of Hours of

to consider a messtage
Commons respecting
the Senate to the
Work Bill.

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN:
I
hope the House will not consider my action
arbitrar- if I ask if to take a stand against
concurrence with the other House in this
matter. It is true thaît virtually all the work
donc by the Senate in relation to the very
large volume of legislation coming here this
session lias been accepted by the other House
in a proper spirit and without complaint of
any kind. I should say this applies to about
99-5 per cent of the work we have done.
Nevertheless, the amendment made by the
Senate which the House of Commons has

JUNE 26, 1935
declined to accept is of particular importance.
I have two motions to make in relation to the
matter. The first will be a motion of nonconcurrence. Perhaps this will lead to a conference; perhaps the House of Commons will
not insist.
The second motion is necessary for this
reason. A message from the House of Commons stated that that House agreed with our
first eight a.mendments, but declined to accept the ninth. Nothing whatever was said
about all the others.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The other House
forgot about them?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
The message from the other House made no mention
whatever of our five amendments, Nos. 10 to
14, inclusive. So we have to take the necessary step to correct the record. My first
motion will be:
That the Senate do not concur in the amendment made by the House of Commons to the
ninth amendment madle by the Senate to the
Bill 21, intituled: "An Act to provide for
limiting the Hours of Work in Industrial
Undertakings te eight in the day and fortyeight in the week, in accordance with the
Convention concerning the application of the
principle of the Eight Hour Day or of the
Forty-eight Hour Week adopted by the
General Conference
of the
International
Labour Organization of the League of Nations,
in accordance with the Labour Part of the
Treaty of Versailles of 28th June, 1919," for
the following reason:
That the Senate sees no sufficient reason
why with relation to the class of labour
referred to in the said amendment the Bill
may not go into effect at the time stipulated
in the amendment.
And that a message be sent to the House
of Commons to inform that House accordingly.
Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: That is with
regard to railiway employees?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
The motion was agreed to.
MESSAGE TO COMMONS

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I now move:
That a message be sent to the House of
Commons to direct the attention of that House
to the l0th, 1lth, 12th, 13th and 14th amend-

ments made by the Senate to the Bill 21,
intituled: "An Act to provide for limiting
the Hours of Work in Industrial Undertakings
to eight in the day and forty-eight in the
week, in accordance with the Convention concerning the application of the principle of the
Eight Hour Day or of the Forty-eight Hour
Week adopted by the General Conference of
the International Labour Organization of the
League of Nations, in accordance with the
Labour Part of the Treaty of Versailles of
28th June, 1919," to whieh amendments no
reference is made in the message from that
House.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
Hansard shows
that in the discussion in the other House
there was at least some reference to those
amendments.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN,:
Yes, but
there was no reference to them in the message sent to this House.
Hon. Mr. MURDOOK: The amendments
were referred te in the discussion.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Quite right.
But there was an omission in the message
that came to us. That message has gone
into our records and we have to make the
records right.
The motion was agreed to.

SOLDIER SETTLEMENT BILL
REPORT

OF

COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE moved concu'rrence in the report of the Standing Committee on Civil Service Administration on Bill
62, an Act to amend the Soldier Settlement
Act.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Would the
honourable member explain the amendment?
Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: It just changes
the date from the time of the coming into
force of the Býill to the 1st of July, 1935.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Is there any
reason for the change?
Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANOE: It was proposed, I understand, by the Law Clerk.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I was somewhat
hesitant yesterday about letting the second
reading of this Bill go without opposition.
I felt that the bringing in of 333 employees
might involve an increased permanent expenditurc, and that such action was not opportune
in the closing days of Parliament. For some
years I have held the view that increases of
pay in the Civil Service, increases of pensions of returned soldiers or their families,
and similar expenditures, are matters that
should be dealt with during the first two
sessions of Parliament. The reason for this is
obvious and will be understood by every
honourable gentleman within the sound of my
voice. Recently I even suggested to a
prominent member of the Government that
the Senate would be acting within its rights
if it laid down a rule that bills for expenditures of a certain class should be re.ceivable
in this Chamber during only the first and
second sessions and not later in any Parliament.
I was present this morning at the sitting
Righ Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

THIRD READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
third reading of the Bill, as amended.
H'on. Mr. DANDURAND:
I rise simply
to draw to the attention of honourable members the fact that when this Bill came to
us from another place it contained a clause
stating that it should come into force on the
date of its assent. We have made an amendment that it shall come into force on the
1st of July.
Ri-ght Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

This year.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
This year. I
have not stopped to consider what the
effect would be if the Bill were not sanctioned until after the lst of July, say, on the
2nd or 3rd. If our amendment is agreed to
in another place, there will be this provision
that the Bili come into effect on the 1st of
July.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think there
will be Royal Assent before the 1st of July,
that is, some day this week. But should the
Bill receive Royal Assent later than the
date provided for its coming into force, the
result would, be, in my judgment, that it
would come into force on receiving the Royal
Assent. It could not become effective before
then, of course, and certainly it would take
effect on receiving the Royal Assent unless
some hater date were specified.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
Could not
something be placed in the Bill to give it
retroactive power?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No; it cannot have retroactive power.
It becomes
effective on July 1st, unless the Royal Assent
is after that date.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.

necessary for the municipalities to get power
from their respective legislatures?
Rîgbt Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: Yes. I believe housing Acts have been passed by some
legisiatures, but 1 do flot know just how
many. I thin'k that until lately no muni,cipality had the necessary power under the
Municipal Act. Special Jegisiation would lys
required, unless it had alreýady beeta passed,
and if an'y has been passed it is of recent
date.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: The right honou.rable
gentleman from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr.
Graham) raised the point tha-t loan companies
would neyver consider lending 5ixty per cent
in conjunction with the Dominion's Joan of
another twenty per cent, to form a total Joan
of eight peýr cent. I think that any honourable
members who sit on boards of Joan companies
will ibear me out wheu I say it would be
difficuit to find a, single company which -advances more than fifty peýr cent on any real
estate, especially nt the present time. Members of city councils, town councils and municipal councils of ail kinds, as a rule, are not
the people who pay the heaviest taxes, and
we know they are exceedingly generous when
it cornes to lending or gran-ting money for
abnost any purpose. To my mind there is
no question in the world that advances of
sixty per cent plus loans of twenty per cent
from, the Federal Government would în the
flot far distant future run into, disastrous
losses for municipalities which are not very
careful. And in Canada to-day it is difficuit
to find any municipality that is very careful.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I think my
riglit honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) yesterday ref'erred to some people
who had theories. I might do the same. As
a theory, the house.4building scheme looks
well, but those who have any experience in
supplying the de.mand for more houses discover that it does not work out so, well. I
myseif had some experience. My own town
formed a ýsmall company in response to the
general demnand for the 'building of houses,
and it was a careful company, but every cent
I put into it was lost, and more too. As a
matter of fact, when we came to settie u-p the
company's business some of us had Vo pay
more money and take houses we did not
want, which were lef t with us. Perhaps MY
honourable f.riend from Leeds (Hon. Mr.
Hardy) was not connected with the scheme,
but he knows the circumstanccs.

433

In theory the building of houses to supply
a demand is wonderful to contemplate, and
when you go into the 'business you feel that
you are almost a philantbropist; but the
practical effect is that little good cornes to
the people who wanted bouses, and loss to the
men who felt tbemselves to be phila-ntbropists
in this respect.
I stili bave the view that unless something
more definite is included in the Bill-and I amn
free to admit that I -cannot suggest wbat iýt
should be-very littie money will be spent
on this enterprise, good as it may be. As my
honourable friend from Leeds (Hon. Mr.
Hardy) bas pointed out, municipalities which
have bad any practical experience in a bousing scheme will not, at least with the consent
of their ratepayers, rush to invcst money under the terms of this Bill
Hon. C. 'P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable
senators, the outlook for this legislation does
not appear to be very encouraging. Recently
I listened to a very eloquent speech by Sir
Francis Floud, in which he described the ineasures taken by Great Britain to assist in the
re-establishment of business activity. He
stressed particularly the policy adopted in
that country for the construction of bouses.
1 was agreeably surprised to hear him declare
that witbin the last f ew years, I tbink six or
seven, enough new homes had been built in
Great Britain to house twenty-five per cent
of the total population. Now, if such is the
case, there must be some way in which a Government can stimulate construction, and surely that way has been found in Great Britain.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Have thcy got
any financial results from their construction?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I understand that
the scheme bas functioned perfectly well.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
scheme?

Wbat is the

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN : I amn not conversant with the details, but I understand that
money is lent for rather modest construction
at a very low rate of interest, and is rcpayable by annuities instead of rent, over a period
of years. 1V
seems to me there is every reason
wby we should study that scheme, and if conditions here are not too different from those
in Great Britain we should perhaps adopt as
many as possible of the methods used there.
I think everybody will recognize that activity
in construction lias served more than anything
else to re-establish prosperity in Great Britain.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
What is true in
Great Britain could be true in Canada. I
think I am right in saying that there were
300,000 workmen directly employed in construction in CanadaRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Normally.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
In 1929. And I
venture to say that there were as many indirectly employed; that is to say, in the preparation of materials required for building.
That is a total of 600,000 workmen. If that
figure is fairly accurate it means that practically one-third of our population is interested in construction, directly or indirectly.
Should we not therefore .concentrate on construction, more than on anything else, as a
means of re-establishing prosperity in this
country?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Great Britain has
given a good example. If that country has
been able to build sufficient new homes for
twenty-five per cent of its total population
of 42,000,000, is it net worth while for us
to sec whether we cannot employ the same
scheme, or something approaching it, and
try to bring about similarly good results for
this country?
The English scheme is apparently sound from the point of view of
business.
I am strongly in favour of encouraging construction, or, as it might be termed, the
manufacture of capital goods. The lack of
activity in this industry is hindering the reestablishment of normality in business. For
my part I think that this measure is well
worth studying with a great deal of care. In
my opinion it might, with modifications if
necessary, go further than much of the other
legislati.on that has been submitted to us in
re-establishing prosperity in Canada.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: One good feature of the Bill lias not been mentioned. The
Economic Council may look around the world
to sec which country has the best housing
scheme, and may report to us next year.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
BURRARD

INLET BRIDGE BILL

SECOND READING

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN moved
the second reading of Bill 118, an Act respecting
the Bridge across the Second Narrows of
Burrard Inlet in the Province of British
Columbia.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

He said: Honourable members, the purpose of this measure is to declare that the
bridge already constructed across the Second
Narrows of Burrard Inlet in the province of
British Columbia is a lawful work. The bridge
has had a rather checkered and tragic history.
The former structure, which was in use for
many years, was apparently not designed to
take care of navigation and other necessities. Accidents occurred one after another,
and finally, I think, the whole span fell. In
any event, the bridge was out of commission
for some time. In 1931 an Act was passed
empowering the Burrard Inlet Tunnel and
Bridge Company to rebuild the structure, and
specifying the nature of the construction. It
was to have, according to section 4 of that
But what
Act, a fixed span of 300 feet.
actually occurred was that the Vancouver
Harbour Commissioners purchased the bridge
and built it with a vertical lift span in place
of the 300-foot fixed span. This measure
declares that the structure is a lawful work
and is not to be deemed an interference with
navigation. It is necessary that we take this
step, because of our jurisdiction in respect of
navigation.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I agree that
this bridge has had a checkered career. The
question in my mind is: Does it interfere
with navigation? Are we legislating something that conflicts with our marine law?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We never do
that.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I am not sure,
after this session. Before a bridge can be
constructed across a navigable stream there
has to be consent of the Department of
Marine, through 'Order in Council, I think.

therefore a right te assume that th\e Publie
Works Department is satisfied. The point was

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
an uncommon thing.

That is net

Right Hon. MT. MEIGHEN: I have a
history of the structure under my hand.
What is our position? The authority incident to the departînent is probably net
exercisable, for that authority, I understand,
must be exercised prior to construction. Consequently a statute is necessary. The bridge
was built, net privately, but by the Vancouver Harbour Commission, which is really
a creation of this Parliament. The Government, representing all departmente,. says:
"This bridge is all right, but we have te
come ta Parliament te have it se declared
by statute." This Bill does that, and does
no more.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
That is, we
are now doing after construction what apparently should have been done before.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, it shouild
have been done before, and would have been
done had the bridge been constructed by a
private company. But the bridge was constructed by the Government indirectly,
through the Harbour Commission.
Hon. Mr. KING: Net originally.
Right Hon. MT. MEIGIIEN: Not originally, but the present bridge was se constructed.
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In order
that there may be nothing illegail in the
work, the Harbour Commission net being
the Government, this Bill becomes necessary.
Ri.ght Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I appreciate
the explanation, and I think it is the only
one that can be given. But the Harbour
Commission is net the GovernmentRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is the
reason this Bill is necessary.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: -and
the
Government must net be held responsible
for what the Harbour Commission does. If
the Harbour Commission of Vancouver,
Montreal or some other port desires ta build
a bridge, it is its duty, just as much as it
is the duty of a private company, te get the
92584--284

435

consent of the iGovernment through the
proper channel, and to guarantee that the
structure shall not interfere with navigation.
I am not stressing the irregularity, but the
rights of navigation ought ta be secured
before even a Harbour Commission undertakes ta build a bridge.
Right Hon. 'Mr. MEIIGHEN: Yes. I find
this among certain elaborate notes furnished
to me:
The Harbour Commissioners have purchased
the bridge and have reconstructed it, not as it
was originally, but with a vertical lift span
in the place of the span that was knocked
down *by the "Pacifie Gatherer" in 1030.
That is the name of the barge.
Approval was obtained under both the
Navigable Wa-ters Protection Act and the
Rajilway Act for the plans of the remodelled
structure, but in order to put the legality of
the same beyond question, counsel for the
Vancouver Harbour Commissioners has advised
that it would be safer to have similar legislation enacted with regard to the remodelled
span as was enacted in 1931, and the Department of Justice has concurred in this view.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That clears
up the matter. The Harbour Commissioners
did what they were expected to do.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

Mr. Justice Tayllor was selected for this
post.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHuAM: He is there

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: He has
occupied the position for nearly a year, and
it is the intention to extend his occupancy
for another year. Consequently we have to
amend the statute by changing the year te
two years. That is the purpose of the BiH.

Vegetables and Honey.
Hon. G. V. WHITE:

I think we should

Hon. J. J. DONNELLY: Honourable members.. Mr. Wheeler. Acting Comnmissioner of
the Fruit Branch of the Department of Agriculture, appeared before the committee and
gave a full explanation of the Bill. The purpose of the Bill is to consolidate the Root
Riglit 11o.

Mr. MEIGHEN.

Vegetables Act of 1927 with the Fruit and
Honey Act of 1934, and to give effect to part
of the report of the Price Spreads Commission. The definitions are practically the
same as in the old Bills, with a few exceptions. The definition of the word "dealer"
is changed so as to exclude the retailer and
the person selling or shipping only produce
of his own growing.
With regard to the word "export," I think
we have already had some discussion in the
Senate. Honourable members will recall that
when the Fruit and Honey Act came before
us last session the word .was defined so as to
include interprovincial trade. Some objection was taken to that by honourable members. and the Bill was amended by insertion
of the words "and interprovincial trade" after
the word "export."
A couple of weeks ago
the Committee on Agriculture had before it
Bill 72, to amend the Live Stock and Live
Stock Products Act, and in that Bill the word
"export" was defined to mean export out of
Canada or out of any province to any other
province thereof. The honourable gentleman
from Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair), I think,
reminded the committee of the objection
that had been taken in the Senate to the use
of the word to cover interprovincial trade,
and we took the matter up with Mr. McCallum, who was present as representative of
the Live Stock Branch, and he promised to
get some information on the matter before
the next sitting of the committee. He later
got into touch with me and said he had
taken the matter up with the Department of
Justice, which was strongly in favour of leaving the definition as it was, that is, to include
interprovincial trade. He suggested that J
interview Mr. Edwards. the Deputy Minister
of Justice. I did so, and Mr. Edwards pointed
out to me that for the sake of uniformity it
was desirable that the word be defined as it
came to us in the Fruit and Honey Act last
year. before we amended it. From what he
said J gathered that the Department of Justice was more concerned with having a term
that was -trictly legal and convenient than
with the niceties of the English language. J
told him of the objection raised in the Senate.
He cited lo tme three or four judgments of

caie undcr the heading of export. In view of
the explanation made by the Department of
Justice the word "export" was not anended
by the committee.

JUNE 28, 1935
The committee's amendments were made
at the request of the representative of the
Departrment of Agriculture, and were of a
miner character.
Right Hon. G. P. GRAHAM: Honourable
senators, I am the guilty party who objected
to the word "export" being defined se as te
include interprovincial trade. When you go
to a shrewd lawyer, in or out of the Department of Justice, he will be likely not te
consider the general effect, but to look for
some legal peg to hang his hat on. No matter
what the courts have said, the general acceptation of the word "export" is that it means
the sending of goods out of one country to
another. I am afraid that if the proposed
definition is included in the statutes it wiill
prove te be a wedge dividing Canada into
nine distinct parts, each one looking after
what it imagines to be its own best ends.
We have nine provinces. Ontario and Quebec
began this business of prohibiting interprovincial trade, but because the commodity concerned happened te be liquor the people did
net much care what was done with it. Honourable members will recall that at one time
-and
perhaps the practice still exists-an
Ontario man's baggage coming from, say,
Montreal, was searched on the train for the
purpose of seeing whether there was any
Quebec liquor in it. That practice in itself
was perhaps not of great importance, but
it was then that the thin edge of the wedge
was inserted and the process began of dividing
Canada into nine separate entities. It proclaimed t o the world that we were not willing
to trade freely even among ourselves.
That course has been followed up by certain
regulations or by-laws between Ottawa and
Hull, as a result of which trade between these
two cities has been to a certain extent restricted. New we find that in British Columbia there is comiplaint about certain goods,
such as live stock, coming in from Alberta.
If this tendency keeps up we shall see the
development of the provincial idea which we
have been trying to get away from ever since
1867, and the time will come when every
member of Parliament will consider it his sole
duty te seek to promote the interest of his
own province rather than of the Dominion as
a whole. Tbat will be entirely contrary to
what the Fathers of Confederation had in
mind should be done. At the time of Confederation each province made what it considered were sacrifices, in order to bring about
national unity.
I am afraid that the effect of defining
"export" so as to include interprovincial trade
will be a very bad one. We shall prob-

437

ably see in some American newspapers the
statement that the disintegration of Canada
into provinces has begun. I do not believe
that any province will ultimately gain by
seeking to restrict trade with other provinces,
because in the long run the people will not
stand for that kind of thing.
If some people have their way in getting
this new definition attached to the word
"export," we are likely te have before Parliament some day a proposition that each
province should have a tariff of its own. Such
a proposition has already been made in one
province. This measure is a tariff in another
form, because it is a restriction on interprovincial trade. If the time ever comes when
all our provinces cannot deal with one another,
it will be very discouraging to those who have
devoted their lives to the ideal of a united
Canada.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY:
I think perhaps
the purpose in using this definition is to give
inspectors of the Fruit Branch more authority
in regard te the inspection of fruit shipped
fror
one province to another. The right
honourable senator from Eganville (Right
Hon. Mr. Graham), like myself, is not a member of the Bar, and I do not know that we
are qualified te give a legal definition of a
term. I agree with him that the use of the
word "export" is not very appropriate. However, the committee was guided in this matter
by the advice of the Department of Justice.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Constitutionally,
we cannot interpose a barrier against the
free flow of commerce from one province to
another.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: In what section of
the Bill is any such barrier created?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am net disaussing this Bill; I am discussing generally the
question raised by my right honourable friend
from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham). I
confess my conception cf the unity of the
United States received its first shock when I
found that a person arrested in New York
for a crime committed in New Jersey could
net be transferred to New Jersey without extradition proceedings. As is well known, when
framing the British North America Act we
strengthened the federal authority in order te
avoid many of the weaknesses which became
apparent in the American Constitution at the
time of the Civil War. I repeat, I arn not
discussing this Bill, but I am confident that
the Parliament of Canada is net competent
to pass legislation which would prevent the
free movement of goods from one province to
another.

SENATE

438

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I should like to
ask the right honouraible senator from Eganville in what section of the Bill he finds any
suggestion of interference with the free flow
of trade between one province and another.
Does he find it in the .definition of "export"?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The word "export" bas always been understood to apply to
goods sent out of Canada te a foreign country.
The word ought not to be applied to trade
between one province and another.
An Hon. SENATOR:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: If the definition in the Bill is retained, goods on the
dock, say, at Charlottetown, destined for Halifax or Montreal, will be marked "export"
and treated as if they were to be sent to
California. That will not impress visitors to
this country with a sense of our nationail unity.
Notwithstanding the opinion of the Department of Justice, I feel it is not beyond the
wisdom of this ,House to find a more appropriate word to express the purp-ose of -the Bill.
It should not be necessary te apply "export"
to interprovincial trade. I do not like the
Bill itselif; I like still less the proposed definition of "export," for to my mind it is an
insult to Canadians te draw a line of demarcation between provinces.
Hon. Mr. DAN.DURAND: "Export" will be
found in the interpretation clause. It is defined as "export out of Canada or out of any
province to any .other province thereof."
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The word is used
in the same sense with respect both to shipment out of Canada and shipment from one
province to another. The words "export" and
"import" are us0ed in, their restricted sense in
our Customs Act and customs regulations;
therein "export" means to send gonds out
of Canada and "import" to bring goods into
Canada. But the components of "export"
are the two Latin words ex-out-and porto
carry. The French word porter comes
-to
from the sane root. So to transport goods
from a city or county to another city or
county would he to export them, and it would
be no abuse of the word to employ it in that
sense.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Our people
will not understand what it means.
Hon. Mr. GR.IESBACH: The officials of
the Justice Department were not called upon
to find a substitute expression; they were
asked simply to express an opinion as to
whether "export" is an apt word. They say
it is. But I am sure that if the right honourHon.

Mr. DONNELLY.

able senator, a newspaper man and master of
English, can suggest a better word, the House
will be very glad to adopt it.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Last session we
amended the interpretation clause in a Bill
which was then before us. We restricted "export" to goods destined for foreign lands, and
applied the teri "interprovincial trade" te
trade between provinces. "Export" has always
meant the transportation of goods from the
Dominion to a foreign country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Foreign trade.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: "Export" applies to foreign trade. I do not like the word.
We might just as well say that goods sent from
Ottawa to Manotic are "export" goods. I
think the words "interprovincial trade" cover
the situation, and are much more Canadian in
spirit than the word "export."
Hon. J. E. SINCLAIR: As stated by the
Chairman, the committee gave some consideration to the use of the word "export"
in the definition in clause 2 of this Bill, for
the reason that, in 'dealing with the definition
clause of the Fruit and Honey Bill last year,
the Senate made use of the words "export and
interprovincial trade."
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: "Export or interprovincial trade?"
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: "Export and interprovincial trade." That was in the Fruit and
Honey Act of 1934. The Bill we are now considering consolidates that Act with the Root
Vegetables Act.
A short time ago we passed an amendment
to the Live Stock and Live Stock Products
Act, in which the word "export" was defined
as it is in this Bill. At that timo the committee gave consideration to the expression
used by the Senate last year in the Fruit and
IIoney Act, and, as has been stated, on the
suggestion of the official who was present to
explain the Bill the Chairman interviewed the
Department of Justice. The officials of that
department submitted a reference to certain
cases in which the word "expert" had been
defined by the courts in Great Britain.

This definition is used largely to facilitate
the licensing of dealers. On its face it
appears to be very broad with respect to
the classes who are to be considered as
dealers, and who therefore will require
licences from the department before they
can handle produce covered by the Bill,
namely fruit, vegetables and honey. This
definition would app'ly to a large portion of
our potato-growing popul:tion in Eastern
Canada, because on fine days in the winter
season farmers unite with one another in
assembling carloads of potatoes for shipment.
They take advantage of mild days in the

We are using the word "export" in a slightly

Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH: Honourable
senators, on Friday last the Standing Cornmittee on Agriculture and Forestry presented
its report on Bill 95, in which report several
arnendments were recommended. Some honourable members objected to the use of the
word "export" to mean, as defined in the
Bill, export out of Canada or out of any
province to any other province. The right
honourable senator from. Eganville (Right
Hon. Mr. Graham) based an interesting discussion on the danger of establishing provincial
trade boundaries, pointing out the generally
accepted ides that trade should be f ree throughout Canada. I arn bound to say that while I
listened carefully to the discussion, I could
not find in the Bill anything which would
tend to restrict interprovincial trade. Honourable members were invited to suggest a
better word in place of "export" ns defined in
the measure, but so far no suggestion bas
been put forward. I amn making this brief
explanation in order that the riglit honourable leader of the House may be au courant
with what was donc here on Friday.

The Senate resumed from Friday, June 28,
the adj ourned debate on the motion for concurrence in the amendrnents made by the
Standing Committee on Agriculture and
Forestry to Bill 95, an Act respecting Fruit,
Vegetables and Honey.

Right Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM: Honourable members, it is not necessary for me
to repeat ahl that I said on Friday, but I draw
the attention of the right honourable leader
to the fact that last session the Senate almost
unanimously objected to the use of the word
"4export" as apphied to interprovincial trade.
In the Fruit and Honev Act of 1934. when it
came to us fromn the other House, "export"
was defined as meaning export out of Canada
or. out of any province to any other province.
The Senate struck out that definition, and
where "export" occurred in the Bill we inserted thereafter the words "and interprovincial trade." That amendrnent was agreed to.

SENATE

The Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry (Hon. Mr. Donnelly),
in presenting the committee's report, explained
that he had interviewed the Department of
Justice in connection with the use of this
word. The department cited judgments that
had been given in the Old Country, to show
that in the circumstances the word "export"
as used in this BilHl is legal. No person
doubts that it is legal. The Chairman also
stated that a representative of the Department of Agriculture appeared before tha committee and, as I understand it, urged that the
definition as given in the Bill be retained.
Now, without saying anything derogatory to
departmental officials, I woulýd point out that,
as everyone who has headed a department
knows, if an official is interested in a bill
his ambition is to have it go through as
drafted, his chief concern being that its operation be made easy. That is laudable, so
far as it goes. But ina Parliament we have
a higher duty to perform than even to make
the working of a bill easy. Last session we
performed that duty when we struck out the
definition of the word "export." We are responsibile for policy, even though a department may not approve of details that follow
upon our action. Every day in committee
we are making changes by virtue of this
responsibility.
I want to emphasize what I said the other
day, that the use of the word "export" as
applied te trade between provinces will be
alitogether misunderstood by foreign countries,
by visitors and even by some of our own
people. To my mind it will have a tendency
to divide Canada into nine separate entities
rather than, as we are trying to do, amid
some difficulties, consolidate it into a united
country. I object to "export" being applied
both to trade out of Canada an.d to interprovincial trade. I am not going to oppose
the Bill if the Committee on Agriculture
thinks it will benefit trade, though I do not
believe it wili; but as a representative of
the Dominion I do feel that the use of the
word "expert" to describe trade between
provinces is not good for Canada as a whole.
Last session we amended the definition
clause of the Fruit and Honey Bill to read
"expert and interprovincial trade." This describes the situation exactly. We all agreed
at that time that it was misleading to apply
"export" te trade between provinces. We
have always applied the word to foreign trade.
To apply it to interprovincial shipments will
net tend to perpetuate a feeling of national
unity, but rather will lend colour to the idea
that we are more concerned with provincial
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM.

than Dominion interests. This Bill consolidates the Root Vegetables Act and the Fruit
and Honey Act, and apparently departmental
officials are seeking to restore the definition
of "export" which, as I have said, we amended
last session.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: What legal objection
was taken to the addition of the words "and
interprovincial trade"?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: There was
none. I think the honourable member from
Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair), being a member
of the Committee on Agriculture, can explain
the situation thoroughly. As I understand it,
the definition was suggested by an official of
the department for the purpose of rendering
the Act more workable.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: It seems to me it
would have the opposite effect.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Yes, I should
think it would have the opposite effect. The
two classes of trade are distinct and separate,
and our amendment would keep them so.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Honourable senators, the change made in the definition of
"export" was made last session when the
Committee on Agriculture was dealing with
the Fruit and Honey Act. Under this Bill
that measure is now being consolidated with
the Root Vegetables Act. The interpretation
clause defines "export" to mean "export out
of Canada or out of any province to any other
province thereof."
The Chairman of the Committee (Hon. Mr.
Donnelly) interviewed the Deputy Minister
of Justice, who advised him that "export" as
defined in this Bill is similarly defined in the
Live Stock and Live Stock Products Act of
this session and also in another Act, administered by the Health of Animals Branch, and
that for the sake of uniformity it was desirable to retain the definition. He cited three
or four judgments of the English courts in
support of the definition that the department
preferred should be given to "export."
I
understood from the Chairman of the Committee on Friday that he intended to have
those citations sent to the right honourable
leader
of the House (Right Hon. Mr.
I presume this was done. and
Meighen).
therefore it will not be necessary for me to
give the substance of the decisions.
The .committee was of opinion that in view
of the broad question raised last session by
the right honourable senator from Eganville
(Right Hon. Mr. Graham) it would bc hetter
for the Senate to decide whether the definition

JULY 2,1935
shouid he amended. No meinbers of the legal
profession were in, attendance, nor had we the
advioe of the Law Officer of the Senate. The
purpose of the Bill is to empower the Departrnent of Agriculture, through its Fruit
Branch, to administer the two Acets proposed
to be consolidated. The 'branch will apply
gra.din.g regulations and conapel shippers of
produce, hoth for interprovincial and for export trade. to attach proper certificates of
grade. Whether or nlot we emend the word
iexport," the powers contained in the Bill
remain unchanged.
Right Hou. Mr. MEIGREN: Honourable
members, I have looked over the amelidments
as paseed by the Committee on Agriculture
and Forestry, and submitted now for approva]
of this House. Those amendments appear
to me to be hetterments. It is neot pretended that they are of great consequen-ce.
We have now to consider whether there
should be a-nother amen.dment to avoid the
use of the word "expert" as inclusive of interprovincial trade. Person.ally 1 arn strongly inclined to the view expreffsed by the right lionouraible gentleman from Eganville (Right Hon.
M.r. Graham) and the honourab]e senator frein
Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair). You can define
"ýexport" to inean whatever you like, for
instance, "vanishing through fire." But it is
always well that words should have their
natural and accepted ineaning; and it is particularly advisable in the case of a measure like
this, which will have to be generally read
and fullowed hy large aections of our people,
that it shouki contain nothing which, would
tend to convey the impression that export
trade and interprovincial trade are one and the
same thing. I ýcannot without further consideration suggest, an amendm.ent to bring
about such a resuit, nor amn I quite certain

that it could be easily done.

I have not had

an opportunity of reading the opinion of the
Department of Justice. 1 do not see much
reason for an opinion in law at ail. Unleas 1
find that the Department of Agriculture~ has
some sound reason for the definition,' I will

find some way of changing "export" to maean
what it should mean, and of having the Bill
inclu-de 'interprovin-cial trade." I move the
adjournment of the debate until to-morrow,
when I shaîl be prepared with a suggestion.

The debate was adjourned.

MARKETING

SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN moved the
second reading of Bill 117, an Act to amend

the Natural Produets Marketing Acet, 1934.
Hie said: Honourwble ruembers, this Bill
amends in bwo or three important features
what is popularly known as tihe Marketing
Act o.f last session-a rucasure which has gone
into operation fairly widely, considering the
short period since its enactmient.

The first amendment includes within the
scopie of the meaning of the terni "natural
product" any article "whàlly or partly manufactured or derived from a product of the
forest." This would cover pulp and paper,
but before a forest produet can be included
it must be determined by the Governor in

Council that it is wise to include it. The
amendment goes further and includes such
article of food or drink wholly or partly
manufactured or derived from any produet

coming within meaning of the terni "natural
pruduct" as uiay bc designated by the Governor in Council. I do not know just why
it is deemed necessary to inake that restriction with respect to f ood and drink, but there
is no reason why this flouse sheuld take
exception to it.
The next amendment provides that the
Marketing Board, on terms fixed by the Governor in Council, may make loans to local
boards "for the purpose of defraying aperating
expenses pending the receipt of charges and

tolls."

Lt will be readily understood

that

when the measure has commenced to operate
in respect of a certain produet it is some
time bel ore tolîs corne in. Meantime there
are certain expenditures. The Act did not
make provision for these advances. Of course,
they are te be by way of boan and on ternis
fixed by Order in Council.
Section 4 provides:
Notwithstanding any provision of this Act.
auy scherne of regulation may provide solely
for equ.aization to any extent, as between the
produicers, of the returus received from the
sale of the regulated product.
It hias been found fromn experience to date
that in the exercise of this control there
cornes a time when producers in a certain
industry--the dairy industry, for exampleswing teoune dairy product, temporarily perhaps, with a consequent depreciation of the
market value of that produet and enhancement of the market value of other products.
The boards find it necessary te have power

to work out some sehemne of equalization as
between those producers in a single industry
who are using the Marketing Board. No
scheme bas se far been worked out, but
members of local -boards desire that a scheme
be devised, and this sectdon gives the necessary authority. Particulars uf the scheme

one of a dozen, but the prineiple is laid down
in the Bill and authority given for its being
implemented in practice.
The first amendment contained in the next
clause is unimportant: it consists of the insertion of the words "or determination' after the
word "order."
The second amendment is
more important. It provides:
In any prosecution under this Act or under
any regulation it shall not be necessary for the
prosecuting authority to prove that the product
in respect of which the prosecution is instituted
was produced within that part of Canada to
which the schem relates, and if the accused
person pleads or alleges that the product was
not produced within that part of Canada to
which the schene relates, the burden of proof
thereof shall be upon the accused person.
It places upon a man who is accused of
breaking the law with respect to a certain
product the burden of proving that that product was not produced in that part of Canada
to which the scheme applies.
Such are the amendments. I am disposed
to think thev should go either to the Committee on Banking and Commerce or the
Committee on Agriculture. Because of the
congestion of work in the Banking and Commerce Committee, I should prefer that they
went to the Committee on Agriculture.

FARMERS' CREDITORS
ARRANGEMENT BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING

Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 114, an Act relating
to the application of the Farmers' Creditors
Arrangement Act, 1934, in the Province of
British Columbia.
Right Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM:
Honourable members, I am not going to present an argument on this Bill; I would sinply
suggest that it be laid over until to-morrow,
when, I think, the honourable leader on this
side of the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

will be present. From what I have heard, I
imagine that he wishes to say something about
it.
The only comment I have to make is by
way of warning that this Bill may establish
a precedent which will lead us into trouble.
We have, for instance, the Marketing Act.
Suppose the province of Ontario, through its
Government, were to say the Marketing Act
was unconstitutional and were to apply to the
courts; then, under the precedent established by
this Bill, Parliament cou-ld proceed to deprive
Ontario of any good or evil tihat might come
fron the Marketing Act. The same could be
done with much of the legislation passed this
year, the constitutionality of which, rightly or
wrongly, has been questioned. This Bill
is in the nature of a big stick over the licad of
any province that might dare to appeal to the
courts. Furthermore, it would upset altogether
the workings of the measures I have referred
to. I just want to sound a warning note. I
am one of the olider men, and am very strongly
in favour of keeping Confederation intact,
and opposed to anything which offers the
slightest eomfort or solace te those who sometimes express the view that Canada is disintegrating.
However, my primary purpose in rising is
to ask that this Bill bc laid over until the
leader on this side of the House is present.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
I have no
objection to the postponement of second
reading. If the leader of the opposite side
desires to speak on the measure, or to attack
it, he will be much better able to do so if I
say now what is to be said in its favour.
He will be able to read what I have said,
and will then have an excellent mark at
which to shoot.
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I would always rather see the right honourable leader
of the House in action than read his speeches.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am net
reading anything.
Riglht Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
The right
honourable gentleman is going to ask the
leader on this side to 'read the speech. I
should prefer that the right honýourable
gentleman gave him an opportunity of hearing it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Ahl right.
It will be a very moderate speech.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable members, I have noticed' what has been sa:id in
the press in reference to this particular Bill,
and there is one question I should like to
put on record, so that it may receive consideration when the two leaders are discuss-

445

ing the Bill. Apparently there is doubt as
to 'the constitution'ality of the Farmers' CrediThe provinze of
tors3 Arrangement Act.
British Columbia ha& already, as 1 understand, entered action in the courts Vo test
whether it is intra vires. I shal speak of
the province of S'askatchewan, as I know
something of what is going on there, and
shall men:tion a personal case as to which I
wonder what the eventual resuit would be
if the Act werc de-clared. unconstitutional.
The point is, this. I was dealiing this mnorning
with an application to the Debt Adjustment
Board for a reduction in the amount of a
debt that is owing to me. I have Vo decide
what I amn willing to do. When I determine
this the debtor has an opporitunity to accept
or Vo reject, my decision. If we fail to agree,
someone else stops in and. sett1es the matter.
Let us suppose there is a difference of
41,000 bet-ween the dobtor andi mysoif, and
that somoebody steps in and in som-e way or
other efforts a compromise. Where do we
stand if Vwo or three years later the Act is
declared to be ultra vires? It semas to me
thee is danger of many rnix-ups.
I arn not asking that this question be
answerod now, but arn simply poi.nting out
that thero must be many porsons; throughout
the country who are wondering what is going
to happen in connection with tho multiplicity
of adjustmonts that have been or will be
made.
Hon. My. HUGHES: Will thore be any
difference in the case of an amicable arrangement?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: If the arrangement
is amicable, there is no difficudty; it is only
whore a judgo or board decides, notwithstanding the position taken by the parties.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Even if tho Act is

CO.MPANES, BILL
REPORT 0F COMMITTEE

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM presented, and
moved concurrence in, the report of the Standing Committee on Banking andCommerce on
Bill 85, an Act Vo amend the Companies Act,
1934.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: Honourable
members, I cannot givo the amendmonts in
detail without the report, and hosides I do
noV know that the House is desirous of entering upon a detailed discussion of what the
committee has done. The consideration the
comîmittee has given to the Bill bas been
very extensive, though, I regret to say, not
as extensive and thorough as the committee
would have liked, or as it would have been
had the Bill reached us earlier in the session.
This measure is one of far-reaching consequence, affecting interests which concern al
the people of our country, even the humblest.
Consequently it would be impossible Vo review
its provisions ton thoroughly. The committee
bas done the very best it could in the time
at its disposai, regard being had Vo the fact
that several other important measures are
also before the committee. If any honourable
member interested in any particular feature
will mention it, I shail ho able Vo recali what
was done with respect Vo it. The Chairman
of the Committee could also explain the
action taken.
In the main, whàt we have done is this.
Certain features of the Act have been strengthened and made more rigid. We feit that we
had to reviseoune imnpurtant feature in ýorder
Vo hring it even ostensihly within Vhe powers
of the Federal Parliament. In this we deal
only with federallhy incorporated companieswe cannot deal with any others---and we limit
the powers that can ho granted Vo thema by
the Secretary of State. We eliminate, as far
as human ingenuîty can, what is usually known
-as 'cooking the balance sheet'ý-the m-arking
up of values Vo represent assots which really
do noV exist. Wherever a mark-up of values
affects the surplus, it cannot ho regarded by
the company in considcring the dividend or
in determining whether or not there is an
impairment of capital. The Bill as it reached

440

SENATE

us provided for the bona fides of the balance
sheet, but we have sought to make the
requirements still more rigid.
I was going to explain the point as to
which we found it necessary to strike from
the Bill a provision attempting to do something which undoubtedly would be not only a
straining, but a breaking of the constitutional limitations binding this House. In trying to supervise and keep right, as we can,
those companies which we control, and the
sale of their securities, we have made the
man or the underwriting company that takes
the securities for the purpose of sale the
agent of the company wherever we could do
so with any honesty at all. But in the Bill
as it came to us we find it stated as to the
absolute owner of the property, the only man
to whom the company can look for payment
for the stock, that if he is going to sell the
stock to the public he is deemed to be the
agent of the company. The committee took
the view that such a person cannot be deemed
to be an agent; that even if he is so described
ne certainly is not an agent. The owner is
în no sense an agent, and we cannot make
him an agent, and so assume jurisdiction for
ourselves, by simply saying that he is deemed
to be an agent.
We might just as well
declare that something with respect to which
the Ontario Legislature is enacting a law is
deemed to be a Dominion matter. That
would not make it a Dominion matter at
all. So the committee felt there was absolutely no justification for assuming by this
circumlocutory method a jurisdiction denied
to us. No doubt this is a main feature of
the measure.
The measure sought also to follow securities further by requiring that when an issuing company-of course, a federally incorporated company, under our jurisdictionmakes an arrangement for an underwriting
firm to buy out its stock, it will take from
that firm an agreement that when selling the
stock it will sec that every purchaser gets
the prospectus twenty-four hours before he is
bound on his subscription. We do not say
that is beyond the power of the Dominion,
but we do say it is perfectly futile, for the
circumvention of it is so simple that it would
always be resorted to. It was pointed out by
the honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Coté) that all the purchasing company
would have to do would be to sell again to
another purchasing company, and that first
company would give the second company the
prospectus. of course.
The law would be
carried out to the letter, but the method
would he just a moekery. Therefore we felt
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

it unwise to put this law on the Statute Book.
In this desperate struggle to pursue the firm
that purchased securities from the issuing
company, and then the purchaser who bought
from the first purchaser, we just had to say,
"Stop!"
We were of course aware of the fact that
every province, I believe with the exception
of Prince Edward Island, bas its own commission supervising the issue of securities.
These provincial bodies have studied the
whole question for years and have adopted
their own methods of supervision. I do not
think we ought to assume that we are the
only people who know how to legislate. This
is a problem of the provinces. They have
tried to discharge it, and they are discharging it. I think that most of the instances
revealed before the Price Spreads Commission
and considered by that commission to have
been wrongdoings occurred before there was
that provincial supervision which now is so
general and, in my belief, so effective.
These arc the main amendments which
have been inserted. I think the Bill as it
will go back to the House of Commons bas
been very much improved. but J do not feel
as confident of our amendments and of the
final result being wholly harmonious and in
the best possible form as I should have felt
had we been able to give it as much time as
we gave to many other measures this session
-as much time as in justice to the country
it really demanded.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I rise simply to
support the statement of my right honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) that
this proposed legislation is of considerable
importance to the commercial community,
and that within the limited time at our disposal we have not been able to do our work
so thoroughly as we should have liked to
do it. The psychological effect of the impending expiration of the session permeates Parliament. Although the · ommittee on Banking and
C
Commerce bas given this Bill careful attention, I venture the opinion that next session
it will have to be amended. Important legis
lation of this character should not be drafted
and enacted in a hurry. Our chambers of
commerce from the Atlantic to the Pacifie are
keenly interested. They should have been
given ample time to study the Bill and present their views to Parliament, and I think
a prudent body of legislators would have
afforded them such an opportunity. We have
already within the last twenty-four months
reviewed the Companies Act. I recognize
that from time to time it may be necessary to

JULY 3, 1935
amend our company law. I hope that within
the next twelve months the vari.ous bodies
interested in the application of this proposed
enactment may be able to give us their views
thereon, so that, if necessary, it may be further
considered and amended by Parliament.
The motion was agreed to.

COMBINES INVESTIGATION BILL
REPORT

OF

COMMITTEE

Right Hon. 'Mr. GRAHAM presented, and
,moved concurrence in, the report of the
Standing Committee on Ba.niing and Commerce on Bill 79, an Act to armend the Combines Investigation A'ct.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think perhaps the Acting Chaimnan of the Committee
could esplainRight Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:

Not so well.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I was absent
during one of the principal days when the
commitee was dea'ling with this Bil.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM,:

Go on, go on.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The amendments are nurnerous, and a few of them are of
some importance.
The first three do not
require special àttention.
The fourth amendmeent deals with the definition of merger, trust or monopoly, and reads
as follows:
"Merger, trust or monopoly" means one or
more persons (a) who has or have purchased,
leased or ~therwise acquired any control over
or interest in the whole or part of the business
of anotherThat, for the first time, defines as a monopoly
something which just unites into one corporate organization. There need be nothing in
the nature of an agreement or arrangement
at ah.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
describe it as an ,offence.

And it does not

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: No. It is
not an offence in itself.
-Or
<b) who either substantially or completely
control, throughout any particular area or
district in Canada or throughout Canada the
class or species of business in which he is or
they are engaged.
The Bill as it came to us read "dominate
or control." The reason for the change is

447

purelly legal. We all know pretty well what
"dýominate" means when used alone: it reall-y
means to control. The domination nay be
small or large, the control partial or complete.
But we do not know what "dominate" means
when used in conjunction with "control." It
appeared to the oommittee that if both words
were used the courts would' look for some
other meaning of "diominate" and would be
comjpelled to say that any company which by
reason of its suocess was larger than another
concern dominated it, though perhaps not in
control of it. How any company, without controlling another, could dominate it except by
being larger I do not know. The committee
felit the best thing to do was to say "substantially or completely control."
Then, as the Bill read originally it unintentionally took away from a person any right he
mnight have u'nder a patent. So the committee inserted a provision to preserve any rights
acquired, under the Patent Act or any other
law of the country.
Also in the course of the inquiry and consideration of the Bill by the committee it was
decided to be advisable to have the Commission-which is the present Tariff Boardkeep in closer contact with the Minister and
report to him, much as the Registrar did under
the old Act, so that the Minister could at all
tilmes examine into the situation if he desired. He reports to Parliament. It is true
that the new Commission will have vastly
more power than the Registrar had, and will
occupy a position of greater dignity, strength
and independence. Nevertheless, it was felt
that it should report to the Minister.
The committee also provided that the Commission, when it has finished with original
documents belonging to a business, shall return them, and that it may make copies of
such documents as are wanted, and thereafter
the copies shall have all the probative force
of originals.
We provided also against simultaneous prosecutions, on the game set of facts and for the
same offence, under the Criminal Code and
the Combines Investigation Act. This practice is not permitted anywhere in any other
British country, nor is it the practice in
Canada in any other connection. We do not
say, "You cannot prosecute under both laws,"
but we say, "You must not place a man in the
position of being prosecuted under both at the
same time."
We provided also that the Act should come
into force on the lst day of October, 1935.
The original provision was that the Act should
not come into force before the lst day of
October, 1935, which I think is ineffective
wording.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, no. That

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: As it is changed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It says:

We define ,it in that way, and then go on ta

-and extend-s and applies only to the business
of manufacturing, producing, transporting, purchasing. supplying, storing or dealing in
commodities which may be -the subject of
trade or commerce: Provided that this subsection shall not be construed or applied so
as to limit or impair any right or interest
derived under the Patent Act, 1935, or under
any other statute of Canada.
I think the law bas always been such that
anything which operates to the injury of the
public is an offence and may be prohibited and
punished by the Act.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Does the right
honourable gentleman think the words "class
or species of business" would cover, for example, the handling of fruit or garden products, say, in British Columbia or Ontario, or
the handling of tomatoes or potatoes in the
provinces of New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island? It seems to me the words are
not broad enough to cover conditions of that
kind.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think the
language used covers that, whether it should
or not. The Bill as it carne to us just said
"cla.ss of business." We changed this phrase
to "class or species," thereby widening its
scope. If the honourable member will read
the definition on page 2 of the BillHon. Mr. MURDOCK: It says:

or combination of persons possessing or

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I wonder whether
the right honourable gentleman would read
subsection 4 as amended.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Read it as it
was before the change, 'and also as it is now?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
as amended.

No, just read it

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, we have
recast it. Now it means one or more "persons,' which of course, includes companies.
It says:
Merger, trust or monopoly means one or
more persons
(a) who lias or have purchased, leased or
otherwise acquired any control over or interest
in the whole or part of the business of another;
or
(b) who either substantially or completely
control, throughout any particular area or
district in Canada or throughout Canada the
class or species of business in which he is or
they are engaged.
That is a very simple and, I think, complete
definition.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:

That is any business.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: And there is no
reference to manufacturing, producing, transporting. purch'asingRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, yes. I
have finished the definition. Then there is
the following:

DOMINION HOUSINIG BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM presented, and
moved concurrence in, the report of the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce on Bill 112, an Act to assist the Construction of Houses.
He said: The only amendment is the insertion of the word "for" after the word "and"
in line 17, page 1.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, the amendment is verbaL It was
shown to me, and is quite correct. Beyond
that I do not know anything about it.
But what I rose to say is this. When the
Bill was under discussion some question was
raised as to whether, although all its clauses
seemed to be quite fair as respects the
Dominion, it would result in further building
or would be ineffective. I was not able to
be present on Friday. On that day the
Deputy Minister of Finance was asked to
appear before the Committee on Banking and
Commerce, and I am informed that certain
questions were put to him on this point. He
has since written me a letter, with which he
encloses copy of one received by him from
of the
Mr. D'Arcy Leonard, secretary
Dominion Mortgage and Investments Association. In Mr. Leonard's letter, which I expect
to have before me in a moment, very hopeful
language was used as respects the efficacy
bf the Bil. He says that the mortgage companies undoubtedly wiil co-operate, and be
speaks officially. It is his belief that because
of the loaning value being se high in relation
to the cost of construction, the measure will
be quite largely availed of. There is no doubt
at al that mortgage companies now are glad
to get into anything which will provide use
for their money on safe conditions. It may
be that when losses come the Dominion will
bear more thap its share, but that wil have
to, be dealt with at the time and the responsibility taken by whatever Government may
be in office. I now read Mr. Leonard's letter:
Dear Mr. Clark:
With further respect te my telegraIn te you
of the 215th instant with reference te the
Dominion Housing Bill, I 'beg te advise you
that I have been in consultation wi-th a number
of the lending institutions who are members of
the Dominion Mçrtgage and Investments Association.
Subject to satisfaotory arrangements being
comp'leted with respect te those matters left
open by the Bill. these companies that I have
consulted advise me that they are ready to
co-bperate in making joint mortgages along the
•

449

plan indicated by the Bill. My inquiries indicate that they hope te be able to advance the
amount contemplated by the Bill, if the demand
for these loans exists.
In view of the fact that under the present
system of financing construction of houses a
first mortgage up te a maximum of 60 per cent
only is granted, and the Bill provides for an
80 per cent mortgage at a contemplated lower
rate of interest due to the Government's contribution, it is reasonable te expect that there
will be a denand for these loans and that
building will be greatly stimulated thereby.
Yours truly,
T. D'Arcy Leonard.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHA:M:
Honourable
members, the Deputy Minister did appear before the committee and was asked a great
many questions, including those mentioned by
my right honourable friend.
There is in the Bill a clause which the casual observer would net notice, though perhaps a really bright legal mind might catch
its significance. As a layman I should call it
a joker. The open sections, mentioned in
that letter, include one which provides that
contracts or agreements may be made between
the Governient and loan companies. Under
certain circumstances it will be optional for
the Government to protect the companies
against losses by assuming more that its regular share under joint mortgages. Newx, the
companies may rely on that to save them
from losses to any great extent.
After a bit of discussion the Deputy Minister remarked he did net think that provincial loan companies could join in this
scheme, particularly with trust funds. He
thought that provincial restrictions would not
permit such concerns te join in an agreement
to Iend 60 per cent as part of an 80 per cent
loan, where there would be only a 20 per cent
equity left, at the best. Provincial loan conpanies seldom lend more than 50 per cent,
particularly .when trust funds are concerned,
because such funds are in a sense more or
less. sacred.
Another point was raised, which I am repeating, but not for the purpose of objecting
to the Bill. It was remarked that under the
provisions of this measure a man who wished
to take advantage of the loaning possibilities
would, if he were building property worth, including the lot, say, $3,000, have to put up
$600 himself. That would bc his own investment of 20 per cent. In other words. he is
expected to invest as much as the Government will lend, and .many members of the
committee thought this would exclude large
numbers of people who really would like to
take advantage of some suèh scheme as this
in order to build little homes for themselves.

92584-29
DEDITION

450

SENATE

I desire to reHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
affirm the position I took on the second reading of this Bill. At that time I was reported
in the newspapers as making a rather extravagant statement, but this was due to the
fact that I did not express myself clearly. The
papers declared J was favourable to an advance of $100,000,000 from the Dominion exchequer, by way of a gift or bonus to the
extent of 20 per cent of the value of buildings to be constructed, with a view to the
starting of work throughout Canada. It was
pointed out that such a plan would mean an
expenditure of $500,000,000 in this country.
But I menitioned those two figures at the time
merely as units, with reference to a proposal
made to the President of the United States.
The figures would of course not be extravagant with respect to that country.
My view is that the Bill will not help in any
appreciable degree to start the wheels rolling
to.wards a rapid recovery in this country. I do
not know the number of unem,ployed in the
whole of Canada to-day, but it is stupendous.
The unemployed are mostly in towns and
cities. My idea was that we could well afford
to make a fairly large gift, in the form of a
bonus, to real estate owners or o.ther persons
who would like to build. We might advance
them a bonus of 20 per cent. Tbat would be a
means of helping to put our people to work.
If the Government, instead of taking the
right to lend $10,000,000, had got authority
to give, say, $20,000,000 as a bonus towards
bouse-building throughout Canada, on the
basis of 20 per cent of the cost of construction,
we might induce people to invest money in
this form of enterprise. In the present state
of stagnation it is somewhat of a risk for
people to put up bouses, for there is only a
slight hope that the proprietor will find
tenants able to pay a rental that would give
him a reasonable return. But by adivancing 20
per cent of the cost, as a gift, and distributing
i, throughout the land, in large centres where
tbere is unemployment, should we not induce
a total expenditure of $100,000,000 and thus
start the wheels moving towards a return of
prosperity?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not want
to make specifie reply to what my honourable
friend says, further than this. He seriously
suggests that the Government give to builders
of new houses 20 per cent of the cost of the
bouses and lots. Then be says the country is
in a state of stagnation. Well, if the country
is in a state of stagnation. it cannot afford te

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: ýCan the country
not afford to continue the dole?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But this
would not go to people who are on the dole.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It would go to
people who are on the dole now, but who
would get employment if bouses were constructed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Certainly,
but the 20 per cent would go to the owners
of the bouses. No more people would be
put to work than if this 20 per cent were lent
to the owners and had to be returned. Of
course you can bonus people to do anything.
People certainly would build houses if 20
per cent of the cost were given to them, but
I do not think the Dominion Government
ought to pay 20 per cent of the cost of conMany people who are well off
struction.
woul-d build houses under a scheme of that
kind, and would thereafter rent them. They
would have a big advantage over owners who
are trying to rent bouses which they built
at their own expense.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The Deputy
Minister told us this Bill would cover the
erection of apartment houses.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. Look
at the advantage that would be given to a
man who used such a gift to help finance the
building of an apartment, as compared with
apartment bouse owners who bad to finance
the whole cost themselves. I think if my
honourable friend (Hon. *Mr. Dandurand)
were in the other House and facing an election
his suggestion would be more appropriate
than it is here.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Well. I have
had that idea for some years. I believe that
something must be done, and I should be in
favour of risking $20,000,000 in order to produce $100,000,000 of work throughout the land.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Honourable senators,
I would be the last person to favour anything
which would result in increasing taxation on
all the people. The only reason why I am
in favour of this scheme at all is that the
Deputy Minister bas assured us there will be
companies which will come forward to put
up money for house-building. I was very
sceptical of the measure until that assurance
was given, for I did not think there was sufficient inducement offered. On the other hand,
J am so disgusted with the dole system that
I would favour almost anything else; and I
believe the giving away of 20 per cent as
proposed would take more people off the

JULY 3, 1935

451

dole than would be taken off by any other
means. The supplying of material required
for the construction of houses will give work
to a great many who are now on relief.
I do flot know what we are opending today on the dole, but it runs into millions.
1 would say, with ail due respect to my leader,
that it would flot matter at aIl if as a result
of this allowaýnce of 20 per cent a large number of buildings weýre erected by people who
are rich or well off, so long as work was created
for men 110W unemployed. I arn of the opinion
that no other plan will make available so
mucli work as one like this, with the Government paying 10 or 20 per cent of the cost of
construction. I shall be very glad to vote
for a measure which wjll induce people to
build.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I should
think it would if the owner were still in a
position to negotiate a loan.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
Bill corne into effeet?

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable member is quite right, that in so far as
there is an advantage it is given to the man
who builds 110w, as compared with the man
who did not have financial assistance. But iii
is not such discrimination as is suggested by
the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand). The difference is the difference
between, say, a 31,000 grant, which can be
kept for ever, and a 81,000 boan which you
have to pay back in toto, plus three, four or
fve per cent interest.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Irnmediately

It is a great mistake andl illusion to suppose
that this country is in a staýte of stagnation.
We have passed the nadir. The indices of
recovery are encouraging indeed, and in many
respects show we are past tbe condition prevailing in the year 1926, which is taken as
the normal stage. They are, I admit, aecornpanied by very considerable, one might alrnost
say disastrous, unemployrnent. But the fact
that unemployrnent exists in this day and
generation does not mean the country is in a
state of stagnation. It is an economie consequence of a scientific development. Not
only do the indices show we are in a very
good position at present, as cornpared even
with 1926, but the Geneva records indicate
that in many respects we have made the best
recovery of ail countries, and in all respects
the best recovery of ahl countries save one.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: A propos of my
right honourable friend's rernarks, rnay I tell
him that, the last issue of the Revue des Deux
Mondes states that the crisis is ended or nearly
ended, but we are now facing a permanent
situation. That is the real difficulty.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
right.

Yes, that is

Hon. Mr. MaeARTHIJR: The honourable
senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock)
raised a question that 1 had in mind as to
when this measure will corne into effect. Perhaps the right honourable leader of the House
will state whether any construction now
started, but flot completed before the Bill
receives Royal Assent, would corne under its
provisions?
92584-29à

Hon. Mr. MacAIRTHUR: That is ambiguous. Let me ask the right honourable gentleman another question. Would persons now
undertaking to build not have a great advantage over those already owning bouses?
Are present householders not discrirninated
against, having had no financial assistance
when they bujît their property?
I do not
agree with rny honourable leader (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) with respect te, his scherne; I
think the oth-er is preferable; but there is
discrimination in giving -the builder of a new
bouse an advantage over the person who is
already the, owner of a building.

OF COMMITTEE

The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned debate on the motion for concurrence
in the ajmendments made by the Standing
Committee on Agriculture and Forestry to
Bill 95, an Act respecting Fruit, Vegetables
and Honey.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, the only purpose in having this report stand over until to-day was to find some
method of so wording the Bill that "export"
would not be applied to interprovincial trade.
It is moved by Hon. Senator Ballantyne,
seconded by Hon. Senator Beaubien, that
the Bill be further amended as follows:
Page 1, line 22. After "export" insert "or
interprovincial trade."
Page 1, line 23. After "export" insert "or
interprovincial trade."
Page 1, line 23. For the second 'export1'
substitute "shipment."
Page 4, line 15. After "export" insert "or
interprovincial trade."
All this proposed amendment does is simply
to word the Bill so that it plainly covers
export trade an-d interprovincial trade. We
do not describe interprovincial trade as export trade.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: May I point out
to the right honourable leader that last
session we amended the Fruit and Honey Act
to read "export and interprovincial trade."
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have no
doubt that what the honourable senator from
Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair) says is correct.
The words "export and interprovincial trade"
were perhaps suitable in the Fruit and Honey
Act of last year, but I am sure they would
not be in this case. Here it is necessary to
use the words "export or interprovincial trade."
Let me direct the honourable gentleman's
attention to section 14:
No person shall assemble or ship honey for
export unless he be first duly registered in
accord with the regulations.
If we followed what was donc before, the
wording would be:
No person shall assemble or ship honey for
export and interprovincial trad-e.
No person would ship honey for both. Under
the present amendment the wording will be:
No person shall assemble or ship honey for
export or interprovincial trade.
Right Hon

Mr. MEIGHEN.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Will the right honourable gentleman read the definition of "export" as amended?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The word
"export" is not used in the Bill except with
the words "or interprovincial trade."
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The marginal note
to paragraph (f) of section 2 is changed as
well?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. The
paragraph now reads:
"Export or interprovincial trade" means
shipment out of Canada or out of any province
to any other province thereof.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The House should
first adopt the amendments proposed by the
committee.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: These are amendments to the report of the committee?

FARMERS' CREDITORS ARRANGEMENT
BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion for second
reading of Bill 114, an Act relating to the
application of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934, in the Province of British
Columbia.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The order stands
in the name of Right Hon. Senator Graham.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The right honourable leader (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
wanted to discuss the motion yesterday.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: At my request
my right honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr.
Graham) suggested that the debate be adjourned. The right honourable leader of the
House very kindly accepted the suggestion.
I should like now to have the riglit honourable leader's explanation of the Bill.

JULY 3,1935
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I wanted to
make the statement yesterday. One remambers more accurately just after reading the
facts than twenty-four hours later. Last session Parliament passed the Farmers' Creditors
Arrangement Act, to take care of distressed or
-ta use a more offensive term-hankrupt
farmers. It provides for voluntary settiemant
of debts through the interposition of officiai
recaivers. In the avent of failure to agrea,
the matter is referrad for final decision to a
board of raview headed by a high court judge,
thera being ana board in each province. The
settlement contemplated by the Act included
ahl debts-even debts due ta provincial gavernmants or commissions. Obviously any
settlemant short of that wauld be perfunctory
and worthiess; in fact, it could not ha effected
under any bankruptcy jurisdiction, for a settlament in bankruptcy involves everything and
gives the debtor a fresh start.
Farmers have avaiied themnselves of the Act
most extensiveiy, and the number of cases
dealt with is a surprise ta me, cansidering the
short time in which the legislation has been
in effect. I thinlk ît lias 'warkad succassfuily. I have heard complaints from. anly one
province-I arn sorry ta say, Ontario-and
those fromn the point of view of creditors.
In British Columbia the Act got well undar
way oniy last spring, and April was an activa
month. In the course of its aperations in the
Sumas Valley cases arase where rnoneys were
owing the Provincial Government. In this
connection it should be kept in mind that in
British Columbhia the municipal organization
is nat nearly sO compieta as in other provincas, and the farmer is dealing direct with
the Gavarnment. Ha has received advances
for drainage, reclarnation and road construction.
The officiais in charge of the administration
of the Act approached the provincial authorities and were promised fullest ca-aperation. Wben, however, the representatives of
the province found its dlaims were affacted
they took injunction procaedings against the
board of raview and endeavourad ta have the
Act declared ultra vires. It is impract-icabie
ta administer the Act without the co-oparation
of the provincial authorities.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would suggest
that the province has no role ta play under
aur Act.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is playing
a rola.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As a creditor.
Rigbt Hlon. Mr. MEIGHEN: As an oppanant, although in the first instance it wel-

453

comed the Act in general and promised to
co-operate. The Government of Canada was
faced with the possibility of having to fight
a lawsuit on the validity of the legisiation
from the standpoint of our Constitution, ail
the way to the Privy Council. I cannot say
that I have given any very useful study tu
the question whether or flot the legisiation
is constitutional. It may be, or it may flot.
But I have always feit that it was. If the
Government does nothing, and the legisiation
is declared invalid, the whole country loses
the banefit of it, even though it is flot on-ly
wanted, but, particularly on the Western
plains, is vital, essential and imperative. The
Administration was faced with the question
what to do. It might have resisted the lawsuit, and perhaps have won; but if it had
lost, not only British Columbia but the whole
of Canada would have had to suiffer the consequences. So the Government took the stand
that the wisest thing to do was to except
British Columubia frorn the provisions of the
Act.
i have not reacl the Bill ilateiy, but I beliave
it is to corne into effeet on proclamation
of the Governor inCouncil. If British Colu.mbia, does nat intend ta pr.oceed with its attack,

it May stili corne under the

pTovisions

of the

Acet in the same way as any other province;
but I do not know why it shouldt be forceid ta
do so against the wil'l of its Government.
Wie must assume that the Government of
British Columubia speaks for that province. On
this .assnnýption, regard baing had to, the
generail interest of the Dominion and the vital
nature od the Act to a treimnendous body of our
popiiation, it is felt that this is the, safest
course to purque.
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourabie seaeors, I
want ta congratulate the 'right honourable
the leader upon the fairness of his stateaent
regarding the situation baetween the province
of British -Columbia and tha Dominion with
regard t a this Bill. I want to say cao that I
think we in the Senate appreciate his efforts
ta make- our statu.s coniform. ta aur authority.
When we had the Fa.rm.ers, Creditors Arirangement Bill and the Farm. Loan Bill before- ouýr
cammittea this year. we, were careful to see
how fa.r we could go in protecting the Domninion treasury against loss and in avoiding an
invasion of the provincial field, of taxation.
In discussing this question I arn no.t gaing
ta rapeat the arguments adlvanced. in another
place. It was rapr.esented thera -that the
Provincial Government did, rasent-I think,
praperly so-the intimation that this Parliament can stop in and take from it the right of
taxation. That is the implication in this Bill.

454

SENATE

Because the Government of British Columbia
has raised an issue bv reason of its revenues
being affected, the Dominion Government
says, by this amendment, "We will not give
the ordinary debtors and creditors in British
Columbia an opportunity to adjust their differences under the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act." The Bill excludes from the provisions of the Act, in which there are many
good features, ordinary debtors and creditors
who want to make an adjustment. I am not
sure that that is wise.
As the right honourable the leader has said.
the Act has been well received throughout
the country; but there is no doubt that if
those who administer it attempt to encroach
upon the provincial or municipal rights of
taxation the Dominion Government must figbt
in the courts. An item appeairing in this
morning's press goes to show that the Government, unliess it is sure of its position, had better
let tIis matter rest. Here we have the Municipal Council of the Township of Gloucester
objecting.
Whereas the Farmers' Cred"itors Arrangement Att bo.ard has proposed in la number of
local cases to cancel the penalty charges on
taxes and to otherwise interfere with collections, be it resolved that this council protest
further against snch action and council herein
denies the right of the board to interfere with
tax collections.

what the British Columbia G'overnment
objected to was interference with their taxation system. J was asking my honourable
friend why he considers this a question of

Hon. Mr. KING: It is net a question of

my honourable friend will realize the importance of it, is that the Act originally was
intended to bring about an adjustment between individual
debtors and creditors.
Whether or net this Parliament bas the right

is objectionable to the Government of British
Columbia?
Hon. Mr. KING: The Government of
British Columbia has from time to time
advanced money in the form of Joans to the
farming community of that province. Then
it bas the right to taxes on farm lands. It is
my understanding that there was a case in
which a Provincial Government loan, or tax,
was affected, and the Attorney-General of the
province took exceptionHon. Mr. GRIESBACH: You say "a loan."

A loan, or tax-

Hon. Mr. KING: Overdue taxes or a loan;

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Surcly there must
be a difference between a loan made by the
Provincial Government and a levy for taxes.
In the case of a loan the Provincial Government is in the same position as an ordinary
person lending moneyHon. Mr. KING: Any Provincial Government that lends money represents the Crown,
and is in the saine position witb respect to
the loan as it would be in regard to taxation.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Oh, I sece.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: What were the terms
and the extent of the loans of the British
Columbia Government to the farmers?
Hon. Mr. KING: I have not that information. I am merely trying to state a principle and to indicate to this Chamber the
difficulties that the Dominion Government is
going to have in trying to enforce legislation
that is not within its purview. In the preface to my remarks I intimated that this
Cbamber was indebted to the leader of the
House for bis endeavours to keep us within
our purview.

JULY 3,1935
The province of British Columbia, through
its Attorney-General, intimates that it is not
satisfied that the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act should apply in connection with its
loans. This being so, there is only one course
open to the Government-to proceed to
vindicate and justify itself in the courts. It
should not withdraw and pass a special enactment that will exclude the ordinary debtor
and creditor of British Columbia from the
benefits of the Act. That is my point. I
concede frankly that I am not prepared to
go into it, but I say we have here an evidence of what is going to happen. My advice
to the Government would be that if it is sure
of its ground it should proceed in the courts
of British Columbia and prove its case. That
is all I have to say.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators, as far as the remarks of the honourable
gentleman from Kootenay East (Hon. Mr.
King) are concerned, I have heard some other
honourable senators express the opinion that
agreements arrived at voluntarily will not
come before the courts. In my opinion, the
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, apart
altogether from the legal position of our provinces under it, bas accomplished imore good
than any other Act we have had in the
Dominion of Canada since Confederation.
I shall take up the time of the Chamiber just
long enough to cite one or two cases that
have come to my attention.
In one case three men bought a hall section
of raw prairie land for $33 an acre and sold
it for $45 an acre without improving it in the
slighest degree.
Hon. Mr. KING: That does not affect my
argument at all. The honourable gentleman
bas missed the point.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: When I get through
with my statement of what the Act bas
accomplished in relation to voluntary agreements, I shall deal with the argument.
The men who purchased the land at $45
an acre <cut the bush off it, broke it up, built
three residences, and dug three wells on it.
Later, finding themselves in difficulties-they
had bought under a half-crop agreement and
had been charged eight per cent interest on
overdue payments-they applied under the
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act to be
allowed to pay $1,200 instead of the $3,000 the
vendors were asking. Finally, when the
parties appeared before the adjustment board,
the judge said to the vendors: "You bought
this land at $33 an acre and sold it at $45 an
acre, showing a profit on paper of about
$4.000. How would you like to make an ad-

455

justment by cutting your claim down to $2,400
and charging interest on that amount?" The
man who was doing the talking for the vendors
said, "I have to consult my partners." "All
right," said the judge, "take them outside and
talk to them. We will go on with another
case. Meanwhile I would recommend that
you throw off $1,200 as of the date of purchase
and accept $2,400 as profit, and reckon your
interest on that." The three men went out,
and hall an hour later -came baek and said
they would accept $2,500. The judge advised
the purchasers to accept the offer, which they
did, and the whole matter was settled to the
entire satisfaction ol both sides, although in
the first place ,there had been a difference, including interest, of more than $3,000 between
the amount claimed and the amount offered.
The night alter the settlement was made I
met the judge. I said to him: "Well, you have
sat for six days at Blaine Lake, but if you
have settled aIl the other differences as well
as you have settled this one, it bas been
worth your while com'ing, because the seven
men interested in this case ai went home
well satisfied."
I am not one of those who think that any
man ought to be deprived of his rights as an
individual, but I believe that in ninety per
cent of cases the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act has worked to the entire satisfaction
of ail concerned.
Par be it from me to suggest that it might
be politics that is influencing the province of
British Columbia in opposing the working of
the Act. So far as Saskatchewan is concerned, apart altogether from political views,
which I am not considering, something of
the kind' was needed to bring debtors and
creditors together, and the Act bas accomplished this in my province. There is no
doublt at aIl that before this Act was placed
on the Statute Book any creditor could have
gone to his fellow man and said, "This is
more than you can pay." Like many others,
But this legislation gave
I have done that.
the opporbunity to more people to do that
very thing. I think it bas been one of the
most helpful laws thait we have ever had. I
may bc wrong, but I am suspicious of the
action that the Government of British
Columbia bas taken. I regret it very much.
That province is one in which I can imagine
there were many cases of land having been
soldi for more than it was ýreally worth. The
Act provided machinery whereby the parties
concerned could get together and corne to
an agreement for adjusting the indebtedness
owing on parLels of land which had been sold
for prices that are now impossible to pay.

456

SENATE

In the province of Saskatchewan, contrary
to what some peoplie may have thought, the
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act has not
greatly injured life insurance companies,
which are handling the funds of widows and
others. So far as my personal aequaintance
with the law goes, most of the adjustments
have been between one farmer and anoither.
I have sold land under agreements of sale,
and in some cases I consider the price was
too high.
The adjustment in su'ch cases
merely means that paper profits are reduced.
I think the Act is a wonderful piece of
legislation, and in my opinion the action
taken by the province of British Columbia
is a very unwise one.

passed last year, and the Dominion Government, instead of resisting that challenge
before the courts, is running away, declaring
it will end the operation af the Act in the
province. I a.dk my right honourable friend
what he will do if the Gloucester Township
Council challenges the right of the Farmers'
Creditors Arrangement Act board to affect
amounts owing to that township.

Hion. RAOUL DANDURAMD:
Honourable senators, ,my honouirable friend from
Saskatchewan North (Hon. Mr. Horner) has
made a general defence of the Farmers'
Creditors Arrangement Act, and I was
pleased to hear him state the advantages
that flow from it. But that is not the question now before us. The Act is not attacked.
The sole issue here is the a.dvisability of
with'drawing the benefits and, effects of the
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act of 1934
from operation in the province of British
Columbia. So there is no occasion for explaining the adivantages of the legislation.
My only object in asking that second
reading of this Bill be postponed until to-day
was that I might obtain from my right
honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
the reason why the measure was brought
down. I listened very carefully to my right
honourable friend's remarks and I found the
sole reason was that when the 'Governiment
of British Columbia attacked the Act in
the courts the Dominion Government decided
it would not defend the constitutionarlity of
the law. the right of this Parliament to pass
it. but would simply withdraw the operation
of the law from that province. Well, it is
a very important principle which we have to
deal with. The proposed measure impairs
the unity of fedieral legislation. We all know
the arguments that were advanced against
the use of the word "export" as applied
to the shipm'ent of go-ods from one province
to another. This House agreed with the
suggestion af my right honourable friend from
Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham) that
commerce between provinces shoulid not be
described as export trade-that the unity of
this country should not be weakened in the
least. We are all in favour of that principle.
Yet we are now facing this extraordinary
situation, that a province-I care not what
province it be-has challenged a federal Act

friend from Kootenay East (Hon. Mr. King),
and which reads as follows:
Whereas the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act board has proposed in a number of
local cases to cancel the penalty charges on
taxes and to otherwise interfere with collections, be it resolved that this council protest
further against such action and council herein
denies the right of the board to interfere with
tax collections.
Suppose this protest is followed by an injunetion, will Parliament next session withdraw
the operation of the Act from the province
of Ontario?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We shall
cross that bridge when we come to it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: May I ask my
right honourable friend what he will do if
a province attacks any of the measures of
social legislation which have been passed or
are in process of being passed by this Parliament? Will lie declare it is the policy of
the Government to withdraw the operation
of the law from the province which has made
the attack? If there is a challenge of any
federal Act by a provincial government or an
individual-for an individual may protest
before the courts-wll the Dominion Government be justified in withdrawing the application of the law from the province in which
the protest originates? And in the case of a
general levy, if Ontario, for instance, challenged the right of the Dominion Government
to impose the tax, would my right honourable friend justify the exemption of that province? Perhaps I am suggesting an extreme

JULY 3,1935
case, for 1 suppose there would have to be
uniformity in taxing legislation.
1 feel that legisiation passed by this Parliament for the whole Dominion must be generalIy applicable tbroughout the country, and
I believe it is the duty of the Federal Government to defend its legisiation before the
courts. .British Columbia has attacked the
Farm.ers' Creditors Arrangement Act, and it
may be attacked by other provinces. We
knew we were upon somewbat delicate ground
'n dealing with, the right of the King in the
various provinces and the right of the King
in the Dominion, wben, some time ago, we
were considering certain legislation, though
the Dominion claimed it bad the nýecessary
power by virtue of eminent domain, and we
passed the legisiation.
It seems to me that it is a very serjous step
to witbdraw the operation of an Act from a
province simply because the Provincial Government institutes an action to challenge the
Act. I ask my right honourable friend to
stop for a moment and think what the result
would be if the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, which is attacked iby British Columbia, were declared constitutional. If the
courts do find the legisîstion to, be constitutional, it could be operating in that province witb ail the advantages--and I think
there are some-that flow from. it. But this
Bill will deprive the province of the benefits
of the law. My rigbt bonourable friend knows
that any piece of Dominion legislation may
be attacked in any of the nine provinces. The
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act itself
may be opposed in a different province every
year. Would my right honourable fricnd say
that would justify the passing annually of a
bill such as this with respect to a particular
province, until the law was no longer in effeet
anywhere in the Dominion?
I believe that wben my right bonourable
fýriend gives further co-noideration to the
matter he will conclude that this Bill is not a
desirable one., Therefore I hope ýhe will permit the second reading to be postponed for
a further twent-y-four bours in order that he
and bis colleagues may ponder over the
situation *whi.ch would be created by the
withdrawal of the operation of *the Farmers'
Creýditors Arrangement Act from British
Columibia. As I have said, the Federal Govermment may expect an assault upon its legislation from any quarter. I.n this case British
Colum-bia is contesting the validity of one of
our Acts, and the Government decides, without asking for a finding fromn the courts, that
the Act shail no longer be in force in that
province; and, I repeat, though the courts

457

may find the legisiation is constitutional,
British Columbia will be deprived of its advantages. It may be vexatious to, have te
go from one court to another defending legislation, but governimentAs have to do that at
timnes. We have been represented before the
Privy Couneil on manyr occasions. In many
instances in connection with social legislation
we have felt that, opinion was not unanimons
as to the -cons tuti onali ty of our enactment,
ti
and we have had a reference to the Supreme
Court before the law was put into force. This
Act bas 'been applicd withont any snch reference having been made, yet my rigbt honourable friend denies the rigbt of any province or
indiviýdual to eentest it before the courts. I
think we shouki 'be very ýcareful before we
adopt the principle involvedin, this Bill 1.14.
With respect to the Ijnemploment InLqurance Bill of this session, my rigbt bonourable
frienýd has: admitted that it may or snay not
be upheld if suibmitted to the tribunale, including the Privy Council. That im.plies he
wonld net be very mucli surprised if it were
tested one of these days. W-e must face the
possi.bility of ail legisIation being opposed
hefore the courts. Surely it will not be said
that every time a Provincial Governmcnt
opposes any of our legislation we shall be
called upen to. pa.ss sncb a Bill as this one

operation, and my information is that it cooperated up to a certain stage. I come now
to that stage.
It appears that in the application of one
Copela.nd in ithe Sumas Valley to come under
the Act a decision was finally arrived at by
the board of review. There was the usual
variety of debts, including a debt due the Government of the province for arrears of taxes.
I enphasize the fact that there was a debt
for arrears of taxes. I submit to this House,
though it is not very pertinent to the debate,
that compromising of a debt for arrears of
taxes is fnot interference with the right to tax.
The Provincial Government can tax to its
heart's content, and its taxation is no:t affected
by the Act. But an effort was made to compromise on taxes that had become a debt.
What happened? The board of review of
British Columbia, in putting its imprimatur
upon a settlement, de.cided that all interest
and penalties due on this debt to the province shoulid be written off; that ithe Government should get its -taxes, but no interest nor
penalties. Su'ch is the extent of the sacrifice
to be made by ithe province. Then the board
of review provided for payment over a period
of years by annual instalments of $469.34. As
soon as this compromise was effected the
Provincial Government instituted proceedings
to have the courts declare that the enitire Act
was ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada.
Hon. Mr. KING: And you withdrew from
the field.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Certainly, we
withdrew. Is British Columbia complaining
that we withdrew? I thought the province
wanted wha.t it asked for. Apparently all it
wanted was a lawsuit.
Hon. Mr. KING: No; I think my right
honourable friend is hardly fair. If he will
read the correspondence between the Premier
of British Columbia and the federal Minister
of Finance he will find that the province
contended it should make its own adjustments
-as it was doing from time to time-with
those who owed the province on loans and
taxes. The Provincial Government also contended that it was not within the jurisdiction
of the Dominion Government to interfere.
That is the position of the province, and I
think it is a fair position.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is another way of putting it.
The provincial
authorities said: "We will not let this Act
affect us. When a debt is due us we will
decide what we will collect.
We will not
permit a board of review to make any adjust-

459

ment. We will start a lawsuit and ask the
courts to declare the Act ultra vires of the
Parliament of Canada." This the Provincial
Government proceeded to do. It secured an
interim injunction in the courts of the province, restraining the operation of the Act.
Why should the Provincial Government coinplain if it is allowed to have a Pyrrhic victory
-if the "enemy," as the Provincial Government seeks to describe us, withdraws from the
field? We said: "This is what you want. We
will give it to you."

from the sovereign power of this DominionHon.
that.

Mr. KING:

You will

agree

with

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think it
does. I ask my honourable friend to note
that point.
The Government of British
Columbia may differ from us in other matters
and we may say, "We have authority to speak
for the province as well as you have'"; but
when it comes to a question of what is the
sovereign power of British Columbia as a
province, as distinguished from our sovereign
power as a federal state, are we not bound to
assume that the Provincial Government speaks
for British Columbia and knows what the
province wants?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But each provincial government can treat federal legislation in the same way.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I know
British Columbia says: "We want that
authority. We do not want you to exercise
it."
Hon. Mr. KIN'G: Oh, no. British Columbia
says: "We have the authority to collect our

SENATE

taxes, and you cannot come in and reduce
them." That is all the province says.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: It is a very important
one.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Let me read
the writ issued by British Columbia. This is
a paragraph of the laim made by the province, a claim so far granted by the courts:
That the defendants, purporting to aet as a
board of review for the Province of British
Columbia under the provisions of the Farmers'
Creditors Arrangement Act, being chapter 53
of the Statutes of Canada, 1934, and amending
Acts and the rules and regulations passed
thereunder, are acting without lawful authority,
as the said Act is ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is. The
other provinces have said: "We are quite
ready for the Act; we want it. We are not
going to dispute your jurisdiction." Have we
the rigbt to ignore the other provinces in that
reasonable request? I do net think we have.
No one imagines that British Columbia is the
only province with loans which may be compromised under this Act. I think Ontario has
$45,000,000 worth of loans; and Ontario is
submitting to the measure. All those loans
are owed by borrowers in distress and come
under the purview of the Act. In Aliberta it is
the saýme. In Manitoba there are all classes
of debts owing the province. There are
arrears of taxes galore in every province.
The honourable member from Queen's said-

That is a terrible responsibility to take.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But if Ontario
takes the same attitude what will the Government do?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We shall decide what to do when we get there. But we
are not eager to go into British Columbia
against the will of the province in respect of
bankrup-tcy proceedings; not at all. It may
be we shall have to with respect to other laws
in order te make those laws effective e'lsewhere. British Columbia says, as in this
writ: "We want to occupy this ground, we
want te perform this service. You get off
the carpet; you are ultra vires." Surely,
then, British Columbia cannot -complain if
we do get off. We are net at all impairing
our power to enforce the Act elsewhere. It
is just as effective in the other provinces as it
ever was. We are only doing what British
Columbia asks us to do, not a whit more.
Now, suppose we have gone too far in our
argument. Let us assume that instead of
saying the Government of British Columbia
may injure its own province in this manner.
we ought to dec'lare that in a field which we
believe to be within our jurisdiction we should
do what we think is right, no matter what
British Columbia wants. I find it hard to
state such a case, because I do net think it is
sound. The British Columbia Government
must speak for British Columbia on these
matters, and if we can exercise what we think
is our jurisdiction elsewhere and keep out of
British Coluimbia we ought to do it; and we
are doing it. But on the assumption I have
stated, aside altogether from the question of
letting the British Columbia. Government
speak for the province, would the Dominion
Government be acting in the interest, say, of
all Canada in entering into litigation on the
subject of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act? Should the Parliament of Canada
imperil this Act by carrying the case to the
Privy Council?

in bankruiptcy, you have to go ahead and

When the Bill wcnt to the flouse of Commons with our amendment the Prime Minister took objection on the ground that what

believed, should die, on the 3Oth of April, 1934,
then on the SOth of April, 1936, then on the

FARMERS' CREDITORS

REPORT 0F COMMITTEE

-Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM presented, and
moved concurrence in, the report of the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce on Bill 114, an Act relating to the
application of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934, in the Province of British
Columbia.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There are
some changes of order and verbiage, which we
think improve the measure, but the main
change makes the Bill effective on proclamation by the Governor in Council. This gives
the Government of British Columbia an
opportunity to determine what course it
chooses to pursue.
Han. Mr. DANDURAND: And perhaps it
giveS the central Government the advantage
of a second sober thought.
Righit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No; the
Federal Government is not given by the Bill
any chance to change its mind at ahl. It has
not asked for such a chance.

RADIO BROADCASTING BILL
REPORT 0F COMMI11TEE ON MESSAGE PROM
GOMMONS

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM presented, and
moved concurrence in, the report of the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce on a message fromn the House of Comnmons disagreeing with the amendment made
by the Senate to Bill 99, an Act respecting
Radio Broadcasting.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, the action now recommended by
the committee is what was foreshadowed
yesterday. The whole background and history
of this matter have been reviewed, and no
repetition is needed.
Upon being satisfied as to what was the
actual intention of the other House, such
being presumably the intention of the Government. this House took no exception at all to

463

the course which had been determined upon.
If on this or any other occasion il feit there
were adequate reasons for disagreement with
the policy which the other House bad em-

hodied in a Bill, though such Bill had Government sanction, the Senate would not hesitate
to resist and rejeet, or amend as it saw fit,
any such measure.

There are circumstances surrounding this
matter which I thin-k make it my duty to
say that the powers and prerogatives of the
Senate respecting amendment or rejection of
any measure which comes to it from the other
flouse, except possibly a measure having to
do with the raising of taxes, are ample and
complete, and are not at aIl affected by the
fact that the measure embodies a policy of
the House of Commons or the Government.
That principle is implicit in our Constitution.
With possibly the exception men'tioned, the
powers of this body are independent of,
co-ordinate with, and in every respect equal
to those of the other Chamber.
Hon. Mr. D'ANDURAND: I feel that il
is necessary to say but a word. I belie-ve the
right honourable gentleman voices the view
of the Senate of to-day as well as the Senate
of the past. The position of this Chamber
was wellI laid down in a resolution it passed
una-ni-mously, which emanated from a comnmittee presided over by the late Senator
W. B. Ross, of Halifax.
The motion was agreed to.
MESSAGE TO COMMONS

Right Hon. Mr. M'EIGHEN: I move:

That a message be sent to
Commons to retu'rn Bill 99, an
Radio Broadcaigting, and to
House that the Senate do flot

the House of
Act respeoting
acquaint that
insist on their

previous amendànenýt, but have substituted
another amendmient in lieu thereof, to which
they desire their concurrence.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: May 1 ask the right
ho-nourable gentleman whether a conference
has been held between the two Houses with
respect to the amend>ment?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. We have
not reached the point where a conference
would be necessary hecause of disagreesment,
for do I anticipate that we shaîl. The Senate,
having ascertained the Administration's in~ten-tion, which was in no way given effect to
in the Bill as sent to us, bas no exception
to take to that intention, and complies therewith.
The moition was agreed 10.

DOMINION TRADE AND INDUSTRY

COMMISSION BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM presented, and
moved concurrence in. the report of the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce on
Bihl 86. an Act to establish a Dominion Trade
and Industry Commission.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, the measure which is now reported
from committee is one of far-reaching conseThe committee would have prequence.
ferred, had it been possible, to give not a
few hours, but days to a critical and thoroughgoing review of every clause and every
principle embodied in the Bill. I am not
finding fault because the measure has come
to us at this time. We have not been unoccupied during the previous weeks of the
session; and I know it is practically impossible
for any Government to have its legislation
sufficiently advanced to prevent some crowding at the end of the session. These things
are beyond the control of the Governrrent;
they depend enitirely upon the pliay of various
forces, largely in the other House.
However, the committee bas within the
limited time available studied the Bill as
carefully as possible, and a lengthy series of
a.mendments, twenty-two in all, have been
made. They are not of a quality to do what
is sometimes casually and often stupidly described as emasculating the measure. They
are designed to make it practicable and less
vulnerable to attack upon its constitutionalitv. Some of them are more or les improvements, or believed to be improvements,
in verbiage. The more important ones I will
now refer to.
The Bill provides that in the case of agreements as regards dealing with commodities
approval may be applied for, and it may be
given to agreements which appeal to the
Commission, as being fair and reasonable and
not against the public interest. Always in the
history of our law it has been recognized that
agreements may exist, but if they operate
against tbe publie interest they are banned by
law and their authors are punishable. What
the Bill does, which was not done before, is to
permit of an imprimatur, a sort of sanction,
being given to agreements by this Commission. after investigation. and to provide
that thereafter the essence of the agreements
shall be published. We provide that such may
be done in relation to an existing as well as a
contenxplated agreement. I do not dou'bt
it was intended so to provide, but the original
Bill said applicants had to establish that there
Rigit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

was a state of demoralization in the industry
by reason of the absence of an agreement.
That could be established only where there
was no agreement; therefore no existing agreement could enjoy the benefit of the Bill. In
making this important extension we carry out
what we think must certainly have been the
intention of the draftsman. No one can be
compelled to get the sanction of the Commission, but anyone who does not get it is
liable at any time to penalty under the Combines Investigation Act sbould it be shown
that his agreement or arrangement is against
the public interest.
The Bill provides for the appointment of a
Director of Public Prosecutions. We have
continued this feature of the measure, though
with some misgivings. The committee was
desirous, not that there should be no such
Director, but that he should not be given a
kind of distinct, separate and novel rank or
dignity. which, because of the psychological
effect of the statute, would likely lead to the
establishment of a new Department of Justice. All things considered, it was felt advisable to retain the position, but provision
was inserted to insure that he, like ail other
factors in the administration ,of justice, should
be an element, a feature, a part of the Department of Justice itself. His powers and
duties are fully defined in the Bill.
Provision is contained in the measure for a
Canada Standard, something new in our law.
It does not say that any public authority
authorizes the imprinting of "Canada Standard," or the initials "C.S.," on any article
produced; it states that anyone producing
goods of a certain standard may use the brand
or mark, but if he uses it on any article which
does not come up to the standard he will be
liable to prosecution. It is hoped that the
term "Canada Standard" will become universally understood, and that it will be the
objective of producers in this country to have
their goods of such a quality as to be eligible
for this mark. By way of amendment to the
provisions as regards marking of different
classes of articles, we provide that exceptions
may be made by the Commision where such
marking is impossible.
Now I come to one of the outstanding
features of the measure. The Commission
receives complaints respecting unfair practices
in trade and may investigate the same. Then
after investigation-I am now referring to
the Bilil in its amended form as it comes
from the committee-the Commission.
(a) if of opinion that the practice complained
of constitutes an offence against any Dominion
law prolibiting unfair trade practices-

JULY 4,1935
-and
there are, I should say, about fifteen
such laws-may order and require all persons who are
parties or privies ta such offence te cease and
desist from further continuation of such
practices.
This is the first remedy. It is a new one,
and has been put in by the Committee on
Banking and Commerce. There seems to be
no doubt as te the powers of this Parliament
te enable the Commission to issue such an
order, which is felt to be a logical preliminary
te more drastic action to be taken later on
if in a -proper case the order is net obeyed.
What else may the Commission do if it
is of opinion that the practice complained of
constitutes an offence? The Commission,
(b) if of opinion as aforesaid may communicate the complaint, and such evidence, if any,
in support thereof as is in

t-he possession of

the Commission, te the Attorney-General of
Canada with a recom.mendation that such
parties or privies to such offence be prosecuted for violation of the applicable Act. The
Attorney-General of Canada, if he concurs in
such recommendation, may refer it. with the
complaint and evidence, if any, either to the
Director of Public Prosecutions or te the
Attorney-General of the province within which
the offence is alleged te have been committed,
for such action as may seem te be appropriate
in the circumstances.
The amendments following are of the nature
of improvements in the phraseology, but I
come te another of considerabile consequence.
Turning our minds for the moment to the
Criminal Code, we find that section 498 of
the Code is analogous te the penalizing and
offence-creating section of the Combines Investigation Act, which is the section dealing
with combines antipathetie te the public
interest and providing punishment for them.
In the Bill te amend the Criminal Code,
which will be reported te this House shortly,
a section is added as 498 A. This creates
a new series of offences. The first is an
offence committed by the act of arbitrarily
charging different prices te business competitors purchasing a like quality and quantity
of goods. Secondly, it makes it an offence
te adopt, for the sake of elliminating competition, a policy of lowering prices and of
charging different prices in different sections
of the country. As honourable members will
realize, the conception of criminality as attached te conduct of this kind is distinctly a
new conception. Such conduct has hitherto
been regarded-if net universally, all but universally-as of the very essence of business.
But the Price Spreads Commission, from
evidence given before it, was convinced that
real evils resulted from the freedon of business people in this respect. Instances were

465

brought te the surface which impelled the
Commission te report in faveur of some such
provision as is contained in this new clause
in the Criminal Code. The Senate committee
did net alter at all the phraseology of subsection 498 A, in dealing with the amendments te the Code. But the committee fel<t
that since we are now te have a judicial body
supervising, controlling, enforcing the law with
respect te all matters of fair trade practices,
it was only right and sound .that there
should be no prosecution under this new subsection of the Code exoept with the written
consent of this judicial body, that is, the
Dominion Trade and Industry Commission.
Such a safeguard appeared te the committee
te be essential; and I am grateful te those
who opposed the measure te the extent of
bringing the committee te realize that that
safeguard had te be inserted. It ought te
be accepted, and I think it will be. I should
dread the consequences if it were net.
This pretty well covers the amendments.
I feel I can assure the House that there is
nothing of importance I have net reviewed.
The motion was agreed te.

Criminal Code.
He said: Honourable senators, I hope my

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, this is the measure te which I referred when on my feet a moment ago. The
same remarks apply te the committee's consideration of this Billl as were addressed te
the House with respect te the last measure.
The importance and perhaps the drastie
character of the amendments te the Code
were such that we certainly should have liked
te examine them and hear representations
over a more extended period. Had that been
possible we should feel more confident of
the report now being made. Nevertheless, the
Bill certainly has not been sketchily or hastily
deait with.

REVISED
EDITION

466

SENATE

I do not know that I can exactly interpret
some amendments with regard to race meets,
but my understanding is that they impose
the same restrictions as to time and number
of days in the year during which trotting
and pacing meets may be held as are now
imposed in the case of running meets, and
they give similar rights.
The next amendment is an attempt to
define and prohibit the new so-called chain
letter scheme of getting rich quickly. I believe "chain letter scheme" is not a correct
appellation to apply. It is not easy to say
just what is the essence that makes this
scheme an offence, but if honourable members
will read the amendment they will appreciate
its purpose.
Another very important feature of the
measure creates several new offences. It is
designed to help the enforcement of the
minimum wage law and the hours of work
law. The committee found it necessary to
make some amendments. The first offence
wili now be described as follows:
(a) employs a person at a rate of wage less
than the minimum wage rate fixed by any law
of Canada.
It read originally, "fixed by law or any competent authority." I do not know there is
much difference in effect between the two
forms, but the amended wording is better.
It will be recalled that where we ourselves
fix a minimum wage rate we say that if the
minimum wage rate fixed by provincial law
is greater, then it shall be the minimum rate:
so we make it a Dominion law. This amendment does not, so far as I can sec, change
the effect, but I think it is wise not to leave
ourselves in the position of creating penalties
applicable to a provincial statute. If we
can make our statte a sort of re-enactment
of the provincial statute, all right, but while
the liaw remains provincial we are not on
very safe ground from a constitutional standpoint if we seek to attach penalties. Futhermore, I do not think we are on very sensible
ground.
The British North America Act
gives the provinces power to deal with these
matters and create offences with respect to
them. If the provinces have donc so, is it
right that we should come along and say,
"You have created the offences, but you do
not know how to provide penalties, and we
are going to show you"? That is the reason
why this paragraph is amended.
The other offences are described as follows:
(b) falsifies any employrnent record with
intent to deceive;
(e) punches any tine clock with intent to
deceive;
(d) pots the wages of more than one
Right Hon. Mr. MEI.GHEN.

employee in the same envelope with intent to
evade the provisions of any law of Canada;
(e) employs any child or minor person contrary to any law of Canada.
We know the law of Canada covers these
matters, and we feel we should confine ourselves to enforcing our owin law. We have
left out there two clauses of the original
Bill.
Hon. Mr. HORSEY: Three.
Right Hon. Mir. MEIGHEN: I will give
the tiwo. Then if there is another I should
like to be reminded.
The first clause made it a crime to permit
any person to work beyond the time stated
in any law in this country, and imposed a
penality of $5,000. It is one thing to say,
"You must not deliberately employ a person at less than the minimum wage rate."
An employer can avoid that, and he can be
expected to avoid it and, to knew he will
incur a heavy penalty if he does net. But
I do net know how the most righteous man
on earth could himself prevent a person
from working overtime. Suppose a fellow
is fired for some good reason, but before the
time comes for him to leave he deliberately
works overtime: why, he can very quickly,
and with terrible results, get back aýt the
man who fired him. So it was feilt it would
be most dangerous legislation, and legislatien that the best of citizens coulid net
possibly live up .to.
The other clause was left out on purely
constitutional grounds. It was an offence te
make any deduction from any employee's
wages for any purpoise not warranted by law
unless such deduction has been approved first
by a competent public authority.
There, if anywhere, you are definitely on
the ground of civil rights. Suppose a factory has a rule that if an employee causes
damage he must make .it good, and suppose
the fa.ctory management frankly lives up to
that rule and deducts the amount of damage
from the pay; then by this paragraph we
should be saying, "You have no right to do
that." The province can say it. But where
is there anything within the limits of our
power to enable us to say it? I do not know
where there is. We considered that was distinctly a matter of civil rights.
The Bill also contained an omnibus paragraph.

I may say I am very glad indeed that this
provision is being made for the fishermen. It
has always been a very difficult matter to
meet their peculiar necessities, by reason of
the absence in their case of special securities
such as the farmer must possess. I am sure
that if the money is carefully loaned no one
will begrudge the fishermen the three years'

The BiH provides for a board similar to the

Loans are to be made on the security of first

collateral which the board may choose to

A message was received from the House of

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. The
Bill contains appropriate provisions against
imposition by provincial authorities of prior
eharges, and for repayment of loans. The
Governor in Council is given control over the
issue price of bonds, but the principle the
board has to follow is to fix the purchase
price at such a figure that the bonds will sell
to the public at par. Under the provisions of
the Bill trust companies, loan companies and
insurance com>panies may purchase these
bonds. I think they might wel do so, as they
are virtually Government bonds.

will not mean the severance of those tics which
have so happily been established between Your

During your tern of office Your Excellency
bas never spared yourself in your efforts to
secure accurate and intimate knowledge of all

Yeu have, accordingly. gained an understanding of our problems
and our possibilities, as profound as it bas

Your Excellency has been with us during a

You have seen the effects of
that depression on our national economy. Yeu

our national morale. Amidst the tribulations

l'occasion de la fin prochaine de vos relations

pour résultat la rupture ties liens si heureusement lié, entre Votre Excellence et notre pays
et son peuple.
Excellence, durant votre terme d'office, vous
n'avez jamais épargné vos efforts pour obtenir
une connaissance exacte et intime de toutes les
parties tie notre Dominion. Vous avez acquis,
en conséquence, une comnpréhension aussi profonde que sympathique de nos problèmes et de
nos ressources. Votre application assidue aux
affaires d'état, l'intérêt humain et profond que
vous avez manifesté pour les vastes entreprises
de notre peuple, vous ont conquis la chaude

affection de tous les Canadiens.

Vos encoura-

national. produiront leurs effets durant de longues années.
Votre Excellence a résidé parmi nous durant
une période de dépression économique mondiale
et de tension sociale. Vous avez été t,émoin des
effets de cette dépression sur notre régime écononique. Cependant, vous avez vu son ii p uissauce à détruire le moral de la nation. Parmi
les difficultés de la misère économique, de même
que durant l'épreuve sévère de la guerre, le Canada est resté ferme, et il est toujours prêt à
continuer sa marche en avant avec une volonté
et un courage nouveaux.
Nos expressions de regret pour le départ de
Votre Excellence seraient incomplètes en vérité. si ce regret ne s'étendait pas jusqu'à Son
Excellence, la Comtesse de Bessborough, dont la
grâce et le charme lui ont conquis dans tout le
Canada une affection qui est en même temps
profonde et générale.
Nous demaindons, Excellence, qu'à votre arrivée dans votre patrie, vous transmettiez à Sa
Majesté l'assurance de la ferme loyauté du Canada à la Couronne, de son affection pour le
Trône et le Roi. affection dont il a donné une
preuve frappante lors des fêtes récentes et
inoubliables qui ont accompagné le Jubilé d'argent de Sa Majesté.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The message
which this House has just received from the
House of Commons contains a request that
we unite with that House in an Address,
which has just been read by Ris Honour the
Speaker, to the retiring Governor General
of our country. Ris Excellency the Earl of
Bessborough. I am sure this House will meet

JULY 4, 1935
that request with an enthusiastic and unanimous affirmative.
During the seventy odd years of her history
Canada has been fortunate in the men
assigned to act in the exalted and responsible
capacity of Governor General of this Dominion. Though for many years such assignments were made on the recommendation of
Ris Majesty's immediate advisers, in accordance with the British tradition, that has not
necessarily meant assignments without the
concurrence or without the actual suggestion
of His Majesty's advisers in Canada. That
the consequence of the practice which has
grown up has been so fortunate for our country is indeed a matter of congratulation. We
have been more than usually fortunate
in the men who, one after the other, through
all the long years, have served our country,
and who, in so doing, have fallen in line with
our Constitution. Among their numbers Earl
Bessborough takes a prominent place in the
estimation of Canadians of all creeds and
classes.
Earl Bessborough comes of a family which
has been associated in a distinguished way
with the traditions and achievements of Great
Britain. If one studies the disposition of the
armed forces of Britain in the great conflicts
of the past, and reads the names of the
captains who have led those forces in the fieId
and on the sea, one will find mentioned in
connection with more than one great occasion
the name of Ponsonby. And 'here I think it is
not inappropriate to say, and I say it with
very keen pleasure, that there is found also
in places of note frequent and illustrious mention of the name of Byng.
Lord Bessborough has been our Governor
General for a space of five years--years of
great stress and anxiety, when, necessarily,
our people were centering their minds upon
practical matters and endeavouring to wrestle
with and solve baffling and oppressive problems. They have been years when less attention and less energy have been devoted to
affairs of ceremony than to great subjects of
policy and historic importance. Under these
conditions the office of Governor General may
not have been as pleasant as it would have
been had conditions been different, but
throughout his term the Governor General
has devoted every thought to the performance
of his task. He has trod carefully, though
confidently, and above all usefully, the path
of duty as laid down for him by the Constitution of our land. Never has he deviated
From that path. He will be able on returning
to his native land to say to his Sovereign
that he has done his part.

469

In this great work His Excellency the
Governor General has been ably seconded,
always with grace and dignity, by the Countess
of Bessborough, and I am sure all will
enthusiastically concur in the reference in the
Address to the universal appreciation of the
grace and charm which have characterized
the Countess of Bessborough in the discharge
of her exalted task.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, bear.

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
Honourable senators, I have listened with interest
to the message of the House of Commons,
just read by fis Honour the Speaker, and
have followed the remarks of my right honourable friend in relation to it.
I may say that by reason of my home being
at a distance, and of my appearing here simply
to attend the sessions of the Senate, I have
not had, like my honourable friend, an intimate contact with the representative of His
Majesty at Ottawa.
Nevertheless. I have
beheld him objectively and from afar, and I
have been pleased to note that in his public
appearances from the Atlantic to the Pacifie,
and in his utterances in addressing publie
audiences, Ris Excellency has in no way fallen
below the high standard of his predecessors.
It is no easy task for the representative
of Ris Majesty to one of the Dominions to
direct his steps and express his thoughts in
such a way as to avoid alluding to questions
or invading fields on which political parties
are divided, and thus to escape becoming the
subject of public discussion. I ha;ve known
of Governors General who were 8o fearful of
making a false step that they would not
address even a board of trade or unveil a
monument without first submitting the text
of their remarks to their chief advisers.
Whatever may have been the advice received by Lord Bessborough, he may feel
that throughout the term of his office he has
discharged his duties to the thorough satisfaction of the Canadian people.
Lord Bessborough in the performance of
his duties has had by his side a lady who
comes from across the Channel, a lady of
French descent, who has been not only a
helper but an ornament to Government House.
My honourable friend from Essex (Hon.
Mr. Lacasse) has raised the point that this
Address should go fonward to Their Excellencies in both French and English. Under
our Constitution that is but fitting. But the
fact that Their Excellencies represent the
high civilization of both Great Britain and
France, and that either of them can address
either a French audience or an English

SENATE

audience in its native tongue with equal grace
and facility, makes it doubly fitting.
I join with my right honourable friend in
regretting the departure of Their Excellencies.
I hope the link which has been forged will
be strong enough to cause them to return, so
that wec may have the privilege and pleasure
of again welcoming them to this country.
Right Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM:
What I have to say may be considered as
out of place, deviating from the aine which
should be taken in the Senate of Canada in
speaking on this Address. I concur in everything that has been said about His Excellency by the two leaders, but in speaking
of Her Excellenecy I want to go further.
What I would mention is not so much a
national service on her part as a philanthropic one: I refer to the interest she has
always shown in the intimate affairs of the
ordinary people.
Her Exoellency, by virtue of bei;ng the
wife of the Governor General, has been the
Honorary President of the Victoriani Order
of Nurses, an organization of which I have
the honour to be President, and one whicb
I think is of great importance to Canada.
Her Excellency has not been an idile Honorary President. She has taken a very active
part in the work of that organization,
attentding ils executive sesions very regularly, and visiting the members in the various
branches throughout the Dominion of Canada. In this way she has contributed, very
liargely I think, not only te the well-being
of ýthe ýpeople affected, but aliso to the success
of the representatives of His Majesty in this
Dominion.
I think honourable gentlemen will all agree
with me-I know the married men awillthat we married men are largely what our
wives make us; and I do net think I am
going too far when I say that in my opinion
the success of His Excellency as Governor
General of Canada is attributable in large
part to the presence of Her Excellency, his
gracious consort.
The motion was agreed te.
It was moved by Right Hon. Mr. Meighen,
seconded by Hon. Mr. Dandurand, that His
Honour the Speaker sign the Address on
behalf of the Senate.
The motion was agreed te.

DISCUSSION

ON

PRACTICE

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable senators, I crave the indulgence of the
House for a few minutes to discuss a matter
of current interest. I had intended' to do
so when the Orders of the Day were called,
but there were no Orders of the Day.
Some time ago an honourable member on
this side put a question to the right honourable leader of the House with respect to
the time that might intervene be.tween dissolution of Parliament and an appeal to the
people. My 'right honourable frien-d stated
that our Constitution was mute on this subject, but I ventured to assert that there was
a tradition to guide us. I had a vague recollection of procedure which was followed at
the time of iprorogation and which I thought
was probably based upon the British practice.
At the end of every session the Canadian
Parliament is prorogued or continued for
forty days. Our Senate Manual, at page
46, contains the form of statement which the
Speaker makes when we prorogue, and which
it was my d'uty te pronounce when I occupied
the Chair. The Speaker says:
It is His Excellency the Governor General's
will and pleasure that this Parliament be
of
prorogued until............the........day
next (40 days), to be here holden;
.............
prorogued
and this Parliament is accordingly
until the..........day of............next.
This presupposes that Parliamuent is allways
either in session or adjourned to a given date.
In Bourinot, second edition', page 269, it
is stated:
Tie sunmoning, prorogation. and dissolution

of Parliament in Canada are governed by
English constitutional usage. It is the practice
to prorogue Parliament for intervals of forty
days.
Since Parliament prorogues or suspends its
sittings to a dnte net beyond forty days,
it is logical that after dissolution an election
should be held forthwith. May, 13th edition,
at page 53, points out that in Great Britain
The Parliansent is summoned by the King's
writ or letter issued out of Chancery, by advice
of the Privy Council. By the 7 and 8 William
III. chapter 25, it was required that there
shall be forty days between the teste and the
return of the writ of sunnons: and after the
union with Scotland this period was extended
to fifty days, such being the period assigned in
tie case of the first Parliament of Great
The Meeting of
Britain after tise Union.

JULY 4,1935
Parliament Act, 1852 (15 and 16 Victoria,
chapter 23), enacted that the time between the
proclamation and the meeting of Parliament
miglit be any time not less than thirty-five
days; and this period was red'ued to twenty
clear dlays by the Reipresentation of the People
Act, 1918.
Under the Great 'Charter of Ring John forty
days were assigned for this period.
There is throughout the country an
erroneous impression that the Seventh Parliament of Canada ended in April, 1896, by
effluxion of time. Since 1867 no0 Canadian Parliament has been teïrminated by effluxinn of
time. The Parliament of 1896 would have becorne functus officio if it had lasted until the
25th of April, but it was prorogued two days
earlier, on the 23rd, to the 2nd of June. This
would implly that an appeal to the people
couki have been made and a new Parliament
elected before that date. On the 24th of
April Pardiament was dissolved, and the
senators and members of the House of Gommons were "discharged from their meeting
and attendance until the 2nd day of June
next," Also on the 24th of April there was
a proclamation for the issuing of writs, which
were return-able on the l3th of July. As
honourabie members know, the election took
place on the 23rd of June, that is to, say,
two mon-ths aïfter the proclamation. On the
24th of April another proclamation was issued,
calling the buse of Commons to meet on
the lSth of July for the dispatch of business.
And on July 13 there was a proclamation
which continued prorogation to the l9th of
August and sum'moned Parliament for the
dispatch of business on that date.
My conclusion would be that under our
British parliamentary institutions the delay
between dissolution of Parliament by the
Governor General, or by effluxion of time,
and the summoning of the people to, the
pois, must he as short as possible, in order
that there may be in existence a Parliament
which is either sitting or prorogued to a
certain date.
At -six o'clock the Senate took recess.
The Senate resumed at 8 o'ýclock.

INTERNAL ECONOMY AND
TINGENT ACCOUNTS

CON-

PAY OF SENATE EMPLOYEES

Hon. E. S. LITTLE: Honourable senators,
on June 11 the Standing Committee on Internal Economy and Contingent Accounts reported to the Senate on three or four matters
which had had the committee's consideration
for some time. The third paragraph of the
report recommended:
That the Senate doormen who on April 1,
1935, had a Senate service of fifteen years or
more be paid at the rate of $5 per day. and
that the pay of doormen with less than fifteen
years' Senate service be inereased to $5 per
day on their completing fifteen years' Senate
service.
This recommendation was made in order to
put the doormen of the Senate on a parity
with those of the other House. I find that
owing to the way in which this clause was
worded these men are not getting the increased salary which the committee intended.
I therefore propose, seconded by the honourable senator from Edmonton (Hon. Mr.
Griesbach):
That the sixth report of the Standing
Committee on Internal Econony and Contingent Accounts be amended by substituting
the words "fourteen years" for the words
"fifteen years" weore they appear in paragra.ph
three of the said report.
lon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I have much
pleasure in seconding the motion.
Has the Senate

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If the Senate is
agreeable, the motion can be altered by the
Clerk so as to fit in with our procedure.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: We made a mistake of
one year.
The report should have read
"fourteen" instead of "fifteen" years.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

longer merely a report. We can rescind its
adoption, and then present it in another form
for adoption.

We cannot

An error was

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I think the matter
ought to be dealt with in some way. I sat
on the committee when the motion was
passed, and I think all the members assumed
that the Senate doormen would, as from April
1, get the same rate of pay as is received by
similar employees in the House of Commons.
During the session we have passed Bills dealing with fair wages, contemplating equal wages
in rateable trades, and so forth,, and I think
it would be a great mistake net to put our
doormen on the same footing as the doormen
of the other House. Our employees are just
as capable and faithful as the doormen of the
Commons, yet their pay is 50 cents below the
Commons rate. I think the right honourable
leader of the House is correct in saying that
possibly action cannot be taken in just the
way this motion proposes. Nevertheless, I
lhink it should be taken in order to give
effect to what I am quite sure the Internal
Economy Committee believed was going to
be done when the matter was dealt with on
June 11.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: We are to understand, then, that.if this motion carries the
procedure suggested will be followed and
effeet will be given to the report.
That is, the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
motion will contain a rescission of the resolution of the Senate, and will be followed by
an amendment.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: And the increase will date from the 1st of April this
year.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The granting
of the increase will protect us from the effect
of some of our own legislation. We might
be in a bad way if we paid less than a fair
wage.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: A penalty of
85,000.

JULY 5, 1935
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The employees
themselves might institute proceedings.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it the pleasure
of the House to adopt the motion on the
understanding that the recommendation is to
be amended?
The motion was agreed to.
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bill 98, an Act to provide
for the Constitution and Powers of the Canadian Wheat Board.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN moved
the second reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable members, as we all
know, this Bill has been under review for a
long time in a special committee of the
other House, and differs substantially from the
one originally introduced. I have studied the
Bill carefully. It provides in effect for the
continuation, by the new board which is
created, of the control now exercised by Mr.
McFarland and bis staff in respect of the
carry-over of Western grain. The new board
will be empowered to purchase grain, or rather
wheat-for the Bill no longer applies to other
grains than wheat, except in a sense which I
shall mention in a moment, and it applies only
to the wheat of the four Western Provinces.
The board may purchase only from the producer. The term "producer" is carefully
defined. If this Bihl passes, the Commission
will no longer be able te purchase in the
market, as it bas done in the past for stabilization purposes.
I cannot help saying that personally I have
grave doubt as to whether the board can
function without wider powers than those
given te it; but, as this matter bas been
very thoroughly considered, I do not know
that I shall press for a change in the Bill in
this regard. I want te go on record, however,
as entertaining some doubt as te whether the
board will not, in some way, have te secure
wider powers.
As respects grains other than wheat, the
new board will not have power te purchase
or market except by special provision of the
Governor in Council.
The Bill provides for the payment of a
certain price te all producers upon sale of
grain te the board. A certificate will be given

473

te every producer entitling him te share, in
proportion te his deliveries, in any excess
which the board may have, after payment of
expenses, over and above what bas been
paid te producers for the same standard of
grain. In this respect the Bill conforms exactly
with the principle of the old Grain Act, with
whieh I had a great deal te do, and which established the Wheat Board in 1919. This measure really returns te the procedure of 1919 in
respect of the marketing of Western wheat.
The other features of the Bill are not difficult te understand. I think the drafting bas
been carefully done. But I believe it would
be wise for us te have a reference te our
Committee on Banking and Commerce. I
have stated te seme people, and I have no
doubt other honourable members have done
the same, that if they se desire they may make
representations te us. Everyone knows that
the Bill is just about ready te be passed; se if
any persons want te be beard they should be
here now. If the motion for second reading
is carried, I shall move for reference te the
Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
members of the Senate, I intend not te deal
with special aspects of this legislation, but
simply te express what I believe to be the
principles which should govern trade in general
and wheat in particular, since wheat is at
present under review. I take it for granted
that no one who is subject te the law of supply
and demand is entitled in normal times te any
special privilege. May I take a moment te
explain what I mean by normal times? I
understand as normal those periods, occurring
between fat years and lean years, when overproduction or under-production of any com-I
modity causes the world market price for that
commodity te fall or rise, and producers of
goods for export are affected by this rise or fall
in price. Now, while such normal conditions
exist there is no duty on the Government te
intervene and try te maintain or boost a price.
I think I have previously stated in this
Chamber that at the time when the surplus
coffee production of Brazil was about t be
thrown into the sea, I met in Paris a Brazilian
who produced coffee on a large scale. He declared he bad been lucky in having a wise
father, who constantly had impressed upon
him the necessity of selling according te the
world market price, and who before his death
saw te it that the business should be managed
by a man trained te believe in the same commercial principle. That old manager, who at
the time I heard the story was past eighty, iad
been allowed a free hand in disposing of the
crop. My informant said he was sleeping

JULY 5, 1935
bas come to my notice within the last few
days. It is so apposite to present-day conditions that it seems to me as if it had been
written yesterday. I shall translate it for the
benefit of honourable members generally,
though I should prefer to give the French
text, because a translation sometimes fails to
convey the spirit of the original. This is the
.article:
President Hoover after the New York
Exchange crash said: "It is nothing; our
economic fabric is healthy; prosperity is
around the corner."
But Mr. Hoover soon
had reason to wonder whether lie had net
mistaken the boum for normal times, and the
return to nornalcy for the accident.
The world presents a queer spectacle:
twenty million farmers who want to sell their
wheat to buy clothing and shoes, and twenty
million unemployed who would like to continue
to produce clothing and shoes in order te buy
wheat and bread.
Asia is starving. The
Occident, with the machine, is producing more
and more. The disorder is solely in the matter
of exchange. The United States refuses to
exciange with other countries.
It stands
behind a barricade. Why is exchange, which
represents ninety per cent of American activity,
paralysed in the home market? The reason is
that to-day the rural parts, like the cities,
are producing at full swing for unknown needs.
Wheat production for export has doubled since
the war. In industry the term for payment
of goods bought on the instalment plan was
extended to two years, -and autos, radios,
frigidaires, and other articles were sold on
that basis. This system was recently exemplified by an illustrated paper publLished, in
New York, which showed a father looking at
his new-born and saying, "In two years it will
be ours."
One hundred and twenty million pairs of
feet need yearly but three hundred million
pairs of shoes; the production is nine hundred
millions. Forty-four per cent of the population live on the land. They form a most
important group of the clients of industry.
They were the first te be hard hit-wheat at
$1.40 in 1925, at $1 in 1929, and down to 42
cents in 1933.
While natural products were losing threequarters of their market value industry was
producing at its maximum. Hence the crash
on the stock exchange. Then the State intervened: the Farm Board started buying so as
to maintain prices by withdrawing from the
market an important quantity of wheat and
restricting the play of supply and demand to
a diminished stock. The result was an increase in acreage.
I draw the attention of the Senate to this
fact: once you maintain or raise the price
of a commodity you do not discourage production; you encourage it, even though there
be already over-production.
Increased production forced prices down.
Two years were lost before the policy of
reducing production was adopted. The same
operation was carried on with cotton.

475

In the meantime what was industry doing?
President Hoover suggested that salaries and
wages be maintained. Industrial products were
not reduced in price and were not made
accessible to the rural population, whose purchasing power had diminished. Salaries and
wages remained fixed as per dogma; interest
on capital and rentals as per contract; taxes
as per necessity.
If manufactured goods had come down to
the same degree that natural products did,
exchange would have been carried on at the
low level, just as it previously had been
carried on at the higher level.
But the
deferring of the levelling process has prolonged
the crisis. Salaries and wages are double what
they were in 1913; the prices of natural
products have been cut in two. As a result,
in exchange for one hour of industrial labour,
the farmer must give four 'times as much of
his product as he gave before. The maintaining of the wage level is equivalent to
increasing it, and increases unemployment. To
increase customs duties is to widen the chasm
that must bu crossed before equilibrium is
restored.
All this gives one considerable food for
thought. If this over-prodùction is a permanent thing, as the Prime Minister cf Canada
says lit is, then it is normal, and if that is
so it is a 'condition which must be met. It
can be met, not by increasing prices, but
only by allowin(g the law of suipply and
demand throughout the world te come into
play. When it no longer pays to produce
an article nobody will be interesteed in increasing production. So, if it is true that we
have permanent overproduction in wheat,
I say we must face the situation like
sensible people, and I wonder if the conclusion is not to be drawn from some of
the premises in the article which I have read,
that sooner or later we must alIl agree to
accept a lower scale of living, as we did
fifty years ago.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, I do not think I take issue witb
the economics embodied in the article of the
distinguished French citizen which has just
been read. I do not think it follows, however, that we must return to the low standard of twenty-five or fifty years ago. There
is no need for that when, through the
mechanisms of our time, production has
attainedi such vast dimensions.
But the real subject before us is the
Grain Bill. It may be that Mr. MoFarland's
judigment in handling the very difficult task
which he had to perform did not prove
errorless. Much that might be said on the
other side is not said, beeause there is an
ellection at hand. Mr. McFarland was face!
with the fact thst wheat prices were the
lowest in five hundred years. Our West is
so dependent upon whest that a contempla-

476

SENA TE

tion of the condition resulting from thirtyfive-cent or twenty-five-cent wheat for one,
two or three years is staggering to the mind.
What has happened, after all, whether
there shouldi have been more sales or not,
is this. A surplus, for which Mr. MdFarliand
was not accountable, and for whieh this
Government certainly was not accountable.
had been carried forward from a time of
great over-production and unprecedentedily
low prices, from a time when its sale woulid
have meant virtual desolation in the West,
into a time wihen, though from the worl'd
standpoint there is still over-production, it
is in a less aggravated form, and, because of
better prices prevailing, it involves less hardship. There may be loss because of prior
purchases at higher figures, but that loss will
be vastly less than it would have been had
the grain been precipitated on the market
three or four years ago. That is all I wish to
say on the general issue.
We are establishing a board for two purposes. The first is to take over the surplus
stili on hand-and, in a sense, owned by the
country, inasmuch as our guarantee is behind
it at a certain figure-to take it over an'd
dispose of it to the best possible adivantage,
regard being had to alil economic conditions.
The second purpose is to handle the wheat
beinig produced while this process is under
way, and to pay tihe farmer what we actually
get for it. The farmer is asking for nothing.
He is to be paid only what the board rece-ives
for the grain less expenses.
There is point to what my honourable
friend savs in relation to the policy which the
new board should pursue in dealing not only
with the grain on hand, but also the grain
which comes to hand from the farmer. His
comment contains much wisdom, and I commend it to the new board.
One does not like to repeat the words "I
told you so," but I think I have a rigbt to say
that I am not, in even the remotest semse,
the parent of any of the wheat boards in the
Western Provinces which collected this surplus,
nor of the united board wbich ultimately came
to the verge of collapse. The board which
functioned under the Government in 1919 and
1920 did its work magnificently. I admit that
certain times were marked by excellent prices
for grain; but there was a sound principle
behind the scheme of operation, and it was
successful. It was bitterly critieized at the
time, and I suggest to my honourable friend
that be look up the files of that day of the
newspaper to which he pays such reverence
now. to sec what those criticisms were.
I
then offered Western Canada a board along
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

the lines of the one proposed in this very
Bill. My proposals were rejected by Western
Canada, as they were by the rest of the
Dominion, and the plan of provincial boards
was adopted and given legislative sanction.
Honourable senators whose memories are good
may recall the debates which took place in
another Chamber in 11922, 1923 and 1924. I
would suggest that when time hangs heavy
on their hands they might read what I said
in those days. I give the invitation cheerfully, feeling that it will not be accepted.
If it is, however, honourable gentlemen will
not hold me responsible for the policy adopted,
or the very dire and, I am afraid, disastrous
consequences which followed.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
CANADA-POLAND CONVENTION OF
COMMERCE BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 121, an Act respecting the
Convention of Commerce between Canada and
Poland, signed at Ottawa, July 3, 1935.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

lion. C. P. BEAUBIEN moved the second
reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable members, the right
honourable the leader of the Senate has been
called away; hence I am sponsoring this Bill.
I think I can say that the general lines of the
treaty now submitted to the House are the
same as have been followed time and again
in the past. It proposes the exchange of
commodities between Canada and Poland
under the most-favoured-nation clause.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not know
whetheir my honourable friend has read the
Bill and the convention.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: No, I have not.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If he had I was
going to put a few questions. As he bas not,
I would suggest that we suspend the sitting
of the Senate and proceed to the Banking
and Commerce Committee to deal with the
Grain Bill. When we report, perhaps in half
an hour, we can take up this convention.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Half an hour?
The bonourable gentleman is an optimist.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I shall put a
few questions to my honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien). He may be able to answer.
The convention is to be found in the schedule

JULY 5, 1935
on page 2 of the Bill. Article 1 says:
Articles produced or manufactured in Canada
shall not, on importation into Poland, be subjected to other or higher duties or charges
than those paid on the like articles produced
.or manufactured
in
any other foreign

country-

That applies to all goods. Then there is
this addition:
-at the same time the articles enumerated in
Schedule A to this Convention, produced or
manufactured in Canada, shall not, on importation into Poland, be subjected to higher duties
than those specified in the said Schedule and
shall be subjected to the lowest rates of duty
which Poland may grant to any other foreign
country on the like articles.
As I was not quite sure of the meaning of
the English text, I looked at the French version. I do not know whether the treaty was
written first in French and then translated
into English, or vice versa. The French version says:
Les articles produits ou fabriqués au Canada
ne seront pas soumis, à leur importation en
Pologne, à des droits ou taxes autres ou plus
élevés que ceux frappant les articles semblables
produits ou fabriqués en tout autre pays étranger; ainsi les articles énumérés à la liste AReturning for a moment to the English
version, I find it says, "at the same time
the articles enumerated in schedule A."
-annexée à lia présente convention, produits ou
fabriqués au Canada ne seront pas soumis, à
leur importation en Pologne, à des droits supérieurs à ceux spécifiés dans ladite liste, mais
seront soumis aux taux de d.roits les plus bas
que la Pologne pourrait accorder aux articles
semblables de tout autre pays étranger.
And the French version says in article 3:
Les articles produits ou fabriqués en Pologne ne seront pas soumis, à fleur importation
au Canada, à des droits ou taxes autres ou
plus élevés que ceux frappant les articles semblables produits ou fabriqués en tout autre pays
étranger; ainsi les articles énumérés à la liste
B annexée à la présente convention, produits
ou fabriqués en PologneDoes this convention apply to all goods
that may come from Poland to Canada or go
from Canada to Poland, irrespective of the
limitative schedules contained in the Bill?
I cannot clearly understand the phraseology
of article 1, in French:

but it seems to me, in view of the use of the
next word, "ainsi," that it is capable of the
interpretation that this treatment is restricted
to the products listed in schedule A.
From the English version I should gather
that the first part of the article is a general
declaration that all products of Canada shall
have the advantage of most-favoured-nation
treatment. But my honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien), who is familiar with the two
languages, will sec the clause in French is
somewhat equivocal, when it says, "ainsi les
articles énumérés à la liste A," instead of
"de même que," or "aussi bien que," or some
other phrase conveying the meaning that the
general clause covers those products which are

to receive special treatment, which means,
I surmise, that they will be subjected to a
duty somewhat below the general tariff. I
should like to have an explanation from my
honourable friend on this point.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:

With misgivings

I will express my own interpretation of article
1 and the schedule to which it refers. The
first part of article 1 says that products of
Canada on importation into Poland shall not
be subjected to any higher duty than is
imposed on like products of any other country.
Now, for certain products of Canada a duty
equal to that imposed on like products from
other countries might be prohibitive. That
is why schedule A provides definite rates of
import duties on Canadian goods therein menBut if a lower rate than that
tioned.
specified in any case is accorded with respect
to like goods from other countries, it shall
be applied to the Canadian importation. This
schedule is a protection.
If I understand
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
it correctly, all the products of Poland may
come into Canada under most-favoured-nation
treatment, and all our products may enter
Poland under the same treatment, but the
products mentioned in the schedules may
obtain a special advantage.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: That is my interpretation. I fail to see how any other interpretation can reasonably be given to this
article 1 in combination with schedule A.

Les articles produits ou fabriqués au Canada
ne seront pas soumis, à leur importation en
Pologne. à des droits ou taxes autres ou plus
élevés que ceux frappant les articles semblables
produits ou fabriqués en tout autre pays étran.
ger-

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I confess that
I found it difficult to hold to that view when

If the clause ended there it would mean that
most-favoured-nation
treatment would be
accorded by one country to the other with
respect to all goods passing between them;

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I think the experience of Canada, in connection with a
French treaty for instance, has shown that
we should be protected by definitely limnited

I read the French text. In my opinion the
word "ainsi" is a poor translation of the
English phrase "at the same time."

SENATE

duties on products with respect to which we
are particularly desirous of stimulating our
export trade. In this instance, although our
goods are to be admitted to Poland at rates
no higher than those which apply to like
goods from other countries, the Government
has thought it prudent to stipulate that in
any event the duties on products mentioned
in schedule A shall not be higher than are
there stated.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If this convention is meant to cover, and does cover, all our
products, and not only those mentioned in the
schedule, I would point out to my honourable
friend that iit is in line with the policy of the
previous Government of this country to grant
most-favoured-nation treatment ýto countries
with whom we make trade arrangements. We
are granting most-favoured-nation treatment
to Poland. I asked my honourable friend
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) if the convention
covered more than the goods referred to in
the schedule.
Hight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
does.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
convention?

Oh, yes, it

Is it a general

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: So that henceforth all goods entering ýthis country from
Poland will receive most-favoured-nation
treatment, and Poland will accord similar
treatment to goods imported from Canada. I
wehcome this convention, because in the first
place I am in favour of easing the conditions
under which goods may be exchanged, and,
secondly, because it is a tangible proof that
my earlier dream of the freedom of Poland
has come true. I do not know why I was
especially interested in the situation of Poland,
and I suppose I was not the only Canadian
similarly interested. I al.ways entertained the
nope that one day Poland, partitioned by
three surrounding empires, would be redeemed as a free nation. It was a great joy
for me when reading the Fourteen Points of
Woodrow Wilson ta notice that the Thirteenth
Point imposed upon Germany the obligation
of recognizing the freedom of Poland, and provided for the creation of the Polish Corridor
and the Free City of Danzig. I felt proud of
President Wilson's action, but I feel less proud
to-day of what I might call l'américain moyen.
I think it was Poincaré who spoke of "le
français moyen." I have been told that
"l'américain moyen" may be translated as
"the average A,merican" or "the mean American." Perhaps the second version would more

Mr. BEAUBIEN.

accurately express my view when I think of
the rejection of Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen
Points, one of which provided for the establishment of Polish independence. I a.m looking forward to better days when the United
States will play the role of arbiter in helping
to maintain peace throughout the world.
I give my whole-hearted support to this
convention.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAIIAM: May I ask a
question, which I think is apropos? Is the
right honourable leader of the House in a
position to give us any information as to the
negotiations between the United States and
Canada concerning a trade agreement?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am sorry I
can give no further information than this,
that I am not one of the negotiators. I do
not know in what position the negotiations
are.
The motion was agreed to, and the
was read the second time.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the third
reading of the Bill.
I draw the atHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
tention of the right honourable gentleman te
the queer wording of articles 1 and 3 in the

the convention has been signed, I suppose it
cannot be amended except by consent of both
parties.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.
COMBINES INVESTIGATION BILL
MESSAGE

FROM COMMONS

The Senate proceeded to consider a message from the House of Commons disagreeing
with certain amendments made by the Senate
ta Bill 79, an Act to amend the Combines
Investigation Act.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, I will deal with the latter amendment first; that is the one with reference to
the word "likely." When the Bill came to us
it provided that where the court found that
a merger operated or was likely to operate to
the disadvantage of the public, the merger
was to be dissolved and punishment ordered.
We changed the word "likely" to "designed,"
for the reason that "likely" imposes upon the
court a duty to estimate possibilities in trade
and commerce. But when "designed" is used
the court is required simply to determine the
intentions of the creator of the merger. A

JULY 5, 1935
person cannot be punished for what may
likely happen as a resuit of his action, unless
bis objective is the commission of a crime.
The word "designed" is used everywhere else
when we are dealing with criminal matters,
and I have no doubt at ail that it is the
proper word here. But the matter ia not of
first-rate importance, and for my part 1 am
prepared to yield to the other House in this
regard.
The other ameadment is of a different
character. It is flot correct to say that it is
the intent of the Combines Investigation Act
to prevent combines other than those in
respect of trade and commerce. There is a
complete misapprehension behind the message.
On looking at the Act you will see it is based
on our authority in respect of trade and commerce. That is the constitutional rock upon
which we place our feet when we are dealing
with this matter. The varions sections of the
Act are tied in with trade and commerce and
commodities. For example, it neyer wau intended to make it possible to deal with a
combine of the medical or the legal fratermity
in respect of their services.
lion. Mr. MURDOCK: Plumbing?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Nor with
plrumbers in respect of their services. It
lied jurisdiction over plrumibing because
piumbing suppâles come under trade and
commrerce. There is a fundamental arror
behind the message of the other lise,
and
therefore I move:
That the Senate do flot insist on the second,
but do insist on the firet aanendment.
lion. Mr. DANDURAN'D I have not the
Act befora me, but I am disposed to agree
with my right honourable friend's interpratation. I suppose the reasons which ha bas
given will be contained in the message to be
sent to the House of Gonmnons.
Right lion. Mr. MEIGHEN: I should like
to hear from the honourable senator from
Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdook). lie is dloser
to, the Act than any of us.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: As far as the word
"designed" is concerneci, as a layman I canflot imagine how it could- ever be proven
before the courts that certain persons, by
entaring into an arrangement which mi.ght
result in a merger or combine or monopoly,
designed to do certain things detrimental
to the public interest. Before I entered the
Chamber Mr. OlConnor, who bas been our
legal adviser on most of theee matters, cxplained tise position to me. I assume hie is
right and that the word "dasigned" would be

479

the better word. But personally it seems to,
me we should bear in mimd what is likely
to happen as a result of any combination or
merger.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is, what
will ýbe the affect?
lion. Mr. MURDOCK: Yes; what will, be
the culmination of the arrangement entered
into by certain persons. I repeat, I could
neyer understand how you could, prove in
court that Tom, Dick or liarry, by entering
into a certain arrangement, designed to do
this, that or the oth-er thing detrimental to
the public interest. But of course I woul
not set my judgment against that of legal
gentlemen.
I agree absolîutely with the position taken
by the right honourable leader of the Bouse
with regard to the first amendment rajected
by the other Bouse. To my mind it is nonsense to say that the Parliament of Canada
bas no business to deal with the plumbing
industry. True, Parliament cannot restrict
plumbers, but, as part of their general arrangement or combination with one another,
plumbers use products that coma within the
meaning of trade and commerce, and therefore thay must come under the provisions
of the Combines Investigation Act.
The motion was agreed to.
Right lion. Mr. MEIGBEN: The reason
for our insistance on the flrst amendment
miglit be axpressed in this form: that the
whole purpose of the Combines Investigation
Act relates to the restriction of trade and
commerce, and that the wording of the Bill
in many other particulars shows that that
purpose is carefully and strict-ly followed out.
The wording deviated only on this one point.
The Sanata adjourned during pleasure.
Mfter soma tima the sitting of the Senate
was resumed.

The lionourable the Speaker of the Senate,
in accordance with a resolution of the Senate
adapted on July 4, 1935, bas submitted to the
Civil Service Commission, through the Clark
of the Senate, a raquest that the position of
Law Clerk and Parliamentary Counsel of the
Senate should ha exempted from the operation

that the right of appointment of those officers

off Parliament should, if requested by such
honourable body or bodies, be released from

to the House
Civil Service Commission
respectively concerned;
In pursuance of this decision. and upon
request set out in the first paragraph hereof,
the undersigned Civil Service Commissioners
have the honour to recommend that under the
provisions of section 59 of the Civil Service
Act, the following position on the staff of the
Senate of Canada be excluded from the operation of the Civil Service Act in se far as the
appointment thereto is concerned; but that in
all other respects it should be subject to the
provisions of the said Civil Service Act, 1918,
and amendments, namely:
Law Clerk and Parliamentary Counsel
of the Senate
It is further reconmended, as required by
said section 59. that such position is to be
dealt with as follows, namely:
That the said position be fiiled by Resolution
of the Honourable the Senate.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved:
That William F. O'Connor, K.C., be appointed
Law Clerk and Parliamentary Counsel of the
Senate.
He said: Honourable members, only those
who have worked in close contact with Mr.
O'Connor through the greater part of several
sessions can realize the exceptional value of
his services; but I think I can say it is the
unanimous desire of this House that those
services should be availed of in the capa'city
mentioned throughout the entire year.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I concur in
the motion of my right honourable friend.
I think I can appreciate the value of the
services which Mr. O'Connor. by reason of
his qualifications, bas rendered to the Senate
in the past, and is destined to render in the
future. J should like, however, to ask my
right bonourable friend whether the classification of the position, as made by the
Senate and approved by the Civil Service
Commission, does not carry with it a rate
of remuneration quite independent of anything we can do.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think the
impression of mny honourable friend is correct.
However. I leave it to the Clerk to ascertain
the fact.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I am informed
that the position is classified, but that the
Civil Service Commission bas expressed the
desire that the Senate suggest what the salary
should be.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: May I ask the right

DOMINION TRADE AND INDUSTRY
COMMISSION BILL
MESSAGE

FROM COMMONS

The Senate proceeded Vo consider a message from the House oif Commons disaapeeing with certain amendments made by the
Senate to Bill 86, an Act to establish a Dominion Trade and Industry Commission.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I arn not sure Vhat I can
keep in mind L-very one of these exceptions
teoaur amendments, but I shall try te do se,
and I hope Voe reminded of any 'that 1
be
omit.
The first aska that the word "unanimous"
be inserted in an amendment made by the
Senate committee and adopted by this House.
Our committee had already agreed that the
same word should be inser.ted in another part
of the section. My recadlection is thst we
added a portion and t.hen did nlot carry this
word into it. I think, therefore, that we
should agree with the messge from the Commons in this re.spect. Insertion of the suggested word will mean that decisions of the
Commissaion to give publicity te agreements
must be unanimous.
The second exception which 1 recail at the
moment relates ta section 20. That section,
as amended, provides ithat where ini the
opinion of the Commission there hms been a
violation of one of the very many Dominion
laws regarding trade practi-ces, the Commission may, if it chooses, firat issue an order ta
cease and desist. This provision was inserted
by our 'Committee on Banking 'and Commerce and adopted by this House. Instead
of issuing such an order the Commission may,
if it so desires, recommend a prosecution. The
Huse of Commons takes tbe ground that
where a crime bas been committed it is not

a proper proceeding Vo issue an order te cesse
and desist, but a prosecution should be
undertaken at once. My opinion, for whatever àit l wortb, is that the amendment made
by -the Senate comnmittee is entirely right.
We are here dealing with what perhaps might
be called artificial crime. We are making
crimes for the purpose of establishing brade
practices, and it becomes .pretty much a
matter of opinion whether a breach of a trade
practioe la of such a character as ta warrant
prosecution and ail the heavy penalties provie ythis ineasure for parties found guilty. Theredf re the Senate felt that in most
cases where the Commission, in the exercise
of its judgment, found there had been a
breach, it would be proper ta take the preliminary step of issuing an order to cesse and
desist. However, the bouse of Commons
holds a different view, and I do not intend ta
recammend that we mnsist on aur amendment.
Another exception is taken by tbe bouse of
Coxnmons with respect te our amendment providing that there should be no prosecution
under section 498 or 498A of the Criminal
Code save with the approval in writing of thbe
Dominion Trade and Industry Commission.
I amn sorry this amcndment is not practicable.
It la an eminenVly appropriate one, but I
realize the force of the objection which the
House of Comnons makes ta it. That House
points out that under the amendment there
woul be interference with the preragative of
the Attorney-Genera'l of thc provinces. I do
nat recommend insistence an our ameudment.
The only other exception I now recall-I
amn sure I amn omitting oDe-relates ta aur
amendment to section 26. That section of
the Bill as submitted to us provided that
where a Dominion company was making an
issue of seaurities, the Secretary of State could
at any time, if he sa desired, refer the capital
strnoture of the company ta the Dominion
Trade and Industry Commission for review,
and after such reference the issue could not
be proceedied with until the Commission reparted. Our committee and thc Senate itself
recognized the fact that this subject is distinetly within the provincial prerogative and
that in aIl the provinces with the exception
of Prinýce Edward Iaad there are commiËsions specifically and technicaliy qualified ta
de'termîine on stock issues. While thc Dominion Commission could investigate and, repart
wibh respect ta Dominion companies, we felt
that under this seetion we were assuming it
could do the work better than the provinces
are doing it. And ta make its work effective
there wouId necessarily have ta be a duplication of provincial machinery.

REVSED EDITION

SENATE

We took the further ground that the section
is exceedingly dangerous. The Secretary of
St ide might refer a matter to the Commission
or le might not, and there was no limit to the
ti ne when he might act. Assume that be took
nn action with respect to an issue which turned
o.it badly, as many issues do. We feared that
ii such circumstances people who lost money
ot the issue would say that he should have
rnferred the capital structure of the company
to the Commission before permission for the
issue was granted, and that in effect the lack
of action by him was virtually a guarantee
of the issue by the Government of Canada.
These reasons appear to me to be powerful
and insurmountable, and I intend to move
that we insist on our amendment with respect
to section 26.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: The amendment overlooked by the right honourable leader is the
one with respect to the Director of Prosecutions.

public as a duty which he should perform unless he is certain of the soundness of an issue,
and consequently, in any case where a
reference was not made, persons who lost as
a result of purchasing some of the issue would
be disposed to hold the Government responsible. With respect to all other exceptions taken to our amendments by the House
of Commons, we do not insist.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We made an
amendment with regard to the Director of
Prosecutions. Our committee was inclined to
oppose the erection of that rather high-sounding office, and finally, on deciding in favour
of it, brought it distinctly under the Department of Justice. I believe there is another
section which says that the Director shall be
under the supervision of the Minister of Justice.
It is considered important that he
should not be an officer of the department;
so the House of Commons has rejected the
clause which would give him that status. I
do not recommend insistence on this amendment.
I shall make a motion, but I am not sure
of the proper wording. It should be to the
effect that in respect of the first exception
(aken by the House of Commons and the
recommendation that "unanimous" be inserted in our amendment, we agree. With
respect ta section 26, the Senate insists upon
ts amendment, because it considers that in
arder to make the section effective the Dominion Trade and Industry Commission would
have te employ a technical staff capable of
making intelligent judgments as to the capital
structure of companies, and this staff would
be a duplication of the commissions now
existing in all the provinces except Prince
Edward Island, which commissions exercise
a supervision that is based on principles derermined after an extensive study of this
wvhole subject. And we insist on this amendment, in the second place, because the Secretary of State's power to make a reference to
the Commission would be interpreted by the

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think so,
too.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I take it the
last statement made by my right honourable
friend implies that we do not insist upon
clothing the Commission with the right to
give an order to cease and desist in the case
of an unfair practice.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is so.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Well, if we
were not at the last stage of the session much
could be said in favour of retaining our
amendment.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
We are venturing into an experiment, and I think that
business people as a whole would have been
happy to have the Commission empowered
to intervene by issuing an order t cease and
desist, which order in most cases would have
sufficed to bring refractory traders into line.
For that reason it is most regrettable that the
House of Commons has net seen eye to eye
with the Senate in regard to this amendment.
As ta the other amendments rejected by
the House of Commons, I am at one with
my right honourable friend in the stand he
tfakes.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK:
Honourable
senators, it seems to me a serious mistake will
be made if this measure is passed without a
provision permitting the Commission te issue,
in its discretion, orders to cease and desist.
Someone bas said that an ounce of prevention
is worth a pound of cure. What is the principle underlying the policing of all our municipalities in Canada? The chief function of
police officers is to make it clear that it is
unwise to encroa.ch beyond the line of proper
conduct. This Bill creates a Commission to
investigate alleged combines of individuals
or companies. In their enthusiasm to make
their business profitable they may get close
to encroaching upon the rights of producers
and consumers. In such cases what more
proper function could this Commission exercise, after a thorouglh investigation of the
facts, than to say to the people in these
businesses, "Cease and desist from continuing

JULY 5, 1935
in the line that you have been following;
otherwise you may go beyond what is proper
in dealing with producers and consumera"?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: And get into
real trouble.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: It seems to me
most important that the Commission should
be able to do this. Why should the Commission wait until some citizen commits a
crime and then take him into court and
prosecute him under section 498?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And the Commission may hesitate to issue a suminons,
while it would not hesitate to issue an order
to cease and desist.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
Every decentminded judge in Canada, and elsewhere, I
assume, would like to see prosecutions avoided,
except in cases where they are absolutely
essential. There is in all of us a sentiment
which makes us desirous of giving other human
beings full opportunity to keep clear of serious
punishment. This amendment of the Senate
was in accordance with human nature. It
empowered the Commission to say, "Cease
and desist before you cross the line where
you will make yourself liable to prosecution
and penalties under the Combines Investigations Act or section 498 of the Criminal
Code." The striking out of this amendment
will be very much to the detriment of the
Bill. I suppose we should be negarded as
unreasonable if at this late hour of the
session we stood pat and said, "Thus far will
we go and no further." I assume we have
to take a chance on what the future may have
in store, but I think it is a real misfortune
to have this proposed amendment left out of
the Combines Investigation Act.
Right Hon. MT. MEIGHEN: I agree entirely with my honourable friend from Parkdale (Hon. 'Mr. Murdock). I think the
Commons have failedi to appreci'ate the
nature of the clause. I may say I did my
very best to persuade those whom I was able
to see that the aimendment was right. I
think with longer time I might have succeeded, thoug(h the Prime Minister intimated
he felt quite strongly on it, and lie informed
me that the Leader .of the Opposition did
too. I am sure -if the case could have been
put 'to them as it has been put now, there
would have been a different attitude. I do
not see anything for us to do but accept
the Commons' position in respect. to this
clause; otherwise we should bring about great
inconvenience, in view of the attitude apparently taken by both parties in the other
92584-311

House. But I make this prediction: there
wilîl be something of the kind done before
many months.
Hon. -Mr. DANDURAND: Wihl a message
be sent to the House of Commons?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Yes. I
move thait a message be sent to the House
of Commons to inform that House that the
Senate does not insist on its other amendments
to the Bill, but does insist on its amendment
to section 26, for the reasons given. Those
reasons I have already stated, and they will
be epitomized and embodied in the message.
The motion was agreed to.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHIEN: There is
no other message before the Speaker?
The Hon. the SPEAKER:

No.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We might
adjourn during plesure, to meet in fifteen
minutes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If the message
has to be prepared, sent over to the other
House, and discusedi there, and then a
massage has to be prepared for transmission
to this House, tihese proceedings will take
some time.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIHEN: Then we
might adjourn during pleasure, to meet at
the cali of the bell.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
After some time the sitting of the Senate
was reisumed.
APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 5
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 116, an Act for granting
to His Majesty certain sums of anoney for the
public service of the financial year ending the
31st March, 1936.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN moved the second
reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: What is the
total amount?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The schedules are
lengthy, and at the moment I cannot find the
total.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The figure is

$3,337,000.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is that all?

SENATE

484

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. The
The
total of schedule A is $192,697,728.57.
other figure is the total of schedule B.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This measure is
sharacteristic of all our supply bills. The
purpose is the granting of supply, but the Bill
never shows the ways and means whereby the
money is to be raised. The budget speech
gives a general survey of the national
finances, with a statement of actua·l revenues
and expenditures for the past fiscal year and
estimated revenues and expenditures for the
current fiscal year. I think in this respect our
system is defective, but at this date hour I do
not inten-d to try to alter it.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
third reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: To give point to
what I sai.d on the second reading, may I add
that after reading the budget speech we forget
alil about ways and means and plunge into an
expenditure which may run millions and
millions of dollars beyond our estimated
revenues. I am surprised that the AngloSaxon mind, more especially the Scotch mind,
does no-t adopt the system which obtains in
France and other European countries. Under
that syste,m a finance committee submits a
statement showing proposed expenditures and
the ways and means by which those expenditures are to be met.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.
APPROPRIATION BILL NO 6
A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 122, an Aret for granting
to His Majesty certain sums of money for the
public service of the financial year ending
the 31st March, 1936.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND

READING

Righ't Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of the Bill.
He said: This is another Supply Bill. The
total is $16,359,978.34. The Bill covers a large
number of items. Perhaps I need only call
attention to four: expenses of the Royal Coimmission on Prier Spreads and Mass Buying,
$155.000; expenses in connection with printing
amendments to the Election Act, $20,000; expenses of -the Royal Commission on Financial
Arrangements between the Dominion and the
Maritime Provinces, $35,000; cost of maHon. Mr. DANDURAND.

chinery and equipment for the Publie Printing
Bureau, $200,000. Those four amounts were
paid under Governor Gene-ral's warrants. I
shall be glad to answer any questions, but it
would take a long while to give all the details
of this Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It appears to be
an omnibus Bill covering .many activities, past
and present, of the Government.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: I was in the other
House a few minutes ago, when this Bill was
passed. The right honourable Leader oîf the
Opposition went to the Table and glanced at
the Bill, apparently for the first time, and
apparently both parties were satisfied to pass
it. Consequently, I suppose we may as well
pas it. This is one of those measures that
corne ta the Senate at the last moment, when
we have no time to consider them adequately.
In fact this Bill has not yet been printed in
both languages.
The motion was agreed to, and' the Bill
was read the second' time.

DOMINION TRADE AND INDUSTRY
COMM'ISSION BILL
MESSAGE TO COMMONS

I should
-Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
make this explanation to the House in respect
of the Dominion Trade and Industry Commission Bill. The Senate did not insist upon its
amendment to clause 20, regarding the order
to cease and desist. When I was on my feet
before I did not point out that because
of other amendments to the measure, wihen
clause 20 was restored it lhad to be altered.

JULY 5, 1935
In the message which went from this House
to the other House clause 20 was altered
accordingly.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Then the words
"cease and desist" remain in, the Bill?
Right Hon. Mr.
honourable member
have already passed
on our amendment,

MEIGHEN:
No; the
misunderstands me. We
a motion not *esisting
but in explaining our

position I did not move a clause in substitution for clause 20, to bring it into line with
other aimendments. In the message which
we sen-t to the other House that substitution
was made, and the Commons were asked to
concur in it.
I was under
Hon. MT. DANDURAND:
the impression that the clause would have
to be altered to correspond with the amendments.
Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Yes, that had to

be done.
PROROGATION OF PARLIAMENT

THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SPEECH
After which His Excellency the Governor
General was pleased to close the Sixth Session
of the Seventeenth Parliament of the Dominion of Canada with the following speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
In bringing to a close the last session of the
17th Parliament of Canada I congratulate you
upon the extent and importance of your legislative enactments.
My Ministers have for some time been convinced that reforms and adjustments in the
existing economic system have become necessary
to insure its more effective and equitable
operation. Throughout the world there is a
new approach on the part of governments to
financial and economic problems, and I confidently believe that the Economic Council of
Canada, for which you have provided, will in
the future become an important factor in the
Government service for the correlation of
information and scientific investigation.
By the Natural Products Marketing Act,
enacted at the last session of Parliament, you
provided for investigations into costs, price
spreads, trade practices and other matters
related to the production, marketing and
processing of natural products.
During the present session you have amended
that statute and the Combines Investigation
Act; the Companies Act and the Criminal
Code; and provided for the establishment of
a Dominion Trade and Industry Commission.
These measures will insure to investors security

districts. As a result, I have, at one time and
another, met personally a great number of your
fellow-citizens, old and young, and through
them, more than by any other means I have
been able to gain some insight into the many
problems with which this Parliament is constantly engaged.
In this way, I have learnt much-and have
been deeply interested in the learning-of the
human background of the Canadian nation;
I have seen how the inspiration of the past
has fortified the present generation to endure
so gallantly the heavy trials which this troubled
age has imposed on all mankind; and I have
sought, as we all do, to look forward along the
road that Canada must travel in the future.
That road may well be beset with further
Wh'at
difficulties and further hardships.
nation to-day would be bold enough to say
that its future path was free from them?
But, though the road be rough, and though
it wind uphill, a nation true to itself does not
fear it; and Canada with lier line still
unbroken, as your Address rightly says, with
ber head still high, will surely tread it with
that resolution which overcomes all obstacles.
I appreciate deeply your kind personal allusions to Lady Bessborough and myself. If I may
in turn strike a personal note, let me assure
you that our recollections of these years will
not be only of the hard-fought economie struggle
that will characterize them in history. We
have been happy in Canada, both ourselves and
our children; and we shall carry home a full
store of memories of pleasant relationships,
of many kindnesses, and of most generous
hospitality. Such memories, together with the
permanent interest in Canada and the Canadians that we have all acquired, will help to
compensate for the ending of my official connection with this Dominion as a servant of
the Crown.
When I reach England, it will give me great
pleasure once more to assure the King of the
unswerving loya'lty to his throne and person
which, as I know from my own experience, is
so abundantly evident in all parts of Canada,
especially in this memorable year of His
Majesty's Silver Jubilee.
Once more, honourable members of the
Senate, and members of the House of Commons,
I thank you most heartily; and I pray that
you, and those who come after you, may ever
be granted wisdom to direct aright the affairs
of a country so rich in promise, and of a
people so loyal and so courageous.
Je tiens à vous remercier bien sincèrement,
honorables membres du Sénat et membres de la
Chambre des communes du Canada, réunis en
parlement, de la teneur de votre adresse.
J'éprouve, moi aussi, un profond regret à la
pensée que ma mission de représentant du Roi
en ce pays touche à son terme. Quand on s'est
fait un chez soi dans un pays durant près de
cinq ans, ce n'est pas chose facile que de le

487

quitter, surtout lorsqu'il vous y a été prodigué
de tous côtés tant de témoignages constants de
bonnes et amicales dispositions.
Persuadé comme je le suis que la fonction
essentielle d'un Gouverneur général est de maintenir le contact personnel entre le Roi et ses
sujets, je me suis toujours efforcé, durant le
temps de mu mission, de parcourir le plus possible votre grand pays. De la sorte, il m'a été
donné non seulement de visiter à plusieurs reprises toutes les grandes villes de l'Atlantique
au Pacifique, mais aussi de prendre contact
avec beaucoup de vos districts les plus éloignés.
C'est ainsi que j'ai pu rencontrer personnellement un grand nombre de vos concitoyens de
tout âge; et c'est d'eux plus que de toute autre
source que j'ai obtenu des éclaircissements sur
les nombreux problèmes dont ce parlement se
trouve constamment saisi.
De la sorte j'ai appris, sur le fond humain de
la nation canadienne, nombre de choses qui
m'ont profondément intéressé. J'ai vu combien
la génération actuelle doit à la conscience du
passé de supporter vaillamment les lourdes
épreuves dont ces temps troublés accablent l'humanité toute entière; comme vous tous, j'ai
cherché à me représenter la voie d'avenir vers
laquelle s'achemine le destin du Canada. Il se
peut que cette voie soit semée de nouvelles difficultés et de nouvelles misères. Quel pays au
monde oserait prétendre que son avenir s'en
trouve exempt?
Mais aussi rude, sinueuse et montante que
puisse être sa route, une nation fidèle envers
elle-même ne craint pas de la gravir. Comme
vous le dites si bien dans votre adýresse, en
rangs serrés, la tête haute, les Canadiens suivront la leur avec cet esprit de résolution qui
surmonte tous les obstacles.
Je suis profondément touché de vos aimables
paroles à l'adresse de Lady Bessborough et à la
mienne. D'un point de vue personnel, vous
m'autoriserez à dire que la dure lutte économique, qui dans l'histoire caractérisera ces dernières années, ne sera pas l'unique objet de nos
souvenirs du Canada. Nous et nos enfants
avons été heureux en ce pays. Les liaisons
agréables que nous nous y sommes faites, les
aimablies et multiples témoignages de la plus
généreuse hospitalité qui nous y ont été donnés
nous resteront présents à l'esprit. Tous ces souvenirs et l'intérêt durable que nous portons
au Canada et à son peuple nous aideront à supporter le regret causé par l'expiration de mes
fonctions officielles au service de la Couronne.
A mon retour en Angleterre, je me réserve le
plaisir de dire au Roi l'indéfectible fidélité à
son trône et à sa personne dont j'ai eu par
tout le Canada de si nombreux et évidents témoignages, surtout en cette année mémorable du
jubilé d'argent de Sa Majesté.
Encore une fois, honorables membres du
Sénat et membres de la Chambre des communes, je vous remercie de tout cœur. Puissiezvoua, ainsi que vos successeurs, continuer à diri.
ger dans la sagesse et le droit chemin les destinées d'un pays aussi riche en promesses et
d'un peuple aussi loyal et aussi courageux!
