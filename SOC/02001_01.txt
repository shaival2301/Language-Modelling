FELICITATIONS ON

WISHART

HIS APPOINTMENT

McL.

ROBERTSON:

May I be permitted, sir, to extend to you the
heartiest congratulations of your colleagues on
your appointment te the eminent position of
Speaker of the Senate?
Your long experience in public life, during
which you have been for fifteen years a member of this Chamber, the last three years as its
leader, together with your wide knowledge of
The Hon. the SPEAXER.

the rules, will, I am confident, enable you to
discharge the duties of your high office in full
accord with its great traditions. To your long
experience is added a natural courtesy and
kindliness that is appreciated by all; by none
more than the junior members-a fact to
which I personally can bear witness.
I assure you, sir, that in the discharge of
your duties you will have the loyal support
and the fullest co-operation of your colleagues.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: I am delighted, Mr.
Speaker, to have the honour of congratulating
you on your elevation to the high office of
Speaker of this Chamber. Your experience,
gained as a member of the legislaýture of
British Columbia and of the provincial government, as a representative from that province in the House of Commons and later in the
Cabinet, and finally as leader of this House
for some three years, fully qualifies you to discharge the duties of your present important
office with credit to not only yourself but every
member of the Senate. I take second place -to
no one in welcoming you to the Chair. I am
confident that you will ably maintain the high
record established by the distinguished gentlemen who have from time to time presided over
the proceedings of this honourable body.
To the members just introduced, may I
be permitted to extend my welcome? I am
not what might be called a veteran of this
Chamber, though I have been here for quite
a while, and in welcoming them I would ask
them to forget the political arena. We all
owe so very much to Canada that we can well
afford to forget our past political struggles and
direct all our efforts to the advancement of
our country. The Senate is a very important
branch of Parliament, and as such is clothed
with heavy responsibilities. If I misread net
the times, there are trying years ahead of us
before the world settles down to more or less
normal conditions, and the members of this
Chamber, with their great abilities and wide
experience, are in a position to give sound
leadership to the Government and to the
people.
If I may digress for a moment, I notice that
each new member on taking the oath has been
given a copy of Holy Writ. This was net the
practice when I became a member. Possibly
the new appointees have greater need of the
Bible than had their predecessors!
From this side I welcome our new colleagues.
I wish they were not quite so many; but even
so, it is my hope that though they are staunch,
yes, stubborn fellows, we on this side may be
able to convert sene, if net all of them, to our
views on legislation that may be submitted for
approval by the Senate.

SEPTEMBER 6, 1945
Having congratulated you, Mr. Speaker, on
your elevation to the Chair, I add this reminder: I want you still to regard yourself as
one of us. If we should at any time question
your rulings, even if we should insult you,
please remember that we love you just the
same and that there is always a spirit of good
fellowship in this old Chamber.
The Senate adjourned until 2.30 p.m.

SECOND SITTING
The Senate met at 2.30 p.m., the Speaker in
the Chair.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
At three o'clock His Excellency the Governor General proceeded to the Senate Chamber and took his seat upon the Throne. His
Excellency was pleased to command the attendance of the House of Commons, and that
House being come with their Speaker, His
Excellency was pleased to open the First
Session of the Twentieth Parliament of the
Dominion of Canada with the following
speech:
fionourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
You wili rejoice with me that the opening
of the Twentieth Parliament of Canada comes
at the moment of the victorious conclusion of
the war.
It is just six years ago that Parliament met
in special session in anticipation of a declaration of war. Since that time, war bas been
waged continuously, first against Germany,
later also against Italy and Japan. From the
very beginning, the resources of Canada and
the utmost efforts of our people were committed to the fight for freedom and to the
winning of victory.
One by one, the aggressor nations and their
satellite states have suffered total defeat by
the armed forces of the United Nations. All
have been compelled to surrender unconditionally. The terms of surrender were signed by
Italy on September 8, 1943; by Germany, on
May 8 of the present year; and by Japan, on
the eve of the present week. The month of
August witnessed the devastating use of the
atomic bomb against Japanese cities, and the
entry of the U.S.S.R. into war against Japan.
Thus the world-encircling conflict, the most
terrible of wars in human history, was brought
to its close. Not only bas victory been complete, it bas been won over strongly organized
and sinister forces working in combination in
an attempt at world conquest and domination.
As you assemble at the opening of a new
Parliament, I join with you in giving humble
and grateful thanks to Divine Providence for
the deliverance which His mercy bas vouchsafed
to the peoples of our own and other lands. We

2

of this day and generation have been the
witnesses of a mighty manifestation of the
workings of the moral law which inexorably
connects wrongdoing with retribution. It is
as applicable to nations as to men.
In this titanie conflict between the forces of
good and evil, it bas been ours to behold the
triumph of right and justice. In this victory,
we find the assurance of the ultimate triumph
of righteousness as we seek to bring into
being a new order founded u.pon world security
and social justice.
The victory over Nazi and Fascist tyranny
in Europe and over Japanese militarism in
Asia bas been bought at a great price. As the
appalling extent of the power of the forces of
aggression and tyranny was revealed, the free
peoples of the world slowly began to realize
what tîhey owe to the allied nations who first
opposed the aggressors. To their heroic
resistance and to the armed might of all the
United Nations, humanity owes -not only its
freedom, but everything which free men value
and cherish most.
Our thoughts at this time are especially of the
members of Canada's forces who have given
their li.ves that victory might be ours and not
The whole nation reverently
our enemies'.
bows its head in tribute to their sacrifice. At
this hour our hearts share in special measure
the hopes and expectations of those who yearn
for the return of their loved es, now liberated
after three and a half years in Japanese prison
camps. The deep sympathy of Oanada is with
all who have been bereaved, and with those who
have suffered impairment of body or mind,
imprisonment, privation or want.
It will be for history to record the magnitude
of Canada's contribution in this global conflict.
We rejoice that our -armed forces have achieved
so much in helping to defend and liberate
nations to whose past and present our own
is so closely akin. Our country will ever remember with pride the heroic exploits of
Canada's fighting men and merchant seamen.
We pay tribute as well to the men and women
without whose loyal and steady work on the
farms, in forests, mines and fisheries, in
factories, workshops and offices, in hospitals and
homes, and in transport and other services,
victory could not have been achieved. Canada's
great contribution to victory bas been made
possible by the unbroken partnership of her
warriors and her workers.
To all who have contributed by service and
sacrifice to victory, I would, in the name of
Parliament, express our country's gratitude.
So far as the future could 'be foreseen, my
ministers had taken steps to see that Canada
was prepared to meet the very difficult situations which would arise when victory had been
won. Under the authority of Parliament, relief
was provided to assist in feeding, clothing and
housing destitute populations, and in rehabilitating areas devastated by enemy action in
Europe. Additional measures to assist in meeting these and other imperative needs will be
submitted for your consideration.
Preparations for the demobilization, rehabilitation and re-establishment in civil life
of the men and women in the armed forces
were well under way when Germany surrendered. The same is true of measures for the
reconversion of the economic life of our country from a wartime to. a peacetime basis, and

SENATE

for the maintenance of a high level of employment and national income.
The plans thus
developed to mneet the requirements of the
period of transition are now being put into full
operation.
In the building of a new world order, my
ministers are determined to seek above all else
the promotion of peace, work and health in
To furdomestic and international relations.
ther these great objectives, the Government
ias received a definite mandate from the people
>f Canada.
The Charter of the United Nations which was
signed by the representatives of the fifty nations who took part in the Conference at San
Francisco will be submitted for your approval.
The Charter expresses their determination to
maintain peace in accordance with justice and
respect for human rights, and to promote the
welfare of all peoples by international co-operation.
To the promotion of national well-being, cooperation and good will between the Dominion
and provincial governments are as essential as
these attitudes, between nations, are te the
maintenance of world peace and international
prosperity. You will be pleased to know that
at'the Dominion-Provincial Conference held at
Ottawa during August, a successful beginning
was made in the consideration of proposals
designed to contribute to the maintenance of
a high level of employment and national inconte, and to the establishment of nation-wide
social security. It is the earnest hope of my
ministers that, when the Conference resumes
its deliberations, agreement may be speedily
reached which will place the Dominion and all
the provinces in a financial position to discharge effectively their several responsibilities.
Such agreements would make possible a reorganization of the Dominion tax structure on
a simpler, more equitable basis, conducive to
the expansion of enterprise and employment.
Every effort is being put forth to ensure the
return to Canada, as rapidly as military commitments and transportation facilities will permit. of our armed forces serving abroad, and to
accelerate the orderly release of men and
women from the forces.
Through the joint efforts of the Government,
industry and labour, the conversion of war
industries to civilian production is taking place
with a minimum of delay and inconvenience.
It is the intention of the Government to
abolish war restrictions in progressive steps as
rapidly as that can be 'accomplished without
occasioning inflation or other economic disturbances. Such controls as are essential to the
welfare of our people will be continued for as
long as they are necessary.
You will be asked to approve a measure to
'xtend certain specified energency powers to
neet energency conditions in the period of
reconstruction.
The maintenance of long-term markets for
our primary industries is receiving close attention. The continuing need for foodstuffs both at
home and abroad will ensure, for some time to
come, a heavy demand for the produets of our
farms and fisheries.
The Government is continuing its efforts to
stimulate the restoration and expansion of
external trade. Measures te this end will be
submitted for your approval.
In furtherance of stable international exchange and adequate provision for international
credit, you will be asked to approve a measuTre

to provide for Canadian participation in the
International Monetary Fund and the Bank for
Reconstruction and Development.
The provision of houses is being pressed forw-ard as rapidly as the supply of materials and
labour will permit. Plans already in operation
provide for the expansion of home construction
to keep pace with increases in the output of
building supplies.
Priority is being given to
bouses for war veterans and their dependents.
Plans for the establishment of a national
minimum cf social securiýty and human welfare
are being advanced as rapidly as possible. Unemployment insurance, floors under farm and
fish prices, and family allowances 'are now in
force.
The Government's proposals for the
promotion of health and welfare made to the
Dominion-Provincial Conference include plans
for a nation-wide system of health insurance
and preventive medicine, and for old age pensions on a more generous basis.
Other measures demanding your consideraton will include a consolidation, -as a Veterans'
Charter, of the various orders-in-ecuncil relating
to the care, rehabilitation and re-establishment
of war veterans; a bill to repeal the Act establishing the Deparrt.ment of National War Services: a bill to merge the Department of
Munitions and Supply and the Departnent of
Reconstruction into a single Department of
Reconstruction and Supply. The army and the
navy have already been placed under the jurisdiction of one Minister of National Defence.
A further consolidation of all defence services
under one Minister of the Crovn will be made
in due course.
Members of the House of Commons:
You will be asked to make financial provision
for all essential services, also to meet expenditures arising out of the war, and for the purposes of reconstruction. My ministers' proposals
with respect to taxation measures will be disclosed in the budget.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
that the position
My
ministers believe
attainei by our country among the nations
of the world makes it desirable that Canada,
like the other nations of the British Commonwealth, should possess a distinctive national
flag. You will be asked to appoint a seleet
committee of members of both Houses of
Parliament to consider a suitable design for a
Canadian flag.
The Government has directed that, pending
approval by Parliament of a particular design,
the Canadian Red Ensign which was the flag
carried into battle by the Canadian army, and
which was flown from the Peace Tower on
V-E Day and V-J Day as a t-ribute to the
valour of our armed forces and to Canada's
achievements in war, may be displayed wherever place or occasion makes it desirable to fly
a distinctive Canadian flag.
The Government also considers that it is
advisable to revise and clarify the definition
of Canadian, citizenship, and to bring the
legislation respecting national s-tatus, naturalization and immigration into conformity with
the definition of citizenship. You will be :asked
to approve the required measures.
The Government has also been giving consideration to the most suitable manner in
which to commemorate, in the capital of

SEPTEMBER 6, 1945
Canada, the service and sacrifice of Canadians
in the war just ended. In the past, the sacrifice
of human if e ini, war has most frequently been
commemorated in monument& of bronze and
stone. Such a memorial our capital a]ready
has. My miniisters are of the opinion that
something more expressive of the vision of a
new world order would, at rthia time, be moat
appropriate.
They believe that this vision
would best find expression, in the planned
developmnent and beautification. of the national
capital and its surrounding area. as a National
Memorial. Steps have already been t-aken to
plan the de'velopment of the ecity and region
of Ottawa on both aides o~f the Ottawa River.
As plans are formulated, specîfic proposais
wilI, fromn time te time, .be submitted to
Parlisment for consideration.
On the recommendation of the Government; of
Canlada, His Majesty ithe King has beenl pleased
to select Field, Marshfal the Honourable Sir
Harol Alexander as my successor as His
representative
in Canada. Field Marshal
Alexander's duties will net permit of his
assumption of office until early in the new year.
Meanwhile Her Royal Hîghness Princeas Alice
and I will pay a short visit to the United
Kingdom, returning to Canada for a brief .stay
before our official departure.
As you take up your heavy responsibilities
in these difficult days of reconstruction, I pray
that Almighty God znay guide and bless your
deliberations.
May you. be înspired by the
vision of the better future for hunianity which
it is now within the power of the United
Nations to create.

THE LATE SENATOR JOHN
ALEXANDER MACDONALD
TRIBUTES TO HIS MEMORY

Hon. WISHART MeL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, hefore proceeding with
the business of the bouse, I regret very mnuch
to have to advise honourable members of the

SENATE

ô

passing of one of our esteemed colleagues
during the interval since we last met. I refer
to the death of the senator from RichmondWest, Cape Breton, the Honourable John
Alexander Macdonald, M.D., C.M., who died
in the Glace Bay hospital on June 11, 1945.
Senator Macdonald was born on January
3, 1883, at Havre Boucher, Antigonish County,
Nova Scotia, the son of Hugh Macdonald and
Mary Macdonald, both Scotch Canadians. He
was educated at the public schools, and
afterwards at St. Francis Xavier University,
Antigonish, where he completed a preliminary
course of studies leading up to his entrance
to Dalhousie Medical College at Halifax.
While attending St. Francis Xavier, in addition to completing a successful scholastic
course, be participated widely in athleties,
showing great prowess in many lines of sport.
Graduating from Dalhousie Medical School,
Senator Macdonald commenced the practice
of his profession at River Hebert, Nova Scotia,
under one of the most proficient and ontstanding physicians in the country, the late
Dr. K. J. Rockwell. While living at River
Hebert, he married Lulu Margaret, daughter
of Hugi Maxwell of Rider John, Pictou
County. He later moved to St. Peters, Cape
Breton. where, in addition to practising bis
profession he interested himself most successfully in political activities. He was elected
to the Nova Scotia legislature in 1916, was
re-elected in 1920 and 1925. Afterwards, in
1925. 1926 and 1930. be was successful in the
federal elections, and represented the constituency of Richmond-West, Cape Breton, in the
B.ouse of Commons, where he held bis seat
until he resigned in 1930 to make way for the
entry into the federal cabinet of the late Honourable E. N. Rhodes. On the 3rd of February, 1932, our late colleague was appointed
to 'the Senate of Canada.
He was a member of the Knights of Columbus, and is survived by bis widow and one
daughter, Mrs. Hern.
For more than thirty years the late Senator
Macdonald occupied a prominent position in
bis native province, and particularly in the
island of Cape Breton. He was a man of
strong convictions and intense loyalty to bis
friends. Enjoying a large medical practice,
he helped others less fortunate than himself
to regain health and strength, giving generously of bis time and ability, and many homes
in Cape Breton will mourn the passing of their
friend and physician.
On behalf of honourable members of this
House, I extend to the widow and daughter
of our late colleague our deepest sympathy in
their bereavement.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, the news of Senator Macdonald's
death came to me as a great shock, as I am
sure it did to all bis friends in this Chamber,
for ho was still a young man and it was not
even known that he had been ill.
The brief sketch of bis career to which we
have just listened shows that our departed
colleague certainly had what is called a full
life. He was a prominent member of the
medical profession, and as a member, first, of
the Legislature of Nova Scotia, then of the
House of Commons and, finally, of the
Senate, he gave generously of bis abilities
to the public service. Senator Macdonald did
not speak very often in this House-I might
say that he spoke too infrequently to suit
us; but whien he did have something to say
he expressed himself clearly and to the point.
I desire to join with all my colleagues on
this side of the House in conveying to Mrs.
Macdonald and ber daughter our sincere
sympathy.
Hon. DONALD MacLENNAN: Honourable senators, as an old acquaintance of the
late Dr. Macdonald, I wish to say a few
vords. I knew him for many years. We
were fellow-members of the Legislature of
Nova Scotia for some ten years, but we were
acquainted with each other before that period.
He was a man of positive opinions, but was
very charitable. I know, in fact, that he
was far more charitable than he led people
to believe. I have been told by prominent
physicians that he was a splendid country
doctor. I have it from several sources that,
considering the limited facilities at bis command, it was amazing how skilfully he practised his profession. He was pre-eminently the
poor man's physician; he was never known
to refuse a sick call, and in many cases ho
accepted no reward whatsoever.
Although the late senator ran in some four
or five elections in the constituency of Richmond, he was never defeated there. It is not
by accident that a man is elected successively
four or five times, and whein one bas such a
record as that he must possess some qualities
that appeal to the people who know him best.
I think it is most fitting that the members
of this Chamber express their sympathy to
bis estimable widow and to bis daughter, Mrs.
Hern, in their great loss.
Hon. FELIX P. QUINN: Honourable senators, may I join those who have preceded me in
paying tribute to our late friend and colleague,
He was perhaps closer to
Dr. Macdonald.
me than to any other member of this
Chamber. I had known him since be first

SEPTEMBER 11, 1945
came to Halifax to attend the Medical, College at Dalhousie, and firomn 1916 our political
careers ran almost parallel.
Before I proceed fýurther 1 wish t.o correct
an error in the biographical sketch of aur
late, colleague which, appears in the Parliamentary Guide. He is said ta have been
elected te the House of Commons in 1925,
but defeated ini 1926. Dr.. Macdonald was
neyer defeated. H1e ran in tbree elections to
the Nova Scotia Assembly, as my honourable
friend fromn Margaree Forks (Hon. Mr.
MacLennan) bas already said, and was elected
every time. H1e resigned' in 1925 te accept
the federal nomination. H1e was victarjous at
that election and again in 1926 and in 1930.
H1e resigned his seat toe make way for aur
late colleague, Senator Rhodes, then Premier
of Nova Scotia, wb'om the Rigbt Honourabie
R. B. Bennett had invited ta join *bis Cabinet.
Dr. Macd'onald, was a layai and devoted
friend; braver beart neyer belat witbin bumaii
breast; and, as the bonourabie gentleman
from Margarce Farks bas just said, b is outstanding virtue was cbarity. The strongest
evidence of that is ta be found among tbe
people of his native constit.ue'ncy of Ricbmond.
Ineyer saw a greater tribute paid ta any
man-and I bave attended tbe obsequies of
many, great and smal1-tban was paid ta Dr.
Macdonald at tbe time of bis funeral by the
cbildren and the youths wbom, as be often
baasted ta me, hie bad brougbt into the warld,
and by the poor women and men wbom. bie bad
attended in serions illness. Tbey passed by
bis bier in wbat seemed ta be a neyerending procession, and it was touching ta see
tbemn shed tears over tbe man wbo bad been
their friend andi physician. for tbirty-five years.
As tbe, maurners came out af cburcb tberp
was nlot a dry eye amang tbem; wamen and
cbildiren could not control. their grief, and
many men toak tbeir kerebiefs ta wipe their
eyes wben tbe casket was taken te its final
resting place.
I shall miss bim as a warma friend and a
loyal colleague. May bis soul rest in peaco'.

FELICITATIONS ON RIS APPOINTMENT

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I rise on tbe Orders of the Day ta
convey ta the new leader on the Goverument
side (Hon. Mr. Roybertson) not -only my own
warmest personail congratulations and good
wisbes 'but those of every one of my colideagues
on this aide of the lieuse. Ever since the
bonourable gentleman was summoned ta tbis

7

Chamber he bas taken a deep and keen interest
in ail legislation and other business that bas

engaged aur attention from time ta time.

I

the very important and
recali with .pleasure
outstanding speeches be bas made during past
sessions. The Government, ta my mind, bas
made a very wise choice, for the hon-ourable
gentleman bas on bis side n-ot only ability but
youth.
1
May I cangratulate him a so an being
created a mem<ber of the King's Privy Counicil
for Canada and a 'Minister without, Portfo.lio.
I can say ta the honourahle leader that
throughauit 'the five sessions during which I
have been privileged to lead the party on this
side, 1 always received at the hands of the late
Senator Dandurand, andi subsequently of my

good f'riend bis Honour the Speaker, wben in
turn he accupied the position of Goverament
leader, the closest and most cordial co-aperatien. Neyer in the h-istory of Cana-da have
there been such colossal preblesus ta be dealt
with as now lie ahead. 1 am quite sure that
my honourable friend wi1l extend ta tbe leader

on this side the samie cordiaýlity and co-operation that 'bis two predecessors did, and I
assure bim that be can rely on support fromn
this side of the bouse -for all the sounil and
sane legislation that is brought before this
Ohamiber. We, of course, reserve the rigbit te

àt appears justifiable.

I hope my young friend may have many
years in which to eni oy the pro-minent posi-

t.ion be n.ow hollds, and in conclusion wou'ld

Some Hon. SENATORS: bear, hear.
Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON: banourable Senators, I find it difficult ta respond
adequately or ta express my appreciation of

the very kind reception which I bave bad frein

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate proceeded to the consideration
of His Excellency the Governor General's
Speech at the opening of the session.
Hon. BREWER ROBINSON moved:
That the following Address be presented to
His Excellency the Governor General to offer
the humble thanks of this House to His Excellency for the gracions Speech which he bas been
pleased to make to both liouses of Parliament,
namely:
To His Excellency Major-General the Right
Honourable the Earl of Athlone, Knight of
the Most Noble Order of the Garter, a
Member of His Majesty's Most Honourable
Privy Comneil, Knight Grand Cross of the
Most Honourable Order of the Bath, Grand
Master of the Most Distinguished Order of
Saint Michael and Saint George, Knight
Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order,
Companion of the Distinguished Service
Order, one of His Majesty's Personal
Aides-deCamps, Governor General and
Commander-in-Chief of the Dominion of
Canada.
May it please Your Excellency:
We, His Majesty's most dutiful and loyal
subjects. the Senate of Canada, in Parliament
assembled, beg leave te offer our humble thanks
to Your Excellency for the gracious Speech
which Your Excellency bas addressed te both
Houses of Parliament.
He said: Honourable senators, I deeply
appreciate the honour of having my name
associated with this motion, and the opportunity to offer my sincere thanks to the
honourable Leader of the Government in the
Senate. I feel that the honour which has
been conferred on me has probably been
given in well-deserved recognition of those in
the Navy, the Army and the Air Force whom
we of the Canadian Legion War Services,
and other organizations of the auxiliary services, have had the privilege of serving overseas in this war, and of my old comrades of
the last war. Also I believe it is a tribute
to my native province of Prince Edward
Island, whose record of enlistments in the
services, and of victory loan subscriptions,
has been something of which our province
has just reason to be proud.
May I extend to you, Mr. Speaker, my
congratulations upon your appointment to the
honourable position which you now occupy.
With your many years of experience in public
life and your long experience as a member
of the Senate, I am confident that you will
preside over the Senate with honour and
distinction.
I should also like to extend my congratulations to the honourable Senator from Shelburne (Hon. Mr. Robertson) upon his appointment as Leader of the Government in
the Senate.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

Speaking here for the first time, while
deeply conscious of the honour conferred on
me, the difficulty of the task is such that I
would have turned from it had I not felt
I could depend upon the generosity and indulgence of those of greater experience who listen
to my modest remarks.
First, may I state how much I appreciate
the honour of being a member of the Senate
of Canada, and may I express my gratitude
for the friendly welcome extended to the new
members of the Senate.
As we assemble at this, the opening session
of the Twentieth Parliament of Canada, immediately following the victorious conclusion
of the war-for which we give our humble
thanks to Divine Providence-I feel that the
problems now facing us are equally as serious
as those which confronted the special session
of Parliament which was called when war
was declared. The great question then was
the winning of the war, and I am sure that
every Canadian is proud of Canada's contribution towards bringing about the final and
complete downfall of the aggressors. Through
Divine Guidance and much sacrifice we have
reached that goal.
Now we and those
nations associated with us are face to face
with other problems; but if we apply ourselves to the solving of these problems as
energetically and effectively as we applied
ourselves te the winning of the war, we shall
not fail in the all important task of achieving
a complete and lasting peace. It is certain that
in this task the policies forecast in the Speech
from the Throne will constitute a valuable
nucleus around which to formulate a programme which will enable Canada to play her
full part.
There are one or two subjects mentioned in
the Speech from the Throne upon which I
should like to say a few words. The first is
the Government's announced project for the
beautification of Ottawa and the surrounding
district as a National Memorial to those who
served and died in the war just ended. I
believe I am justified in saying that many
cities, towns and villages in Canada should
have more parks and open spaces, and nothing
could be more appropriate than memorials of
this nature, which time cannot destroy. While
in England I was asked what I should remember longest about London, and I answered
without hesitation, "It's many parks with all
their natural beauty."
Secondly, as one who has always been proud
to be a Canadian, I certainly approve of
Canada having a distinctive national flag.
The need was never more in evidence than
during the years of the war, when every other
nation of the Commonwealth proudly displayed a distinctive official national flag.

SEPT1EMBER 11, 1945
I also f'eel that the time bas corne when legisi-ation should be enacted to give legal status
to Canadian nationality. Tbis is ail the more
fitting and proper since, as a result of the
wise leadership of our Prime Minister at the
San Francisco Conference, Canada bas
emerged as a leader of the middle powers of
the world.
The re-establisbment in civilian 11f e of the
veterans of the war is perhaps the Government's most immediate responsibility. This
task bas been made even more urgent by the
sudden termination cf the confliet witb Japan.
However, as a result cf the vision and foresight of the Government of the Rigbt Honourable Mackenzie King, legislation already
has been enacted and bas received the almost
unanimous approval cf the veterans themselves. These enactmnents have been studied
and discussed wberever veterans got together,
meet one -of 'them wh.o would
and I have yet Vto
offer one word cf criticism, even of a constructive nature. The problem is te, get our
boys home, an~d te place them either in empîcyment or in a position Vo prepare tbemselves
for empîcyment as speedily as possible. Veterans realize, better than Canad-ians who bave
no't been away frem 'home, the excellence cf
Canada's price control regulations and how
muob they mean te allcf us.
In closing may I say it is my opinion that
te be good Canadians we must know one
another and be conversant witb one anotber's
needs; ever ready and anxieus te co-operate
or te compromise, if necessary, in erder successfully te solve our problems and retain
Our national unity.
bon. VINCENT DUPUIS ý(Translation):
Honourable senators, I wish at the outset Vo,
express my deep gratitude te the Governiment
for having deigned te elevate me Vo -the dignity
cf member cf the bigbest 'tribunal in Vhis
country, and at the same 'time entrust me with
the task, wbicb is both most bonourable and
often perilous, cf seconding 'the Address in
reply te the Speecb from the Throne.
I dare hope that yen will net judge me toc,
barshly if, on account cf my deficiency, I do
net prove equal Vo the delicate task I bave
te perform. bowever, yen may be sure cf
my sincerity and my impartiality.
In taking my seat for the first time in this
august assembly, my thougbts naturally go te
my family.
If my humble father and my beloved
mother were still living, they, wbo saw me
go forth on the King's bigbway and begin
the struggle fer life at the age cf 'thirteen,
weuld ne doubt be pleased and proud cf the
success acbieved 'by their twelftb son. I could
then express te tbem my deep gratitude and

assure them that this success is due in large
part to 'the lessons in courage and rectitude
which they gave me through their advice and
their examples.
Because I deeply feel the truth of what I
haive just said, I wisb you to believe that 1
shall neyer be arrogant or unyielding witli
anyone, for I have always kept in my memory
the words of a ballad my father taught me
when I was young, in which a father gives wise
advice to bis child. H1e says to hlm am.ong
other things:
Too soon the years, disappoinýtment and care,
Will corne to furrow thy brow 80 fair.
Thy deeds may be writ in history's pages,
A pattern of glory for ail future 'ages;
But bies le flot found in ýglory alone,
And he who lives hippy lives often unkn.own.
Kindly forgive me if, for a moment, I have
given way to the expression of personal
feelings.
I should now like to offer my most heartfelt,
congratulations to the distinguished senator for
Kootenay East (Hon. Mr. King) on bis nomination as Speaker of this Huse. bis long
experience in public life in bis province and in
the dominion sphere, the high functions be bas
fulfilled with dignity, and latterly the supremely djifficult task of leader of the Senate
which he bas discbarged with perfect tactfuiness and ability, lead -us Vtoanticipate that
be wiIl achieve comparatively easy success.
H1e will thus follýow the bigh traditions wbicb
bis predecessors in the Chair have ever maintained, and among the latter I do not f orget
bis iromediate predecessor the honourable
senator for Lorimier (bon. Mr. Vien).
I also bave -the pleasant duty of 'tenderýing my sincere congratulations and my best
wishes of success to the bonourable senater for
Sbelburne (Hon. Mr. Robertson) -on lis recent
-nomination as leader of this bouse. The
sound judgment and the talent with whicb he
performed 'bis numercus duties both in business
and in politics are a guaran'tee of tbe success
lie will undoubtedly achieve, as the Government's representati-ve in this Cýhamber.
It is comforting 'Vhat parliamentary usage
allows me to pay a tribute of esteem and
respect te the memory of my immediate predecessor as representative of the senatorial
district of Rigaud, Honourable Arthur Sauvé.
Experienced j1ournalist, occasional writer,
career politician, leader of bis party in tbe
Quebec legislature for several years, minister
in the federal Cabinet, tben senator, always

SENATE

Honourable gentlemen, as I speak, the
world has barely emerged from the most
dreadful conflict ever witnessed by man. In
the countries directly affected by the war, we
find no.thing but ruin and havoc; famine
and misery are rampant everywhere. Without
the charitable help of the Americas, who
knows if Europe, gripped by plague, might
not for a while disintegrate into a vast expanse of desert where even the raven might
not find its prey. When we recall that the
world was engulfed, in this calamity by the
freakish will of but a few men, it is easily
understood why humanity loathes dictatorships under whatever name or form they may
occur. Thank Heaven our country was spared
that scourge. Many of our families, however,
mourn the loss of sons who died on the field
of honour; many of our fighting men will
return crippled and wounded, while countless
others will come back home weakened by their
long captivity in enemy camps, where they
suffered from malnutrition and, other hardships. To each' one of them, we owe an
imperishable debt of gratitude, for it is thankto them that we still enjoy freedom, tranquillity and peace.
It is therefore our bounden duty to show
ourselves worthy of their sacrifice. None of
us. whoever we may be, must spare any effort,
shrink at any hardship, to bestow on the
survivors the opportunity -of enjoying a
better and happier life. It is therefore reassuring to find that the Government intends
not only to promote peacetime initiative,
but that during previous sessions it planned the'
needed steps by appropriate legislation. In
order that the various projects might prove
effective, it was essential, first of all, to ensure
the maintenance of peace based on principles
of justice and the respect of the individual.
Jointly with the other United Nations, our
Government, represented at the San Francisco
Conference by a worthy delegation, took the
necessary steps to attain that end.
It aiso invited the provincial governments
to attend a conference, and submitted to 'them
plans for organizing employmenit, equitably
levying national income, and putting into
effect a social security programme. I know
that in trying to carry out this item of their
platform, the members of the federal Cabinet
will ever remember that they must respect
the rights of the provinces and minorities.
I was delighted to see the Government propost the gradual repeal of war restrictions,
while ensuring the control of inflation. I feel
convinced, however, that, as soon, as circumstances permit. Canadians will be able to
exercise their rights freely.
Ion Mr. DUPUIS.

(Text): Honourable senators know that I
am now discussing that clause of the Speech
from the Throne which states "that it is the
intention of the Government to abolish war
restrictions . .. without occasioning inflation
or other economie disturbances." I am very
hopeful that this will be approved by every
honourable member. because the liberty of the
citizen should he restored as soon as possible.
Ion. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Hea'r, hear.

Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: I am firmly convinced
that ti; Government will not fail in its duty
towards that end, and that each and every one
of us will always have present in our minds
the wise advice which Lord Macaulay gave,
more than one hundred years ago, .to British
parliamentarians and government officials.
Here is what he said:
Our rilers will best promote the improveient
of the people by strictly confining themselves
to their own legitimate duties-by leaving
capital to find its most lucrative course, commodities their fair price, industry and intelligentce their natural reward, idleness and folly
thei:r natural punishment-by maintaining peace,
b- defending property, by diminishing the price
of law and by observing strict economy in every
department of the state. Let the Government
do this; the people will assuredly do the rest.
In the short time at my disposal, it is
not possible for me to make a proper analysis
of all the items contained in the Speech from
the Throne. However, among the measures
which will be submitted to Parliament, none
is more important nationally, in my opinion,
than the adoption of a distinctive flag. Indeed, a flag is a tangible sign which symbolizes the soul and the aspirations of a
people. The soul of a nation, overflowing
with hope, manifests itself in the actions of
each one of us, and notwithstanding the diversity of our origins, our aspirations converge
towards a commun ideal: from Prince Edward
Island to the island of Vancouver, every
Canadian without exception, filled with justifiable national pride, wishes to gain for his
country a reputation which would give it a
foremost place among the nations of the
world. It is therefore imperative that such
aspirations, such pride, such national reputation should be symbolized by an outward
sige. This sign and this emblem are lacking.
Heretofore all kinds of flags have been flown:
the Anglo-Saxons flew the Union Jack; the
Irish, the golden harp on green background;
Canadians of French descent, the Tricolour
or the fleur-de-lis banner. Unfortunately, all
these emblems tend to divide us instead of
to uni-te us. They do not symbolize the common ideal of all Canadians. Praise be to our
At last we shall have our own
legislator.!
flag.

SEPTEMBER 11, 1945
Those economists who dlaim that Canada,
due to its topography, is destined to be engulfed in the great American maelstrom, have
neyer reckoned with the phil.osophy of history or the potential value of the human element. Is it not a fact that the greatest empires originated in small towns, such as Athens
and Rome of old, or in small countries sncb
as England and Japan in modern times? We
know that the secret of the greatness of
those empires lies principally in the initiative,
-the wisdomn and the dynamnic quality of their
people. We have therefore some justification
for 'haviag an unshakeable faith in the future
of Canada. And if Canada is to survive, she
needs bier own fiag.
Since 1 am fromn Quebec, 1 may be allowed
to state, without false pride, that the people
of my province are as determined as any
te see that ne other province outdistances
them on the road to progress and in the,
development of our commen country.
I should like to convince honourable senators, who se 'nobly represent the other parts
of Canada that the people of Quebec are
not inspired by any sensitive and meddlesome
egetism but rather by a commendable spirit
,of emulation.
Their .*only ambition is te
secure their just share of prosperity and freedom in this land of ours. Do net therefore,
be se rash as te judge tbem on appearances
alene. You need nut fear tlîat Liy remarks
on this subject will follow the pattera of a
speech delivered by a certain peasant of the
Danube region te the Roman Senate, under
the reign of Marcus Aurelius. Hewever I would
peint eut te yen that if only a small number
ef people from my province occupy key positiens in -the public service and -industry, it
is not due -te any incempetency ontbeir part.
We must look elsewhere te find the cause. I
feel tbat were we te make an inventory in
Canada oef our experts in science. literature
and art, Quebec would be in a position te say
with Father Mauray, who said, wben asked
wbat be theught of himself: "When I judge,
net much; but when I compare, a great deal."
There fore, I say te the ether previnces:
When you look at Quebec, your elder 8ister,
please do se, with the nakved eye, and you
will find hier kind and sympathetic, and her
faults will appear te you as just average and
perfectly bearable. If, on the contrary, yenu
persist in using a magnifying glass -te h-unt
for the mete in bier eye, she will feel aggrieved
and will be tempted te held aleef.
I sbould be quite surprised if sbe retorted
by requesting yeu te remeve first the beam
frem your ewn eye, because she is naturally
charitable. Metherless since ber early child-

il

heod, brought up ia adversity, she bas shaped
for berself a character ef patience, tolerance
and tenacity, and new that the great Canadian family bas reacbed its maturity, sbe is
quite willing -te play the part of eldest daughter
whýo cannot be dispensed witýh by the other
provinces witheut i.njury te themselves.
On ber part, the province ef Quebec la fully
conscious ef the importance of bier sisterprovinces. We are well aware that, from a
material and cultural standpoint, the provinces
complement each other and formi an inseparable enýtity, of which the new flag will be the
sublime emblem.
Under tha-t flag every
Canadian will be happy -te live and in its defence he will ever be willing and proFud te
give bis life.
Before I conclude my remarks, may I say
that it is fitting and proper that we sbould
give thanks te Divine Providence for having
granted us victory over the forces of evil; and
we Canadians-those of us who can rise abeve
-political cansiderations--owe the Creator a
particular gratitude for having, through the
people's will, "vox populi, vox Dci," placed
and maintained la the leadership of this country a true statesman. Týhrough bis courage,
bis prudence and his insight he bas succeeded
ia *evercoming difficulties, obstacles and pitfalîs both within and witbout. He was able te
surround himself with mon of unquestioned
ability and bring the ship of state safely te
port despite gales and storms. We are confident ýthat, with the help of the men of good
will who formn the.vast maj.ority of bonourable
members of the present parliameat. inspired
as tbey are by the vision of better times te
camne, he will succeed la solving the difficult
post-war problems.
Thus aur country will
march ýunimpeded towards its ulýtimate ýdestiny.

HON. SENATOR BALLANTYNE
TRIBUTES ON RIS RETIREMENT AS
CONSERVATIVE LEADER IN
THE SENATE

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. WLSHART McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, it is with mixed feelings
that I desire ta refer ta information that has
reached me regarding the change in leadership
of the other side of the House, which change
is naw indicated by a rearrangement in the
seating opposite. I am sure that every honourable meinher on this side shares with me the
keenest regret that the bonourable senator
from Aima (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne), who for
sO long has so well carried out the duties of
leader, feels it necessary to resîgn from ýthat
very important position. I .think, honourable
senators, that the officiai record of bis age is
belied by his youtbfui cou-ntenance and youthful spirit.
Som Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: For my part, as
a junior senator, I have always had the
pieasantest possible relations with bina. I
have experienced at his hands, as have so
many others in this House, numerous courtesies. I have the greatest respect for lis
judgment-a judgment derived from long
and intimate association with publie affairs.
To me it is a matter of the keenest regret that
he bas felt it necessary to offex. bis resig.
nation as leader of bis party in this Chamber.
A compensating feature, however, is that the
members on. the other side have eeen fit to
elect as their leader the bonourable senator
froua Winnipeg (Honourable Mr. Haig), who
at the moment graces the chair vacated by the
hionourable gentleman from Aima (Honourable
Mr. Balianityne). With him, too, 1 bave had
the pieasantest. relations, which I hope will
continue. I arn sure that I express on behaîf
of members on tbîs side of the House our
desire ta co-operate with bim in every way
we can and to bave a continuation of the
cordial relations which we bave had with his
predecessor.

Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: ilonourable Senators, my first. words te t.he leader of the

on biis side cf the House, are: Thanks for
those very kind sentiments. We on this side
take place second te none in our very high
regard for the henourahie gentleman who bias

sought bis advice on every occasion, and we
always besaefited by bis sound judgment. W/e
very mucli regret that he bias resigned as our
.e..der. Net oniy to-day, but for soveralixveeks
past, every one cf us urged him te reconsider
bis decisicsn, but he, said he feit it bis duty
te xithdraw from the office, and with very
great regret we accepted his resignation.
As for mysoîf, 1 arn afraid that 1 shahl net be
able te carry on the high traditions cf those
who have graced this chair since I entered
the House somne ten years age, but I shahl
always remember the uine cf succession and try
te live up te it. To the leader cf the Government and te ail the members on biis side I
may say that I xvili give to this House the
hest service I can-always bearing in mind
that we do ourselvos a serx'ice when we serve
others.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Thank you
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE:

After long consideration I hav e feit il my

WAR EXPENDITURE AND DEMOBILIZATION APPROPRIATION BILL No. 1
SECOND READING

ROBERTSON
iMcL.
WISHART
Hon.
moved the second reading of Bill 3, an Act
for granting to Ris Majesty aid for national
defence and demobifization.
Hec said: Honourable senators, the ýpurpose
of this bill is te providze interim supply of
that part of the expenditure of the Government xxhich in the past was incorporated in
ivar expenditures. and which now is referred
to as war expenditure and dernobilization
appropriation.
Foir the information of honotirable seniators
1 would point out thiat during the year 194445 the total estimates on this account were
83,650.000,000, to which was added a further
$84J0,000,000, or in ail $4,450,000,000. For t.le
year 1945-46 the appropriation is more or Ies
in two stages. Last, session a speciaI appropriatien of $2,000,000.COO was made un this account
An adtlitional stîm of
and was granted.
$1,365,000,000 is flow contemnplated for the
period fromn September 1 te Mlarchi 31, 1946.
The comparative totals would tico be $4.450,000.000, for the year 1944-45, and S3.365,000,000
for 1945-46, this figure being made up of the
$200000.000 voted 'aàst ses.sion and the 81,365,000.000 whiiehi wil' be az-ed for this session.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: This is only a partial

bill

tut'?

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON. Yes. The sum
vonternplated in this interirn bill is $400,000,000,
bcing approximately two months' requirement.
YcuGii i no-te in reference to the expendittîîcîý of last ycar that Mutual Aid was
shown separateiy; in the 32,000,000,000 voted
last sesion thiere xvas included a certain proportion of Mutual Aid. 1 arn informed that
Mlutual Aid bas now ceased, and that in the
total iimiount of $1,365.000,000 which will be
asked for-, of wvhich $400,000,000 is for iramediate requirements, there is no item included for Mutual Aid.
Nýcedlcss to say, honourable senators, if
vou sec fit to approx e of this request, every
facilitv xviii bc afforded you to secure al
possible information on the figures referred te
whien. in due cousîre. the main supplv bill
cornes before you. This is a request for
$400,000.000 out of the total of $1,365,000,000
which xviii be asked for this session.
Hon. Mr. F. QUINN: We may expect,
thon. that the balance of $965,000,000 will be
asked for before this preserit sessntOf is over.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

Yes.

SEPTEMBER 12,1l945
lion. JOHN T. HAIG: Honaurabie members, as I understood the leader, this will flot
in any way prejudice future discussion of the
estirnates when they corne before us. This
is simply an interirn vote covering demobilizatien.
In that connection I just want ta say one
word, and I hope it reaches the ear of the
Minister of Finance. There is one place where
that gentleman gan make a saving, which
wiii permit him to eut the corporation and
incarne taxes in this counitry. As soon as the
war psychology of officiai Ottawa dâÏsappears
the better for the taxpayer of this country.
In what I say I ar n ot placing ail the
biame on the Government. They have ta reiy
on advisers, and just haw inuch they are
responsibie for and how much the ather
peopie are responsiýbie for is a matter on
which 1 ar n ot clear.
lion. Mr. EULER: What do yau mean by
"9officiai Ottawa"?
lion. Mr. HAIG: Ail the officiais in ail the
departmnents, and the advisers ta the Govcrnment. My honourabie friend from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) was a very efficient administrator, but 1 imagine that in rnany matters
he had ta depend a good deai on deputies.
Under the various war measures we have a
whoie h-ost of officiais. Unfortunately, they
are not ail cancentrated in Ottawa; a few
have strayed, out to the city of Winnipeg,
and to, Vancouver, Regina and other places~
and believe me, they are some officiais!
An lion. SENATOR: They spend rnoney.
lion. Mr. HAIG: They are some officiais!
They do flot have ta fight the people ta
justify what they have done. You can deal
with a man or wornan who is eiected, or
ane who is appointed on his responsibility ta
a ehamber such as this; but it is very difficuit ta nail down the officiai who has done
a particular job.
Whether the Governrnent is considering it
or flot, I know that the people of this country
are expecting a cut in taxes.
Same Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: There, is na doubt about
it. They are expecting it, no matter what
anybody rnay say. The Governrnent may get
away without cutting taxes for a year or
two, but it cannot do it for long. As I
say, there is one -place where the Goverument
can reduce e.xpenditure without curtaiiing
efficiency. I arn sure that if I were holding
a government job and knew that some day
the job would disappear, I might go-but Idon't believe I wouid,--and urge the Minister
ta do away with my job. No, I dan't beieve
47704-3

I wouid; but the Minister has got ta do it.
The Leader of this House, who is a member
af the Government, has got ta do it.
That is the oniy suggestion I have ta make
about this estimate. The sooner you get
rid of the necessity for it the better. I quite
admit that soidiers are coming back and that
they must have their gratuities; I quite admit
the necessity for dernobilization; but, for the
life of me, I cannot understand why a very
large staff is stiii carrying on to-day. I can
see very littie difference since May 8, the
date on which the war with Germany was
successfuily terminated.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON. I shouid like ta
assure the honourabie senator that every
faciiity wiii be provided for inquiry and discussion when the main iegisiation in this conflection cornes before, us. I shouid iike ta go
even further, if possible, and make arrangements for consideration before it actuaiiy
reaches us in its officiai forrn, so that honourable senators rnay have every oppartunity of
securing whatever 'information they require.
I would mave the seco;nd reading of the
Bill.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill
was read the second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
Bill be read the third time?
lion. Mr. ROBE RTSON: With leave of the
House, I wouid move the third reading now.
The motion wvas agrecd ta, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.
APPROPRIATION BILL No. 3
SECOND READING

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON
moved the second reading of Bill 4, an Act
for granting ta Bla Majesty certain surna of
maney for the pubic service of the financiai
year ending the 3ist March, 1946.
lie said: Honourabie senators, this is the
third interirn suppiy bill ta caver generai
expenditures for the public service of the
present financiai year. The total estimates
for the year are one billion and twenty-two
million dollars. 0f that amount approxi- mateiy llve-tweifths were voted at the iast
session, ta caver the manths of April ta August inclusive. The maneys so provided were
exhausted at the end -of August, and this bull
proposes that a further one-tweifth, or one
rnonth's additional supply, shahl be immediateiy forthcarning in order ta carry on the
business of the country. The amaunt ta be

le

voted by the bill is $29e769,999.11, which is
flot mathemnatically one-twelfth of the total
of something more than one billion dollars.
The explanacion, apparently, is that certain
payments included in the one billion dollars
are statutory and do flot have te be voted.
The amount provided by the bill is approximately one-twelfth of the part of the one billion dollars that has to be voted. It does flot
include any portion of whatever supplementary estimates there may bc.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: There wvill be the same
reservation hore as there was on the other
Bill?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That is correct.
The motion wvas agreed te. and the Bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:"With leave of the
Senate, I move third reading now.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third tîme, and passed.
THE ROYAL ASSENT
The lion. the SPEAKER informed the
Senate that he had reeeived a commun-ication
from the Assistant Secretary to the Governor
General, acquainting him that the Honourable
Týhibaudeau Rinfret, Chýief Justice of Canada,
acting as Deputy of His Excellency t.he
Governor General, would proceed to the
Senate Chamber this day at 5.45 p.m. for the
purpose of giviîng the Royal Assent to certain

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
consideration of Hua Excelcncy the Governor
Gentral's Speech at the opening of the
session, and the motion -of Hon. Mr. Robinson
for an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
alHow me first to congratulate the morver
(Hon. Mr. Robinson) and the seconder (Hon.
Mr. Dupuis) of the Address in reply to the
Speech £rom the Tihrone. 1 have alreadýy
congratulated His Honour the Speaker upon
bis elevation to the position of presiding
officer of this Chamber. 1 also t.oek advantage
on Thursday hast of the opportunity to welcone the n<ewly-appointed members of the
Senate.
Mon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

My first word-and I know ahI honourable
members will loin me in this-is in appreciation of the work of -our soldiers, sailors, airmen
and members of the merchant marine in hehping le bring to a successful conclusion the
greatest war in history.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: We have paid a high
price in helping to acliieve victory. I am
referring to price in terras not of money, but
of the bast hives and broken bodies of inany
ougmen and young women.
of our
Down through the ages history vvihl record
the valorous deeda of theso men and women
that have made possible the holding of such
a meeting as this here today, and of ýot.ber
such meetings in the demnocratie countries of
the werhd. Prior to the last war, when, one
rend of the valour of men and women of bygone times one .often wondered whether, if
the necessity arose, the sýame courage and
bravery would be shown. by modern people.
Wehl, the war came, and the world witnessed deeds of heroïsm. equal to any recorded in history. Many of us thought then
that perh.aps there neveT again wouhd, be another war of such great proportions; but *enly
twenty-one years after ils close there began
the even grenIer conflict which has just ended,
and I am sure nîl honourable members will
agree with me that the deeds of heroism in this
,war were unsurpassed by Ihose of its prodecossor.
I also want to congratuhate the farmers,
fishiermen, lumbermon, tbc people in industry
and transporta-tion. and the ordinary men and
women of this, country upon the way in
wbieh t.bey stood -up to Ibis struggle during
six vears. In that respect Canada need take
second place bo no nation in the world. When
we met in Ibis Chamber on the 9th of September, 1939, and voted to go to war against
Germany we knew-for the memory of the
last war was fresh in our minds-that we
were taking a fateful decisien, flot only for
the young men and women who would, be
requircd to serve in the armed forces but
for aIl the people of our country. Il has
heen deephy impressod upon us whnt n struggle
it was to the people back home.
I congratulate the Governmcnb on their war
effort. Many things that we suggested wouhd,
I think have been an improvemenI on their
policy; but. 1 wihl concede that any mistakes
tbey made may he attributed to the head
rather than to the heart, for I believe tbey
were just as anxious as the rest of us that
Canad.a's war effort should be flot only truhy
national in scope but also indicative of a
united people. I did hope that we would have,

SEPTEMBER 12, 1945
maybe nlot a union goverfiment, but at least
a goverfiment representing aIl parties. However -the government of the day did flot deem
this feasible and they carried on, as a party
goverfiment. 1 want ta congratulate tbem on
giving the country fine leadership. True, as
I said before, I think they made some mistakes; but tiere is this compensation, the
coming generation should benefit by those
mistakes.
We shail in a few days ho asked, ta confirm
the United Nations charter which is.sued from
the San Francisco conference. One of our
colleagues on this aide, whom I respect very
iuch, said te me juat the otheir day sometbhing which I want to repeat now for the
benefit of honourable mem-bers. It is this:
The education of our youth in the next fifty
yeara, nlot any charter agreed ta at San Francisco or any place else, will determine whether
we are to have another war. True, sueh a
charter is a guide and shows a disposition on
the part of the nations of the world ta preserve peace; but unless we and our sons and
daugliters can, pass on ta futuiie generations
'wha't war really mens, and that national
differences can and siould be settled, by arbitration, in maybe fifty years, certainly a
hundred- years hence, the world again will have
ta undiergo ail the horrors of war. The
development of weapons of destruction during
the past five or six years shows whait a frigitfui thing war is, and furtier developments
along this line will make future wars so
devastating as ta imperil aur very civilization.
Only recently a young airman told me what
radar meant ta the crew of a bomber, iow
greatly it increased the effeetiveness of air
raids. Radar was hardly known before the
war; today it is fully develaped, and
undoubtedly it contributed largely to the vietory of the allied nations. As we aIl k-now,
the latest engine of destruction is the atomie
bomb. I do net think the use of Vhe atomic
bomb on two Japanese cities brought about
Japan's surrender-ýwe know now that even
before its use -the Japanese goveramen-t had set
on foot negotiations for surrender-but unquestionably it convinced the Mikado and his
advisers tiat it was hopeless te. continue the
When on Septem-ber 9, 1939, the Parliament
of Canada voted in favour of a. declaration
of war againat Germany every member knew
exactly what he or aie was doing. I douit
whether that could be said, of the members of
tbe Parliament of Canada in 1914 wihen they
voted ta go to war. In saying this I am flot
questioning their ability for a moment, but
tbey had had no experience of what modern
47704-3J

17

war means. The first Great War gave us that
experience. Members of Parliament and the
public were torn with anxiety ini 1940 as
through the dark days of May, June, July,
August and September they watched the German forces march across Europe. Se great
was the strain tbat one could nlot sleep. That
is ail-one just could nlot sleep. I do neot
know why the British got away from Dunkirk,
why Hitler did not try to cross the channel,
why he turned on Russia; I do flot know why
Japaii attacked Pearl Harbour and brought
the American people uflitedly ifito the warbut probably ail these happenings meant our
8a1vation. I believe every part of Caflada was
whole-heartedly in -the war. Some persons did
neot agree witi us on certain policies. We
think they were wrong; maybe -they t-hink
they were right. Our people kflew we were
in for a desperate struggle, and this Heuse,
to its credit, voted .unaflimously for Canada's
participation in the war. There was nlot even
a dissenting whisper fromn any quarter of this
Chamber.
Now, the problems of peace are much more
difficuit than the problems of war.
Hon. Mr. CALDER- Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: While war is on and your
-boys are at the front you are willing to do
anything in order to further the war effort,
because failure to do so may mean your boy's
life. But in peace time there is no such incentive, and you set'tle back and forget those
critical days.
Now the war is over, and we are facing the
difficuit problems of peace. In my judgment too many people have been going up
and down the country picturing a great and
glorious new world. There has been so much
of this airy talk that today too many people
are unwilling te face realities. With the
devastation and disruption of the Orient and
the great continent of Europe, we cannot escape
repercussions on this continent. What are we
facing today? A request by Great Britain to
give her money so she can carry on, and the
cold, liard fact that, whether we like it or flot,
if we do flot help her to carry on we shall lose
our best customer. For generations our merchants tirougiaut the country have had to
help their customers through liard times. A
farmer is in difficulties because of crop failure
or cattie losses. The merchant says to himself: "This man is an honest fellow, and I
shall have to carry him until he gets on his
feet again, or 1 shall have no outiet for my
goods." We are in that position in regard
ta Great Britain. As a sellsh individual, I
do nlot like to give a billion dollars to some
other country to carry on. Further, I do not

1 think the single tranferabie -vote ought to

If nobody gets a majority on the first couint,
the iast man is dropped. an.d tbe second choices
are transferred, and se on until somehody is
elected. That is the single transforable vote.
Unler proportional representation there is a
ulifference. It may ho that four, eight, or ton

SEPTEMBER 12, 1945
Now let me deal with some specific cases to
show just what I mean. Take, for instance,
Mr. Bracken, who had a good majority under
the present systerm in Neepawa, Manitoba.
He obtained 6,480 votes, about 1,900 more
than the Liberal candidate, who got 4,568, and
the C.C.F. candidate, who polled 2,986 votes.
In other words, Mr. Bracken had 6,480 votes
and his opponents 7,554. Yet on the surface
it would appear that he had a big majority.
Let us go now to Selkirk, where a C.C.F.
candidate was elected. We find that the
C.C.F. candidate there polled 7,556 votes and
his opponents 13,225 votes-nearly twice as
many. The candidate who stood in second
place was a Liberal, with 6,400 votes; the
third was a Progressive Conservative, with
3.400 votes; the fourth was an Independent
Liberal, with 2,000 votes, and the fifth a
Social Crediter, with 1,300 votes. I do not
know where those votes would have otherwise gone. I do not believe the Social
Crediters would have voted for the C.C.F.,
or that the Independ'ent Liberals would have
voted for the C.C.F., but they might have.
I am sure the Conservatives would not have
voted for the C.C.P. Some of the votes die,
but they-dio not all die.
In the Manitoba campaign and in coming
campaigns we are going to be faced with
three parties, the Liberal, the C.C.F. and
the Progressive Conservative. The C.C.F. say,
and I think they are correct, that their philosophy of government and life is absolutely
opposed to that of the Liberal and Conservative parties. As a result, the voter first deeides whether he is going to vote for the
C.C.F. or one of the other parties; then he
deoides between those two parties.
Let me take another situation. Perhaps
some of my honourable friends will be more
interested in the constituency of Prince
Albert than in Neepawa. In Prince Albert
Mr. Bowerman polled 7,928 votes; the Prime
Minister secured 7,799 votes; the Conservative candidate had 2,767, and the Social
Credit candidate had 847. Bowerman was
elected with about 8,000 votes; the total
opposing vote was 11,400. Now if the Social
Credit votes had been transferred, I do not
know where they would have gone. I do not
know where the Conservative votes would
have gone, but I do not believe they would
have gone to the C.C.F.
Now let us look at Lake Centre. Mi.
Diefenbaker received 6,884 votes; the C.C.F.
got 5,875; and the Liberals 3,812. In this
situation I am persuaded that a large number
of Liberals voted purposely for Diefenbaker
to defeat the C.C.F. candidate.

19

Let us look at Qu'Appelle. Mrs. Strum
received 6,146 votes; Mr. Perley had 5,400
votes; the Minister of Defence had practically 4,900. Now under the single transferable system where would those 4,900 votes
have gone? From my knowledge of Saskatchewan I am certain that great ilumbers
of them would have gone to Mr. Perley.
The same situation prevails in Manitoba.
We do not hear the C.C.F.'ers in Manitoba
advocating the single transferable vote. In
fact, in the Winnipeg Free Press to-day there
is a letter criticizing that paper because it
advocated the single transferable vote. It
said: "You must want to keep down the
No doubt the author was a
under dog."
C.C.F.'er and was afraid of the single transferable vote.
Now, honourable members, let me take a
typical instance in the province of Ontario,
that of the constituency of Wentworth. Mr.
Lennard, a young man, got 15,458 votes; the
Liberal candidate got 13,652; and the C.C.F.
got 11,915. In other words, Mr. Lennard
became the member for Wentworth with
15.500 votes, but he had opposed to him
25,500 votes. Here, again, it is not known
what would have happened if the 11,900
C.C.F. votes had been transferred. But why
not try the scheme? Someone may say to
me, "Yes, Mr. Haig, but when I go in to
vote. I vote for the Liberals. Why should

I make a second choice and vote for the
I don't beaieve in their

policy." The only difficulty with that statement is this, that the voter does make a
second choice for the Conservative.
I am sure most honourable senators have
been at one time members of provincial
legislatures, also members of the House of
Commons. They know that many men and
women, even in the same family, are divided
in their political choice. They say they don't
know whether to vote for this side or that
side. The result is that one vote is cast
for one side and a cancelling vote is cast
Under the system in

SENATE

20

it appeared that the Liberals or Conservatives
were making a clean sweep, there were still
48 members elected by a minority vote, and
in some instances a very decided minority.
The only reason I bring this subject up is
that I think this House ought to refer the
problem te a committee. We are going to
have to face it. No political bias would be
brought into the matter at all. It makes no
difference to me as a Conservative, or te yen
as a Liberal, or somebody else as a C.C.F.'er,
if we believe in the fundamentals of democracy. The, redeeming feature of the system
I refer to is that it works. It also bas a
tendency te make for less bitter partisanship
in politics than the present system. Take for
instance the constituency of Neepawa. A division of the C.C.F. votes in that constituency,
would bave had a considerable bearing on
whether the man or woman who represented it
was a bitter partisan or one of a more indepen-dent frame of mind. I think the House could
give real service on this proposition. Men or
women would come voluntarily from different
parts of Canada, to make representations to us
as to what the effect of the proposed change
would be, and I think we would be surprised
at the unanimity that would come to us on this
question.
So much, honourable members, for that
problem.
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN: Before leaving
that subject, would the honourable senator
be good enough to tell us whether or net
that system is in operation in Manitoba?
Hon. Mr. HAIG:

It bas been in force since

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:

net say this; but the objection one hears
on the street corners is: "If we 'did net

Haig could never get elected." What they
mean is this; one becomes well known to the
public all over the city, and it is very hard, te
change him. However, that only relates to
individuals within the party. The result of
the system is that you get, within a small
fraction, exactly the representation you are
entitled te.
Honourable senators, the Government, whatever its composition may be, will sooner or
later be compelled to give serious thought to
this question. Otherwise we are going to have
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

government by groups, minority government.
We very nearly got that in the last election.
Minority government is nothing to write home
about. I repeat that this question is one that
will have te be seriously considered.
Now I want to say a few words under the
heading of our external problems. This country depends on its foreign trade. We do net
produce all the goods we need for our own
use. True, we are large producers of grain,
cattle, meats, eggs, minerals, lumber and fish,
but there are many things that we have to
buy fron other countries. During the last
fow years we have enjoyed a prosperous trade,
especially with Great Britain and other parts
of the empire. Tîat trade is being challenged
now; there is no doubt about it. We have got
to develop trade with other parts of the world,
and that is a difficult thing te do. The prosperity of my part of the country-of Manitoba,
Saskatchewan and Alberta-depends on external trade. We do net like having to buy goods
in a closed market and to sell them in an open
market. Some scheme bas to be worked out
whereby our grain, our cattle and our hogs
can be sold on the world market. The British
people have been eating Canadian bacon for
the last six years and may be eating it for
the next two, but I am not one of those who
blieve that Denmark will be unable to resune
the sale of bacon to Great Britain.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Denmark is selling te
them now.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I never thought we could
retain the whole of that market. We have got
to work out a policy for trading with Britain
if this country is te prosper.
Next I want to touch on our internal problems. What are they? Well, our first internal
problem is how to get rid of the wartime controls. I admit that at the present time we
may need control over sugar. I say we may
need that control; I am net well enough
informed to know positively whether we do
need it or not. Also we may need control over
butter and some other things. But I say quite
candidly that I do not believe we need control over meat. Throughout Canada there is a
desire to get rid of these controls. In considering the problem of how te get rid of
them we must listen, net te the controllers
but to the men and women in Parliament,
who are the best judges of what should be
done. As every lawyer knows, the man who
makes the best judge on the Bench is one who,
in addition to bis other qualifications, bas a
good deal of every-day practical experience.
He makes the best judge because he knows
human nature. Now, the members of Parliament know human nature; and by and large

SEPTEMBER 12, 1945
-of course, I arn now thinking particularly
of the members of another place-they are
pretty good fellows. They would not get
elected unless they were.
One contraI that I want ta say a word or
two about is the rentais contraI. In 1941 when
the Governinent establisbed the rentais contrai tbrougbout this country a good many
people thought; as 1 do stili, that it Would
mean putting one or two thousand dollars in
the pooket of everyone who owned a house.
And that is just what happened, for since then
there has been virtually no building of houses
for rent. In the West, and I presume in every
other part of the country, no houses have
been bujît except by private individuals for
their awn use. Everybody who understood
the housing situation said: "The minute you
put contrai on the rent of hoeuses, people will
stop building them for rent, and owners who
are now renting will selI. so the very people
you try ta protect will be evicted." That is
exactly wbat happened. Just lately an order
was issued prohibiting the owner from evicting a tenant. That is putting one contrai on
top of another.
Now, the Government is building bouses in
Winnipeg and, I believe, in other cîties, and
as a resuit private builders are unable ta get
supplies. For instance, in Winnipeg seven
hundred bouses under construction by private
individuals are standing uncompleted tbrougb
lack of supplies, because these supplies are
needed for the two bundred houses ta be
erected by the Government. 1 do not think
the Government can make a success of bounsing. 1 expect ta be stili a member of the
Senate when these Government-constructed
bouses in Winnipeg are condemned and classified as slum buildings. And the Government
is putting up bouses not only in the city
itself but some seven miles nortb. An acre of
land goes with each of these hoeuses, whicb
prasumably are ta be occupied by people who
work in town. How can a man live that far
fromn bis work unless hie bas lis aown car?
Houses are also being built by the Government west and south of Winnipeg. Tbe
money spent on tbese places and the materials
used in thema will be wasted. It would bave
been far better if tha Govarnment had
encouraged people ta build in tbe city.
In establishing a contrai why did the Government pick on the ana form of wealth tbat
the ordinary persan uses more widely than
any other? If I have bonds the Government
does nlot prevant me froma collacting my
interest; but sae how I arn treated if I own

bought a house in 1930. For the first six

21

years I may bave got a rent of $11 a montb.
The taxes were $25 a montb, but for rent
I had ta take eitber $11 or nothing. For
the next five years, up te 1941, I was .able
ta get, say, $30 a montb. Tben when the
time came that 1 could bave got $75 the
rentaIs board said: "Oh, no. You wera getting $30 a month in 1941 and yen are stuck:
at tbat." That policy is wrong, bonaurable
senators. It leads ta just what bas bappened.
AIl the restrictions that have been imnposed
bave not resulted in tbe building of a single
bouse in Manitoba, but tbey have stopped
the building of many.
It is said tbat the returned, man deserves
proper bousing. 0f course bie does; but it is
my experience that the man who cbooses bis
own bouse is likely ta be mucb better satisfied witb it than bie would be witb one twice
as good that was chosen for im by tbe
Government, even tbougb the cost of tbe
better bouse was no bigber. One of the
problems of flrms wbo build bouses is to
anticipate the desire of purchasers. Let me
give an illustration. In 1927 a contracting
firm in Winnipeg bought a hundred lots as
bouse sites. The firm's programme for that

would be taken ta sea a house-after ahl, it is
usually the wife wba exercises tbe cboica in
sucb a matter. Sha would say: "I do nlot
like the view from here. If the bouse was
on that lot over tbere, it would suit me fine."
Well, the contracter would then arrange ta
duplicata the bouse an the desired lot, and
take bis chance of selling tbe existing bouse
ta someone elae.
Another -problem tbat this country faces is
tbe .praviding of jobs. I agrea with an editarial
on tbis subject tbat appeared in the Ottawa
Journal a few days aga. During tbe war men
were earning six or seven dollars a day or
more doing a job in a factory, in good baaltbful surroundings. The job was wortb that at
the tirne. As a friend ef mine said tba other
day, wben bis company was making an, airplane at a cast of approximately baîf a million
dollars it did not matter mach if the cost was
increased 1by 85W,000. If tha airplane was in
the right place at the right time it was worth
a million. But once tbe war en.ded that was
no longer true. We are now producing for
peacetime consumption, and aur cemmodities
have ta be solil on world markets. In order
ta be able ta salil we must produce more
chaaply than aur competitars. If I have a
fact-ory in wbich every man makes ana hundred articles a day, and a competitor's emapl-oyaes turn out a daily average of two hundred articles of the sae kind, that compatitor
can underseil me. He can market his gooda

wben I cannot. Thaf, is fundamental. We al
believe thar every man and woman ought to
have the o.pporfunity of working at, a job
under the 'best conditions possible, but tliose
conditions are to some degree controlled by
wnrld markets. I ar n ot opposed to unions;
I think they are a good thing. In a co.mmittee
room the other day an honourable gentlemani
from ýCalgary was addressing a union meeting.
11e said: "You people think you are good
unionists, but, I bclong f0 fthc oldest union in
the world, a union that nobody bas been able
f0o break yet." He wvas a lawyer. As a lawyer
I too say fliat I belong to the closest union in
the world. We lawyers arc guidcd *by the
tariffs of fees cstaliiýhed by our varions
organizations. So I arn not opposed to unionism.
During this war and in the prrccdi ng years
of peace the United States demonsf.rated to
fthe world that fhrough the use of inv entions
and machinerv they could produie goods
faster than anybody else, and still pay highl
wages. We in Canada have get to mecet that
situation.
Lasf, but flot least, we face the ques.tion of
taxation. I do not intend te gef into a discussion wif h any supporter of ftie Government in this or in fthc other Bouse as to wliat
the Minister of Finance saidl dcring ftie general election. I undersfood him te say thaf

with the uncertainties of farming in Western
Canada. If you are blessed with raim at the
right season you will get a good crop; if net,
you wili get a bad one. This year in eastern
Saskatchewan there is a good crop; in western
Saskatchewan, no crop at -ail. Eastern Saskatchewan got rain; western Saskatchewan got
none. There are of course certain local exception8, but generally that is the condition.
I subrnit that whatever goverument may be
in power it shouid lay down a long termi
policy for the primary producers of this
country.
Take the fishermen of the Maritime Provinces. During the years prier to the war
I met men and women from those provinces,
and they toid me that the more pittance the
fishermen got was simply appalling. I have
the samne feeling for those fishermen as 1
have for our farmers in Western. Canada. This
is not a political issue, it is an economic and
business question. If we want to mako Canada

undesirablo condition is in my .iudgment due
largely to a mistaken policy in regard to grain.
The Government put a certain price on bogs
and on grain. Then they allowed hog producers in Ontario a preference. The resuit was
that if a Western farmer fed his barley te, bis
hiogs hie lost the extra fifteen cents a bushel he
woul have got 'had hoe sold ihis grain. I think
hog production during August was about 50,000,
as against a requirement of 100,000 a week.
Ail this cornes under tbe problema of primary
production. This problem must be sol'ved on

what condiÎtions tbey will have to meet. At

would stay on the land if they thought there

they will be surrounded by grown sons and
daughters, and, I believe, some fifteen grandchildren. I was born within a dozen miles of
Senator Donnellyf's birthplace, and I lived there
until I was twenty years of age. I know the
members of the family and their reputation
well, and undoubtedly the gathering will
demonstrate that they are as highly regarded
and respected among their neighbours and
frienids as the honourable senator is now, and
always has been, in this House.
Some Hon. SENATQRS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. JAMES J. DONNELLY: I must say
that the remarks of my friend the honourable
senator from Peel (Hon. Mr. Marshall) really
come as a surprise to me. I had no notice that
any reference would be made to such a family
gathering as we propose to have on Monday
next. May I heartily thank the honourable
gentleman for his kind remarks. Like myself,
he is a Bruce man, and we have a great deal
of respect for Bruce

GENERAL'S SPEECH

ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed frorn yesterday the
consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Honourable Mr. Robinson
for an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. WISHART MoL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators will, I hope, appreciate
the fact that during the relatively short period
I have occupied this office I have not been
able to acquaint myseif with as much detail as
might in other circumstances reasonably be
expected of me in speaking to this motion.
With your forbearance, therefore, I should like
to confine myself to a few general observations. After, many otiher senators have, as I
hope, participated in the debate, perhaps I
will be accorded the privilege of making some
further observations.
I wish first to associate myself with the very
happy expressions by the leader opposite on
Thursday last, respecting the new members
who are gracing the House for the first time.
I heartily concur in what he said on that occasion. I would also, honourable senators, join
in his felicitations to the mover and the
seconder, both of whom discharged their duties
and responsibilities well. Further, I should
like to offer a word in commendation of the
speech of the leader on the other side of the
House, both as to subject matter and delivery.
I amn sure, honourable senators, that whatever difference might develop as to detail,
there can be very little difference of opinion
as to the objectives set forth in the Speech
from the Tbrone. There is on our part a
unixversal thankfulness to Divine Providence,
and to those who participated so wholeheartedly in our war effort, that victory has
crowned our efforts. The splendid courage of
our fighting men and women, which is true
to their tradition, was matched by the unselfish
and loyal support of the people at home.
I am sure that we are pleased to know that
everything is being donc to expedite the return
of our fighting men and women to Canada;

SEPTEMBER 13, 1945
that everything possible will be done to further
their re-entry into civil life, and that provision is being made for the years that lie
ahead so that in every way possible their
interests will be protected. The project
unfolded before our eyes of a great capital,
to be a lasting tribute to those who gave their
lives, or offered them, in the defence of freedom, as well as to those who worked so unselfishly at home, is I think an excellent one.
I like also the suggestion of the mover of the
Address (Hon. Mr. Robinson) that in lesser
degree, perhaps, similar projects might be
encouraged in various communities throughout
the provinces.
It is natural that we should all be interested
in the plans that are being made for as orderly
a transition as possible from the very difficult,
new, and extraordinary conditions that surround a country during a period of total war,
back to the more normal conditions of peace.
Then, of course, comes a thought which is
uppermost in our minds-the hope that we can
build better, so that the spectre of war will
disappear. That, of course, involves our
external relations.
The Speech says that in due course there
will be presented what might be regarded as
the first step towards the charter of the
United Nations. There will be presented also
legislation and plans which will have a direct
bearing on our external relations, and which
will not only seek to provide a surplus market
for our products, but will endeavour to increase
the flow of international trade by meaµs of a
stabilization of exchange and the removal of
various impediments.
As to the field of domestic relations, I think
all must agree that as we seek to improve
relations among nations it is desirable that
we should also seek to improve relations
between the Dominion Government and the
provincial governments, in order that our
national machinery will function as efficiently
as possible. It is essential that we recognize
the diverse elements which go to make up
this Canada of ours. To-day over 50 per cent
of the people of Canada are descended from
racial origins other than those of the British
Isles. It seems to me that the recognition of
this situation is a step in the right direction.
It will in no way detract from the happy association that we enjoy in the British Commonwealth of Nations but it will increase our own
national consciousness. All within our borders
should be conscious of and proud of our
nationality. This matter was referred to most
eloquently by the seconder of the motion
(Hon. Mr. Dupuis).

With some of the things that the honourable leader opposite said in his address I am
in hearty accord. For instance, I think it was
a splendid suggestion that on the occasion of
the next Victory Loan campaign every possible
bit of information as to the need for the
money should be given to the public. It is
always an excellent idea to tell the public all
that can be told, but it seems to me especially
important to do this in the coming campaign.
I am not in a position to discuss in detail
my honourable friend's specific suggestion in
regard to the single transferable vote. I think,
however, the importance of the matter merits
our serious consideration. I would go further
than that. Perhaps we might consider not
only the single transferable vote but the question of whether it is desirable to make other
changes in our electoral machinery. I know
of no group that is better equipped than the
members of this honourable House, with their
wide experience, to deal with these matters.
I want to thank my honourable friend for
his reference to the quality of leadership that
the government of the day gave during the
war. I agree with him, but I would point out
that that leadership was possible only because
the people of Canada, irrespective of political
affiliations, gave the Government wholehearted support. In that regard honourable
members opposite were shining examples. On
every platform on which I spoke, both before
and during the last election campaign, I expressed the view that though the leadership
given by the Government was good, the country's war effort was not attributable to the
Government alone. I felt, and I said repeatedly, that as boys and girls drawn from households of every political faith in Canada had
laid down their lives in defence of the country, any reference to the war effort from a
political angle would be an insult to their
memory. The war effort of Canada was the
war effort of all the people.
Now, honourable senators, this country is
faced with problems which, though different
from those that confronted it during the war,
are of tremendous seriousness; and I do not
believe they will be dealt with successfully
except through a continued national effort.
Of course, it is inevitable that there should
be some change in the public attitude. As my
honourable friend remarked, there is a disposition on the part of people in war time to
render every possible service in the common
cause.
One of the important questions facing us
to-day is price control. I can think of no more
unpopular measure to have to enforce. Yet,
honourable senators, bearing in mind what

SENATE

26

happened after the last war in our own country, Germany and elsewhere, I feel that this
matter will be as serious for Canada in the
immediate future as it bas been in the past
six years. The danger is that the public may
not appreciate the seriousness of the situation.
My recollection is-I am speaking only from
memory-that the increase in the price level
in the twenty months after the last war was
as great as if not greater than it had been
during that war.
I would remind honourable senators that
there is, potentially, greater danger right
now because there exists a deferred need for
consumer and capital goods along with a
tremendous purchasing power. For that reason, while I would not for one moment suggest that any administrative actions of the
Government should be accepted by this House
without careful consideration, I am not certain
that I could subscribe to the view which I felt
was at least implied by my honourable friend
as to meat rationing, rentals control and other
such measures.
Of course, if after being in possession of
all the facts an honourable senator or any
other person felt there was no need for a
certain control, it would be not only lis
privilege but his duty to say so. For my
part, I am not in a position to say whether
these various measures are necessary or not.
It might be an excellent thing if one of our
efficient committees-the Committee on Agrion
culture, and Forestry, the Committec
Banking and Commerce, or some other-asked
those responsible for the controls to appear
before it and satisfy honourable senators as
to the need for these measures. I am not able
at the moment to argue whether meat rationing is necessary or not, but I presume that it
was reintroduced in order to make sure that
our allies, particularly Great Britain-yes,
and perhaps even the defeated peoples of
Europe-shall not go hungry. There is, I
am sure, on the part of honourable senators
and the people as a whole, a desire that out
of our bounty we should extend to the British
people and our other allies every help that
we can.
There is a further reason for supplying food
wherever it is urgently needed. Experience
las taught us ýthat hungry and dissatisfied
people are a breeding ground for social unrest
and disease; and it is not always possible to
prevent these evils from spreading across
I think, honourable
national boundaries.
senators, that if we are convinced of the
necessity for these controls we should do
everything within our power to make their
operation effective; and when we consider
the tremendously serious consequences of a
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

breakdown in our economic structure we should
be careful to utter no word that would make
the task of the administrative officials more
difficult.
On the other hand, I am in hearty accord
with the suggestion of the honourable leader
opposite that we should direct our efforts
towards securing larger markets for the primary industries and enabling them to purchase
at lower prices the goods that they require.
So hcartily do I agree with his suggestion
that were it not for the physical limitations
of the seating on this side of the House I
should invite my honourable friend to cross
the floor. However, as this is not feasible,
I can at least express my conviction that
Covernment supporters who at present occu.py
seats on my honourable friend's side of the
House will have for him from now on even
kindlier feelings-if that be possible-than
they have had in the past.
Honourable senators, every time that I
have read a casualty list, every time that I
have seen a ship bringing back boys and girls
to this country-and, as I live in Halifax,
this las been often-and every time that I
have seen troop trains moving one after the
other in quick succession, I have felt that I
should like in some humble way, in my capacity as a member of this Senate, to do everything in my power to sec that what they
fought for is maintained, and that their hopes
and ambitions are not dashed to the ground.
What we can do is a matter of judgment.
There are pressing questions facing us. But
in addition to wbat may be regarded as constitutional responsibilities there is, I think,
an obligation on us as members of the Senate,
with our wide experience of public affairs,
to contribute our share to the solving of the
grave problems with which civilization is
now faced, and so do our utmost to match,
however inadequately, the great contribution
which our boys and girls made towards Allied
victory and the preservatien of our way of
life.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. JAMES J. DONNELLY: Honourable
members of the Senate, I am not on the list
of speakers today, but the honourable leader
on the other side (Hon. Mr. Robertson) in his
very eloquent address made particular reference to meat rationing and with your permission I should like to take about ten minutes
of your time on this subject.
I speak particularly for the stock raisers and
meat producers of this country. I hope there
is no impression abroad that those who produce our beef cattle have any objection to

SEPTEMBER 13, 1945
helping to supply the starving people of
Europe with a reasonable portion of our meat.
The stock men are just as kind-hearted as any
others, but they are flot quite satisfied witb
the way the industry has been treated. I will
be somewhat frank. If you look at today's
reports of the Toronto stock market you will
see that yesterday 2,500 cattie were left over.
Our stock raisers are quite ready to seIl their
cattie if they can get a prîce ini keeping with
the cost price of stockers in the spring, of
the cost price of stockers in the spring, and of
labour to look after their cattie. I was talking
to a prominent stock dealer in Toronto lest
week, and I arn going to repeat bis remarks.
He said.: "The trouble is with the board in
Ottawa. There is one man on that board,
Mr. Todd, who has a more active brain than
the other members. He bas beei4 in the eiuploy
of the packers for some time, and on account
of his great ability he has been able to manipulate things. in such a way that the packers
have been able to reduce the price of cattle
when týhey so desire." It is not a question of
honesty. The objection is that he has practically put the industry into the hands of the
packers; in the language of the stoekyards,
he bas been able to outsmart t~he other members of the board.
As 1 said a moment ago, we have no objection at ail to our beef being used to supply
the distressed people of Europe. During the
war the Government set up various agencies
in order to get things done, and secured men
of great ability to manage thein. What objection would there be to a Government agency
going out into the country and buying cattie?
The stock men are anxious to seil. Let the
Government buy the cattle, process them andi
send the beef to Europe. Then our stock men
would be very glad to supply the cattie.
It is in the interest of this country that there
be a ready market for our cattle. There are
districts in the West where th&e is abundance of grass and hay, but there are other
districts which. are very dry. The stock men
there desire to get a market for tiheir cattle.
If our Ontario men could get a market for
their finished cattle at a reasonable prioe they
would be very glad to buy that stock in the
West and feed it in the winter Vùne. But they
must have somne assurance of a market. I think
my suggestion would get over. the present
difficulty.
As Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture I would have accepted the proposai of
the lionourable leader opposite to bring the
officials concerned before our committee; but
I understand that we are adjourning for two
weeks, and as this is a very live issue today
it would then be just too late to do anything.

Hon. TVA C. FALLIS: Honourable senators, I should like first of aIl to associate
myself with those who have preceded me in
extending my congratulations to his Hon-our
the Speaker, and also to the mover and the
seconde of the AddTeas in reply to -theSpeech
from the Throne, wbo, along with the honourable leader on the Government side (Hoa.
Mr. Robertson), bave directed 'their attention
mainly to the matters therein referred to.
Perhaps I may be allowed for a few moments
to speak upon a problem, of major importance
to the people of this country, but which
received no more than a passing nod in the
Speech from the Throne--the probîema of
employmelnt.
While primarily a Government responsibility, this matter is of vital eoncern to us ail.
We are aIl equally anxious to find the right
answer to the problem. Probabîy sîl of us
bave our own individuel ideas concerning the
solution. It may be that froin the pooling
of these ideas some benefit wili corne, or some
assistance towards the solution of the problein.
My personal opinion today is fundsmentally the saine as the one I have expressed in
this House on more than one occasion during
the past two or Vhree years. The three main
points, the vital points in my estimation, are
these. First, it is the primary responsibility
of the governient of a country te. provide
work in so far as it is humnanly possible, and
to provide adequate remuneration for that
work. Second, it is the first responsibility of
the individua:l citizen to accept that work and
to do it to the best of bis ability, in so far
as he is physically and mentally capable. In
the third place, I believe that the xueasure of
a country's greatness is stiil the measure of
thrift, of energy and initiative of the average
individual citizen~
Some Hon. SENATORS:- Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. FAILIS: -and that parliamentary legislation and government leadership
should be ýaimed towarde developing, and not
destroying, those characteristies in the
individual.
I firmly believe that -the situation in which
Labour and Government find themselves today could have been avoided to a large extent
if the Government during the past few years
had spent less time and thought on overzealous pa'ternalism, and had laid more stress
on the responsibiity of the individual. When,
during the recent 'federal election cam-paigu,
and since, the Minister of Labour met every
question regarding employment with the airy
answer: "There are jobs for alI, and to spare,"
the workers naturally concîuded that the iMinister meant what he said, and they were to

SENATE

be kept at the jobs they were doing, at the
same wages. If, instead of adopting that
attitude, the Government had told the workers frankly and repeatedly over a period of
time that conversion would involve the transforment of industrial workers from one type
of industry to another, and serious readjustments, in order te provide jobs for all, and
that farmers, who by thousands had answered
the call for help to make munitions, would
have to return at the cessation of hostilities to
their neglected and unworked farms in order
to perform the equally patriotic and essential
task of providing urgently-needed food; if
women had been told that the need of work
was to be the yardstick of employment, and
that if they had good homes, and husbands
earning enough to support them, they should
not hold a job which to another person meant
bread, I believe a different attitude of mind
would have been developed among the workers. But now, having been led to believe certain things, the workers are naturally looking to
the Government to fulfil its promise; and the
fulfilment of that promise is not going to be
as easy as the Minister of Labour has led
them to believe. However, serious as this
difficulty may -be for a short time, it is unlikely that it will constitute a major problem.
That will come later, and it is upon the
prospects and plans for permanent employment that I should like to speak to you for a
few minutes to-day.
The majority of thinking people in Canada
realize that the war emergency, with its natural
accompaniment of full employment, could be
folilowed' a few years hence by an emergency
of a different type but none the less seriousthe type of emergency which we experienced
to some extent two or three years after the
close of the last war, and to a much greater
extent in the 1930's. It is because of this grim
expcrience of the past that today all governmental bodies, as well as leaders in the industrial and business worlid and in the community
life in general, are striving as never before
te blueprint the future.
As one who lives in a city small in
population, but great in the proportionate
contributions which it makes te the industrial
life of the nation, I have been extremely
interested, in trying to find out from some of
our industrial experts how the future appears
te them. In our town, with a population of
only 33,000, we have a greatly diversified
industrial field, which inceludes the Canadian
General Electrie Company, the Quaker Oats
of Canada, the Western Clock Company,
Raybestos, Dominion Woollens, DeLaval,
Nashua Paper and many others. Att these

·

Hon. Mrs. FALLIS.

plants have, of course, been running at peak
capacity during the war. Now the people of
the town and surrounding district are expecting
these industries te continue to employ the
same nümber of workers in the years te come
as they have been employing through the war
years. Indeed, the people expect even more
than that; they expect that in addition these
plants will absorb a substantial percentage of
the men and women from the town and
district who have been in uniform and are
now return.ing to civilian life. Well, the
opinion of the few industrial leaders with
whom I have discussed this matter is simply
that it cannot be donc. And what is true of
one town with such diversified industrial activity will probably be truc of other cities
great and small across the Dominion.
Please remember that I am speaking now of
permanent employment, not of the boom
period which we expect te come soon and te
last until we catch up with the back-log of
scarcity and demand. I stress this point, that
industrv wili not be able to provide indefinitely
the high scale of employment that is expected
of it. I stress that point because in almost
all the plans I have seen or beard of, and in
all the statements that I bave read- concerning
the question of empl'oyment, the central theme
is that industrv must do this, that or the
other thing to take up the slack and prevent
unemployment.
And when people speak of
industry in that way they do net include in
their thinking such activities as mining, forestry or reconstruction, but only manufacturing.
If we study statisties provided by the
Canada Year Book and other reliable sources
we realize that more is being expected of our
industrial plants than• they will be able to
perform. The latest total estimate which I
have seen of employable persons at present
available is 4,700,000. At the peak of peacetime employment before the crash of 1929
there were employed in manufacturing plants
667,000 workers. If to this figure we add 5
per cent for expansion, plus 100,000 te allow
for increased export trade and optimism, we
still have a total of only 800,000 workers, or
something less than 17 per cent of the total
number of employable persons as the estimated maximum that could be absorbed in
manufacturing plants. I am told by the Department of Labour that at the end of 1943
there were 1,241,068 persons employed in industrial plants. Even if we concede that the
number of women and other war workers, such
as construction workers and farmors, who
leave these plants voluntarily will equal the
number of ex-service men and women return-

SEPTEMBER 13, 1945
ing to their jobs in these plants, we still have
a huge surplus of workers who muet lie provided for.
My firat reaotion to these figures was the
question, "Well, why cannot industry expand
and so employ more then Vhis estimated
number of workers?" The answer eeeme to
be that industry can and probably will expand, but that, todey an increase in the production of goods does noV necesearily mean a
proportionate increase in the number of workers. We have Vo face the stern reality that,
because -of the steady increase in the amounit
of electric power used per cmployce, plus
better tools, plus a constant fiow of new
labour saving inventions, the contînuous trend
in indjustry today is towards the production
of more and more go-ode with less and les
labour.
0f course, dburing the firet yeare of peace
there w.ill ýun'doubtedly be a gr.eat demand for
rehabilitation equipment for the devastated
countries. Muoh of this muet go abroad as
a gif t, or on long terni credite; but irrespective of who pays for ths material there will
lie for some ýtime a market for more than the
normnal amount of manufactured produets.
But again, as with the domestic market, Vhe
extra employaient provided will be of a, more
or less temporary nature. Ncvertlieless it. will
be of great value in giving the country time
to prepare for the days; that lie beyond the
boom perioýd, the days when production
catches up with deficit. Then will ýcome the
creatio>n of the inevitable surplus that spelîs
depression.
It seeme Vo me that there is nio sense in
work which has noV a. definite objective, work
whýich does noV prodîuce needed goods or
services. To insist that any manufacturing
plant shaîl give work, wliether or noV there
is a demand for Vhe plantsa product, lias
always appeared Vo me to be stupid. But J
do nlot pretend to lie an economist. Perliape
I have been taking a rather peseimistie view
of the long-range possibilities of employmient
in this country.
If we approacli the problem from another
angle and recognize that expansion along other
lines of national industry and extension of
services to the people are just as neoessary as
expansion in industrial plants, we can form a
mucli more optimistic picture -of the future.
For exemple, I think we could do with a little
more Governuient interest in our forests and
mines. Speaking along Vhis liue on the 22nd of
Auguet, the Riglit Rev. R. J. Renison, Anglican Bisliop of Moosonee, prophesied a postwar boom in tliat district. 'He said tho Precambrien shield and black spruce mean hope,
wealth and employment for many times the

29

hundred thousand people who have settled
there, and that this land of gold and pulp
is the hope of the future of Ontario. He
based ths statement on the fact that gold and
pulp are among the most fundamental needs
of present day economica. That this fact is
appreciated by private enterprise 1.8evidenced
in the announcement made on September 7
of the intention of .the Marathon Paper Mile
of Canada to spend at least 815,000,000 in construction of a new plant on the north shore of
Lake Superior and te employ 1,500 men there.
The nation could co-operate with private
enterprise, and do its share liy carrying on
more reforestation and by employing a greatly
jncreased number of men in the care and protection of our forests. In the year 1941 alone
we lest 1,745 million cubie feet of merchantable
timber through fire and insecte. We hear much
about the cost of adequate forest protection,
but very littie about the huge loas to the
country whicli occurs year after year owing ta
lack of adequate protection.
One of our greatest sources of new wealth,
the mining induetry of Canada, hae lain practically dormant throughout the war years
because of scarcity of material and labour.
Now it only awaits the green liglit to become
once more one of our major industries and
open up another great avenue of employment.
As a woman I was partîcularly interested ini
the visit to Ottawa a week or two ago. of
Mrs. Viola MacMillan, firet woman president
of the Prospectors' and Developere' Association of Ontario. The report of an interview
that appeared in an Ottawa paper stated that
she had come to Ottawa to leaen from government officials what the plans are for power
and transportation in the Northwest Territories. She said that the association of which
she is president was sponsoring a ten-year plan
to encourage suitable young men to go into
mining, by getting them to attend prospectore'
classes and helping them to get jobs. My idea
is that it would lie well worth while for the
Government to assist in every possible way
corporations and individuels who are willing
and financially able to open up additional
avenues of employment, and that a strong
endeavour sliould be made now to direct
people away from the idea that jobs are to be
found only in manufacturing plante.
Another answer to the question "Where
ehall we look for additional permanent cmployment in the years aliead?" is to be found
in the extension of needed, useful services.
I would mention these three as outstanding
exemples: first, conservation of our natuýral
resources; second, increaeed recreational facilitics; third, extension of health services.

SENATE

30

No one needs to stress in this Chamber the
importance of measures that have been taken
to conserve our natural resources. We all
know that there is a great field for increased
employment in the extension of such measures. I am, of course, quite aware of the
fact that much has been talked of along these
lines, and some things have been donc; but
what bas been donc bas usually been of a
comparatively minor nature to meet some
special need, and not as part of a planned
national economy with the objective of providing employment. No one, for instance,
will dispute the important effect conservation measures can have in preserving and
regulating our water power, which is closely
interlocked with our forest problems and
forest wealth. Of the four greatest sources of
wealth in Canada, namely, our farms, forests,
mines, and electrical power, three are vitally
affected by what we do, or fail to do, in
conservation, and there is room for great
extension of employment in this field.
The extension of recreational services would
embrace a wide variety of items ranging all
the way from the creation of more great
National Parks and the granting of more
large-scale support for cultural subjects to
more playgrounds for children.
The third field for extension of services
which I mentioned is the field of health
and medical services and here, of course, the
possibilities are almost unlimited, for medical services would include education and
sanitation as well as the services of doctors
and nurses; also the providing of hospitals
and sanitoriums. This bas been for years one
of our most pressing national needs, and yet
year after year we have seen the National
Health Bill pigeon-holed on one pretext or
another, while family allowances, not nearly
so urgent a need, was made law almost
over night. Of course, I freely acknowledge
that the latter was much more spectacular and
a much better vote getter.

Opposition
planned extension of services such as I have
outlined is based on the belief that the cost
would be a heavy burden on the taxpayer. I
do not think that would be so. Increased
activity in mining and lumbering would be a
source of new wealth, and the services I
have mentioned would from a national viewpoint, soon become almost, if not entirely,
self-sustaining because of the additional employment given in other parts of our national
life to meet these requirements.
By way of illustration, I may remind bonourable senators that recently the GovernHon. Mrs. FALLIS.

sum sufficient to erect a new Sick Children's

accommodation throughout the Dominion
were to be adequately met, that building
should be duplicated in the other provinces.
From the employment angle it is obvious
that the building, equipping and staffing of
these hospitals would require not only the
services of doctors and nurses and maintenance staffs, but as well would provide
employment in the building trades and in the
factories which turn out the equipment
required.
Speaking of cost, if we do not provideemployment for our people, we shall find that
this becomes expensive too. Honourable
members will appreciate what it costs, not
only in money but also in lessened physical
efficiency and in the lowered morale of our
people, when thousands of families are on
relief.
So in closing I come back to my original
theme, that to me it seems a mistake to
place so much of the onus of prevention of
unemployment on our industrial plants alone,
and that a great and useful service could be
performed by the Government planning now
for intensive development of our natural
resourees and extension of useful services to the
people as part of a long-range source of perinanent employment. I believe that if this
policy were carried out in so far as it is practical and feasible, it would pay us valuable
national dividends in the form of much needed
permanent employment, with its resultant
higher average standard of living, more healthy
minds in healthy bodies, and a better all-round
citizenship.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. A. C. HARDY: I did not wish to
interrupt the honourable lady senator during
ber speech. Now that she bas resumed her
seat, will she tell us who made a promise that
jobs would be found for everyone at present
wages, and when and where such promise was
made?
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: I think the honourable
senator bas misunderstood me. I did not say
that that was a promise. I said the Minister
of Labour had stated over and over again
that there were jobs for all and to spare, and
that the workers naturally concluded that be
meant they were to be kept in their present
jobs at their present wages. That is the conclusion they drew from the Minister's statement; it was not a statement by me.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: It was the idea of labour
itself.

Honaurable senatars, I arn not going ta
diseuss the Speech from the Throne at any

the time-honoured tradition, in that it gathers
volume as the years rail on and that what it
disciases of Government paiicy is in inverse
ratio to its length.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: If this tradition continues to ho, follaowed, what the Speech from
the Throne will become in the next few years
it is difficuit ta say. I have always feit that
the iess the Speech from. the Throne says the
better. Apparently it is meant ta bide what
is realiy behind the mind of the Administration-always a wise course. It is the
course Sir Oliver Mowat pursued for some
thirty years, and I venture to say very few
Speeches from the Throne contain more wisdam and give iess reai information than thase
which that wonderful aid statesman used ta
prepare for the Ontario Legisiature.
I wish to convey my compliments ta all
our new senators, ta His Honour the Speaker
on his appointment ta his high position, and
ta the mover and -the seconder of the Address
ini reply ta the Speech from. the Throne.
This is the second tîmýe within five years
that we have been able ta congratulate twa
new leaders taking office at the same tirne.
I wish thern a very happy -tenure of leadership for man-y years ta corne on their respective sides of the House-as they are ta-day.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: I was much interested
in the very liberal and generous speech of
the honaurabie leader on the ather side of
the House (Hon. Mr. Haig). Apparently he
could nat find very much ta criticize in the
Speech frorn the Throne. I do nat biame
him for his failure, nar arn I surprised at it,
because, although it does not say too rnuch,
I think it is very satisfactory ta the people
at large.
The honourabie gentleman deait at sorne
iength with the merits of the single transferable vote. While probalyy many students of
electorai reform wiii agree with every word
he said, it is questionabie whether its adoption wouid not ernphasize and peopetuate the
groups which he hopes the single tra.nsferabie
vote rnight abolish. Whether it wouid or flot
I do not know. But I have a solution to
offer hirn whicb wouid be effective irnrediateiy, and, I think, very satisfactory: let
the good aid Tory party corne holus bolus
inta the great Liberal party.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.

à

Hon. Mr. HARDY: 1 think our friends
opposite would finl -an organization readymade for them, and there would be no difficulty in choosing a leader or, if necessary,
arranging for a doubie-barrelied leadership.
I believe it wouid do the Liberal party good
to have wjth it a somewhat middle-of-theroad party, as the Conservative party has
become, since so far as I can see the Liberal
party is bound heil-for-leather down the road
in competition with the C.C.F.-probably in
an endeavour ta eut it off. The moderating
influence of our friends on the other side
might at least hait the rush in that direction
by the present Administration. I arn not
going to criticize the Administration on that
account. It may be quite right. Time will
show.
While I do not suppose my honourabie
friends across the aisie will take what I say
seriously, there is one thing which I have no0
doubt will follow before very long. Unless
the two old parties, either separately or together, start a real system of education for
the electors of this country, we shall find the
cornrunistic forces headed by the C.C.F. Party
taking a very much stronger position in our
public life than they are to-day. That party
is composed largely of preachers and pedagogues, and there is neyer a day that those
gentleman are not educating the electorate.
They have been brought up ta do that, and
they have made a wonderful job of it, whether
we like it or not. If we cannot get preachers
and pedagogues, then we shall have ta get
publicans and sinners out of our political parties ta undertake the work; but the sooner
they do it with a weil-thought-out system the
better it will be for this country. I offer that
suggestion ta my honourable friends opposite.
I can offer it even more st.rongiy to the
Liberal party, because being in power it can
take -a lead in such educational work. Let me
add that we shall always be giad ta receive
aur friends on the other side. There wili be
a light in the window ta welcome them, and
I do not think they wouid feel too unhappy
in the Liberai foid.

EMERGENCY SITTINGS OF THE
SENATE
NOTICE OF MOTION

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON rose
to give notice of the following motion:
That for the duration of the present session
of Parliament, should an emergency arise during
any adjournment of the Senate, which would in
the opinion of the Honourable the Speaker
warrant that the Senate meet prior to the
time set forth in the motion for such adjournment, the Honourable the Speaker be authorized
to notify honourable senators at their addresses
as registered with the Clerk of the Senate to
ameet at a time earlier than that set out in
the motion for such adjournment. and nonreceipt by any one or more honouraie senators
of such call shall not have any effect upon the
sufliciency and validity thereof.
He said: I am a little in doubt as to the
need for this particular resolution which, if
I am not mistaken, was associated particularly
with war measures. However, I thought that
to present it would do no harm, since in the
event of some unforeseen contingency it
might facilitate the business of the House
and meet the convenience of those members
who live at a great distance from the capital.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I am agreeable to the resolution being
set down on the clear understanding that it
be net treated as a precedent. As the honourable senator has very properly said, we passed
a similar motion in order to meet any contingency arising during the war. The Minister
of Justice in the other place has said that
the war is not yet over, but I doubt tEe correctness of his statement. I would suggest
that in future sessions a motion of this kind
be not presented.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: This is simply a notice
of motion.
The Hon. the SPEAKER:

Yes, it

is a

MEAT RATIONING
STATEMENT BY GOVERNMENT LEADER

On the Notices of
Hon. WISHART
Honourable senators
last sitting I stated
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

Inquiries and Motions:
McL. ROBERTSON:
will recall that at our
that, if satisfied of the

necessity of meat rationing, rentals control
and other similar measures, we should do
everything in our power to facilitate them.
In response to my remarks the honourable
senator from South Bruce (Hon. Mr. Donnelly) referred to meat rationing and offered
some specifie suggestions for providing a
ready market for our cattle. He added that
this was a very live issue, and requested that
the Government give it consideration during
the adjournment of the Senate.
His suggestions apparently were based on
the assumption that Canadian stock raisers
and meat producers have had difficulty in
finding a ready market for their cattle, and
he proposed that a government agency
should be set up to buy the cattle, process
them and send the beef to Europe. He presumably felt that this would create a more
satisfactory situation with respect to price,
delivery and shipment, and would encourage
the buying and feeding of stocker and feeder
cattle.
I am advised that the buying and selling of
cattle during recent weeks has been carried
on at unprecedented levels. The published
reports of the Department of Agriculture
indicate that during the four weeks ending
September 15, slaughter of cattle under federal inspection in Canada amounted to 162,661
head. This compares with a figure of 107,629
in the corresponding four weeks in 1944. The
slaughter for 1944 established a record for
that particular period of the year. The
slauglter during this particular period of 1945
not only greatly exceeded that of 1944, but
also created a record for any consecutive four
weeks.
The honourable senator referred to a carryover of 2,500 cattle in the Toronto stockyards
on September 12. I am advised that this is
not an abnormal number of cattle to be carried over from one day to the next, particularly in midweek. Normally, cattle arrive at
the stockyards in large numbers on the first
two or three days of the week. When packing plants are working to near capacity the
cattle cannot all be killed on the day on
which they arrive. However, it is worth noting that by the end of the week the stockyards had been practically cleared of slaughter
cattle, so that picking plants had to depend
upon early arrivals in the following week to
continue full-scale slaughtering operations on
Monday.
As to cattle prices, all market reports indicate that for some weeks past slaughter cattle
have brought prices equal to or better than
those prevailing -one year earlier, when meat
rationing was not in effect and was not even
under discussion. It is true that the prices

OCTOBER 3, 1945
of stocker and feeder cattle have been slightlY
lower this year than last year, but only by
a matter of from 25 to 40 cents per hundred
pounds. Sucli difference as lias existed, hoever, constitutes an added inducernent to
farmers to buy unfinished cattle for further
feeding.
That farmers have taken advantage of the
opportunity is indicated hy the fact that during the four weeks period under consideration
the stocker and feeder cattle returning to the
country numbered 22,833, as compared with
19.398 in the corresponding four weeks of 1944.
This large movement of stocker and feeder
cattle to the country indicates a greater than
normal purchase of feeder cattle for finishing
and later delivery to the markets. The
recorded figures are. of course. in addition to
the very large unrecorded volume of transactions carried on d'irectly bctween farmers in
the country.
As to the suggestion that the Government
might buy cattie and bave them killed, and
the meat proccssed and sent to Europe, it is
only necessary to point out that the killing
and processing facilities available in the country are already bcing used almost to the limait
of their capacity. The intervention of the
Government as a buyer and seller could flot
increase the number of cattle slaughtered or
the amount of meat delivered. IL might, indeed, have the cffcct of temporarily slowing
up the present high rate of activity by the
interjection of a new and untried method of
doing business at a time whcn marketings are
extremely heavy.
If there is any "bottleneck" impeding the
movement to Great Britain and Europe of the
record quantities of beef now being produced
in Canada, it is in the limited capacity of
available freezing eqoipment rather ihan in
the slaughter of cattle. Fresh beef, in order
to be deliverable in good condition to Great
Britain, must be hard-frozen before leaving
Canada. Moreover, it must be frozen within
a few days after killing, and must be kept
frozen continuously until delivered to the
trade in Britain. Beef when sold in the Canadian market is normally not frozen. Consequently, when cattle slaughtcr is heavy and
beef is divertcd from domestic to export
channels, freezer capacity may become the
limiting factor in the volume exported. Freezers in Canada are now being used to their
practical limait, and there is every reason to
cxpect that a continuance of freezing at the
preseot rate will take care of the volume of
beef that may become available for shipment
to the UJnited Kingdom.

One other method of exporting beef, namely,
canning, is available to us, and this also is
being used very largeiy at the present time.
The full utilization of canning equipment reduces the demand for freezer space, and Wlso
makes possible the delivery of meat to destinations which canno-t acoept fresh frozen beef
because of a lack of refrigeration -facilities at
the delivery point. Ail of the meat going
from Canada to the liberated countries of
western Europe and to UNRRA is being canned, because this is the only forrn in rwhich
meat can be generally distributed in those
countries without serious spoilage.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Mr. Speaker, I do
not want to object to what my honourable
friend is saying, but lis remarks are out of
order. This is nlot an answer to any question.
The honourable senator from South Bruce,
(Hon. Mr. Donnelly) in dealing with the
Speech from the Throne, made a statement.
The honourable leader opposite has already
spoken on the Speech from the Throne, and
there is no way we can answer what he is now
saying. He is out of order. The statement he
is *making should *be made in -aenswer to a
question from this side Qf the House. I arn
not objecting to the statement, but I suggest
that, in order to make it legal, the honourable
senator should move that the subi ect be
referred to the Committee on Agriculture for
investigation and report baek to this House.
Then honourable senators would have an opportunity to speak as they wished.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I think the honourable leader opposite and other honourable
meýmbers will recall that the honourable senator for South Bruce took occasion to
refer specifically to, the suggestion which I
have made, namely, that if my honourable
friend was not satisfied as to the necessity« for
rationing, it would seem to be an excellent
idea to refer the question to the appropriate
committee, so that explanations could be given.
You will recaIl, honourable senators, that the
honourable gentleman from South Bruce approved of the suggestion, and spoke on it
speeifieally because, as we were about to adjourn for two weeks, he felt there was flot
time enough to carry it out; but *he thought
the matter of sufficient importance to be
brought before the House at once.
I took cognizance of 'his remarks and immediately had the matter referred to, the -appropriate source for a specific answer to the
suggestion he had made, feeling that it was a
motter -of urgent importance. I arn now taking the first opportunity I have had to answer.
If I have tre.spassed too grently, I would ask
the indulgence of honourable senators. I very

34

SENATE

much appreciate the constructive suggestion
which was made, because information is allimportant in this matter.
Honourable senators will appreciate that in
a matter of this kind I am not in a position
to debate in detail with honourable senators
who have a very wide knowledge of the subject.
I have answered as best I can as soon as
possible, and if honourable senators are not
satisfied with the sufficiency of the answer,
I would suggest that they move to have the
matter referred to the appropriate committee
so that they can hear the explanation as is
deemed desirable. I arm sure that this House
would give sympathetic considieration to such
a motion.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, as this is a tremendously important
question, I would suggest to the honourable
leader that such a motion be made, and if
no one opposite will make it, I shall be very
glad to move that this question be referred
to the Committee on Agriculture. When their
report reaches this House we can go into a
Committee of the Whole, and thus ail members
will be able to take part in the debate.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators, may I suggest that time be given to
bring witnesses, such as shippers from Western
Canada, before the Committee?
The honourable leader has been reading some
figures as to the amount of stock which has
been handled. In that connection I should
like to say that on Monday last I was in
Winnipeg with a carload of cattle from home,
and at that time the Commissioner told me
that since meat rationing had gone into effect
cattle were off two cents and heavy calves
were down three cents a hundred during all of
last week. This applies to the whole of
Western Canada. There is very strong complaint as to what the management of the Meat
Board meant to the producer. That is what the
honourable senator from South Bruce (Hon.
Mr. Donnelly) referred to a couple of weeks
ago. Apparently all the Government is
interested in is securing the beef, regardless
of what the producer gets for it.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I beg again to
remind honourable senators of what they themselves must be cognizant, that I am not in a
position to debate this subject. I have taken
the first opportunity to present the statement
handed to me in reply to the request of the
honourable senator from South Bruce, and I
have followed that up by suggesting that if
that statement is net deemed sufficient we
might proceed as the honourable senator from
Alma (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) has proposed.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Finish your statement.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I am through.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Do I understand the honourable leader is now going to
move that the question be referred to the
Committee on Agriculture?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I think the honourable senator from Alma should frame an
appropriate motion, for I assume he will be
specific as to what the motion involveswhether it is te cover the whole subject of
meat rationing or the specific subject brought
to our attention by the honourable member
from South Bruce-in order that we may
know what particular officials are to be summoned before the committee. I would suggest that the regular procedure would be for
the honourable senator to give notice of his
motion for the consideration of the Senate.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: In order to
regularize our proceedings I would suggest
that notice of motion be given setting forth
in specific terms the question to be inquired
into. Then when the motion comes before
the House hQnourable members can express
their views in regard to it.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Honourable senators, it
does not seen to me to be absolutely necessary that notice of motion be given. The
subject-matter already has been debated in
this House and we have had at least two
speeches on it. If I am in order, I would
move that the subject-matter now under discussi'on be committed to the Commýittee on
Agriculture.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Meat rationing.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: If the subjectmatter can be specifically stated in a notice
of motion, it would be the more regular
course to follow. The present discussion has
arisen on the calling of "Notices of Inquiries
and Motions". The debate on the Address
is to be resumed to-day and probably will
continue for some time; there will be ample
opportunity to proceed as I have suggested.

SENATE
There is one word more of a preliminary
character which I wish to say, particularly to
the large number of members who have
recently joined this assembly. You have been
warmly received already, and nothing that I
might say could add to the cordiality of your
reception, but I should like to assure you that
I join most heartily in the welcome. I should
like, however, to offer to you one observation
and one suggestion. The observation is that
you will find this to be a very friendly and
a very appreciative assembly. This House
welcomes members who take its work seriously and play their part in its debates and
committees. I would add that I know of no
deliberative assembly which is more generous
in its judgment of speeches made by those
who have a contribution to make, or more
appreciative of hard work done by its members. I think-if I may -again for a moment
address the new members-that as in many
other things, you will get ont of this Senate
just about as much as you are willing to
put into it.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: If you take an
active part in our discussions and work hard
in our committees you will find compensation
in the admiration, the esteem, yes, and the
affection of your fellow-members.
My suggestion to the new members is that
you take an active part in our dýebates. We are
glad to hear new voices, andt fresh points of
view are always welcome here. It is true of
course that during the war the activities of this
Chamber have been somewhat curtailed and
the amount of useful work possible to it bas
been somewhat limited. That condition I
hope is rapidly passing away. If you will for
a moment glance at the legislative programme
for the present session, particularly in the
field of international affairs, set forth in the
Speech from the Throne, you will sec a
number of subjects in regard to which I think
this House could do very useful work. We
have, for instance, a reference to the approval
by Parliament of the United Nations organization set up as a result of the conference at
San Francisco; we shall have to deal with
participation by this country in the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for
Reconstruction and Development to be set
up as a result of the Bretton Woods conference; we shall have to deal with the question
of mutual aid for the rehabilitation in large
measure of the countries of Europe. Those
matters are all referred to in the Speech
from the Throne.
Hon. Mr HUGESSEN.

Now, honourable senators, those are matters of vast import, and they fall outside the
region of ordinary partisan activities with
which we associate, and quite rightly, the
lower Chamber. It seems to me that the
Senate of Canada can make a great contribution to the public life of this country by
taking upon itself the function of deliberating
upon international affairs in the same way
that assemblies of similar character do in
other countries. I refer particularly to the
House of Lords in England and to the Senate
of the United States.
The mention of international affairs leads
me to the few topies which I wish te consider
in relation to the Speech from the Throne.
We have come to the end of the war, and
sometimes I think it would be advisable if
we were to pause and try te determine in
our own minds what position Canada has
reached as a result of six years of war.
Now and then we are apt net to realize quite
as fully as we might that this country lias
advanced very rapidly in international rank.
We are now one of the important nations of
the world. We were recognized at San Francisco as one of the most important of the
midd.le powers, taking rank immediately behind those five great aggregations: the United
States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, France
and China. Perhaps sometimes we are net
quite sufficiently accustomed to that idea; but
that is the position we have reached in the
world today, and it behooves us to lay our
plans and shape our policies accordingly. In
the eyes of the world Canada lias reached a
position of considerable importance.
That being so, I welcome those parts of
the gracious Speech which tend to lay emphasis on our emergence as a nation. I refer
particularly to those two passages which relate to a Canadian flag and te Canadian
citizenship. Dealing first with the question of
a Canadian flagHon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: May I be allowed to ask the honourable senator this
question? I am not against a Canadian flag,
but inasmuch as the Parliament of Canada
bas not yet adopted a Canadian flag, why is
it that the Union Jack has been lowered and
our merchant marine flag substituted for it?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: As I am net a
member of the Government, that is a question
which my honourable friend should address
to the leader on this side, not to me.
Let me quote the Speech from the Throne
with reference to the question of a Canadian
flag:
My Ministers believe that the position
attained by our country among the nations of
the world makes it desirable that Canada. like
the other nations of the British Commonwealth,

ehould possess a distinctive national flag. You
will be asked to appoint a select- committee of
members of hotb Houses of Parliament to consider a suitable design for a Canadian flag.
Now wbat is a national flag? Surely it is a
symbol of nationhood; it is the outward and
visible sign of all those feelings, traditions,
hopes and aspirations, wbich go to make up a
nation. I feel that it will be an excellent tbing
for us to bave in this 'country a symbol to
wbich we can all look up in that way. Now
I do not wish to be misunderstood. I am proud
of the Union Jack.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: It gives me a thrill
to see it flutter in the breeze. It lias served
us well during the formative period of our
country. We have been bappy to live under it,
and we have enjoyed its protection. We know
what if means as the. flag of a great and, proud
nation, the Britisb people, wbo have rendered
great service to the world-great and distinguished service-and not greater at any
tinie th-an during the past six years.
Hon. Mr. HORNFdI: Wbat is the matter
with it now?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Tbe fact remains
tbat it is the flag of Great Britain. It bas
no particular designation to show that it bas
any special connection witb Canada; andI,
as tbe Speech fromn the Throne indicated, I
think it is now time for us, like the otber
members of the British Commonwealth, to
design a flag of our own.
We are f0 bave a joint parliamentary committee to consider the'dýesign andtI f make a
report. I have given some thought to this
question of a national flag, and for what if
may be wortb, 1 offer some suggestions to the
Huse. It seems f0 me that it should fulfil
tbree requirements. First, it should incorporate
in a position of prominence and honour the
Union Jack. None of our people would have
it otherwise. By so doing it wiIl give evidence
of our membersbip in the British family of
nations, and will he an indication of the netural
origin of about one-haîf of our people, who
trace their ancestry firom -the British Iles.
The second essential to my mind, is that it
should include in a position of prominence
and bonour some symbol or design to represent the blood of France that flows in the
veins of nearly one-third of our citizens. May
I remind honourable senators that our citizens
in wbose veins flows the blood of France are
the descendants of those who first settled in
this land; andI it is tbey who have a better
title, or at any rate an older title than any
of tbe rest of us, to caîýl themnselves Canadians.

3

The third requiremnent sbould be that our
flag must bear some symbol or emblemn that
is distinctive of our own country, and wbich
ail the world will recognize as such. 1 suggest
that the emblemn migbt be, for instance, the
maple leaf or some similar emblem. A fourth
element which 1 think would be desirable, is
that our national flag should be as simple in
design as possible. That might be difficult of
attainment in vie.w of the three prerequisites
wbich I have just mentioned; but, to the
extent possible, I believe that our flag should
be simple in design and not too intricate ini
pattern. A national flag, after ahl, should be
clear and plain for ail the world to see. It
would be a mistake, I think, to try to put too
much or represent too mucb in our national
flag. No doubt the matter will be gone into
wxth great tboroughneas by the joint parliamentary committee, and after their investigation I arn sure tbey will achieve a satisfactory
result.
Now on the question of Canadian citizenship, the gracious Speech from the Tbrone
has this to say:
The Governent aleo considers that it is
advisable to revise and clnrify the definition
of Canadian citizenship, and to bring the legislation respecting national status, naturalization
and. immigration jnto conformity with the
definition of citizenship. You will be asked to
approve the required measures.
The measures have flot yet been brought
down, and therefore we have no details of
them. However, generally speaking, I should
like to say th-at I welcome any steps which
will place more emphasis on our present statua
and leas on our racial antecedents. 1 think that
in the past in this country there-bas been too
great a tend-ency to classify ourselves according
to racial originsq, wbich in many oases were so
remote as to lose aIl possible meaning. How,
for instance, can you designate as an EnglishCanadian a man whose family bas lived in this
country for the past four or five generations,
and wbo bas in his racial strain not only
English, but perhaps part Irish, Dutch an-dl
German bloodr? How can you classify as a
French-Canadian a man whose ancestors have
been in this country for tbree hundred years,
and who, very likely bas, as so many have,
Scotch ad other blcod intermýingled witx
bis French blood? I.t seems to me that a man
of that kind would have a righ.t to cali himself
a Canadian, pure and simple, witbout any
reference to bis ancestral origin..
Some Hon. SENATOR-S: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: People in thîs
country are too prone to classify themselves,
and to allow their government to, classify
tbem, as English-Canadians, French-Cana-

SENATE

38

dians, Danish-Canadians or Ukrainian-Canadians, or hyphenated Canadians of some kind
or another. The tendency has been to emphasize the racial origin at the expense of the
"Canadian". I think that is wrong. Keep
the prefix if you like, but place the emphasis
on the suffix. Let us emphasize our united
future and not our divided past. For that
reason I welcome any legislation, such as is
now foreshadowed, which will embody the
idea of Canadian citizenship; that will be
equally the right and equally the pride of
everyone of us.
Now it is idie to deny that in this vast
country we have great diversities of racial
origins, tongues, beliefs and interests. But
let me ask you to consider these diversities
in the light of the position that Canada bas
achieved in the world of to-day. The outside world knows nothing, and cares less,
about these diversities. I was mueh struck by
a remark which was made to me a few days
ago by a boy who bas just returned from
four years of service with our armed forces.
He was commenting on our tendency in this
country to classify ourselves by our racial
origin, or by the province from which we
happen to come. This is substantially what
he said: "In England, in Italy, in Belgium
and, yes, in Germany, we were looked upon,
and we looked upon ourselves, as Canadians.
Nobody was interested in our racial origin or
in the part of the country from which we
came. By the peoples of those countries we
were accepted and welcomed as Canadians.
We represented the strength. the goodwill,
the riches and the help that the narme
'Canada' bas come to mean to the other
nations of the world."
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Now I suggest to
you that that is a feeling which exists in the
minds of every one of the boys in our fighting
forces vhen. with their hearts full of hope,
they turn their faces homeward to the land of
their birth. I suggest that we should follow
their example; that from now on we should sec
ourselves as the people of other nations sec
us, and think of ourselves as the peoples of
other nations think of us. Likewise, we should
think of ourselves as, together, constituting
one nation-a nation which bas an important
part to play and an important contribution to
make to the world of today and of tomorrow.
It is a truism, of course, it is a thing which
bas been said countless times during the last
few years by many tongues far more eloquent
than mine. that no nation can any longer live
to itself alone. In the modern world isolationism as a policy is no longer possible; it is not
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN.

only dead but it is damned. Henceforth our
external relations as a country are going to
be far more important than any of the internal questions on which we may differ from
time to time. If you want proof of that, look
again at the Speech from the Throne and read
how, in paragraph after paragraph, it refers to
matters of international importance of all
kinds.
Honourable senators, I should like to repeat
a very striking phrase that was used, two
or three years ago by the late President
Roosevelt, when he said: "This generation has
a rendezvous with destiny." We in Canada are
now called upon to act as a nation. That is
the reason why I welcome the steps that have
been announced in the gracious Speech with
reference to the Canadian flag and Canadian
citizenship. It seems to me that those steps
will emphasize our national status in the
minds of our own people, and will help us to
develop the mental attitude that we shall
need as we face the world of tomorrow.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. J. J. BENCH: Honourable senators, I
should like, first, to associate myself with the
good wishes expres-sed to the honourable the
Speaker, and to the leaders on this and the
other side of the House, by those who have
preceded me in this debate. I should like also
to add iny voice to the chorus of congratulatons which lias been raised in recognition of
the fine forensic efforts of the mover (Hon.
Mr. Robinson) and the seconder (Hon. Mr.
Dupuis) of the Address in Reply to the Speech
from the Thron-e.
I was admitted to this Chamber under the
leadership of the gentleman who now graces
the Speaker's Chair, and I should like to take
this opportunity of recording my appreciation
of the many courtesies and the good advice
which I have received from him since that
time. These courtesies, I might add, were
reflected in the attitude towards me, as the
youngest member in point of years in this
Chamber, of the honourable member from
Alma (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne), vho bas recently
retired from the leadership of the other side
of the House.
Anyone listening to His Excellency's Speech
nust have shared with me an appreciation of
its underlying theme-Canada. having energed
victorious from the most desperate armed
struggle of its history, may now turn its legislative talents to the happier tasks of peace.
As was said by the honourable gentleman
from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) who immediately preceded me, this Parliament may
now concern itself not with the ugly problems

OCTOBER 3, 1945
of waging war, but with those related to -the
achievenient of a fuller measure of social justice and security, prosperity and happiness, for
our own citizens and those of the other nations
of the world.
This prospect would seemn to signal a broadened horizon of activity for the Senate as one
of the two Houses of our Canadian Parliament. As was pointed out by the honourable
gentleman from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen), during the six years we have been at
w'ar the normal functions of this House have
been very considerably restricted. For the
purpose of most effectively mobîlizing the resources of our nation to meet and defeat
belligerent aggressors, Parliament has seen fit
ta dedegate to the Governor-General in Council and to Crown agencies mucb of -its lawmaking powers. Whether or not we agree that
these delegated powers always have been exercised wisely, none would venture to argue that
the principle of delegation under the impact
of war was not a sound one. However, one
of the _practical results of this step has been
to leave the Senate much less opportunity to
perform ils normal function in the scheme of
Confederation. The overriding needs of the
emergency reduced to comparative unimportance matters associated with the rights and
interests of minorities, not to mention the
rights and interests and even the liberties of
individuals, with ail of which the Senate of
Canada normally must be concerned.
On other occasions, both in and out of this
Chamber, I have ventured ta draw attention
to the position which is held by the Senate of
Canada in our parliamentary structure. Incid.entally, I should like to seize upon this opportunity to convey to honourable senators an
expression of my gratitude for the great
honour wbicb they conferred upon me at the
last session hy spreading on the pages of the
Senate Hansard a copy of a speech made by
me upon this topic at the city of Hamilton.
I do not intend to burden tbis House with a
repetition of what I have previously said on
the general subject of the Senate. I merely
seek the indulgence of honourable senators
for the purpose of respectfully pointing out
what seem to mie to be the expanding apportunities which now lie before this branch of
Parliament. I am convinced that no position
in our parliamentary scheme of tbings, excepting on.ly membership in the Cabinet, offers
greater scope for public service than membership in the Senate. Here we are free of
motives of political prejudice; we are independent of the whims and fancies -of public
favour. We need be concerned only with a
desire to act in the best interests of all
seètions of the Canadian people.

39

Notwithstanding these considerations, il
would be folly not to recognize that the Senate of Canada, as a branch of our Parliament,
has suffered a very substantial loss of prestige
in the eyes of the Canadian public. Il bas
been referred to as an "anachronism" and a
"political limbo". It is so long since it bas
left any positive impression on the public
conscience that many misunderstandings have
arisen as to its purpose and its powers. In
faét, in the writings of certain learned gentlemen who claimn to be authorities on the
constitutional aspects of Canadian Government, one can find considerable evidence of
ignorance of the work of the Senate. Not
long ago, I was amazed to hear il said by a
distinguished member of the legal profession,
one who ought to have known better, tbat the
Senate has no power to initiate legislàtion.
More recently a Saskatoon newspaper, in
commenting upon the appointmaent of the honourable scoator from Vancouver-Burrard (Hon.
Mr. McGeer) described Ibhis House as -the
"lsomnolent arena". I am sorry that the bonourable gentleman is mot at the moment in bis
seat, but knowing bim as we alI do I arn sure
that none of us expect him now to fali
asleep.
One does not like to recaîl these unpleasant
references to the Senate, but if there is to be
a realistie appreciation of the status of this
body in the public mind il would seemn necessary that we be frank witb ourselves and
also with the people of Canada. The sbadow
of the Senate undoubtedly bas been growing
less and less. If it is not to disappear entirely
some-thing miust be, done to improve the place
of the Senate in the parl.iamentary sun. As
every honourable senator knows, 1 arn by no
means the first mefrnber of this Chamber 10
addrcss myscîf to tbis subject. In our records,
diating from shortly after tbe Act of Confederation, there will be found expressions of a similar
nature. Time and again it appears that efforts
have been made by the Senate 'to induce the
Gov.ernmeat to give it moure work to do, so
that il rnay share more directly with the
House of Commons the legislative burden.
But almost all such attempts have proven
abortive.
If, in their wisdom, governments sec no
advantage in using the facilities of the Senate,
then, it would seemn t me, Ibis honourable
House must formulate and execute its own
programme for better serving the purpose for
which it was created.
If honourable senators will give some
thought to the way in wbich our Parliament
funetions as compared witb the Congress of
the United States, they will realize that, wbatever the technical position may be, there is

SENATE
no regular parliamentary forum here in which
public views and criticisms can be heard.
Every member of this honourable House must
at some time have remarked to hinself the
great difference which exists between the
functioning of the Senate of the United States
and that of the Senate of Canada. My own
impression is that, through its committees, the
United States Senate is serving constantly as
a sounding board of public opinion.
This happens only infrequently in Canada.
The reason for this failure I believe is that the
Canadian people have let fall into disuse the
instrument which they have in their Senate and
which very well could serve the same purposes
here as its counterpart serves in the United
States. If Canadians were fully aware of their
opportunity to be heard through the facilities
of the Senate, I think they would take increasing advantage of it. I am equally convinced
that Government loses a great opportunity
in failing to put to active use the means at
its disposal, the proper funetioning of the
Senate, to gain an impression of publie reaction on not only the making of the laws but
their administration.
I was interested to note the remarks made
by the honourable leader on this side (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) when the Senate was last
sitting, and referred to again today by honourable senators on the other side. relative to the
subject of meat rationing. The honourable
leader struck a note which I feel is very much
in the same key as my own thinking. He said
it might be an excellent thing if one of our
efficient committees asked those responsible
for the controls to appear before it and satisfy
honourable senators as to the need for these
measures.
I respectfully suggest that the incipient
revolt against meat rationing is the result of
two things: first, a natural desire to be free of
regimentation after six years of patriotic
submission to such rules; secondly, and probably more important, a lack of conviction
on the part of the people that there is a practical need of the measure to carry out our
obligations to the other nations of the world.
There is possibly a .third reason: I have frequently heard the suggestion that we were
pushed in-to meat rationing by vocal expression
of one or two members of the United States
Senate.
If meat rationing is necessary-and I am
prepared to accept the assurance that it is
necessary-I am perfectly satisfied that the
people of Canada would submit to it readily
and willingly if they were given their day in
court to state their case and hear the Government's side.
Hon. Mr. BENCH.

I have had a little personal experience as a
bureauc:rat, and I know the value of taking
the people into your confidence. As long as
the administration of the Wartime Wages
Control Order was kept as a "hole-in-the-corner" operation in a back room of the Confederation Building it was in constant trouble.
There were strikes and threats of strikes. As
soon as the National War Labour Board made
it a matter of policy to hold its hearings in
public and give the parties concerned an
opportunity to be heard openly the fever
went out of the problem.
If it should still be deemed advisable, as
has been suggested here today, that a committee of this Senate should undertake the
responsibility of holding public hearings on
the matter of meat rationing, I believe we
should not have such exhibitions of revolt
against the Order as we have seen during the
past two or thrce weeks.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. BENCH: Moreover, if that conmittee were able to report in favour of the
measure, it xnight be safely predicted that the
people of this country would accept it willingly and generously and give to the Wartime Prices and Trade Board the co-operation
necessary to make rationing a success-something that agency of Government is not getting
today.
Having referred to the subject of the meat
rationing, it might be appropriate at this
point for me to draw the attention of bonourable members to the current threat of a
nation-wide strike in the packing bouse industry. Press reports indicate that the strike
is to be called for the purpose of enforcing
wage increases. The control of wage and
salary rates in the Dominion is part of the
Federal policy to meet and overcome the
disaster which would result from inflation.
There has been set up under Dominion Government auspices a tribunal for the purpose
of administering this wage control in a manner which is designed to he fair and equitable
to all workers in Canada.
Any strike action which may be taken to
enforce wage inereases, without resort to the
normal processes provided by the law, would
seem to me under existing conditions to be a

one of which the Parliament of Canada
should take cognizance.
Is any group or
section of the national community to he encouraged to take the law into its own hands?

OCTOBER 3, 1945
Employees in the packing house industry
may have some real basis of complaint with
respect to the level of their wage rates. In
such case the Canadian people should demand that they submit their case for adjudication by a properly constituted tribunal. If
they elect not to do so, then the people of
this country, and those of starving Europe
who are dependent upon Canadian sources
of supply, will be at the mercy of the
unlawful and possibly ill-considered action
of one sectional group. In this event it
would appear that the Government has no
practical means at its disposal to meet the
situation. True, the law purports to impose
penalties for what have been described as
illegal strikes, but it does not require much
imagination to realize that it is quite impossible to prosecute and punish hundreds or
thousands of individuals who participate in
any such breach of the written law.
I suggest that these issues should be aired
in the court of public opinion, making sure
that all interested parties receive a fair hearing. I would go so far as to say that in a
situation such as that which now threatens
in the packing house industry the Senate of
Canada might actively interest itself in a
solution of the problem. In default of the
complaining parties taking their case to the
National War Labour Board', and resorting to
the strike weapon instead-, I think the matter
should be referred for inquiry to the appropriate Senate committee. To its sittings
should be invited not only the complainants
and others directly concerned, but representatives of all sections of the population who
may be affected by the dispute. Parliament
should seize upon the earliest possible opportunity to learn at first hand the reasons
underlying disturbances or threatened disturbances of this type, which affect the
national interest. Only through such direct
investigation can the causes of the trouble
be removed. Otherwise, it is not beyond
the realm of probability that Canada will
find herseIf faced with a general strike I
sec in the present disturbed state of our
labour relations several indications of this.
The Speech from the Throne forecasts that
as a result of the agreements which it is hoped
to conclude with the provinces it will be possible to effect "a reorganization of the
Dominion tax structure on a simpler, more
equitable basis, conducive to the expansion of
enterprise and employment." This statement
will be most happily received by al sections
of the country. However, I suggest that there
yet remains a very important work to be done
in the field of taxation, which need not wait
upon any dedision of the Dominion-Provincial

41

conference regarding the redistribution or reorganization of taxing methods. I think we
can be reasonably certain that income tax,
and the related impost on excess profits, so
long as the latter is needed, will continue as
Federal taxing measures. No one will argue
that the mechanics of assessment and collection of income and excess profits taxes do not
need overhauling.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: The Income War Tax
Act, first passed in 1917 and amended and
added to from time to time since then, has
never been revised and consolidated. In the
result, today it is so complicated that hardly
anyone can understand it-and as a lawyer I
do not think that is making too great an
admission. I am surprised that even the
officials of the Department of National Revenue who are charged with its administration
can carry out their duties with any degree of
uniformity. Here is a very practical and
much needed work that the Senate could
undertake. I respectfully suggest that we
should have a committee of this honourable
House set up for the special purpose of considering and revising the Income War Tax
Act and the Excess Profits Tax Act, as regards the procedures of assessment and collection, with a view to their modernization and
simplification-so that even I could understand them.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Then, too, our electoral
laws are in much the same condition as the
taxing statutes which I have just mentioned.
The honourable leader on the other side
(Hon. Mr. Haig) a few days ago gave
expression to the proposal that there should
be in Canada a system of the single transferable vote. Other honourable senators and
members in the other place have expressed
themselves similarly. Not long ago a sug.
gestion was made to me that we should pre.
serve our system of national registration foi
electoral purposes and that there should be
maintained in each district or county a register of all persons of voting age. Thus we
would be able to maintain a running census
of the voting population and do away with
the expensive and somewhat clumsy method
of enumerating the voters in advance of each
election. In this connection, I notice that
certain enumerators are now being prosecuted
in the city of Toronto on charges arising out
of the performance of their duties in the
recent federal election. It seems they put
on the voters' list the names of a number of
graduates of the University of Toronto who
happened to be then under the voting age.

42

SENATE

A system of permanent registration, properly
devised and ad'mini,-tered, would overcome
these weaknesses in our election laws.
It may be argued that the Senate, not being
the elected branch of Parliament, should not
undertake a study of this kind. I do not
agree with that attitude. It seems to me
that, quite apart from the fact that we have
more time than the other House, and better
facilities for doing the work, the very circumstance that the Senate is not directly concerned with the application of our election
laws, and thereby is free of any bias in regard
to them, better equips it to give impartial
study to the whole matter and to formulate
recommendations for the consideration of
Parliament. Any such effort on the part of
the Senate, if it did nothing more than
provide an opportunity for the expression of
public views, would in my humble estimation
constitute a fine service to our country.
There is yet another matter with which I
think we might concern ourselves, and which
directly affects this Chamber and its work.
This is to make a study of. and to report to
Parliament upon, the advisability of amending
the Salaries Act and other ActŽ dealing with
the remuneration of our public officials. It is
a little-known circumstance that the Leader
of the Government in the Senate receives no
remuneration beyond his sessional indemnity.
How the leader of this House can be expected
to spend the time and energy necessary to the
proper execution of its business. without being
paid for it, is beyond m' understanding. I
submit that the office of Government Leader
should be recognized as a full-fledged Cabinet
position, carrying with it the same salary and
allowances as are assigned to other ministerial
positions.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. BENCH: I would also suggest
for similar reasons that the position of the
leader on the other side sbould carry a salary
status comparable to tbat of the Leader of the
Opposition in the other House.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. BENCH: There are other inequalities in our statutes reiting to salaries.
We are constantly hearing romplaints about
the basis of remuneration provided for the
judges of the country, and I have alto heard
it suggested more than once tbat the salaries
of deputy ministers and other civil servants
should be reviewed and revised. If the Senate
were to undertake a study of this problem and
report its recommendations to Parliament, I
Hon. Mr. BENCH.

suggest that thereby it would be making an
important contribution to the machinery of
government.
Now, honourable senators, I have ventured
to put forward these suggestions to-day as a
respectful indication of the great opportunities
wbich we in this House have to advance and
assist in the work of Parliament. These are
only my own ideas. I am sure tbat other
honourable senators more experienced than I
am could add to the list very materially. May
I add the hope that during this session the
Senate may undertake some work on its own
accouet which will effectively demonstrate to
the Canadian people that we are not only a
necessary but a very useful branch of our
parliamentary machinery.

INTERIM COMMISSION ON FOOD AND
AGRICULTURE
RIPORT R{EFERRED TO COMMITTEE ON
AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, with unanimous consent, I would move:
That a copy of the first report to the Governnents of the United Nations b the Interiem
Commission on Food and Agriculture, Conference Series, 1945. No. 1. laid on the Table of
the Senate on 11th September, 1D45. be referred
to the Standing Committee on Agiuiolture and
Forestry.

OCTOBER 4, 1945
My reason for presenting this motion is
that probably next week there will corne before us fromn the other place a measure, based
upon the report, which has to do with
Canada 's participation in the international
confercace on food and agriculture. In the
meantime I think it will be advantageous to
have this report before the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Forestry, where
departmental officiais who have detailed
knowiedge of the subject may be heard. In
this way we shahl become better acquainted
with the measure and more able to appreciate its full signîficance.
This interim commission was established by
the United Nations Conference on Food and
Agriculture, held in May, 1943, at Hot Springs,
Virginia, in an effort to solve on, an international scale the problemn of surplus food production in some countries and the shortage or
even lack of food in others.
Canada has taken a prorninent part in this
international effort, in that the Canadian
Ambassador to the United States was the flrst
chairman of the conference; and I notice that
Canada's proposed contribution to the contemplated budget cornes immediately after the
contributions of the United States, the United
Kingdorn, the Union of Socialists Soviet
Republics, China and France. Indeed it represents 5-6 per cent of the total budget as
against France's suggested contribution of 5-69
per cent. For the benefit of those who are
interested in our fisheries, I rnay say that I
understand our delegates are particulariy
anxious to have the international association
give greater recognition to the possibilities of
flsh as a food, and I believe that already
they have achieved considerabie success in
that direction. Honourable senators, particularly the honourable senator from Northurnberla.nd (Hon. Mr. Burchili), who is a past
president of the Canadian Forestry Association, wili be interested .to know -that the report
gives considerable prominence Vo forestry prodjuction. I arn confident that the information
to be subrnitted to our committee wiil help us
when themeasure to which. I have referred
cornes before us for formial consideration.
I cannot say at the moment just when the
Committee on Agriculture wili meet. The
honourable senator frorn South Bruce (Hon.
Mr. Donnelly) who s0 courteously and efficiently presides over that Cornmittee will not be
in Ottawa until next week. When he arrives
I will consult with hirn, and perhaps, if it is

Tuesday. I should like it to'be held as soon
as possible so that we rnay have before us ail

1 wouid advise honourabie senators, particularly the newer ones, that although the
report will be referred to the Comrnittee on
Agriculture, this does not mean that anyone
wiil be debarred frorn attending. It sirnply
means that oniy members of the cornmittee
will be entitled to vote. Every member of
the Senate bas a right to attend the cornrittee
meetings, and I wouid urge all who are interested to do so, for I arn hopeful and confident that some enlightening information wiIl

EMERGENCY SITTINGS 0F THE

MOTION

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON rnoved:
That for the duration of the present Session
of Parhiarent, shouid an emergency arise during
any adjournment of the Senate, which wouid
in the opinion of the hlonotîrable the Speaker
warrant that the Senate Ineet prier to the tirne
set forth in the motion for such adjournment,
the honourable the Speaker be authorized Vo
notify honourable senators ut their addresses
registered with the Cierk of the Senate Vomeet
at a tirne earlier than that set out in the
motion for sucb adjournment, and non-receipt
by any one or more honoiirabie senators of
sucli call shall fot have any effeet upon the
sufficiency and validity thereof.
He said: Honourable senators, this is the
motion of which I gave notice yesterday.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Honourable senators,
personaliy, should be happier if the Leader
of the Senate wouid add -after the words
"authorized" in -the seventh line, the words "on
three days previous notice". The motion as
it stands would, permit the members who
remain in Ottawa to assemble here and pass
any legislation that might be ready. This
was doue, to mention an extrerne case, when
war was d'eclared on Japan, and yet the
Province most vulnerable Vo attack was flot
repreffented here at ahi. We dieclared war bef ore the United StaVes did so, and before we
had been attacked, at least in a physical
sense. It scems to me that we should have
sorne notice. We represeut the provinces. A
province rnost vitally concerned in some, legislation might be prejudicaiiy affected by
reason of not being represented, therefore, it
seems to me only reasonable that somne
advance notice should be given. If it is
deemed desirable to let the motion go as it

is, I have no great objection; but I think
w-c would feel happier if it were varicd to
the extent I have suggestod. I arn not offering -an amendment, 1 arn only asking the
Leader opposite if he would include what I
have just suggcsted in his motion.
Ion. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable sonators, as far as 1 arn concerned, I merely
adoptcd the phraseology used ever since the
resolution was first introduced in the Senate.
As I said yesterday, I had some doubts in
rny mind as to whetber such a resolution
was necessary or not. If the resolution as
it stands would cause any inconvenience, I
should be very pleased ta accept the suggestion of my honourable friend. I sbould
like to know how the Leader opposite, or
any other senator, feels in regard to it. I
arn quite willing to abide by the opinion of
the House.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The honourable senator
from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder) bas made
a suggestion to me wbicb I think bas menit.
It is that the three days notice should not
be made arbitrary but that the honourable
the Speaker be given the power asked for on
the understanding that be is ta give three

That would be satis-

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It is suggested,
honourahie senators, that, instead of changing
the phraseology of the resolution, it be passed
on the understanding that should it become
necessary ta act upon the resolution it would
be desirable ta have at least tbree days notie.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Uuless it be in a case of

bas to be taken.

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators,
I thank you for the welcome. 1 should like
to join in the very cloquent remarks made in
his masterful speech, by the honourable member fromn Summerside (Hon. Mr. Robinson)
who, in moving that a humble address be
presented to lis Excellency, tbanked the older
members of this House for the kindness with
which they had welcomecl the new memberF.
The friendly welcome that was extended to
us was, I can assure you, very highlv appreciated. 1 wish to, min in that expression of
thanks and to add that I myscîf w-as most
favourably impressed by the courtesy. the
gond fellowship and the kindness with which
the aider senators-and may 1 say as wel.
the officers of this House-welcomed us, the
newcomers, to this assembly.
May 1 also join in the congratulations so
eloquently tendered to you, Mr. Speaker,
upon your assumption of the responsibilities
and duties of your high office. And if I arn
flot pre'suming too much as a new member,
1 should also like ta join in the congratulations and the gond wishes that have been
extended to the two honourable gentlemen
wbo have undertaken the duties and responsibilities of leadership in this Huse. I refer
to the honourable senator from Shelburne
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) and the honourable
senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig).
May I, at the opening of my first address
in the Senate, aeknowledge the gratitude that
I feel for the privilege which I now enjoy of
addressing this most distinguished assembly.
I am particularly grateful to the honourable
senator froma Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen)
for the kind remarks which he made on the
floor of this Chamber yesterday afternoon
when extending a welcome to the newcomers.
He gave us the assurance that our voicesho did not add, as he might bave done, "however raucous "--would be welcomed, and that
our vicws, however immature,Some Ion. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: -would ho tolerated. I appreciate that assurance vcry highly,
and I can tell the honourable gentleman that
it makes me feel more comfortable as I risc
for the first time here ta state a few thoughts
which perhaps are immature and which certainly will not be presented in any finished
way.
The honourable senator fromn Winnipeg
(Ion. Mr. Haig) expressed himself very
st.rongly in favour of the alternative vote in
As 1 undersingle-member constituencies.

OCTOBER 4, 1945
stood him, hie feit tbat that reformi would
give us assurance that no person could be
elected to a seat in the House of Gommons
except by the consent of a mai ority of those
voting in bis own constituency. The honourable gentleman is not in favour of rninority
representation. Neither arn 1. In my view,
the representation of a mai ority rather than
of a minority in a constituency is a rnost
important principlp, and I wish to suggest
to my fellow members that the time bas
come when we should cease considering this
measure purely from a viewpoint of party
advantage. To my knowîedge and experience, it bas been so considered, not only in
this Parliament but in the legisiatures as well,
over a number of years.
The time bas arrived in the political
development of Canada when we must consider this measure from the standpoint of
principle and not of party advantage. I myself arn a democrat. I believe in the rule of
the mai ority. I arn prepared to accept tbe
decision of a mai ority, even wben I do not
agree with it. I would go so far as to
accept a government of tbe opposite political
persuasion if, God forbid, the people of this
Dominion determined in favour of it. My
honourable friend to my right (Hon. Mr.
Leger) will admit that in this I arn going
pretty far. If the people of this country
make a decision, I, as a democrat, am prepared to accept that decision with the best
grace possible under the circurnstances, and
willingly, knowing that people learn by rnaking mistakes and that there is no substitute
for experience. I will take rny place with my
'felîow citizens in accepting any decision of
the mai ority of the people.
But what I fear, honourable senators, la
the election in this country of a government
which does not possess the confidence of a
mai ority of the people, a government attempting to rule although it has flot been
elected by a rnajority of the votes cast. I
tremble at the thought of what might happen
in Canada did a governrnent representing a
minority attempt to enforce views and policies
to which the majority is opposed. It is that
possibility, because of a wrong principle ivolved in our present method of voting, which
so impresses me ini favour of this measure
of the alternative vote ini single-member constituencies. And if honourable members will
bear ini mind that possibility-of a majority
in the other House representing a minority
in the country endeavouring to impose on
the rest of us policies and practices of which
we flot only do flot approve. but actively disapprove-tben we rnay ýcount upon the support of tbat measure by the Senate.

Honourable senators, in the Speech from the
Throne there are a number of points which
to me are of exceptional interest. To begin
wîitb, the Speech gives notice of the end of
the most terrible war in history, and it expresses humble thanks for our deliverance.
It expresses remembrance of and pays reverent
tribute to those who have paid the price of
confiict. It acknowledges Canada's tremendous war contribution, the resuît of that glorious partnership between our warriors and our
workers. In the victory over the Axis powers,
the authors of the Speech say, "We find the
asurance of the ultimate triumph of righteousness as we seek to bring into being a new
order founded upon world security and social
justice." "World security and social justice",
those are fine words. And they are used i
earnest, for Ris Excellency assures us that
the Government will shortly bring in measures
to assist the starving millions in Europe and
to expedite the rehabilitation of their devastated areas.
Fortunately the Speech comes nearer home
when it deals with the demobilization, of the
men and women of our armed forces and their
rehabilitation in civil life. It also speaks of
the maintenance of a high level of employment
and national income. When a Government
sets out to establish what it calTa "a national
minimum of social security snd buman welfare" it is quite natural that it should in, the
first instance turn to the work of men's hande,
such as the building of homes, -the construction of public works, and similar activities.
In furtbering social security and human welfare it is also natural tbat the Government
sbould turn to humanitarian legislation, such
as providing for floor prices for farm and fishery
produêts, old age pensions, health insuran-ce,
family allowances, preventive medicine, and
of course the re-establishment of war veterans.
These are splendid measures, and because of
their paternalistic but beneficial nature, in my
judgment the Prime Minister and his colleagues will go down i history as the moat
humanitarian governinent of our time.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I commend these
meaisures most heartily, for in common with
ail honourable mem-bers I bave seen something
of tbe shady side of life, I know something
of what goes on in the poorer homes of our
nation.
But wliile with aIl my heart I approve such
measures, at the saine time I recognize their
limitations. No ha&nd-out, no sop, no charity,
and no pump priming, however generous it
may be or however vigôrously applied, is
suficient to esta'blisb permanent prosperity or
the higbest type of social welfare.

SENATE

46.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Business activity is
one of the essentials of human welfare, and
upon it almost all other things are built.
Therefore I say to you that business activity
and a full measure of employment at high
wages are the prime attributes, not of charity,
but of social justice.
Some Hon. MEMBERS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Given this quality of
social justice in our society, both general wellbeing and high national income follow as a
matter of course. With failing profits to industry and lack of jobs at good wages, inevitably
you have business depression, hard limes,
poverty, disease and unhappiness. Indeed,
unless you have prosperity with its corollary
of high national income, decadence is the
fate of our nation.
Henry Wallace, now Secretary of State for
Commerce of the United States, a man with a
very briglt mind and with a background of
broad experience, lias recently published a
book entitled "Sixty Million Jobs." He states
his belief that it is possible to bring about
full employment and business prosperity in a
free-enterprise society without at the same
time submitting to what bas been described
as planned econonmy-a ceuphonious term for
bossism-and without disastrous inflation and
the objectionable features of an unbalanced
budget. He believes that this excellent condition miay be brought about without the sacrifices which so many of those who speak of its
desirability seem to think are necessary.
But, honourable senators, I would call your
attention to the fact tiat Henry Wallace
speaks of fre enterprise. He does not advocate free monopoly, or free privilege, or freebooting of any kind. It is free enterprise of
a truc character tiat he bas in mind when he
promises the result of business activity and
full employment. He speaks also of the gospel
of abundance rather than the gospel of scarcity.
While I suppose almost everybody would agree
in the generalities of my statements, there yet
are those in this country who say that,
becauso the war is over and we are now no
longer destroying wealth by the billions of
dollars, wages must come down. There are
those who actually would use the increasing
supply of manpower to force wages down.
I submtit to you, my fellow-members, that the
ritizen who at this lime joins in conspiracies
to reduce wages is no friend of Canada.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I appreciate, however, that there are those who hold a bona
fide view that, in order to compete in foreign
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK.

markets, we must produce more cheaply than
our competi-tors. Of course there is no answer
to that statement. We must produce cheaply
if we would. seli t advantage in foreign markets. On the basis of this truism, they proceed
to argue that in order to produce cheaply you
must reduce the standard of wages. Well, by
way of reply, though by no means completely
meeting the argument, I would say that if in
order to trade abroad it is necessary that we
reduce the standard of living at home, then
the sooner we cease trading abroad the better.
But of course that is not the case at all. Their
argument is based upon a fallacy. The true
explanation is that wages are not the only
element which enters into production. High
wages do not necessarily mean high costs of
production; and, conversely, low wages do
not necessarily mean low costs of production.
I call the attention of honourable members
to the trade in manufactured goods which
flows from countries of comparatively high
wages and good standards of living to countries of abnormally low wages and low standards of living. I cite, as an example only,
the trade in manuifactured goods which flows
from the British Isles to low-paid and starving India.
To sustain my position that high wages do
not necessarily mean high cost of production,
or to put it conversely. tiat low wages do not
necessarily mean low cost of production, I
quote the words which the senator from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) uttered in this
House just before the adjournment. Here is
what he said:
During this war and in the preceding years of
peace the United States demonstrated to the
worli tliat throigh the use of inventions and
iuachinery they couhl prodiuice goods faster thau

anybody else, and still pay high wages.
I say to those who would like to engage
in the foreign trade of Canada that they must
depend upon the things wbich the honourable
gentleman from Winnipeg lias specified. They
must seek advantage in their own intelligence,
in their organizing ability, in machinery and
systems, in order to keep thte cost of their
goods down to a point at which they can sell
tiem in competition with other countries. That
can b done in this country as well as anywhere alse. They must rely on the things I
have enumerated, because we will net tolerate in this country the impoverishment of our
workers. There is no alternative.
Now I suggested that low wages accompanied by high rates of production inevitably
result in social stagnation, in business deI call

your attention to certain general facts. Is
it not true that in times of depression warehouses are filled to the roofs with goods

which people have produced, and which peopie need and unfortunateiy cannot buy? I
suppose that ail of us in this Chamber remeraber the burning of piles of coffee on the
wharves because of the iack of a market in
which to seli; we ail recail the driving of
hogs into the Mississippi; and I arn sure that
none of us will forget that in the disastrous
days of depression through which we have
passed aur own elevators were full to, the
eaves with w-heat that we could not seil. The
purchasing power of the masses alI over the
worid had been so depleted that they had
nothing left to exchange for needed commodities. After they had paid the tax collector
and t.he landiord, there was nothing left which
they could trade with us for the food whicb
they s0 sorely needed and which we would
have been sa, happy ta supply. In ather
words, yau must keep purch>asing power in, the
hands of yaur peaple.
Let me give yau an illustration. The manufacturers of agriculturai implements neyer
close their plants, or cease operation, so long
as the farmer can pay bis notes; the manufacturers of food and clothing neyer disebarge
their empioyees in periods when the housewife bas the wherewithal to furnish hier table
and clothe bier children. To paraphrase a
very aid aphorism, "The shoemaker's children
do flot go barefoot when the shaemaker's
custamers can buy shoes and pay for tbem."
In other words, honourable gentlemen,
purchasing power in the hands of the people
is tbe key ta business activity; and business
activity is the sine qua non of a happy, industriaus and prosperous people.
The Honourable C. D. Howe is a very great
organizer. H1e ie a genius at t-hat sort of thing.
Ha is naw busiiy engaged in tooling up the
factories for post-war production. But I
suggest ta you, that it will be futile ta turn
out radios, washing machines and refrigeratore if tbere are na buyers ta buy them. 1
wouid suggest that a super-organizer is flot
at ail essential; just let dollars jingle in the
pockets of the warkere, and manufacturera and
merehants will spring up like mushrooms
in the night -ta suppliy ail needs. My submission is that the way ta pramate business
activity is ta maintain purchasing power in
the hands'of the workers. The way ta maintain purchssing power is ta increase wages,
flot to decrease them.
Let me illustrate once again. The beneficent family allowance act distributes among
the people, the workers in the main, something like 320,000,000 a year in purchasing
power. The effect of that 8200,000,000 is
to-day. being felt i the factories and on the
farms of Canada.

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD. No doubt about it.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: When you discuse
social legisiation, you talk in millions; but,
honourable senatars, when you discuss wages
yau talk flot in millions but in billions of dollars. The effeet of increased wages ta aur
workers, lu keeping factories snd farms
active lu this country, would be proportionateiy greater than the resuits obtained from
the raising of money lu the public treasury
and handiing it out in gifts ta those wh.o
need it, and in eaying this 1 am n ot abjecting
ta social legîslation.
During the war Canada's greatest customer
was the Government. But, obviously we can
no longer depend upon Government buying ta
keep aur factaries maving. The Governent
does nat need ta buy now. At least, the Govermment daes not need ta buy in such great
quantities, because it does not, naw need ta
destray in such great measure. We must distribute aur produets amangst aur people.
W-hy reduce wages under these circumstances?
The billions of dollars which during the
lsst five years flawed into the boiling cauldron
of war may naw, if we are sufficiently wise,
fiow like sunshine inta the homes of aur people. It ie within aur power ta praduce lu
this cauntry the grandeslt civilisation that yet
bas been known upan this earth.
The bonourable mem-ber fram Peterborough
(Han. Mrs. Failis) made a most excellent
speech before the adjourument. It was a speech
an the subject of employaient, andI cornmend
hier for tbe thought wbich she bas given ta
this vitail question. She wss rather critical,
I admit, of the Minister of Labour for what
she called his "airy remark": "Tbere are jobs
for aIl and ta spare." She doubted the ability
of manufacturing in-dustry ta absarb the thaueande of mon who are being discharged from,
our armed farces and aur war factorles. On
the ather hand, she found reason for optimiàsm
in can'tempiating, the possibilities that iay i
otýher fields of endeavaur, fields other than
that of manuifacture. 'She enumerated farmsa,
forests, mines and water pawers. Well she
might, honourable gentlemen, for these are
the natural resources of aur country. To the
farina, the forests, the mines and the water
powers, she might well have added the fisheries. She was right. She envisaged i the
use of these natural farces a vast reservoir of
paying jobs. She was right; what is a job
after ali but the transformation of natural
commodities or forces inta a form that satisfies human desire? I will go furt-her than the
Minister of Labour, wha says there are jobs
for aIl and to spare. I think hie might have
UITION

SENATE

said, "There should be jobs for all and to
spare." I will say this, that in a properly constituted society of free enterprise, where man
and capital have free access to natural forces,
the limit of jobs is the limit of those who wi'll
fill them-and I might add, in the words of
the Minister of Labour, "and to spare."
Now what should we do? My suggestion is
that we should make business and employment profitable by every proper means that is
within our power. When I say "business" I
do not mean just big business, that has done
so well during the last five years. I have in
mind for the most part little business, which
has been so often crowded to the wall. And
I suggest that the first step in the way of
making business profitable, and therefore capable of extending employment, is to get off its
back.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Perhaps. I might
illustrate what I mean. In order to employ
our population we should ameliorate taxation
upon both industry and consumption, taxation which, in my judgment, is to-day bleeding Canada white. I turn to the excess profits
tax, wbich as now devised allows industry
established in the period before the war to
accumulate and to retain the profits of prewar days, while at the same time it restricts
the non-profitable industry of those times, and
new industry, to rates of retained profits so
meagre that expansion and development are
practically impossible. There is good reason
to tax profits that are in fact excessive, for
excessive profits arise from the ownership of
natural forces, and from monopolies such as
hide behind tariffs, patents, and Government
favours. Because of the unfair advantages
possessed by industry in these classes, profits
are greater than would be possible in free and
open competition. But taxation of profits
which are excessive in fact is not the principle
of the present excess profits tax. In my judgment, it is deadly and vicious.
I was pleased to note that this subject is
mentioned in the Speech from the Throne. I
think it is at last recognized that if we maintain taxation of this character, we shall drive
the enterprising young men of the rising
generation across the international line into
the United States, where the founding of new
business is not a practical impossibility, as
it is in Canada today.
The Speech says that the financial agreements in contemplation at the recent
Dominion-Provincial Conference "would make
possible a reorganization of the Dominion tax
structure on a simpler, more equitable basis,
Hon. Mr. ROEBCK.

conducive to the expansion of enterprise and
employment." I take that statement to mean
an intention to alter the basis of the excess
profits tax and other imposts which have the
effect of destroying industry and enterprise
and thus limiting employmen-t.
I was interested in another statement in this
remarkable Speech from the Throne, a statement which leads us to expect measures
calculated "to stimulate the restoration and
expansion of external trade." I take it, honourable senators. that that means the Government is contemplating the abolition of the
foreign exchange tax of ten per cent, which
bas had the effect of abolishing the frce list
in the Canadian tariff and of raising the tariff
wall which we have built around ourselves to
the highest point in history. I hope that that
statement in the Speech forecasts the introduction in this Parliament of measures that
will re-establish the principle of low tariffs as
a policy of the Liberal Party.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: The income tax
falls, of course, with varying intensity on
different classes of our people; but, honourable
senators, I protest against any tax measure
which still further reduces standards of living
that are already below the level of decent
I further protest against an
subsistence.
income tax which takes from our best workers
in the middle classes of society one-half or
more of all that they can earn. We put up
with that sort of thing during the war: first,
because we had to; and secondly, because in
those days we were not critical, our minds
having been concentrated on the one end of
beating Germany and the Axis powers. But
those days have gone by, and J submit that
we should not now be called upon to endure
this form of excessive taxation. The Australian Cabinet has seen fit to announce a
reduction of 12, per cent in personal and
income taxes. Canada must do something
along the same line.
Should these remarks come to the attention
of the Minister of Finance and should he do
me the honour of reading them, I can imagine
his asking, "How is it possible to carry on
government in Canada if these sources of
revenue dry up?" My answer, honourable
senators, is three-fold. First, we must reduce
the cost of government in this country. By
that I mean that we must reduce the tremendous expense of our civil and military establishments. Secondly, I think we must-and
I am sure we should-endeavour to increase
our population. My third answer is that the
Minister of Finance should seek sources of
revenue which do not have the effect of killing

9" ,

enterprise and industry, that is to say, taxes
imposed upon ownership rather than upon
enterprise.
The first of these proposais, that we should
reduce the cost of our civil and military
establishments will,_-of course, be unpopular;
but 1 submit that the Minister of Finance
muet face up to that job and do it immediateiy. With regard f0 my second proposai,
that we increase immigration, I cati the
attention of honourabie senators to the fact
that depressions corne upon peoples when
the profits of the nation's industry arein
sufficient to carry the nation's overhead. When
I refer to overhead in this connection I have
several things in mind: first, land rente;
second, the burden of taxation; and third, the
cost of railways and other public services of
that kind. 0f course, there are other over.heads, but I mention these.
. point out to honourable members that land
values in Canada, from the Pacifie to the
Atlantic, have been advancing during these
last two or three years. Notwithstanding
price eeilings, land values have been steadily
inching up. As we know, our tax burden
has been multiplying. And the cost of transportation and of other such services is very
high. What then is the answer? I suggcst
it is to inerease our numbers and so spread
the burden among more people. If we bring
into this country selected people who will
actively engage in enterprise, then our railways will continue to be as busy as they are
to-day, our tax bill wilt be lesa burdensome,
and our land values may perhaps be carried
at their present levei. Unless there be an
increase in our numbers, I tremble for the
future of business activity in this country.
I submait, honourable senators, that twelve
million people must zmot and should not
attempt to pre-empt for themselves the greater
part of a whole continent. That condition
cannot last. We should not and we cannot
reserve for so sparse a population the vast
areas and wonderful natural resourees of this
country. R.ight now, Canada should take into
consideration the revision of her heartless
policy of the "elosed door"~. In order to promote prosperity and fuît employment, we
should encourage selective immigration ta the
extent of about 500,000 persons a year. In
this way we could double our population in
the next twenty years, as we did i those years
which preceded 1911.
I suggest that the Minister of Finance
should seek sources of revenue which do not
discourage industry, whichdo not kilt employment, which do not increase the cost of living
and bring about unhappiness in aur land. If
yau will permit me, I should like ta illustrate

my point by the historie tale of the "Toitgates on -the Rhine". Long, long ago there
were pirates on that fabted river. There have
been pirates in modemn times, but those ancient
pirates wore bandanna handkerchiefs around
their heads and earried cutlasses between their
teeth and preyed upon commerce as it moved
up and down the river. In course of time one
robber pirate, more intelligent perhaps than
the others, figured out a better system of
coitectmng toila than by cutting throats, whîch
at hest was mcssy and disagreeabie. Re gave
notice -that those traders might pass up and
down the river wit-h a whoie skin wbo cailed
at his wicket and paid his fees. He thus established the first foul gate, on the Rhine, a very
profitable enterprise. Others followed hi&
example. By the tweifth century ithere were.
some nineteen. toit gates established-nowremembered by the ruined casties that deiight,
the eyes of passing tourists. By the ýthirteeuth»
century the number had grown by a further
twenty-five, and by the end of the fourteenthi
century there were no less than sixty-four todE
gates preying upon commerce on -the Rhise,.
The exactions of these robbers were s0 great
that they offset the advantage of river transportation, and merchants carried their goodài
upon their backs aiong the river banks as theyhad done before boats were invented.
You and I, iooking back upon thosebarbarous and unenlightened times and contrasting them with the intelligence and under.rtanding of our own day, may wonder why
it was that the vietims of this iniquitous
system did not combine and dlean it out.
The answer is that every one who might
have done so was too busy figuring out howhe himsetf might change a cottage into ai
castle and thus eatablish a toit gate of ha.,
own.

Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: 0f course, eventually the toit gates disappeared, and today
only the ruina of their casties remain to
remind us of those buccaneering barons of'
ancient times. But I doubt whethem amy
real progresa has been made, for the owners;
of the wharves along the banks of the Rhine
now colleet in renta what the robber barons
formerly exacted in toila, and the reaulta
are pretty much the same.
I have used that historie incident to give
point to the foltowing suggestion. If the
Minister of Finance would increase his revenues witbout injuring his people, let hin,
look for modem "toit gates on the Rhine'e
in our present society, and let him take -

SENATL
taxes from. those who acquire but do flot
themselves produce. That is his preblem, to
hunt out the "toil gates on the Rhine".
What a country this would be, honourable
gentlemen, if when we hoist that new
Canadian flag we at the same time pull
down the Jolly Roger.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

lion. Mr. ROEBUCK: Let me say, hon,ourable members, that social justice is the
basis of prosperity. If we eliminate one injustice after the other. we shaîl in the very
nature of things establish a beneficent
age,'
without, as I have already said, the necessity of suhmitting our people to rogimontatien
and the less of their liberty through direction
frein above. In a country where jobs are
plentiful and business is prespereus and free,
~ieople do not resert te excessive, violent
Tneasures. Injustice, with its resulting stagnation, poverty, sickness, and unhappinessthis is the thing that drives men te drastie
remedies.
In closing may I quote the werds of this
romarkable Speech frein the Thirene-; His
Excellency the Governor General concluded
his Speech with these impressive words:
May you be inspired by the vision of a better
future for humaiiity which it is now within the
power of the United Nations te croate.
Hen. F. W. GERSHAW: ilonourablo senators, I wish first of aIl te cempliment the
mever and the seconder of the Addross, and
aIse everyono else who has centributed teo this
debate.
Every speech up to the present
moment has indeed been excellent.
Like the last speaker (Hon. Mr. Roebuck)
1 should like te express appreciatien of the
very kindly wclcomo that we new members
have received frem our colleagues and the
officers of the Sonate.
We have been reminded that membership in
this Chamber carnies with it an obligation.
The honourable Leader of the Government
<Hon. Mr. Roertson) indicated our obligation when he spoke of our making a contribution that would in some smali way conmpare with the contribution made by the host
of young men and women of our armed
forces. They have foughit victoriouisly the
groatest war of ahl time. Wo rejeice that
many of themn are returning fromn the field
of battle, but we are filled with sorrow when
,we realize that se many of our brave men
must rest forever in the land where they feIl.
Se long as memery lasts, se long as histories
are written and read, their skill and fortitude
and horoism. will redound te tlieir everlasting
ýglory.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK.

The underlying thought running through
the Speech frorm the Throne seems te be that
the Government is determined te keep up
the national income, to impreve the standard
of living, and te maintain full employment.
What I amn about te say may have rather a
local application, but I do beliex e it is one
way in whichi in grezit mcasure these desirable
purposes can be accomplished.
I should like, honourable niembers, te draw
te your attention the fact that a great disaster
has hefallen the farrng industry in soitîtcastern Alberta and southwestern Saskatcherwvan. Owing te hot winds and the lack of
rainfaîl erers hav-e pet iiîed, with the re,ýtîlt
that peo erty and want are the only retttrns
from a year of toi] by the farmer and iii
farnilv.
Some fainilies hiave already heen
reduced te sucli desperate straits thiat thcy
have only the farnily allowance choeques ',f
thieir children te live on. The creps harvestcd w~ere se poor that lîardly sufficient xvas
recov ered fer seed purpo.es. Cattle could net
ho fattencd and had te ho seld for low prices,
and cews failed te produce milk hecause of
poor grass and lack of water. In many places
even the gardens did not grow the feed whlich
is se badly nceded.
Here in the East the average annual rainfaîl is from twenty-five te forty inches, but in
the districtsý te which I have referrod it is
very much less. At a place called Empress,
the centre of a farming district, the normal
rainfaîl is 8-93 inehes; this yenr the precipitation was only 2-31.
Ia the Manyberries
district the normal rainfaîl is 5-11 inches;
this year they hiad only 3-94 inchc.s ef ram.,
Those of us whî hîav e, lixcd there fer seme
years realize that conditions are gradually
getting werse, because many streams, sloughs
and sînait lakes that wore a fair size years
age are slewly drying up.
Twenty years
ago there xvas beating and dock sheeting
on seme lakes wvhieh today are completely
dried up. and the land thc 'v coered xvill
net produce anything. Drought, however, is
net new in those. districts; hut, as I say, the
condition is getting gradually werse, and now
it is evident, that meisture fromn the sky cannet be depended upen.
Away back in 1856 the British Government,
being desirous of learning more about the
Northwest, issued instructions te Captain
John Palliser te organize an expedtition for
the purpoe of exploring and reporting upon
the part cf the Canadian West lying betweea
the Seuthi Saskatchewan river and the fortyninth parallol of north latitude.
Ho got
bis little band of ventureseme mon toge thon,
and they encountered many of the difficulties
and experienced many of the trials, hardships,

OCTOBER 4,1945
and sufferings of our early pioneers. T-hey
endured privations and faced many dangers
in travelling across what was then that great
lone land. Theiît contacts with the roving
bands of Indians, then the only inhabitants,
were not always happy. Captain Palliser
prepared a report, whici is now of great value
from the historical standpoint. Honourable
members will find a copy of it. in the Library of Parliament. He reported that an areà,
roughly triangular in shape, with the present town of Alsask-somewbere near the
boundary between Alberta and Saskatchewan
-at the apex,, and with the base extending
fromn Cardston in Alberta to Deloraine in
Manitoba, was unfit for agriculture. This area
is known today as the Palliser Triangle, and
the years that have followed since hie went
over that ground have to a great extent
justified bis forecast.
On July 20, 1856, Palliser was travelling
westward fromn Regina, and in bis journal
hie made the following entry.
Our course was due west, and as far as the
eye can see there is nothing but desolate plains.
Then again in 1874 Colonel Wýalker, one of
that historic band of original Northivest
Mounted Police, one of those mers in scarlet
who have done so much to gain the confidence of the Indians and drive out whisky
runners ansd other undesirable characters, when
hie was travelling through that area said that
neyer had hie seen a pasture field s0 lackrng in
food as were the prairies around for 150 miles.
It is true that a few years later, in 1879 and
1880, a botanist by the name of Macoun
travelled through that lansd and found conditions very much better.
That bas been the experience. There are
sorne good years and there are many poor
years. For instance, that courstry was largely
settled irs the period fromn 1908 to 1912; 1913
and 1914 were rather dry years; 1915 and 1916
were wet years and there were good crops.
Thers there was a long series of dry years
right up until 1927 or 1928; and again a few
good crops. Ail through the 30's not only were
there poor crops, there were poor prices, and
of course the people were impoverished. The
years 1938, 1939, 1940 and 1942 were good, but
the last three years have been worse than any.
We bear the saine record ye-ar after year; the
crops are growing and look promising; then
the bot winds and dry weatber corne along
and the reports are that the crops are suifering. A little later the indications are that
there will be a baîf a crop; maybe there will
be a setback, and finally wben harvest time
does corne the crops have to be ploughed
down, or the yield is only two or tbree bushels
per acre. So now after tbree years of crop

51

faidure, there is an emergency in that district.
The time has corne when some government;
action must be taken. It must be government action, because the private capital is
flot available to correct conditions over thatý
great area.
In talking over this problem, I have met
many men who say, "W-hy flot move themn ail]
out? Let the land go back to the ranchers;
let the land go back to the Indians." But.
really that is flot the answer. In that district
churches and scbools have been built in the
towns and cities; telephone systems have been
established; telegraph lines and new railways
have gone through; roads have been constructed, and in the towns and cities there is
provision for medical eare-there are supplies
and things of that kind. People who live there
find more satisfaction in living there than
they could by going to far-off places where
none of these facilities are available. Further,
the moving out of a large number of people
from many districts 'would bring sadness,
suffering and hardship. These people have be-.
orne attached to the place. Some are making
a living-a few are able to make a living-and
it would he a very great hardship to move
wholesale the people who have settled there.
.That is not the answer, because assistance
can be given. The Prairie Farm Assistance
Act has been a great help. If there is a crop
failure year declared, a farmer can get up to
$2.50 an acre for as much as 200 acres, or haîf
of his culiivated acreage up to 200 acres. In
an emergency year hie can get up to $2 an
acre. This bas been the means of preventing
hardship in many, many homes. In recent
years the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act has
bee-n of great benefit. Some 8,000 dugouts,
stock-watering reservoirs and smnall irrigation
schemes have been constructed. In places"
where it is possible to get a run-oif they are
a great aid to the settlers.
May I mention one place in that very
district that Colonel Walker described as a
desert, a littie ares, that would feed on'ly one
cow without irrigation? That area, witb irri-'
gation, has produced as much as 250 tons of
feed in one year. The short-grass area contracts and expands with the seasons. There
are some areas wbere power farming can be
successfully carried out. The man with the
big area and powerful macbinery caus produce.
wheat very cheaply. This is the crop whicb
stands the drought best. But the man on the
haîf section ieads a short life and a lonely one;
he leads a very poor life and before long is
impoverished or bas to move out.
Now in Australia, according to Mr. Justice
Davis, the Canadian High Commissioner, a
ten-year plan for the installation of reservoirs

Z2

SENATE

and further irrigation of a million acres of
land bas been developed. In Western Canada
a Qimilar programme is desperately needed.
Irrigation schemes have been surveyed and
thought feasible; the water is available and
some progress has been made in setting tbem
up. One which is close to my heart, the Redcîjiff Ronalane scheme, was started with private
capital. Sir Ronald Lane and bis associates
invested many millions of dollars in it. At
Vauxhaîl there is an ares of 42,000 acres that
has been producing splendid crops for a nomber of years. That seheme could be extended
to irrigate another 150,000 acrcs, at the very
low price of $20.00 an acre. A considerable
number of surveys bave been made, and a
:great maoy ditches and reservoirs are already
in existence. Additional land, could be irrigated witbout enlarging the main canaIs. Tbat
would bring prosperity ta a large ares. It
would employ 500 men for tbe next itbree years
and make permanent homes for many people.
Another district is the St. Mary Milk River
area, in Soutbern Alberta. Tbis ares bas been
surveyed and it bas been declared that 345,000
acres could be irrigated at an estimated cost
of $43.99 per acre. That projeet would bring
great prosperity ta the people wbo, year aftcr
year, have met witb disaster. The rcason why
it sbould be undertaken at once is tbat th e
international streams must be made use of.
By a 'treaty hetween Great Britain and tbe
UJnited States made in 1909, it was agreed that
if one country did nlot make beneficial and
productive use of those strcams the other
ýcountry could do so. We have flot built struc-

tures, as tbc United States bave donc, ta look
after our share of thc international waters.
The American structures are large enougb ta
make use of our share of water as wcll as their

own. The Spring Coulce dam, tbe key structurc in that big irrigation sGbeme, should ho

buîlt.
surv-ey

Tbe Meak Commission in a recent

suggested tbat the Dominion Govero-

ment sbould build large dams, construet
reservoirs, build connecting canais and provide
sufficient st-orage for Canada's full share of
the water; also, that tbe province should build
the lateral canais and set Up irrigation districts.

Tbis would mean that eacb government would
spend between seven and eigbt million dollars.
The contribution by the province would be in
some measure recoverable by water rentals.
It is the opinion of aIl engineers, and men
wbo have lived in the locality for many years,
that tbose streams of water sbould ho put
on the dry, barren areas and sbould not be
allowed to run off ta lludson's Bay. By doing
sometbing to make tbat land productive we
Hon. Mr. GERSFIAW.

would add to the richness of human life in
that ares. Such an undertaking would increase production to, the benefit of both
Western and Eastern Canada, because then
the goods manufactured in the East could ho
bougbt and paid for by the people of the
West. Irrigation would make homes for the
discouraged farmers on the dry areas; it
would provide homes for returned men wbo
are desirous of gaing on the land, and it
would make it possible to raise perishable
and seasonable produets. It would flot add
ta aur surplus of wbeat; it would, however,
produce the food which. we need most, and
for which tbere is a market.

We could bave

canning factories, quick-freezing plants and
possibly beet-sugar factories. It would bring
employment to a great number of people;
it would help tbe livestock industry, and it
would tomn those deserts into veritable gardens.
Having seen life in tbe dry areas, and having
observed methods of living in an irrigated
area, I believe that irrigation makes the home
more bomelike. Flowcrs, small fruits, veget-

ables, shade trees and shrubs can be grown ta
gladden the heart and make people more
happy and contented, and protective foods,
such. as milk, butter, eggs and cbeese-many

of which are needed by not only the growing
child but the aduit as weii

cao ho prodiiced.

An Hon. SENATOR: Home-grown vitamins.

Hon. Mr. GERSHAW: Vegetables, fruits
and tbings of that nature wbich are so badly
needed in ail areas of Canada. Tbe people
of Canada d'o not get enough of sucb foods.
Ailso, life would be happier, because there

would be more and better social and community activities. In those areas at the present time there are only about 3.5 persans
per square mile; in partly irrigated areas there
are 12-7 persans, and in fully irrigated ameas
there are 29-7. 1 firmly believe tbat the
Government sbould initiate these irrigation
measures. the results of wbich wauld endure

for ages ta came, and would he a great
blessing ta this and future generations.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed fromn yesterday the
consideratian of His Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Robinson for an
Address in reply thereto.
Hon. JOHN J. KINLEY: Honourable
senatars, I want first of ail ta thank you for
your warm. and generous welcome and for
your most graciaus greetings ta me on my
becoming a member of this Chamber. Your
welcome ta the ather new members bas been
equally cordial. I wish in particular ta thank
the bonourabie senator fromn Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) and the honourable senator
frorn Lincoln (Hon. Mr. Bencb) for their
kindly advice and counsel ta us. I can
assure tbem that it is bigbiy regarded and
appreciated. The officiais of this House and
tbe staff of attendants bave beén most considerate in looking after us and in getting us
settied down ta aur new duties. This attitude
on the part of bath members and afficials at
once created a mast agreeabie atmosphere of
cordiality, and made manifest that the grand
old virtues of kindness and caurtesy still abide
wîtbin these walls.
1 believe that a new member designates the
place whence he cames. I came from Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, but I arn reminded that
Honaurable Senator Duif alsa camnes fromn
Lunenburg lànd la so designated. In view of
this I choose ta be known as the Senator fromn
Queen's-Lunenburg-tbe dual constituency in
Nova Scotia that I bad the privilege of representing in tbe Commons. 'Ail my experience
ini public life up ta the present has been in
active politics, as an elected member, a

5

capacity ini whicb 1 have always felt it an
hanour te serve. Naturaily, the service is
strenuous, but it has to be that way if one is
to survive. Members in ail parts of the
country mnuet keep in close touch with their
own private affairs. Tbey are expected to
look aîter their own business, because that is
usually the test of haw weli they can look after
the pubic's business. Unicas a man can look
after bis own business successfuily, bie is not
very highiy regarded wben hie seeks to becorne
a servant of the public.
The indernnity paid ta an elected member
of parliarnent bas always been. sucb that, unless hie bas another source of incorne, bie finds
it bard ta carry on the duties expectcd of him
and at the saine time maîntain bis family.
There is a divided înterest. One is obligcd to
do two things at the saine time. I suppose
that is the way one gains experience-in the
field-for the work anc has ta do in Parliament.
Tbere are many perplexing problems ta be
decided in tbe face of conflicting interests and
strong competitian, bath in the field and in
Parliament. Public duty catis for the best;,
ta prevail is always a struggle, and as honaurable members bere know, tbere are many
casualties.
Membership of tbe Senate imposes a
responsibiiity equal te that imposed by
mernbership of tbe Hause af Commons, but it
is meliawed ta a degree by an independence
and security wbicb make tbis Cbamber different. I tbink this is a place for sincere and
reasoned consideration and debate. The lack
of urge ta score on an oppanent is sometbing
that is of great advantage. Furtbermore, we
need not be s0 mucb interested in or considerate of tbings ephemeral. We can take a long
range view. Witb. the security that we have
bere gaes the obligation ta avoid extremes, ta
be courteous 4nd tolerant. With caurtesy
added ta tolerance, we sbould endeavour ta
find and know the truth. I do not wish ta be
misunderstaod. I arn a party man. Ta me
tolerance is nat neutrality; I was neyer known
ta be neutral. We in Nova Scotia are not
built tbat way. Most senators have been
trained in tbe political life of tbis country by
long service in politics, and politice is the art
of government. Others are appointed because
of outstanding menit. Td6getber tbey form an
assembly ta which mature minds are called in
the service of their country.
Democracy ia the will of the majority, and
we are advised that democracy will function
badiy unless tbe rights of tbe minorîty are

those rights is a function the Senate can perform- Parliament is so constituted-and I
tbink this was part of the plan of those who
conceived Confederation-that the Senate is
the guardian of minority rights in Canada;
it is aise a place for review
and appreciation.'
That, I tbink, is perbapa flic principal funetion
of the Senate. That funiction should be invoked for the maintenance of freedom, stability
and true progress.
The field of research is important, perhaps
more important today than at any time in
tlie bistory of the world. As I said, senators
are trained and practical men in the science
of polities. I believe they are qualified to
constitute an active counicil for political researchi. In fact, that lias been demonstrated
many timea. Wlien I was a member of another place I used to visit Senate committees,
and I want to say that I was always greatly
impressed witli tlieir dignify and decorum,
and witli the aliility and experience of tlieir
members as sliown liy tlie way in wlich tliey
conducted their affaira. I liave in mind particularly the Special Railway Committee,
wliicli did good service some years ago under
the joint cliairmanship of two senators.
I listened wifli interest, on Wednesday te
tlie heneurable senator from Lincoln (Hon.
Mr. Bench), wlio I lielieve lias made a study
of the functions of tlie Sonate and is an
autbority on tliat sulijeet. I do not know
how far bne goes witli regard to what may bic
called innovations liy tlie Senate. As I recall
it, my summons te the Sonate said that I was
lieing cailed for assistance and advice. It
seems to me tliat wbile it is well tliat we are
able to introduce legislation in the Senate,
nothing sbould lie done to impair our function
as reviewers and appraisers of legislaf ion which
is introduced in another place. Senators sliould,
I tliink, keep weli informed, in order f0 lie in
a position te review maffers ceming liefore
tbem. In my opinion, we sliould net fry in
any special way te keep liusv doing tliings
that we are net expected fo do; we ouglit te
lie a biody of well informed men and wemen,
equipped to exercise good judgment in tlie
intereat of stabilify and frue pregreas.
I want te congratulate tlie newly appointed
Speaker cf tlie Sonate. Hua Honour is an old
aind distinguislied parliamenfarian, wliose record
of service and acliievement could weil lie
referred te as sbowing the lie.t qualifications
for a senator. He lias for many years given

OCTOBER 5, 1945
As you assemble at the opening of a new
Parliament, I join with you in giving humble
and grateful thanks to Divine Providence for
the deliverance which His mercy has vouchsafed
to the peoples of our own and other lands. We
of this day and. generation have been the
witnesses of a mighty manifestation of the
worltings of the moral law which inexorably
connects wrongdoing with retribution. It je as
applicable to nations as to men.
In these words Hie Excellency pute first
things first. We all bow reverently as we Join
in that recognition of the help of Divine
Providence, for it brings to our mind "a
mighty fortress is our God."
Our armed forces, the men in the air, on the
sea and on the land, those who in'the front
lines made the final sacrifice and who by their
valour and fortitude protected and hrought
freedom to the United Nations, are not forgotten in the Speech from the Throne. I amn
sure that the paragraph which pays tribute
to our glorious fighting men je whole-heartedly
endorsed by every member of this Huse.
Undoubtedly Canada will ever remember
with pride the heroic exploits of our armed
forces and also of our merchant seamen. In
thie regard Parliament has a duty to keep
green the memory of those who have fallen.
We salute those who are now returning and
we are glad that preparatione for their reestablishment in civil life are well under way.
Tribute je also paid Vo' the men and women
of Canada, without whose loyal and steady
work-on our farme, in our foreste, mines and
fisheries, in our factories, workshops and
offices, in our hospîtals and homes, and in the
transport and other servicesý-victory could flot
have been achieved. Canada's great contribution to victory has been made possible by the
unhroken partnership of bier warriors and lier
workers. It ahl adds up to a mighty war effort,
and we have been assured by the highest
authority that it was magnificent.
May I also pay my tribute to the Government of Canada, wbose members bore the
responsibility for our war effort. Nùbody
knows the anxious hours and hard days experienced by the Cabinet, and especially by
the Prime Minister. He surmounted every
difficulty, and while some thinge might be
criticized, the over all effort, which je the real
test, was superb. Moreover, the electorate
returned the Government once more to power,
and thus it hae a definite mandate to help in
the building of a new world order.
Before I diecuss this important subject I
desire to refer to one or two statemente by
some honourable members who have preceded
me. We are ail interested in the suggestion
of the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig) with respect Vo incorporatîng the single

transferable vote system into our electoral
law. We in the East do not know as much
about the working of the system as they do in
the West, where the local legisIatures, having
trîed it out, are familiar with its operation. I
suppose that it wae resorted to as a cure for
certain conditions. But I amn not at ail sure
that it would be wiee Vo adopt the system for
the rest of Canada. I fear it migbt cause
considerahie log-rolling, and destroy something that is of considerable value to the
electorate.
We were ail delighted with the splendid
speech which the bonourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) delivered yesterday.
With mucb of what hie
said I agree. I think hie can laimi Vo be a
reformer. But for an old parliamentarian I
thought hie showed a delightful irresponsibility.
He is a finished speaker and his rheturic. was
fine, but I arn not so sure of the soundness of
hie mathematics. Business muet deal in balance sheet;s, with definite items and conclusions, and hie argument does not seern Vo
add up. There muet be an intake before there
is an output, and -one muet bear relation to
the other. Hie story about the castles on the
Rbine was enchanting, but I arn certain there
are free-traders in Nova Scotia wbo think
that those toîl-gate castles have their counterpart to-day on the waterways of Canada and
in the great centres wbere things artificial and
iniquitous firet show their head. He carried
the dramatic scene to ite climax when hie
raised the Jolly Roger-the pirate fiag that we
associate with the sea stories of our youth.
I believe the Mînister of Finance will be
delighted Vo reduce taxation.
However,
althoug-h the war is over, our responeibilities
as one of the United Nations are noV ended,
and nobody will suggest that we assurned too
many. I amn all for lowering taxes, but I
would point out, notwithstanding war-tirne
taxation, the average man i Canada-including wage-earners in the lower brackets, where
the subeistence level would apply-ie better
off than hie was before the war. I arn told on
reliable autbority that the increase ini the
standard of living je better by 15 per cent
than it was before the war. At the same, time
the price ceiling bas been rnainta.ined moet
vigorously, tbougb, as we know, not without
criticisim.
I believe the first reduction in taxes should
be in the lower income brackete, and that
excess profite in whatever form, simply because
they are excese, sbould be the firet to, be
taxed and the last Vo be relieved. I do agree,
however, that our rnetbod of computing the
excese profite Vax is outmoded. T'here should
be a simpler way, perbaps by a general perEDITION

centage, without regard to the earnings of the
companies before the war. As the war went
on our method of computation took on the
appearance of bonusing the affluent companies.
The little companies that in peacetime struggled to exist were obliged to continue to
struggle in wartime. With long service most
of their equipment was written off, and a
computation based on the capital einployed
gave them very littie capital to work on. I
think that in the interest of our smaller industries especially there should be a review of
taxation.
There is a practical way to go about this.
Ycsterday the honourable senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell) gave notice of
motion for the appointment of a special committee to examine into the provisions and
workings of the Income War Tax Act and the
Excess Profits Tax Act 1940, and to formulate
recommendations for the improvoment, clarification and simplification of the mcthods of
assessment and collection of these taxes. I
have no doubt that thîs motion will be proceeded with in due course; and when the
committoe is appointed we shall have full
opportunity to discuss the subject freely and
to secure authoritative information from
departmcntal officiais and others who may
come before the committee.
The honourable senator from Lincoln (Hon.
Mr. Beech) the othor day talkcd about rationing. At that timo the pot was kept boiling
by disturbances rclatcd to the rationing systoma in Canada. H1e tbought, and I believe
it te be truc, that people were tired of regim-eetation. Ccrtainly, aftcr ssix ycars of war,
evcrybody is tircd ýf rogfimentation, but
scarccly anyone will deny that the legisiation
aed regulations were nccssary. I thinýk it is
conccded gencraly that tbey are still necessary. Do flot forg-et that rationing is a factor
in bolding tbe price cciling. If yeu do net
ration, the people wbo bave moey te spcnd

may buy two suits of clothes instead cf one.
Rationieg is for the purpose of dividing available goods cvcnly ameng the people, se that
grecd cannot prevail. It scems te me that
the people wbe arc in the low income brackets
should be the first te defend ratieeing by the
Govcrnmcnt of Canada. I still think ration-

ieg is nccessary.
Wc have cemmitments
abroad, and ratiening is tbe only means by
which we can satisfy them.
We are ýtold there are four kieds cf flesh,
three of which are for food-the flesh cf
beasts, of fish and of fowl.

It scems te me

that when fisb and fowl are unrationed in
Canada, partîcularly as this is the hunting
season, we can get aleng very wel. and nebody need go hungry because cf rationing. I
Hon. Mr. RINLEY.

believe that the

internaI

routine of meat

stores has been somewhat disturbed. The use
of tokens has been especially objected te, and
it may be that which has caused most of the
trouble. H.owever, the retailers of Canada
have derived many advantages from wartime
cconomy; most of thema are doing better than
thcy did ie peaco time. They must realize
that they have many privileges, and that cernpetîtion is almost non-existent; they must
also appreciate that they have had a buoyant
economy due te the war, and mnat profits
have been greater than at any ather time.
Their only difficulty today is they cannot get
enough goods te selI. I arn gladi ta know the
Retail Merchants Association of Canada have
taken a good stand. Let us hope their purpose will prevail.
Honeurable senators, I wisb te speak for
a little while on what is knewn as "the ncw
world order". We sec it rcfcrred te in the
Speech frem the Throne. As a business man,
I should like te sec somethiag definite as an
objective.
Veý have a goed start in what
wvas knewn as the Atlantic Charter. Tbis
Charter, as you know, came into being on
August 14. 1941, whcn the Presidont cf the
United States and the Prime Minister cf
Great Britain met on a battloship off the
shores cf 'Newfcunidland. There t.hey gave
te the wvcr]d the Atlantic Charter. It was a
statoment te the world cf what we were fighting for. and what the ceuntries preposed te
(Io when the war was over, in order that a
new order migbit prevail. Twenty-six nations
signed the' Atlantic Charter. The basis cf the
Charter is four freedoms: frcedom cf wership, freedomn cf speech, frecdorm from fear
and freedomn from want. With regard te the
freedomi cf worship, wc scarcely appreciate
its. value in tbis country because we know
that it bas beco bore for gencrations. W'hile
there are countries wvhere such freedoni is not
enjoycd, ie Canada ne man cao bc challcngrd
for the way je which ho chooses te walk
humbly befoe bis Gcd.
Frccdomn cf speech is cf grcat importance.
\Ve have an alincot unlimited frcedom cf
speech. Wc are told sornctitees that mnembers
talk tee much in Parlianient and that thicir
speeches are toc long. Perscnally, I nover
saw much harmn ccme from long speeches. I
believe it would be botter te have roams cf
long speeches ie Parliameet than cee page
cf bad law. Thore is nething liko the wind
cf public opinion blowing througb the logislative halls te clear the air and prevent the
passing cf bad laws.
Therefore, members
should take their time and discuss mattors
carefully. Wlien they du this they are rendering their best service te the country.
The

OCTOBER 5, 1945
newspapers, whi]e they say we talk too much,
talk to us~ every morning and evening, and
we are expected to take it and like it. In a
dembcracv such as Canada, the speeches in
Parliament are very beneficial, and whether
they are long or short we can well afford the
time they require.
As fier fear, it takes' two forms-fear of
danger fromn within and fear of danger fromn
without. Fear of danger from without should
be rernote, because Canada is pcrhaps the
safest place in the world to-day. We have
as our neighbour to the south that great
country the United States; we are associated
with the British Empire, and we cnjoy cordial relations with the greater part of the
world to-day. This being so, as far as fear
of danger from abroad goos, we can assume
that we are safe. The fear wjth which we
must deal is the fear of danger from withinthe fear of unemployment and the fear of
sickness. Yet we are told that the greatest
fear is of fear itself. I arn sure that there is
no part of the world in which the four freedoms outlined in the Atlantic Charter are as
abundantly practised in the lives of the people as thcy are in Canada at the present time.
If we compare ourselves with the ot.her
nations of the world, we find ourselves in the
front line.
Now, honourable senators, we came to want,
and that is our big job. Naturally, when we

see want wc ask what makes want. Want, as
I see it, is the absence of the necessities of
liS e. What causes want? Sir William Beveridge, in that splendid report which caught
the imagination of the world, said that want
was caused principally by four things-ignorance, squalor, disease and idleness. Dealing
first with ignorance, there was neyer a time in
the history of the world when education was
more important. We pride ourselves on our
war eff ort, on the wonderful job donc by our
industrial workers and our armed forces. But
we must not lose sight of the tremendously
valuahie research carried on by a relatively
smail number of highly traincd scientists, who
finally produced a bom-b more destructive
than any other weapon ever invented. That
shows that mind is still the standard of the
man. From the standpoint of the safety of
the nation, it was neyer more important than
now that the people of Canada ghould be
educated. I arn told that our colleges and
universities are crowded with students. Lt is
a good thing to knaw that provision lias been
made for the 'higher educatian of sa many
of our young people. In the modem world
of machines and science, what chance has a
person without education? It is not necessary that most of aur young people take
47704---6ý

5
57

courses in Greek and Latin, but in this
machine age they should he trained to use
their abilities for the improvement of themselves and their country.
As to squalor, I need net say much. We
all are agreed that cleanliness is next to godliness. So let us be clean in mind and body.
Then there is disease. Well, that is samething we have always been fighting. This
country now has social security legislation
which, should do much to combat discase. I
believe the programme is a good aone. By
reducing disease we shahl hehp to abolish want.
The people must be educated to accept this
programme, for sometimes they arc not willing to submait ta things that are for their own
benefit.
As ta means for the prevention of idleness,
wc have learned a lot during this war. I arn
not a theorist-on the contrary, I regard
myself as a realist-and I -have came ta the
conclusion that what is physicalhy possible for
a nation is financially possible. I think that
aur governments and industries, with free
enterprise, should be able to sec ta it that
unemployment is kept at a minimum.
Hon. Mr. BORNER: That is good Social
Credit doctrine.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I do not know what
doctrine it is, but I have often thought that
wherever a serious body of men are congregated there is an element of truth ta be
found in what they say. But there is error
also. The question is whether the errer is
greater than the truth. That being so, I
should not be surprised ta discover that there
is a grain oS truth in the doctrine oS the
people who are associated under the name of
Social Credit.
Hon. Mr. BORNER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: As public men-and
I have been in polities for many years-we
must be concerned with the presence oS poverty in the midst of plenty. I think anyone
would find it difficuit to, explain why that
condition shouhd prevail in a democracy. It
i. becausc I believe that family allowances
will help to abolish poverty in the midst of
plenty that I am a strang supporter oS them.
It is a curiaus fact that while wc hate war
and hope there will neyer be another, certain
scientific and industrial prajecte develop mare
rnpidly in war-time than in periods aS peace.ý
We wonder why that is. Well, I think the
reasan Je probably ta be found in the Sact
that necessity is the mother oS invention.
We should aiea bear in mind that in peace,
as in war, initiative must be encouraged if

SENATE

58

we are to have progress. Then, too, we must
protect the rights of individuals, including
the right to succeed.
Under the heading of prevention of idleness
I think it would. b appropriate to refer to
yesterday's press report of a message that
President Truman sent to the United States
Congress. The report said, in part:
Seeking approval of a Canadian-United States
agreement of March 19, 1941, to 'build the Great
Lakes-St. Lawrence seaway and develop hydroelectric power from the project, he said experience had shown beyond question that the
prosperity and defence of the two countries
"are closely linked together".
His message followed joint resolutions introduced in the Senate and House of Representatives Tuesday, proposing approval of the
agreement.
ln a message to the legislators, Mr. Truman
said that opening the Great Lakes to oecean
navigation and developing 2,200,000 hydroelectric

horsepower,

as

the project envisions,

would:
1. "Furnish lucrative employment to many
thousands of our people."
2. "Make it possible to utilize our warexpanded factories and shipping facilities in
the development of international economie cooperation and enla.rging world commerce."
3. Increase consunption of electricity wbie
"will mean more jobs, more income and a
higher standard of living".
Mr. Truman noted in his message that Canada,
in expectation that the United States would go
through with the agreement, has already built
more than half its share.
Down in the Maritime Provinces our people
are not sure how they regard the St. Lawrence
waterways scheme, but I think that under
certain conditions it might be greatly to their
benefit. In coastwise shipping Canada is controlled by the merchant shipping agreement.
which provides for reciproeity with low-standard-of-living nations. We have no reciprocity
with the United States in coastwise shipping,
but I do not set how we can carry on the
commerce of the St. Lawrence waterways in
future without such reciprocity. Nova Scotia
is a province surrounded by the sea. Many
of ber young men, especially those who
are being demobilized from the Navy, are
naturally looking for employment as sailors.
In the past it was her sea-going trade that
made her great, and in my opinion that will be
necessary to make ber great in the future. If
we can make with the United States a reciprocal agreement for coastwise shipping, Nova
Scotia may again come into ber own as a very
prosperous province on the eastern coast of
Canada. I believe this is an opportune time
at which to negotiate with the United States
for such an agreement. I regard the matter
as being very important, and I commend it to
the attention of the honourable leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Robertson).
Hon. Mr. KINLEY.

An important problem facing us just now is
that of Dominion-Provincial relations. We ail
are familiar with that wonderful document
known as the Sirois report. I believe that the
persons who prepared it rendered a great service to Canada.
Nevertheless, I feel that
because of the extensive wartime changes in
the financial burdens.as between the Dominion
and the provinces, that report is now a bit
outmoded. During the war the activities and
responsibilities of the provinces were much
restricted, and as a result provincial treasuries
were able to build up surpluses. It seems to
me that the first duty of Canadians is to make
Canada a great country. When the representatives of the provinces come bore for the
next Dominion-Provincial conference it should
be made clear to them that the wartime expenditures assumed by the Federal Government constitute a burden which, but for the
virility of our citizens and the vastness of our
natural resources, would stagger a country
much larger than Canada. I hope that at the
conference the provincial premiers will not
permit any matter of political advantage to
outweigh considerations designed to make our
country strong.
Now I want to say a word about labour.
For more than thirty years I have been an
employer, and I have always had cordial relations with labour. I think that readjustment
is going to be difficult. Labour is asking for
shorter hours. Well, it seems to me that
science and machines should make shorter
hours possible. I do net see why under modern conditions men should have to work
throughout daylight in order to make enough
to live. We have advanced too far for that,
and we ought to try to reduce the daily working hours in Canada.
In endeavouring to
make it possible for men to earn a living wage,
as I think they should, there are certain conditions which must be taken into account. It is
necessary, for instance, that a price ceiling he
maintained. So you must co-ordinate the price
ceiling with wages; you cannot have them Out
of line.
During the six years of war, conditions were
such as to almost amount to the bonusing of
industry. Many companies were carrying on
their peacetime production to a limited extent, but they ail had to take war contracts.
These contracts of necessity were largely on a
cost-plus basis. When a manufacturer went
to the Prices Board and said, "I am manufacturing peacetime goods at a loss," he would
he told, "Yes, but your over all profit is ail
right and we are net going to change." The
manufacturer could say, "Yes, but the day will
come when we cannot lean on this war con-

OCTOBER 5, 1945
tract, and then how long shahl be able to
manufacture goods at a bass? It will be a
peculiar situation when we have to tell our
custorners that we must charge more for our
gooda after the war, and it is not economicai
to carry on in that way." However, the Pr.ices
Board had a difficuit job on their hands-to
keep down the price ceiling. My firma is servicing a fishing fleet exound Lunenburg. We
are paying our men ninety cents an hour for
their work, and the price ceiling limits our
charge to that figure. In my plant wages
have gone up 100 per cent since the outbreak
of the war. I do not objçct. 1 should like
to sec wages stay at that level. But the prîce
ceiiing was erected years ago when wages were
lower.
There must be sorne adjustrnent, and that
adjustment is going to cause sorne difficuity.
I do not think the difficulty will be insurmountable, hecause, being reasonable people,
we shall get together. Labour and management should do their utmost to co-operate
with each other. That is the ýonly safeguard
against goVernmental interference. Undoubtedly, unies they do work together amicahly,
the State will step in and eventuaily there will
bea dictatorship, which means strict regirnentation. After aiýl, the most important consideration is not the rate of wages, but what
thosie wages will huy. Money is the yardstick
of value. The basic thing to be considered is
that yuur dollar shahl huy a dollar's worth of
goods; and if you keep down inflation it is
bound to do that. In order to accomplish this
we must do certain things that perhaps wi'll
not be to our cornfort.
The Speech frorn the Throne intirnates
that the >definition of Canadian citizenship
is to be revised and clarified. I think there
shouid be Canadian citizenship, and that it
shouid be defined as such. I recail that some
years ago when Canada was at war my wife
and I wcre returning home. Before the ship
docked we had to sign the passenger rnanifest.
As I signed I was asked, "Your racial origin,
please." I answered, "Scotch." My father
happened to be a Scotchrnan frorn Prince
Edward Island, where rny honourabie friend
over here (Hon. Mr. Robinson) cornes frorn.
When my wife was asked for her racial origin
she looked at me and said, "I have got to
put down 'German'". I need not remind
honourable members that the ancestors of
the people of Lunenberg came to this country
two hundred years aga. They gave a sovereign to the British Crown. They followed
George Louis, Prince of Brunswick-Luneberg,
who becarne George I of England. When
rny wife stated her racial origin was Gernan,
our fellow-passengers did not know what to
make of it. During the taking of the hast

o

census I was interested in seeing how some
persons described their racial origin. In one
district in my county I f ound that about 30
per cent put themselves down as English
and another 30 per cent as Dutch. I doubt
whether there is a single person there of
Dutch or English origin. It ail shows how
unfair and ernbarrassing it is in wartime ta
require Canadians to state their racial origin.
One and ahl, we should be Canadians. There
may be people in this country whose vision
of home is in some other land than Canada,
but surely the tirne bas corne when we
should have a Canadian citizenship, and 1
commend the proposai of the Government
in this respect..
We are also told by His Excellency that
bis ministers believe it desirahie that Canada
should possess a distinctive national flag. I
realize that this proposal will amouse a gooci
deal of controversy. 1 arn of opinion that
we should have a distinctively Canadian flag,
and I think the time bas corne to considerWe ail admire Great

Governrnent was flying the Red Ensign on
the Parliament buildings. The answer wasthat it was in honour of our men frorn overseas, because that was their flag. But theRed Ensign is rcally a flag of commerce. It
is the flag of the British merchant marine;
it can be flown on a British ship in any part
of the worid, and cannot be regarded as distinctively Canada's. Truc, the 1{ed Ensign

consider a suitable design for a national flagNow that peace bas returned to the world,

Some Hon. SENATORS: HeÈar, hear.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators, it is with sorne fear and trembiing that
I at.tempt to address the House to-day. 1
flnd myseif 'in a rather difficuit position. So,
many new and able debaters have presentecl

60

SENATE

their views to us that I feel if I fail now to
make an attempt I shall perhaps be beaten
for all time.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: First of all, I desire
to congrauilate Your Honour on your appointment to the position of Speaker. I also wish
to say that though while you were leader
of the Government I may often have been
rude to you, yet I never received anything
but kindness in return. I appreciate that
very much, and I assure Your Honour that I
shall endeavour net to transgress the rules of
the House or give you cause for any uneasiness. I wish aiso to congratulate the mover
and the seconder of the Address, and to convey to the new leader on each side my best
wishes for their success in their new positions.
I was very much interested in the address
of the honourable senator from Lincoln (Hon.
Mr. Bench), particularly that part referring
to the duty of senators and his admission that
the Senate was losing favour throughout the
country. I have had some experience of this
attitude. I know a very fine chap who lest
his sight in the first war. He was formerly
a soldier representative for the Saskatchewan
government, but now lives in Toronto. He
writes in our farm paper in what he calls the
South East Corner. For a time he wrote some
very bitter criticisms of the Senate. I happened
two or three years ago te be coming east, and
on the train we had what we call a smoking
room parliament. We had a lively discussion.
I tackled him on his attitude towards the
Senate and proceeded to tell him that while
I would not claim that senators had any special
knowledge and ability, at least they were supposed to be good citizens and to have worked
in many lines in the best interests of their
country before their appointment. I said
it was a peculiar thing that even men who,
like himself, did not approve of the Senate
might profit from the remarks of members of

that House. In one of the drouth years I had
the privilege of travelling across the country,
and, having the experience, I was able te
make an estimate of what the current crop
would be. I gave an interview te a reporter
of the Calgary Herald during which I objected
strongly to the Government selling the wheat
at the then price of 85 or 86 cents, when it
should be selling at net less than $1.25, and
I stated that the total western crop would net

be more than'130 million bushels. I guessed
the exact millions of bushels, and I doubt

that anyone has ever come closer than that.

Subsequently several farmers and others,
strangers to me, came up and shook hands.
One of them said, "Well, I don't tare if you
Hon. Mr. HORNER.

live to be a hundred, I made $5,000 or $6,000.
I was just going to sell my wheat when I read
your interview. I held it and received that
much more for it." One after another came
up and shook me by the hand and reported
similar profits. After telling this story I asked

one.man why ho paid any attention te what

those people were talking about. He said,
"Oh. well, I thought you were a senator and
would likely know." When my friend in the
smoking car wrote his next article he said,

"We left Mr. Aberhart stretched out on the

wash basin, and we failed entirely te deal
adequately with the Senate because of the
presence of a genial member from that body."
Honourable senators may recall my remarks
about the wonderful potatoes we grow. in Saskatchewan. Well, just the next week after that
speech Saskatchewan bonds went up 10 points
on the New York market.
Now I wish to comment on some items that
I see in the Speech from the Throne. With
some of these I heartily agree and am very
thankful that they are there.
I join with you in giving humble and
grateful thanks to Divine Providence. . . .
I am very thankful for that extract from
the Speech.
Might I be allowed to read
further?
The victory over Nazi and Fascist tyranny in
Europe and over Japanose militarism in Asia
has been bought at a great price. As the
appalling extent of the power of the forces of
aggression and tyranny was revealed, the free
peoples of the world slowly began to realize
what they owe to the Allied Nations who first
opposed the aggressors.
To their heroic
resistance and to the armed miight of all the
United Nations, humanity owes net only its
freedom but everything whieh fret men value
and cherish most.
Honourable senators, because I like te honour men while they are still alive, I hope it
will not be out of place for me to mention
the name of Winston Churchill. I recently
read an article in the New York Times entitled "Greatness is Among Us." The article
quoted a statement by Mr. Churchill as follows: "We fight by ourselves alone, but net
for ourselves alone." It went on te emphasize
the greatness of the man when England was in
dire danger of invasion and showed his humble
simplicity when he got up te announce the
victory in Europe. I strongly believe that at
times one man may change the whole course
of history. If that statement be true, it is
entirely possible that the inspiration supplied
te freedom-loving people by Winston Churchill

had a great deal te -do with the securing of
allies and stimulating the will of the people
te fight.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

OCTOBER 5, 1945
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Another portion of
the Speech from the Throne for wbich 1 arn
thankiul is as iollows:
The deep sympathy of Canada is with all
who have been bereaved, a.nd with ithase who
have suffered impairment ai body or mind,
imprisonment, privation or want.
It is very proper that we should think ai
those whose sacrifice has been so great.
Another part qf the Speech which intereats
me is as iollows:
The maintenance of long-term mnarkets for
our prirnary industries is receiving close attention. The continuing need for foodstuffs bath
at home and abroad will ensure, for some time
to came, a heavy demand for the products oi
aur f arms and fisheries.
I want ta take the Government ta task an
this question oi lang-term markets. Coming
irom Western Canada, where the farmers' hog
production bas, in my opinion, decreased ta
not mare than 25 per cent af what it
arnounted ta last year, I arn irightened at
the suggestion ai long-term markets. I believe that we have missed the mnarket, that
we bave lost millions ai dollars. 1 maintain
that bad the Government adopted the right
policy, the farmer would have received up
ta 20 cents a pound for dressed park. But
practically nothing was dane. There was a
bonus oi 15 cents a bushel given an ail tbe
barley grown. The hanourable senator fromn
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) spake
ai incarne tax destroying industry. I know
a farmer wbo produced $2,000 worth ai pigs.
He said bie had worked irom 5 o'clock ini the
morning until 9 o'clock at night at this mast
dîsagreeable task only ta find when it was
finisbed that ail hie was earning was incarne
tax. Sa hie gat rid ai bis pigs. The value
ai the pigs was ail consumed in excess profits
tax.
If the Government bad been sufficiently farsighted, I dlaim there would be no need for
mat ratianing to-day. There would have
been an abundance ai meat for cansuimptian
in Canada, and plenty for shipment ta
Europe. If tbe farmer bad received fair
treatrnent, it would have been a simple
matter for him ta produce hags. The situation in regard ta beef is samewhat similar.
I regret that the hanourable senatar from
Peel (Hon. Mr. Marshall) is not bere. If hie
is available, I thinn I will engage im. ta seli
my cattie in the future.
I listened to the speech by the Leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Rabertson) when bie
spake ai the number ai cattie that were being
cleared through the yards. The honourable
(Han. Mr.
senator fram South -Bruce
flonnelly) suggested that, when there was a
shortage ai meat, the Government undertake

61

the supervision of buying. That would encourage the feeding of animais. Now any
other business in which men are engaged, such
as manufacturing, is generally done under
contract. At ieast that is the case with
respect to mast of the commodities the
farmer has to purchase. The manufacturer
bases the price of the goods on coat plus his
Profit. But with cattie it is altogether differpnt. Cattie are flot like goods that can be
packed away in a warehouse. You may go
ahead and hire help and feed your cattie,
but they must be sold at the proper time ta
make any profit. Otherwise, when you go
down to seil your cattie you find the market
bad. Incidentally, I should like someone in
the Government to tell me why hogs dropped
25 cents last week. I thînk I can tell you
why. It is the usual situation. Farmers like
to have their pigs corne in April sa that they
may have time to fil out; therefore, as a
resuit the bulk of the hog production goes
to the market at one time. At such times the
packers may not be buying, and the price is
down; but at other times, when the hogs are
nat coming in, the price will pick up. Then
when the rush is on again the prîce goes
down once more. This is what the farmers
are complaining of, and have been complaining of for years.
I mentioned once before in this- Chamber
the method of weighing live stock. One honourable senator said it was impossible ta
criticize the method of weighing because the
scales were ail automatic. On my way home
I mentioned this ta a shipper. Hie said:
"That is ail right, but a cane shoved into the
scales made a difference af 300 pounds on
three beasts I was shipping. When I comnplained ai it and went out and watched the
weighing, 1 got 300 pounds more."
I recently brought a carload ai cattie ta
Winnipeg, 34 head, and they brought me the
enormous price of $1,565. That is an average
price for meat, I would say, ai about ten
cents per pound. The Government apparently expects the hard-working farmers ta
seil their beef for ten cents a pound and then
go to the butcher shap and pay 40 cents a
pound for wbatever is available. You will
need an inspector in every farmyard, and
wbere the farmer bas any spunlc the inspector
will need an armed guard. Why sbould the
farmer give bis stock away and starve bimseli?
The difflculty ai getting cattie weighed is
one ai the reasons*given for inability ta clear
the yards. What happens is this. The cattie
are taken out in the yard aiter tbey are fed.
There are several buyers for one company,
and they are on a mare or less competitive
basis. Eacb buyer is trying to buy cattie

62

SENATE

that wili produce the highest percentagc of
output after being slaughtered.
For instance, a man buying for the Swift Canadian Company has certain animais markced
to bis name. and he gets credit for them.
They are kept out in the yards away freni
feed, and pounded around and kept away
fromn the scales as long as possible. Fina]ly
they are weighed.
I have here nineteen
weight slips for fourteen whitc-faced calves,
ail alike. Four or five weighit slips shouid
have taken curc cf the whoie ioad, but there
were nineteen. And 1 asic honourable senators te notice that there is net an odd pound
shown en any of them; they are ail for even
figures. The wcight is recorded at the lewest
even figure. There is no ebjcct ie weighing
in s0 rnany drafts, except te take as many
pounds as possible from the shipper. 1 arn
doubtfui cf what a committee of the Senate
wouid accomplish in this matter. The Gevernment have been implorcd te take somne
action; they know the situation s ery wcll.
They also know they could secure ail the
bacon required if they would just, raise the
price.
Now I w'ish te criticize the Governmcnt
rather sexvereiy with respect te their handling
of strikes in this country. The honourabie
senator who just spoke concerning the labour
question (Hon. Mr. Kinley) bas been fortunate
in having ne trouble in his particular operations. It seeims te me the poiicy of the
Government bias been te aiways wait tee long.
Deiays sbouid net eccur. Sureiy the labour
situation should have been settied beforehand.
It is depiorable that now, when there is sucb
a demand for cars and other commodities, se
many men shouid be idie. And in the West,
perhaps throughout Canada as a wboie, people
wiii freeze tbis winter because 9,000 ceai miners
are on strike. I do net biame the miners at
ail. These men are heavy meat cateýrs and
tbe present ration means almost starvation for
them. Why, 1 have had working vwith me mon
who wouid eat the entire weekiy ration of
meat at one meal. The Government shouid
see that these miners are given an increased
ration se tbat they ean go back te work. The
rest of the people would net begrudge it, te
them. I arn speaking from experience wben
I say that men doing heavy work must get
adequate food. 1 have worked on the drive
on the river, and in the bush, and 1 know
that men who de net get enough te eat cannet stand that kind of work very long. How
couid a company oxpect ýa hungry man te go
eut at four e'ciock in the morning and stand
in running water up te his waist? The officiais
in the departînent know very weii what the
conditions are, and I arn surprised that tbey
Hon. Mr. HORNER.

have net granted the miners' request for a
iarger ration. If people freeze te death this
winter, the responsibility wili rest on the
Government. This matter shouid be settied
without furtber deiay.
The honourabie senator fromn Inkernan
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) is greatiy concerned that
we should have a new flag. Weii, the fiag we
have is quite ail right for me, but if ho wants
an embiern that recegnizes the varieus races
in this country, I have ne objection. I should
like te sec him include in bais fiag something
representative of the first, Canadians, the
Indians. This referenco te Indians reminds
me cf a bock that interested me very rnuch,
tise Memoirs of Vincent Nolte, whicha is te, be
found in the Parliamentary Library. It svas
written more than ninety years ago, and is,
I believe, a truc stery of conditions in tbe
preceding baif century. The author had dealings in cotton and in financial transactions,
having beon himself at one time connected
with a financiai house in Lombardy, Itaiy.
Ho tee met robbers "on tise Rhine" and at
varieus other places. He speaks of President
Andrew Jackson and says bis greatest ciaim
te fame lies in bis elimination of Indians. Se
far as I can find eut, our North American
Indians were perhaps about the best of ail the
so-caiied savage races.
I want te commend the Goverement for its
plan te spend some $2,000,000 on the rehabiiitation cf Indian homes-a measure that i3
long past due. Certainiy our Indians in westcru Canada have a very ýhigh record of eniistments in this war. A man in the Mistawasis
reserve, noar where I live, had ten sons in
uniform. Aimost every physicaiiy fit man in
the reserve joined up. I think Indians shouid
ho aliowed te vote without any restrictions
whatever. They are a fine type of people, as
they have proved whenevor givon a chance.
If my honourable friend aise wishes te have
the Eskimos represented in sonne way on bis
flag I shahl net objet, thougb I repeat that
the present flag is ail rigbt for me.
I realize that, as many mon have said
before, Canada is a difficult country to govern
because of its extreme iength fromn east te
west and its reiativeiy short depth. The honourabie senater who just preceded me (Hon.
Mr. Kiniey) apparentiy thinks that free trade
would be a good thing for Nova Scotia. I can
assure bim that western Canada wouid give
tbree eheers for frec trade tee; but I do net
knew that the rcst cf Canada would ho se
weil pieased with it. Much of the western
trade wouId ho with the United States, wbere
a botter market for our products can often
ho found. Last fail a farmer friend of mine
bad te soul 150 iambs because his feed was

OCTOBER 5,1945
gone, and as there was no demand for them
in western Canada he could get only six or
seven cents a pound. Some time Inter the
Government was persuaded to open up the
market to the south, and lambs then went
up to thirteen and fourteen cents a pound.
Just tbink of it, bonourable senators! The
poor farmer who raised these lambs got only
six or seven cents, but the man who held them
for a while and fed them got thîrteen or
fourteen cents. That is -another instance of
the "toll-gates. on the Rhine" mentioned by
an honourable senator yesterday (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck). As the late Dr. Motherwell used
to say, they who need the most get the least.
I understand that my duty in this Senate is
not to belp those who can take care of tbemselves, flot to intercede on behalf of the
packers. My criticism of these concerns has
flot been profitable to me. On one carload of
live stock I Iost $400 or $500.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Did they give you
right weights?
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I do not think so.
However, I intend to do my duty, -and if we
ail do that 1 believe we can abundantly prove
to the Canadian people that their rights are
protected in this Chamber. Perhaps one of
the reasons why people througbout the country have become politically hardened is that
they feel members of another place often
speak wibh a view to getting votes in their
respective constituencies. But we in this
Chamber, not having to seek election, can do
our duty without fear or favour, and we must
figbt to protect our people from being robbed
by "toil-gates on the Rhine." In ancient tîmes
there used to be a toli-gate on the Dnieper
River, but the situation was a little different
there, for the workers were robbed by the
idlers on land. The early settlers around
Kiev used to trade with Byzantium, as Constantinople was formerly known, and at the
rapids of the Dnieper they were faced wit-h
the alternative of paying a heavy toli or being
prevented from shipping their goods.
The honourable senator from Medicine Hat
(Hon. Mr. Gersbaw) spoke of the Pallîser
Triangle. I arn heartily in favour of anything
that can be done to provide irrigation. A
matter that I do not recaîl having heard 'mentioaed by any honourable member so far ini
this debate is the effeet of lack of water upon
duck and other wilýd 'life. Duek shooting is
a sport that brings large sums of moniey into
Canada. At Brooks, Alberta, every room in
the hotel is reserved by sportsmen a year
ahead of the shooting season. Yet the honourable senator from West Central Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) telle me that

63

thousands of young duck die in Saskatchewan
because of a shortage of water. Ponds that
are formed in the spring dry up later on, and
the mother ducks teach their young to walk in
search of water; but before most of them can
find any tbey die of thirst or are killed by
royote.- or hawks. It is an ideal country for
aIl kinds of game birds, but more water must
be provided.
I used to have a farm down in the Paîliser
Triangle, and I know how important rainfaîl
is. In some years there will be a crop failure,
but there will be years of abundance. In 1943
and 1944 the farmers in that area paid more
income tax than the farmers in- Ontario and
Quebec combined. Any expenditures that the
Government may make on the improvement
of farming conditions out there will be returned over the years to the federal treasury.
Some of the land around Flaxcombe has produced as much as tbirty ýbushels of flax to the
acre, but a lot -of the money that the farmers
should have had has been lost in speculation
on the Grain Exchange. I know farmers right
in that area who have bast from ten to twenty
tbousand dollars. That is another "toîl-gate
on the Rhine." We arrest men wbo run a
poker game and take a rake-off, but in a dry
year the country elevator man, flot having
much to do, bas got to proteet bis job, and he
or bis company receives $3 for every tbousand
bushels of wbeat traded on the Winnipeg Grain
Exchange.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Wby not abolisb
it?
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Wby not abolisb it.
Trading in rye was left open. Last fali the
farmers, those wbo need the most, got the
least; about fifty cents a bushel.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Wby did tbey not seIl
to the Pool out there?
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Don't get me started
on tbe Pool.
Some Hlon. SENATORS: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I could tell you
something about that. I lost a lot of money,
but I amn still beartily behind the Pool. I
remember tbe days before the Pool, the dayez
of -the "'toil on tbe Rhine," when tbe spread
betweea waggonload and carload was 10 cents
a bushel. Now if a farmer bas a load to,
seil tbe spread is about one cent. The Pool
elevator is responsible for tbat. In every
conceivable way the Pool bas. more than paid
the farmers regardless of anything it may
have lost for tbem. Tbere is great anxiety
on the part of these line elevator companies
that tbink tbey bave a God-given right to
take tbeir toîl, as I suppose tbe robber barons

SENATE
in the casties on the Rhine got to think that
they had a perfect right to sit there and take
toll.
Now, 1 shall be getting myseif really well
likedHon. Mr. ASELTINE:

Advertised.

Hon. Mr. HORNER: Yes, advertised; but
1 arn stili determined to do what I believe
to be my duty. The Pool has been the salvation of our western farmers. They paid sufficient te build every line elevator and storage
bin in Western Canada, and besides a lot of
their money went ail over the world. To my
mind there is ne justification for the Grain
Exchange being reopened for rye, none whate'ver. The man whio last fall got 50 cents a
bushel should have received a dollar. Then
those that needed the most would flot have
received the least.
1 agree with the honourable senator fromn
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) as to
our need for more immigration. But lie did
not go far enoughi. We ouglit tu have five
million immigrants in the next few years.
We mnust have more people in this country.
Today we can ne longer find mon for certain
classes of work.
I wish the hionourable gentleman had
developed his remnarks on the causes of slums.
H1e had nothing to say about idleness-one
of the main causes. We ail seem te be afraid
of working with our hands. Our universities
are partially to blame fer this state of mind.
The idea seenis te be that if you get a gond
education you can sit at case and take "tol
on the Rlhine." We seemn to have quit recommending the good nId practice of working
with our bands, of earning our living by the
sweat of our brow. Apparently we are goiag
to live in some kind of Utepia where we shall
do nothing for ourselves and the Goveroment
will bonus us when we are yeung, and we
will just float along in luxury. But this is
net ahi: we are told we must compete with
countries whose people are net afraid te
work. 1 sbeuld very muclh like te know iow
thiat is possible. Every article we produce
wvill cost an excessive sum, and we shall be
expected te trade with people wvho are willing
te work twehve heurs a day.
In that connection,' it appears that we are
geing te build homes instead of finding jobs.
Wbere in future are we geing te get the
log-cabin felhows who wihl go into the bush
with an axe and hew eut homes? I do net
objeet te the building of homes for our peophe,
but 1 am fearful of wbat wilh be the position
of a nation ef younig men and women who
are breugbt up under these conditions.
Hon. Mr. HORNER.

Hon. Mr. JONES: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: How shall we hold our
place with the other nations of the worhd, if
we raise a class of people that cannot lift a
hand te make a home or bold a job?
1 wish the Government would tell me what
plans it bas fer providing emphoyment for the
peophe who wihl hive in -the bouses ýthat are
being built at excessive cost. But first of al
I want te criticize the cities. We ahl remember
wlhen Toronto and Montreal were both striving
te 'become the largest city in the Dominion.
When they were engaged in that great game
thýey said te outsiders, "Corne on in and behp
our city grew." Then when bad times came
they said, "Get eut of berel If you haven't
any money you cannet stay bore." It was
about the saine with other large cities.
Hon. Mr. DAVID:
Mentreal werse.

Toronto

was

bad,

Hon. Mr. HORNER: What is happening
today? People w-ho could go 'back te a farmn
home are waiting on the Government's doorstep to have a bouse built in the city.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: That is right.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: 1 was in Calgary tbe
other day and hearne.d tbat permits had been
issued fer twelve hundred new homes. In
Saskatoon a few years ago peophe would not
pay taxes on their preperty, and gave it back
te the city. I do net like te be comphaining,
but I do tbink that semebody in authority
should, warn these peophe that possibly the
bouses are costing tee rauch. A service man
returning fromn the war witb a hittle money
may tbink it, will hast forever, but it certainhy
will net, and the heuses the Government is
now building are, for their size, costing
altogether tee mnucb. That man would be
better off te go eut and build himacîlf a -home
in the country.
.I want te mention semnething in connection
with wbat it costs labeur to hive. l'le Government regimented everybody but the restaurant
owners. They give yen five cents' worth
ef bacon in strips as fine as a shaving; I
reekon tbey seil it at the rate of $8 a pound.
A werking man would have te go te three
restaurants te eat, and even then bie would
net bave had a full meal. I certainhy wouhd
have te eat tbree sucb meais if I was bungry,
or else cat six or seven times a day. The
Government bas allowed these restaurant
proprietors te charge five cents extra for a
cup of tea or coffee, and there is ne second
cUp.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: And ne sugar.

OCTOBER 5, 1945
Hon. Mr. HORNER: That-raises the labouring man's cost of living from 10 Va 15 per cent.
Then he has to pay so rnuch incarne tax that
he cannot put by a solitary dollar. The
restaurant proprietors have had to du ail sorts
of things with their soaring profits in order
to escape paying higher inoome Vax. They
have installed air-conditioning, les.ther seats
and a lot of other fancy dodads to get rid of
their extra profits and bring themselves within
a lower incarne Vax bracket. They run wild
while every other class in the country is
regimented.
I notice in the Speech from the Throne
there is mention of a grandiose scheme Vo
beautify the city of Ottawa and adjoining
district.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: This city is at about
the narrowest part of Canada; when you go
north you are in deep snow and on unfriendly
land. But go out west and you will find
animais by the drove, living clear out ta the
Arctic Circle. In the province of Saskatchewan we have a larger area, of agrieultural land
than ail the casteru provinces combined. We
are but a few people here ta decide on spending money ta adorn and beautify a permanent
capital. This is noV the proper place for the
capital of Canada. The capital should be
moved ta Western Canada, «Where the deer
and the antelope roam, and the skies are noV
cloudy ail day." Out west -there are many
beautiful sites for a capital city, and you
would not need Vo hire anybody from. France
te plan a beautiful city. There you have
natural beauty, and you would not have Vo
ghovel so much snow. I arn entirely opposed
ta spending one dollar at the present time on
the beautification of Ottawa. The only resuit
will be Vo bring in a lot of people. They
cannot live on the scenery. The grandest
scenery I have ever seen is where there are
only wild animals and man has not spoiled
the natural beauty.
1 noticed in the Ottawa Citizen of last Tuesday a dispatch from Toronto headed: "Canadian Architectural Institute Proteste Hiring of
Jacques Greber." This is the dispatch'
The Royal Architectural Institute of Canada
announced today it had sent a letter of protest
ta Prime Minister Mackenzie King coneerning
a Government decision to engage Jacquies
Greber, French landscape artist and towa
planner, Vo prepare the "master plan" of
Ottawa and surrounding district.
Native Talent Brushed Aside

Greber, but his appointment must be considered
as one more example of that inferiority complex

which welcomes the foreign expert and casually

brushes native Valent aside," saîd the letter.

institute president.
"The is not and of Ottawa and the federal
district development sbould not be a one-man
job," the letter added. "IRather it should be
entrusted to a group of Canadiaji specialists
drawn from the relevant professions of architecture, civil engineering and the social sciences."
Greber, now attached to the office of the
French minister of town planning and reconstruction, bas supervised tbe building of
destroyed sections of France.
He designed
Connaugbt Square in Ottawa and also designed
some large gardens in the United States. He
also had worked lu Germany and Italy.
I may be at fault, but I caîl Connaught
Square Confusion Square. As I used ta walk
by there when ahl the work was going on I
thought: "What are Vhey doing? Are they
going ta build a parking space underneath?
That would be fine." But no, they snarled up
the traffie in the finest shape possible. As I
say, I cali it Confusion Square, but the names
I bear it called by others would not be fit
ta repeat in this Chamber.
I have neyer heard one solitary man who
took part in the lasV war praise the War
Memorial in Connaught Square. When in
my town there was Valk of erecting a war
memorial I said, "Let us buîld a fine hall and
lit it up with everything of a cultural nature
ta improve the young people of the district.
We can have speakers corne here and address
us in this free hall." Between Kan-sas City,
Missouri, and Kansas City, Kansas, there is
a high hil, and on it they have built a tbreehundred foot cernent reinforced tower, with
a small elevator inside and narrow winding
stairs, and up on top they keep a fire hurning day and night. Across from that Vower
a littIe way there is a building about the
size of this Chamber, in which. there is a
collection of ancient and rnodern war pieces,
and there is also a large and very intereàting
folder containing prints of the propaganda
which the various :countries issued during
the last war. That mernorial is out of the
way of Vrafflc and its three-hundred-foot
tower with the lighted beacon is a guide ta
aeroplanes coming in at night; it is, of sorne
use; but this memorial here-if you had let
me get at it I could noV have donc any worse 1

"A committee representative of Canadian

"Ottawa is the Capital of Canada, and
specialists from every province have the right

INCOME AND

EXCESS PROFITS

TAXATION
MOTION

Hon. G. P. CAMPBELL moved:
1. That a Special Committee of the Senate
be appointed to examine into the provisions and
workings of the Income War Tax Act and The
Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940, and to formulate
recommendations for the improvement. clarification and simplification of the methods of assessment and collection of taxes thereunder and to
report thereon;
2. That the said Committee be composed of
the Honourable Senators Aseltine. Beauregard,
Bench, Buchanan, Cãimpbell, Crerar, Euler,
larris. Haig. Haydon. Hugessen, Lambert,
Leger, McRae, Moraud, Robertson, Sinclair and
Vien;
3. Tbat the said Committee shall have au'thority to send for persons, papers and records.
He said: Honourable senators, in support
of this motion I should like to make a few
observations which, I am sure honourable
senators

will

agree,

are

appropriate

at

this

particular time. We now face a period of
reconstruction, not only in Canada but
throughout the world, such as we have never
faced before, and during this period this
country will be faced by many new problems.
We have passed through a war of the
most devastating character, in which human
lives have been sacrificed, and during which
we have departed from the generally recognized laws of economies. In this departure
we had but one thing in mind, te produce the
articles of war. War production was carried
on without regard to cost.
We now enter the period of reconstruction,
when a new policy must be adopted-a
policy which will enable us to continue to
produce in this country, and to maintain a
high standard of living and full employment,
and at the same time effect a better distribution of goods at a fair selling price. During
this period we shall have the problem of high
wages, and, as has been said in this Chamber,
no one would argue in favour of a reduction
of wages if the result were to be lower living
standards for the workman.
Nevertheless,
we must realize that to produce in the post
war period it is necessary to operate on a

OCTOBE R 9, 1945
competitive basis. I suggest that we should
make a careful survey of our production costs
during the past four years, and see how we
can improve production in the future so that
we may continue to produce, and to maintain
the high standard of living which has been
established in this country.
To do that we must have effective tools.
During the war period our efficiency was
developed to a point where we could compete with other nations. We have showçn
the world that we are flot only an agricultural country, but an industriel country
capable of producing in competition with
nations long recognized as the leading industrialists of the world. We have demonstrated our ability to produce articles which
are the equal of those produced in the United
States. At the same time we have been
able to demonstrate that we could survive
under the regimentation whicb was necessary
during the period o! war. We have been able
to appeal to our people in sucli a way that
they have heen ready and willing at aR times
to do anything that was required of them.
As we enter upon the period of reconstruction we must meke use of the knowledge
which we obtained in the industriel field
during the war. We must improve methods
of manufacture, and try to maintain-and 1
believe we will maintain-a high standard
of living for our people. It will be impossible
for us to do this unless we are able to harmonize the working of capital, labour and
In order to harmonize the
government.
relations between capital, labour and government we must sec that each understands
the other's problems. I submit that labour
bas a duty towardis capital, towards government and towards the people of this
country-e duty to give a fair day's work
for a fair day's pay. It is not enough for
industry itself to improve methods of manufacture. Industry can furnish the best tools,
can spend fortunes in order to provide the
best methods of manufacture, but these
things will not resuit in lower production
costs unless the labourers in the plants give
a full and efficient day's work.
At the same time, the Government itself
bas a duty towards both capital and labourthat of harmonizing the differences between
these two factors in our economy. I submit
that leadership is being given in this direction.
We were fortunate during the War period,
because labour and capital were able to get together; but today in this country, -as in other
countries ail over the world, we sec sig»ns of
strife, which can only be regarded as pei'fectly natural after the disturbed period
through which we have just passed.

I appeal to labour to come forward during
the period of reconstruction, as it did during
the period of war. There is no doubt that
the position of workers in factories bas considerably improvedi over the hast few years.
From the point of view of net returns their
position is far better than that of salaried
people in this country to-day. If I may digress
for a moment, I should like to point out that
for the lest few years there bas been a constant increase in the wages paid to labour,
but no corresponding increase in the income
of the low salaried or wbite-collar classs of
Canada. I feel that labour should recognize
thet during the war it was given every opportunity to improve its position; it bas served
well end it lias been paid well; but, as I say,
certain other classes in this country have not
been equally well treated. Further, we find
that a tremendous burden lias been cast upon
all the people by way of taxation. That was
inevitable during the war, and no one grumbles
about it, but it did bring great hardship upon
the white-coller classes. Today these people
are living et a lower standard than they did
prior to the war, in contrast to labour, whose
standard of living wes improved. No one is
querrelling about the increased wages peid to,
labour, for it is recognized that they are one
means of bringing about prosperity and a
better distribution of the world's gonds.
The honourable senator from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck) expressed the fear that there
might be some conspiracy afoot to reduce
working men's weges. I bave no such fear.
I think theat our industrialists and capitalists
realize that in order to have prosperity we
must bave bigh wages; that there must be
enough money in tbe pockets of the people
to enable them to buy the goods that are
produced.
Now, it seems to me thet one of the very
important matters to be considered in this
post-war period is taxation. Thet is why 1
am moving for the appointment of a committee to study the subjeet. I realize that the
question of taxation is not wholly within the
sphere of this Chamber, but I seec no reason
wby we should sit idly by insteed of doing
what we cen to make sure that we have a
taxing stetute which is capable of interpretation and will best fit into our post-wer
economy.
Hon. Mr. CALDER- Heer, hear.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: It is with that in
mi, honourable senators, that I ask for the
adoption of this resolution. I feel that with
the knowledge and experience of honourable
senators who will constitute the committee,
and of other honourable senators who will

68

SENATE

take part in discussions before the committee
and in this House, we can make a great
contribution towards solving our post-war
taxation problems.
Whetber we like it or flot we realize that
taxes are here te stay. The Act is comparatively new, having been passed in 1917. Tt is
framed largely on the sta;tutory law of Great
Britain.
Since about 1832 the Imaperial
Parliament from time te time passed taxing
statutes, and amended them periodically until
about 1918, when a joint committee of both
Huses, of whicb I believe Lord Wrenbury
was a member, revîewed and consolidated the
legislation. Later, commissions were set up
to try to codify the income tax laws.
Our Income War Tax Act apparently ivas
passed as a war measure, and why, during
peace years, it continued to be called a war
tax Act, I do flot know. The Act bas been
well administered.
At first it invoived ne
great hardship to business or persons; but
Inter, with the increase in rates, it became
burdensome, and even confiscatory. Furthermore, constant amendments, without any
attempt to consolidate or codify the law,
have resulted in a statute wbich today is
quite incapable of interpretation by any
lawyer or accountant, or by any other professional man who may be cailed upon to advise
in regard to its application. In many particulars it is simply unintelligible.
An Hon. SENATOR:

Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I submait that no
taxing statute should be left in that indefinite
form. It is quite truc that during the war
period it xvas well nigh impossible for the
Government or the dcpartments concerned
witb the administration of this legisiation to
attempt to codify it or put it loto more intelligible form. It is for this reason that I
believe a committee sncb as I hav e proposed
sbould study this legislation and become
familiar with the problems which are daily
brought before the Department of National
Revenue in its administration of this law.
Sections have crept in which bave the effect
of taking the taxing pewer out of the hands of
Parliament and putting it into the hands of
the Minister or the Treasury Board. I am
confident bonourable senators wili agrec with
me when I say that is flot proper. The Gevernment sbould net sponsor legislation wbicb
will vest in an individual or any group of
individuals power to tax the subjeet and take
away bis proerty. This power should be
vested in and should be exercised by Parliament alone.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear. hear.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL.

Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL:

Many phases of

this legisiation are frequently subject te attack
by those principally concerned with its interpretation-the legal and the accounting professions. If a client comes te you with a problem relating te the reconstruction of a corporation, you find the Act is in such an indefinite form that seidom, if ever, can you
give a legal opinion on bis position in respect
te taxation. It is necessary te submit your
case te Ottawa and get a ruling. I may say
that the experience of ail members of botb
the legal and accounting professions is that
those in charge cf its administration do their
best te make the legisiation werkabie.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, bear.

Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL:
I bave been
amaze(l at times te sc how wcll they bave
made it wuik. But I do net think it is fair te
place officiais chargcd with the collection of
the national revenue iii such a position that
they cannot interprct the law they are trying
te administer.
I do net wish to take time to-night te go
into thie v arious phases of this legisiation tliat
I mighit feel frce te attack. I think it cao
best ho dealt wvith by the committee whichi I
hiave proposcd. But I should like bricfly te
.show how important this matter is te our national econolny. We realize today that the
great industries of this country have been
biiilt up from profits. and nothing but profits.
Aftcr ail], capital is nothing but an accumulatien of profits. Today we have rates cf taxatien which are confiscatory; thcy are destroying capital day in and day eut. If yen
analvze the financial position cf the great
industrial erganizations whicli hiave been built
up in this country. vou will sec that a great
deal of their surplus has gene into thie development cf the business that gives empîcyment
te labour. Todav. threugha the medium of
hiighi income and exccss profits taxes it is practically impossible te accumulate capital withi
which te exteind business. Capital accumulated and hclId in reserve is hiable te, taxation
on distribution. and in the ex eut cf the owncr's
death it is hiable te taxation net oniy on distribution, te him. but, also, on bis death, te
succession dutics. Many cases will ne doubt
be brought before the cemmittee te, show that
people who tbrough bard work and energy
have built up very substanitial businesses,
whicb give employment to a great rnany
people, cannot do anything with those businesses except liquidate tbem in anticipation of
heavy succession duties. That unsatisfactory
condition is due te the bigb rates of taxation
and tbe methods of application ratber than to
administration.
There is an insistent de-

OCTOBER 9, 1945
mand from farmers, labour organizations,
boards of trade and chambers of commerce,
for a simplification of our taxing statutes. In
view of these circumstances I feel it is the
duty of every honourable member to lend
what assistance he can to the Government and
to the departments charged with the administration of these taxing statutes to try to
develop measures which can be interpreted
without difficulty, and which will fit into our
national economy in such a way as to let business expand and give capital a fair chance; or,
as one honourable senator has remarked, "Let
the Government get off the back of business."
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: If we can so revise
our taxation statutes to simplify and make
them capable of interpretation, and so revise
the rates as to impose a fair tax and thus
give business a chance to survive, I feel that
Canada will prosper in the postwar period.
I believe that the future prosperity of this
country starts and ends within the four corners
of our taxing statutes. I submit the resolution for the consideration of honourable
members.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Robertson, the
debate was adjourned.

ject, and bas very properly, I believe, arranged that certain Government officials will
appear before our committee and give us the
benefit of all the information they have on
the subject. The gentlemen who are to appear
before the committee to-morrow are Dr.
Barton, the Deputy Minister of Agriculture,
Dr. Finn, Deputy Minister of Fisheries, and
D. Roy Cameron, of the Forestry Division
of the Department of Mines and Resources.
Our committee is rather small, and unfortunately a number of its members are not
able to attend. As the leader explained to
you last week, every honourable senator has
a right to attend any meeting of any committee of the Senate-at least any Standing
Committee. Honourable senators have the
right not only to attend, but to join in the
discussion and ask questions. As it would be
impossible for the committee to bring in a
report which would convey to this House all
the information placed before it by the gentlemen I have just named, I now desire, as
Chairman of the committee, to invite all
honourable members of the Senate to this
meeting; in fact, I would urge as many as
possible to attend, for by so doing they will
make possible a more intelligent consideration
of this legislation when it is brought before
the Senate.

NOTICE OF MEETING

SECOND READING

On the Orders of the Day.
Hon. J. J. DONNELLY: Honourable senators, before the Orders of the Day are called,
I desire to refer briefly to a meeting of the
Committee on Agriculture and Forestry, whieh
will take place to-morrow at 11 o'clock, in
Room 262, the large committee room on the
main floor. You will recall that last week
the first report of the Interim Commission
on Food and Agriculture was referred to our
committee. It is to consider that report that
we are meeting to-morrow.
The Interim Commission came into being
during a meeting 'held at Hot Springs, Virginia, in 1943, its purpose being, briefly, as I
understand it, to increase food productiorf by
chemical research and various other means,
and also to increase the nutritive content of
certain foods.
Little action has been taken since; but now
tbat thi war is over the members of the
Commission desire not only to talk but to act,
and the Government has introduced Bill 14
in the other place so that Canada may do its
part. The Leader of the Government desires
that all members of the Senate should have
as much information as possible on the sub-

Hon. JOHN T. HAIG moved the second
reading of Bill C, an act t' incorporate the
Dominion General Benefit Association.
He said: Honourable members, I will not
take long to explain this Bill. It follows the
standard form.
To give you some information on the Bill,
may I read one paragraph from it:
The society shall be a fraternal benefit
society, carrying on its benefit and insurance
work solely for the protection of its members,
their families and beneficiaries, and not for
profit.
It is the usual mutual benefit society Bill.
It bas been submitted to the Department of
Insurance, whose representative, I understand, will be present to take part in the
discussion when the Bill goes before the
committee. I move the second reading.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN moved the second
reading of Bill D, an act to incorporate International Air Transport Association.
He said: Honourable senators, this Bill,
though comparatively simple in form and not,
I hope, objectionable as to detail, is of more
than passing interest. The Bill, sponsored by
the operators of international air services
throughout most of the world, has for its object the organization of an association for
their mutual advancement, with headquarters
in Canada. It will be remembered that a
conference of most of the governments of
the civilized world was held in Chicago in
December of last year. That conference resulted in an agreement to set up a body to
regulate international civilian aviation. The
agreement then arrived at has been distributed among honourable members, and I
understand that it is to be submitted to us
for consideration later in the session. Following the Chicago conference in April last a
conference was held in Havana among the
representatives of the bodies-whether government-owned
or privately-owned-which
operate international air services in most
parts of the world,. They decided to set up
an organization of their own, known as the
International Air Transport Association, to
further their mutual interests.
The objects of this association are set out
in Clause 3 of this Bill, which I will take the
liberty of reading to you. They are:
(a) To promote safe, regular and economical
air transport for the benefit of the peoples of
the world, to foster air commerce and to study
the problems connected therewith;
Hon. -Mr.HAIG.

(b) To provide means for collaboration among
the air transport enterprises engaged directly
or indirectly in international air transport
service;
(c) To co-operate with the International Civil
Aviation Organization and other international
organizations.
The International Civil Aviation Organization is the government organization, and honourable senators will have read in the newspapers during the last few weeks that it bas
determined to have its headquarters in Canada,
and has in fact opened an office in Montreal.
This operators' association is now proposing to
follow suit, and' the purpose of this Bill is to
give the association corporate form and the
necessary powers to carry on business in this
country. I understand that its head office,
like the head office of the government body,
is to be in Montreal. I may say it is perhaps
a matter of pride to us as Canadians that
the president of this International Air Transport Association is Mr. Herbert Symington,
who, as honourable senators know, is the head
of Trans-Canada Air Lines.
In the debate on the Address a week ago I
ventured to draw attention to the increasingly
important part which this country is taking
in international matters. It seems to me that
we have here a rather striking example of
that fact, for not only the government body
dealing with international aviation but the
private organization of operators is to set up
its headquarters in this country.
Inasmuch as the subject-matter of the Bill
is primarily connected with transportation,
after second reading I shall move a reference
to the Standing Committee on Railways,
Telegraphs and Harbours.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: May I ask the honourable senator a question bearing on subsection
(d) of section 6? Is it the purpose of the
company to do its own banking business?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: That subsection
merely gives the power which is conferred
upon every corporation to endorse promissory
notes and so on.

Hon. Mr. LEGER: I do not think so. It
does not say there that it is for the purposes
of the company.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN:
discussed in committee.

That matter will be

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I am sure the
matter will be explained to the honourable
senator's satisfaction in committee. Obviously
it is not the intention of the association to
carry on a banking business as such.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READINGO

Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT moved the
second reading of Bill E, an Act to incorporate
Ottawa Valley Trust Company.
,
He said: Honourable senators, as indicated
by the titie, this is an Act to incorporate a
trust company to be known as Ottawa Vailey

Trust Company. The purpose is simply to
set up a trust company in compliance with the
provisions of the Trust Companies Act and

sufbject to the supervision of the Superintendent of Insurance. For fifteen years the
sponsors of the Bi-I have had a close association here in Ottawa, through a company
organization known as Edwards Agencies
Limited, which bas served the sponsors of the
Bill and others ini the capacity of fiscal and
general agent and administrator. This organi-

zation, however, has flot exercised the full
powers of a corporate trastee, nor indeed
does its present set-up permit it to do so.

It bas,

however, administered. large sums

of money, and been uniformly successful in
its operations. The sponsors now feel that the
experience gained by them and the executive

officers

of Edwards

Agencies

Limited bas

equipped them to carry on efficiently the 'busi-

ness-of a corporate trustee. It is proposed that
the authorized capital shahl be one million
dollars, divided into ten thousand shares of

$100 each, of which 3250.000 wou]d be subscribed and $100,000 paid in by the shareholders on accounit of their subscriptions. Thut

would conform with the provisions of the
Trust Companies Act.
I intend, if the motion for second reading
is passed, to move that the Bill be referred

for further consideration to the Standing Coinmittee on Banking and Commerce.

SHou. Mr. EULER: Will the honourable
gentleman -permit a question? I presumne that
the -business of this new comipany will be
nation wide. Is that the reason why it is
asking for

a federal

charter

instead of an

Ontario charter?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: The primary reason
for seeking a federal charter is that the
sponsors of the Bill have financial interests on
both sides of the Ottawa River, in Ontario and
Quebec. I think the Trust Companies Act
provides for the issuance of a federal charter
in cases of this kind.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question? I should

71

like to know why the incorporation cannot be
proceeded with by letters patent instead of
hy a private 'bill.

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT:

I will say quite

frankly to my honourable friend that, not
having had any experience as a corporation

lawyer, I cannot readily distinguish between
an application for letters patent and one for a
charter authorized hy Act of Parliament. Perhaps he wou.ld be good enough to explain the
-listinction.
The motion was agreed to and the Bill was

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. LESAGE moved second reading
of Bill F, and Act respecting the Quebec
Railway, Light. and Power Company.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hon. Mr. LESAGE:

Explain.

Honourable senators,

since the reasoms for this Bill are somnewhat

technical, I would ask permission to read them.
They are as follows:
TIhe Quebec Railway, Lig.ht & Power Company
was incorporated by Parliament in 1895. It
was declared that the undertaking of the company was a work for the general advantage of
Cana-da and the cotnpany w.as authorized to
operate -an electrie street railway in thecity of
Quehec and adjoining parishes and a railway
line f rom the city of Quebec to Cap Tourmente
on the north shore of the St. Lawrence river.
Since 1895 the company bas operated an
electrie street railway system in the city of
Quebec. In 1939 Parliament also granted the
company the power to operate auto-buses. As a
matter of fact a large portion of its passenger
service in Quehec is provided by motor-buses

at the present time and they are more and more

replacing the electric tram-cars. The company
is still aperating its railway lîne from Quebec
City to Cap Tourmente, pas.sio-g through Montmorency Faîls and Ste. An-ne de Beaupré, with
electrie and steam trains. The length of this
line is about thirty miles. By their nature the
operations of the tramways and bus services
are quite distinct f rom the operation of the
railway line proper.
As will be seen f rom section 18 of the comnmany's charter of 1895, it had power to en-ter
into any agreement with certain railway and

street-railway companies or with any other
electric railway company in the district of
Quebec regarding the sale or lease of its properties.

The. purpose of this Bihl is to enlarge,

section 18 so as to en-able the company to obtain
sbnilar

powers of

conveyance

or lease with

respect to any company operating auto-buses.

SENATE

72

This amendmaent is also desirable in view of
a judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada
rendered Mardi 15,. 1944. It will be found in
The Supreme Court Reports for 1945 at page 16.
This judgment held that the control of the
tariffs of the auto-bus rates and tolls of the
compan-y came solely within Federal jurisdiction, but pointed out that Federal legislation
w-as lacking on the subject, as the regulation of
fares and tolls for auto-bus service was not
includcd in the powers granted to the Transport Board. In the samne ju-dgment tbe Supreme
Court held that the Quebec Public Service
Board had no jurisdiction in tbe matter in
view of the fact that the undcrtaking of the
eompany was a work for the general advantage
of Canada.
Consequcntly, the ultimate solution would
appear to be the incorporation of a provincial
company to take over the transportation service
of the eompany in Quebec. In view of the fact
that such provincial company might be operating
auto-buses alone or both tramways and autobusest the' tnahling legisiation containcd in the
proposed Bill is neceessary.
Full details on the subject will be furnished
by the oficers and counsel of the company
before the Railway Committee.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: If my rncmory serves
me, a similar proposai was before the Senate
and the Private Buis Committee on at lcast
one occasion, if not two.

of the judgment of the

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from Friday, October 5,
the consideration of His Excellcncy the Governor General's Speech at the opening of the
session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Robinson
for an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. GERALD G. MeCEER: ilonourable
senators, in rising to support the motion that
this House off er humble thanks to His Excellency the Governor General for the gracious
speech wbich he addressed to botb Houses of
Parliament, may I at once join with those who
have prcceded me in congratulating the mover
(Hon. Mr. Robinson) and the seconder (Hon.
Mr. Dupuis) on the splendid, effective and
pleasing way in which they have placed the
motion before us. They are new timber in this
House, but already they have proven that they
Hon. Mr. LESAGE

are gond timber. This is no surprise, for they
both are good stock from fine old solid Canadian family trees.
May I hasten to join honourable senators
in the words of complimentary and happy
approval and genuine estecm extended to the
honourable .senator from Kootenay East (Hon.
Mr. King) on bis appointment to the distinguished position he now so gracefully
occupies as Speaker of this House.
Much indeed bas happened, your Honour,
since you and I sat together in the Legisiative
Assembly of British Columbia in 1916. That
was twenty-nine years ago. But even then
we juniors looked upon you as a battiescarrcd veteran of many political campaigns.
If I remember rightly, you first entered upon
public life in the legisiature of our province
in 1903. In the intcrvening forty-two years

You have donc, great bonour to the
maritime province of New Brunswick on

honour and service to the maritime province
of British Columbia, whicb you ndopted as
the base of operations for your noble profession of medicine and for that public career
wbich bas contributed so mucb to Canada's
national progress. You could very wcll say:
Much bave I seen and knonn; cities of men

Myself not least, but honour'd of tbem all.
Our best wisbcs go witb you in this new

May I loin with ail the bonourable senators
in the congratulations which they s0 generously extcndcd to the bonourable senator for
Sheiburne (Hon. Mr. Robertson) upon bis
rapid risc to the position of leader of the
Government in this House. Nova Scotia may
well. be proud of ber sons, for ever since the
birth of our nation they bave gone forth
from ber rugged shores witb the faitb, tbe
industry, and the ability to make the dreamn
of the Fathers of Confcderation-a mighty
and powerful Canadian nation-come true.
I was privilcged to spend a year in Halifax
attending Dalhousie Law School. What I got
there was of great value, but it was as notbing
compared with what I got from my association with Nova Scotians wbo, I found, flot

OCTOBER 9, 1945
only lived ini a salty atmosphere, but really
were the sait of the earth. 1 made my first
political campaign speech in Halifax in the
election of 1911. Il must have caught the
spirit of Nova Scotia, because I have been
making political speeches ever since.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh!l Oh!l
Hon. Mr. McGEER: While there I Iearned
that we of the maritime province of the
Pacific have much in common wjth you of
the Maritime Provinces of the Atlantic. We
know what it means to feel the sait spume
flying and to, hear the mighty oceans booming
their restless -and eternal message upon our
shores, calling our nation to take a rankixng
place in the sea-borne trade of the nations
of ail the world. You know, honourable
senators, we who corne here, leaving behind
us the surging voice of the Atlantic and
Pacific oeeans, find the complacent. attitude
of the Great Lakes and the canoe-minded
atmosphere of the beautiful Ottawa River
Valley a somewhat rcstraining influence upon
our conception of the future glory of our
nation.
Now that our Speaker is a maritimer owing
allegiance to both our shores, and the Go>vernment leader here is from. our Atlantic coast,
it may well be that the ideal of Canada as a
mighty nation of the seas-an ideal so weli
perso.nified by the men of our Navy and our
Merchant ýMarine in this war-is fast becoming more and more a reality.
I join with the honourable senators in
extending to the Goverument leader the
siicere wish that in the difficult days of the
future bis success will be just as great as the
speed with whioh hie has risen to positions
of responsibility in the past.
1 offer my tribute to the new leader on this
aide of the House (Hon. Mr. Haig) with a
measure of real fellow feeling, because 1
happened to be horn on the main street of
that great and Vhriving metropodis, the city
of Winnipeg, from which the honourable leader

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: It was a long time
3go; but that does flot deny me the right to
boast that 1 was born in a cabin on Canada's
western frontier. While -we on this side of the
House may find it easier to congratulate him.
as the leader of the opposition than we
would have had the election gone otherwise
and we had been called upon to felicitate hirn
as the Leader of the Government, nevertheless,
we are ail very happy tha.t the wise, friendly,
and experienced honourable gentleman from

73

Alma (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) has handed over
the reins to one so genial and able as the
honourable senator fromn Winnipeg.
It is surely sornething more than a cornetdence that our Speaker is £rom British Columbia, the Government leader from Nova Scotia
and the -leader of the opposition from Winnipeg. In this our firat post-war Parliament, our
Victory Parliament, the distribution of leadership fulfils the hcopes of our fathers, who in
Confederation days dreamed of a rnighty
nation reaching fromn sea to sea. Such incidents
heip us to carry on with an eniarged vision
and renewed faith in the gioriaus future of
our land.
As far as I amn concerncd, it is a pleasant
coincidence that the Leader of the Opposition
and I owe aliegiance to Winnipeg-he by
adoption, and I by birth; that at the comnmeîicement of my politicai career I had the
privilege of sitting in the legislature of British
Columbia with the honourable the Speaker,
and that part of my legal training was secured
in Nova Scotia, the home of our Government
leader. It indîcates that I arn fortunate, enough
to be something of a Canadian myself, and that
in the Senate itseif 1 arn in the hands of friends.
Even if that were not so, the words of welcome
and the general good, will which honourable
senators have extended to those so recentiy
honoured by a life membership in Canada's
Parliament, have dissipated any feeling that
one might have that one was a stranger in a
strange place. That welcome has assured me
that I am.a Caniadian, privileged ta enjoy an
enduring friendship with the eider statesmen
of our land.
From the moment my appointrnent was
announced, I learned that my friends in al
walks of life had a, most arnazing variety of
conceptions of what the Senate is and was.

In not a single instance was the great honour
of heing appointed to the Senate recognized.
Some of my more radical and belligerent
supporters seemed to feel that I was retiring
from public life; that 1 was being put away

from the service of rny people, my province
and my nation. One of rny good friends wrote
to me, more in sorrow than in anger, that My
appointment to the Senate was but another
tragic example of Gray's conclusion that "The
paths of glory iead but to the grave."
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh! Oh!
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: Honourable senators,
after listening to the honourable member
from Queens-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kiniey),
and the speech this evening of the honourabie
senator who introd-uced the motion to appoint
a cotumittee to, investigate taxation (Hon. Mr.
Campbell), and after having encountered the

SENATE

genuine good will and spirit of friendship with
which the doomed are welcomed to this
magnificent Chamber, I have only this to say:
If this be the grave, "O death, where is thy
sting? O grave, where is thy victory?"
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh! Oh!
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: Honourable senators,
I wish to tender my thanks to the Government, and particularly te the Prime Minister.
Tonight in making this, my maiden speech in
the Senate of Canada, I believe that I am
enjoying the greatest privilege and honour
that can come to a Canadian in the political
life of our nation. My appointment te this
distinguirshed body was not within the scope
of my political ambitions, and was made
without my knowledge. I find it somewhat
difficult to believe that I am worthy of so
great an honour. But since I am here, I want
my colleagues to know what I conceive to be
the purposes, the powers and the duties of
the Senate of Canada. I have tried to understand what the Fathers of Confederation
regarded as the role of the Senate in the life
of our nation, not only in 1867 but in these
days of changing conditions. I find on page
37 of the Confederation Debates. one of the
books on Canadian History wbich I believe
to be more interesting and enjoyable than any
3ther, this statement from the greatest and
wisest of all the Fathers of Confederation,
Sir John A. Macdonald. He said:
In this country, we must remember. that the
gentlemen who will be selected for the Legislative CouncilThat is the Senate-stand on a very different footing from the
peers of England. They have not like them
any ancestral associations or position derived
from History. They have not that direct
influence on the people themselves, or on the
popular branch of the legislature, which the
peers of England exercise, from their great
wealth, their vast territorial possessions, their
numerous tenantry, and that prestige with
which the exalted position of their class of
centuries bas invested them. The members of
our Upper House will be like those of the
Lower, men of the people, and from the people.
The man put into the Upper House is as much
a man of the people the day after as the day
before his elevation. Springing from the people,
and one of them, he takes his seat in the Council
with all the sympathies and feelings of a man
of the people, and when he returns home, at the
end of the session, ho mingles with them on
equal terms, and is influenced by the same feelings and associations, and events, as those which
affect the mass around him. And is it, then, to
be supposed that the members of the upper
branch of the legislature will set thenselves
deliberately at work to oppose what they know
to be the settled opinions and wishes of the
people of the country? They will not do it.
Hon. Mr. McGEER.

There is no fear of a deadlock between the
two Houses. There is an infinitely greater
chance of a deadlock between the two branches
of the legislature, should the elective principle
be adopted, than with a nominated chamberchosen by the Crown, and having no mission
from the people. The memýbers of the Upper
Chamber would then come from the people as
well as those of the Lower House, and should
any difference ever arise between both branches,
the former could say to the members of the
popular brani-"We as much reoresent the
feelings of the people as you do, and even more
so; we are not elected from small localities and
for a short period; you as a body were elected
at a particular time, when the public mind
w-as running in a particular channel; you were
returned to Parliament, not so much re.presenting the general views of the country, on
general questions, as upon the particular subjects which happened to engage the minds of
the people when they vent to the polls. We
bave as much right, or a better right, than you
to be considered as representing the deliberate
will of the people on general questions, and
will not give way.
therefore wNe
It does seem that Sir John A. prescribes.
as the first responsibility of the Senate, a
response in all its affairs to the will of the
mass of the Canadian people.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Secondly, he advances
the proposition that in responding to the will
of the people, it should be the duty of the
Senate to extend the greatest possible measure
of co-operation to the Commons in all its
actions.
Now I want to dwell for a moment on what
that distinguished statesman had to say about
senators being as much of the people after
appointment as before. My father was born
on a farm in the County of Wicklow, in
Ireland; my mother was born in St. Helens
in Lancashire, in England. Early in life I
served my time as an iron moulder, and I
still carry my union card. Later I studied
law. I was twice elected to the legislative
assemb1y of my province and once to the office
of Mayor of my city. I joined with the other
mayors of Canada in forming the Mayors
Conference in the depression years, in 1935.
I had the privilege of attending that greatest
of all universities on political cconomy in
Canada, the House of Commons. Se I come
to the Senate with some of the qualifications
that Sir John A. prescribed. I believe that
while we have met the challenge to our right
to live upon the earth, our whole scheme of
responsible government is being challenged
today as it neyer was challenged before. We
speak of a brave new world with higher
standards of living and greater measures of
freedom for all the people of the earth.
But first let me refer to what was said about
the Senate by another distinguished Canadian, a former Prime Minister and senator,

OCTOBER 9, 1945
the
Right Honourable
Arthur Me.ighen.
Writing in the Queen's Quarterly, Volume 44,
page 152, in 1937, Mr. Meighen had this to
say:
Some time ago a prominent and popular
Canadian, a man of opposite political association to myself, said, "I am thankful in these
days for the Senate! No matter what wild and
extreme radicalism may sweep the country the
Senate will stand firm; it will save the ship".
This surely is worth saying and remembering.
The forces of wild and extreme radicalism must
be met right out among the ranks of our people,
in their homes and meeting places; there the
power of reason and common sense must be
applied, the lesson of long experience must be
taught, or nothing will save the ship. Surely
we have learned from tragedies in other lands
that the tide of a mad, militant and persistent
majority never can be stemmed. It must not
become a majority.
What the Senate can do is to devote its
energy within its own sphere to making our
laws practical and sensible, to give the best
possible chance to workers and especially to
the humblest worker.
That is the conception of one of the
Senate's duties as stated by a man who
graced both our Commons and our Senate
with an ability that people in every walk
of life and in every political party recognized
as outstanding.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McGEER:
The message of
Mr. Meighen is two-fold. He charges the
Senate with the responsibility of taking care
of the working masses, and of seeing to it
that the humblest are not despised.
He
warns of the danger if the masses are neglected or oppressed.
We who are responsible in these days for
at least a part of the government of Canada
have good reason to study with care and
profound interest these words of Sir John
A. Macdonald and the Right Honourable
Arthur Meighen.
The enslavement of the
workers in many lands and the disturbing
conditions that exist in the wake of this last
appalling war give us reason to sense our
obligation and to do something more than
talk -about it-in short, to use all the influence we can to raise the standard of the
humblest of our workers to the point of
satisfaction.
A great many people in this country and
elsewhere were amazed that in a British
election the services that Churchill had
rendered did not save him from being
defeated in his first post-war election. I
suppose that the latest election in Britain
resulted in one of the greatest surprises the
English-speaking world has ever known. Who
ever dreamed that in the wake of the war
a Labour government would come to West-

75

minster, and that in the British House of
Commons members would sing "The Red
Flag"?
Here is a warning given to the British
people by one who to me bas always been
the greatest Liberal that England ever produced. At Sheffield, on September 23, 1873,
Joseph Chamberlain said:
There is no patriotism or wisdom in ignoring
a patent danger and a self-evident wrong. There
is no folly more stupendous than that which
refuses to consider just claims temperately urged
by great masses of the people. There is no
crime so base as that of those self-styled instruetors of public opinion who pander to selfish
prejudices and intolerant assumption, while they
ignore the irrefutable evidence of injustice and
wrong. Suoh men may stay for the moment the
settlement of these questions, but they cannot
stave it off. The time will come when the
solution will be obtained with or without them;
and according to their conduet now will they
then be consulted or entirely set aside. If they
continue the course they now pursue, the time
is coming when the working class, strong in its
perfected organization, as it is already in its
overflowing numbers, will say to them"We looked for guidance to the blind,
. We suaed for counsel to the dumb;
Fling the vain fancy to the windYour hour is past and ours is come.
You galve in tihat propitious hour
No kindly look, no gracious tone;
But Heaven bas not denied us power
To do your duty and our own."
Nobody paid much attention to that
prophecy of Chamberlain in 1873. Like other
men who understood and who had the vision
of wisdom, he was cast aside, but now his
prophecy has been fulfilled.
Do you think, honourable senators, that we
have nothing to do to prevent the troubled
conditions of our own nation from growing
worse instead of better? I believe that in our
war programme we never were more united;
but in the domestic affairs of our nation we
never were so hopelessly divided.
My conception is that the government of
the people of Canada flows from three political authorities. They are civic and local,
provincial, and federal. The ideal of good
government which our Canadian system of
responsible and representative government aima
at is to be found only in the wholesome cooperation of all our nine provinces with the
local governments within their respective jurisdictions, and with each ather and with the
federal government; ail of them employing all
the means in their possession to prosper the
development of the resources of the entire
territory and make possible the progressive
security of ail the people, and exercising the
powers at their disposal to administer
impartial justice in all its bounds so that no
individual, group, class, corporation or section

76

SENATE

may advance at the expense of or to the
detriment of any other. The aim should also
be by periodic stocktaking to maintain in
reasonable balance both the quality of benefit
and quantity of advantage that flows to every
section of this extensive country from the
legislative and administrative action of the
federal authorities.
The Duncan Commission Report dealing with
Maritime Rights is an outstanding example
of what can be done by periodic stocktaking.
But I believe that a committee of this Senate,
working in co-operation with the Commons,
tould have donc a better job for the Maritime
Provinces and the rest of Canada. My reason
for believing that is this. If the work of the
Duncan Commission had been done by a
::ommittee of the Senate, that work would not
have ended with the filing of a report. The
Senate committee would have recognized that
what was necessary for the Maritime Provinces might be necessary for the western
provinces. for the upper reaches of Quebec
and of Ontario, or even for the Province of
British Columbia; and had the committee
carried through the stocktaking-which is how
the Duncan Commission described its activities
-we should have had a much better balance in
both the quantity and quality of advantage
that flows from the federal authority to the
distant reaches of this great nation.
Now on the agenda there is an important
matter, the St. Lawrence waterway. Our
Government has agreed to the terms of a
treaty, and bas undertaken that the moment
it is ratified by the Senate and House of
Representatives of the United States it will
be presented to the Senate and House of
Commons of Canada for ratification.
Let me point out that the position in regard
to this matter is very different in the United
States from what it is in Canada. In the
United States the development of hydroelectrie energy is no less and no more the
responsibility of the states which form the
union than it is the responsibility of the
provinces which form the confederation of
Canada. But what has taken place? The
Federal Government in the United States, as
part of their attempt to overcome depression,
launched a national programme of power
development. They have carried on huge
developments in the states of Colorado, California, Oregon, Washington and Nevada. The
Tennessee Valley Authority covers a vast area
of the eastern section, and now an even larger
programme is under development in the
Missouri River Valley. The Federal Government il? Canada has donc nothing. Countless
millions of horsepower rush daily in idle
Hon. Mr. MeGEER.

waste down our rivers to lakes and seas. If
we ratify that treaty and help build the St.
Lawrence waterway, we shall spend between
250 and 500 million dollars in the development of the St. Lawrence Seaway and the
power projects contemplated.
I believe that this kind of co-operation
between the United States and Canada will
meet with the unanimous approval of the
Canadian people. It will mean the creation
of a great volume of cheap power for the
But unforindustries of Central Canada.
tunately for Canada as a whole, industry is
already over-centralized in that area. Surely
if we are going to approve of that project,
we in the Senate, who are called upon to
guard and protect the rights and privileges of
all sections of the Dominion, should insist that
a national Canadian power programme, similar to that carried out in the United States
by the Federal Government there, be undertaken for the purpose of developing the hydroelectrie power of the Maritimes, the outer
regions of Quebec and Ontario, the Prairie
Provinces and British Columbia.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Probably most honourable members have read President Truman's message to Congress on the seaway,
but I should like to quote this portion:
The Congress and the people of our country
can take just pride and satisfaction in the
foresight they showed by developing the Tennessee and Columbia Rivers and the rivers in
the central valley of California. Wilhout the
power from these rivers the goal of 50,000
airplanes a year-considered fantastic only five
short years ago, but actually surpassed twice
over-would have been impossible. Nor could
we have developed the atomic bomb as early as
we did without the large blocks of power we
used from the Tennessee and Columbia Rivers.
The timely development of these rivers
shortened the war by may years and saved
countless American lives. We must ever be
gra.teful for the vision of the late President
Franklin D. Roosevelt and the wisdom of the
Congress in urging and approving the harnessing
of these priceless natural resources.
We Canadians are standing by, indifferent
to the enormous wealth of resources that
is ours to develop, notwithstanding the example that stares us in the face just across an
imaginary border. That is only one example.
Yeu can find countless others.
Now, in the light of what I have said, let
me come back to finding out what are the
powers of the Senate. I want to apologize
to those who have long been members of
this House for repeating what they have
perhaps heard ad nauseam, but there are
many new members in this Chamber, and I
for one had some difficulty in finding anything

OCTOBER 9, 1945
like a clear definition of the powers and
duties of this body. In any event I should
like my colleagues to know what I believe
those powers and duties to be, and if I am
wrong, I hope they will put me right.
During the Confederation debates Sir John
A. Macdonald laid down this general proposition:
In order to protect local interests, and ta
prevent sectional jealousies, it was found requisite that the three great divisions into which
British North America is separated should be
represented in the Upper House on the principle
of equality . . . Accordingly, in the Upper
House . . . which has the sober second-thought

in legislation, it is provided that each of those
great sections shall be represented equally by
twenty-four members.
As you know. when the Western Provinces
came in they got another twenty-four members; but the Prairie Provinces and British
Columbia are separated by infinitely greater
physical barriers than are the Maritime Provinces and Quebec.
Sir John continues:
There would be no use of an Upper House if
it did not exercise, when it thought proper, the
right of opposing, or amending, or postponing,
the legislation of the Lower House. It would be
of no value whatever were it a mere Chamber
for registering the decrees of the Lower House.
It must be an independent House, having free
action of its own, for it is only valuable as being
a regulating body, calmly considering the legislation initiated by the popular branch, and
preventing any hasty or ill-considered legislation
which may come from that body.
The Senate was not prepared to be merely
a Chamber of second thought or delayed
action.
A special committee was appointed in 1918
to consider the question of determining the
rights of the Senate in matters of financial
legislation. It decided to secure the opinion
of two of the ablest authorities on constitutional law in Canada. They reported to
the Chairman of that committee, Hon. W.
B. Ross, as follows:
We have been asked if in our opinion the
Senate has the power ta amend money Bills.
Sections 17 and 91 of the British North
America Act place the Senate on exactly the
same footing as the House of Commone as
respects all legislation.
The only material derogation to this general
rule is contained in section 53 which provides
that Bills for appropriating -any part of the
public revenue or for imposing any tax or
impost shall originate in the House of Commons.
The denial of the right to originate money
Bills does not involve the denial of the right to
amend them. Nothing therefore in the text of
the British North America Act takes away the
latter right from the Senate.
What is said in that letter is set out in detail
in the committee's report.

An Hon. SENATOR:
statement?

7r
Who

made

that

Hon. Mr. McGEER: E. Lafleur and Aimé
Geoffrion. Instead of reading the full report
of the Ross committee I will ask that it be
incorporated in Hansard.
(The report referred to by Hon. Mr. McGeer
follows).
The Special Committee appointed ta consider
the question of determining what are the rights
or the Senate in matters of financial legislation,
and whether under the provisions of the British
North America Act, 1867, it is permissible and
to what extent, or forbidden, for the Senate te
amend a Bill embodying financial clauses (money
bill), have the honour to make their second
report, as follows:
Your committee begs ta report the following
summing-up thereof is submitted as the conclusions of your committe on the rights of the
Senate ,in matters of financial legislation:
1. That the Senate of Canada has and always
had since it was created, the power to amend
bills originating in the Commons appropriating
any part of the revenue or imposing a tax by
reducing the amounts therein, but has not the
right ta increase the same without the consent
of the Crown.
2. That this power was given as an essential
part of the Confederation contract.
3. That the practice of the Imperial Houses
of Parliament in respect of money bills is no
part of the Constitution of the Dominion of
Canada.
4. That the Senate in the past has repeatedly
amended so-called money bills, in same cases
without protest from the Commons, while in
other cases the bills were allowed ta pass, the
Commons protesting or claiming that the Senate
could not amend a money bill.
5. That rule 78 of the House of Commons of
Canada claim.ing for that body powers and
privileges in connection with money bills identical w'ith those of the Imperial House of
Commons is unwarranted under the provisions
of the British North America Act. 1867.
6. That the Senate as shown by the British
North America Act as well as by the discussion
in the Canadian Legislature on the Quebec
Resolutions in addition to its general powers
and duties is specially empowered ta safeguard
the rights of the provincial organizations.
7. That besides general legislation, there are
questions such as provincial subsidies, public
lands in the western provinces and the rights
of the provinces in connection with pending
railway legislation and the adjustment of the
rights of the provinces thereunder likely ta arise
at any time, and it la important that the powers
of the Senate relating thereto be thoroughly

understood.

What the Senate can do is, I believe, to be

found in what it has done. In 1913 the Senate
stopped the Government of Canada from
spending money. That is one of the great
powers whioh the Senate enjoys. If you look

up your Hansard of that date you will find the
following:

78

SENATE

Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED moved the second
reading of Bill 21, an Act to authorize measures
for increasing the effective Naval Forces of the
Empire.
He said: This is a Bill providing that there
may be paid and applied out of the consolidated
revenue fund of Canada, a sum not exceeding
thirty-five million dollars for the purpose of
immediately increasing the effective naval forces
of the Empire.
Sir GEORGE Ross moved in amendment:
That this House is not justified in giving its
assent to the Bill until it is submitted to the
judgment of the country.

which takes you through the city of Mexico
and six hundred miles further south. It is
being continued te the Panama canal, and
in time it will be extended to Rio de Janeiro.
On the west coast of Mexico there are being
developed even more elaborate winter resorts
than are to be found in California or Hawaii.
We should look forward to making the tourist
trade of this country the largest and most
important item in our future trade.

On May 30, 1913, the amendment was
carried by a vote of 51 to 27. This is an
example of that independence of the Senate
which Sir John A. Macdonald declared must
be maintained. It was a Conservative administration that sponsored the legislation for
that appropriation.
The majority of the
members of the Senate at that time had been
appointed by Conservative governments, yet
that Senate denied the right of the Commons
to pass such legislation.

Hon. Mr. McGEER: The Senate started
this, and the Senate has a right to follow it
through. We need better highways and accommodation for our people; our hinterland
must be opened up; our parks, lakes and reserves should be developed so that they will
meet the competition in tourist traffic the
world over. Here we have an alternative
power, to stop spending or to encourage and
recommend expenditures for wise and proper
development.
An incident which I thought important was
one in which the Senate stopped the House
of Commons from amending the British North
America Act in 1936.

Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: At that time there
was a Liberal majority of twentyfour in the
Senate. I was appointed to this Chamber
two days before. I voted on that Bill in
the House of Commons and also in the
Senate.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: The honourable gentleman may be right. At any rate I have another
instance where there is no question about it,
because there was a Liberal government in
power, but the Senate took similar action.
However, that is beside the question. The
point established is that the Senate has the
power, and has exercised it, to stop the
Government of Canada from spending money.
On the other hand, I find that the Senate
of Canada has the power to recommend that
the Government spend money. In 1934, in
the depths of the depression, the Senate
appointed a Tourist Committee. This committee made a report recommending the
appropriation of $150,000 for the establishment of a travel bureau. Within two months
of that recommendation the Government
established the bureau, and from 1934 to 1945
there has been expended in all some $2,549,853.
The estimated receipts from the tourist trade
during that same period are $1,326,000,000. To
the Senate must go the credit of having been
ahead of the Commons in recognizing the
need of something of a practical nature in
the way of tourist development, and recommending suitable action.
Now that the war is over we need some
more practical recommendations. Today we
have to compete with the Laredo highway,
Hon. Mr. McGEER.

Hon. Mr. HAIG:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: The Minister of Finance, with the approval of the Minister. of
Justice, proposed in the Commons a redistribution of the powers of indirect taxation held
exclusively by the Federal Government, and
that the provinces lie given power to levy
indirect taxation. Following a speech in the
Senate by the Right Honourable Arthur
Meighen, I think both the Minister of Finance, the Honourable Charles Dunning, and
the Minister of Justice, the Honourable Ernest
Lapointe, realized they had made a mistake,
and that the Senate was correct in rejecting
the proposal. In any event, the Bill was
never revived. But it is important to note
that a Senate dominated by Liberal senators
repudiated a measure of a Liberal government to alleviate the deplorable condition of
the provincial governments. The tragic part
of the whole affair was that nothing construetive was done about it by the Senate. It
appears to me that the Senate could have investigated the financial position of the provinces at that time, and recommended a practical measure of relief.
Another important incident was the Old
Age Pension legislation. The Bill was passed
in 1925 and deadlocked in the Senate. It was
deadlocked because the House of Commons
refused to accept a proposed amendment. That
deadýlock continued until the election of 1926.
In 1926 that legislation was approved by the

OCTOBER % 1945
electorate, and then the Senate accepted the
mandate of the people and pamed. the BiR
unanimously.
It appears in the ambit of those cases that
the Senate has the right to exercise these
powers:
i. To maintain the constitution as it is
defined in the British North America Act and
our English Common Law.
2. To maintain inviolate the rights of ail
the provinces as between themselves, and
with the Federal Government.
3. To guard and protect the rights and
privileges cf ail territories, sections, provinces,
cities, classes and groups, and the education,
health and security cf ail ind-ividuals, especially the rights and privileges of minorities,
the underprivileged and those in need.

5. To veto ail legisiation deemed by the
Senate te be against the good gevernment of
the people cf Canada.
6. To initiate any legisiation deemed te be
necessary and requisite, which dees net invelve

7. To conduct public investigation into ail
matters, cf current public interest and cencern.
To initiate legislation within its powers, and

and nècessary.

the Dominion, in ali ite parts and over aIl its
people, a forma of government which aims te

for themselves, or that which the Government,

individual, corporation, group, class or section
may unrighteously advance at the expense cf
another; te augment and put into effect, whenever it is expressed with authority, the mandate cf the people.
These puwers give us a purpose te meet a
great many cf the situations that will arise.
I do net knew hew many honourable senators have read the Sirois Report. Along with
the report there is a very large volume of surveys. The Sirois investigation ccst the taxpayers cf this country semething over 8500,000.
The only result cf it as far as I know was an
angry dispute between the provincial premiers
and the representatives cf the Dominion Gevernment, during a conference that failed. I
have read and studied this report carefully, and
I know that a committee cf this Senate could
have conducted that investigation, and presented in a much briefer report everything
that is herein contained; and I am sure they
would have suggested some practical solution
for the problems; that everybody knew te
exist before the investigation was made.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MûGEER: A fair interpretatien
cf the recommendations cf the report is that
no solution cf the real problem was reached.
With respect te the Maritime Rights Commission, if a ccmmittee cf the Senate had
made the investigation it would have been
made by a group cf men who had experience
in municipal, provincial and federal administration. The laVe Honourable Newton RowelI
did have some slight experience i national
politics.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: HoR
was a sick man.

and I am glad that one who knows se much
about this report has so kindly approved of
my remarks. If Sir John A. Macdonald was
right that the Senate was nominated for the
purpose of guarding and protecting the rights
of the territories-that is the provinces--then
this Sirois Report is of vital interest to every
honourable senator who agrees that it is the
duty and responsibility of the Senate of
Canada to protect the rights and privileges
of the provinces and municipalities.
I do not know how many honourable senators have read these documents on the
Dominion-Provincial Conference. I have read
them all, but I cannot say much more than
that. I think the time has come when we
should have a strong and able committee of
the Senate to study not only the Sirois
Report, but to grasp the full meaning of
what these documents on the Dominion-Provincial Conference mean. I say this because
a settlement of the differences between our
cities and provinces and the federal government must be reached if we are to enjoy the
peace, progress and prosperity which I am
satisfied is available to us in the Dominion
of Canada.
I am not going to say more. I hope that
someone will present, and the Senate will
receive, a resolution calling for the appointment of a committee. Furthermore, I believe
that the Senate should make the provincial
and municipal governments aware of the fact
that it is prepared to champion, protect and
advance the cause of local governments.
The Senate has not been content to remain
a mere power for restriction and restraint,
a chamber of delayed action and second
thought. In the conception of its creators,
that undoubtedly was one of its primary
purposes, but it was only one of many
equally important duties. Without detracting
in any way fron that essential and vastly
important part of its constitutional responsibility, the Senate has supplied in the past
and will

offer in

the future true principles

to public opinion and worthy objectives for
popular aspiration.
The Senate can expose the fallacies in
theories of political economy that conflict
with our traditional conception of expanding
liberty and seculity under the impulse of
representative and responsible government.
It can give enlargement and understanding
to the ideas of the age, and advance the
intellectual tone of public demands on political administration. It can facilitate the exercise and progress of political power and
action, not only by protecting the rights
and privileges of minorities but even more
só by espousing the cause of those who,
Hon. Mr. McGEER.

unsheltered and unfavoured, are in need. It
can give our nation greater unity and
strength by supporting a more generous consideration of the needs of those sections of
our nation less plentifully endowed than
others or not as favourably located on the
lines of transportation over which our commerce moves. I am speaking as one who has
been closely associated with municipal life in
Canada, but I am not saying anything of which
any honourable senator is unaware. There is
not in Canada a city with the means to take
care of the education and health of its citizens
and to maintain order as these things should
be donc. Much less is there a city able to
bring about that new expansion for which we
are all hoping.
I want to refer for a moment to the plan
for making Ottawa a great national capital. I
think the vision is a splendid one. But when
the Prime Minister referred to the proposal
in another place, on the 21st day of April last
year, he had in mind sotnething more than a
national capital. He said this:
I would like to sec-I nay net live to se it,
but I hope others may-the day w'hen the
Ottawa river, instead of flowing along the north
bo.rcler of the capital, will bo flowing through
tie heart of the city, the greater Ottawa that
is to be, and that we shall have a capital city
which w ill extend as far into the province on
the other side of the Ottawa river as it may

extend into the province on this side . . .
I have one other thought in mind to which 1
should like to give expression an<l it is this . . .
What

finer

nenorial

could

there

be than

a

capital city which would serve as a model of
conliiity planning for all the other cities of
Canada . . . ?

That is a magnificent idea. Everybody is
planning to rebuild our standard of life. Now,
we sec that our cities are fairly poor when we
come to know them. Montreal and Toronto,
for instance, have sections that are net conplimentary to our Canadian standard of life.
That is truc not only of our older cities, for
already it is to some degree truc of the
younger cities of the prairies and the Pacifie
coast. It is true of Ottawa too. Go and look
about you. Are we in this age and generation
going to build a great war memorial in the
midst of living conditions such as abound
in the cities of Ottawa and Hull? If that were
to be donc it would be a travesty on the sacrifices that have been made in this war.
But where are the other cities of Canada
to find money to build a replica of the model
that is to be built here out of the Consolidated
Revenue Fund? I say, let us by all means
make the national capital a war memorial
worthy of a nation as great and rich as
Canada is. And, by the way, in my humble
opinion Canada is the richest nation on earth.

OCTOBER 9, 1945
No other twelve million people possess and
control such great resources as we do, witb
the saine power to develop them and to use
them in trade and in service. We are not
poor in manpower, in ability, in industrial
equipment, in available natural resources. We
can build as a war memorial the finest national
capital in the world; and if we want to have
the kind of co-operation between, federal,
provincial and civic governmeuts that we
should have, we can give to every city in
Canada the example in realîty that such a
model would off er. But we shaîl probably not
do that. We shahl prob-ably do as we did in
the thirties, and try to tell our people that
idie men, idle wealth, id-le resources and idie
money are the inevitable fate of a nation
that lives through a post-war period.
In my own city, if we had the means we
shoUld like to build our parks and beaches on
a better plan and a wider sca-le. We sbould like
to have social centres in connection with our
sebools. We should like to have auditoriums
and mus~ic and some of the other arts. We
want playing fields and stadia and gymnasia
and swimming tanks. We look upon our
working areas and find that for the great mass
of the people the only eutertainment available
outeside of their own homes is in the movies
and the beer parlours. That is not good
enough for the, people of Canada today. Every
city in this country needs tbings sucb as I
have mpntioned, and every city eau have them.
It is up to someone to solve the problem of
bringing available resources, ability and labour
together to permit the people to produce
what tbey are capable of producing out of
their own resources.
1 also want to say a word on flic question
of meat rationing, whicb 1 think is another
problem. that this Senate should tackle. We
are having difficulty with meat today because
for the first time we -have gone into the
exporting of it. The other day we, sbipped
90,000 eggs in one vessel from the port of
Vancouver through flhc Panama Canal to
Englaud. We had neyer sbipped a single egg
that way before.
In Vancouver we have no shipside cold
storage facilities. The other day we had a
strike at the Americau Can C-om.pany. An
enorimous quantity of fish was being caught,
and fortunately the strike was settled, though
just in time to prevent the loss of thousauds
aud thousands of pounds of salmon that might
have occurred because of the lack of cold
storage 'facilities. 1 believe we are in the ineat
exportîug business to stay. We are going to
ship beef, poultry, eggs, bacon and butter and
other agricultural produets not only to England
and to Europe, but to the countries across the
47704-74

si

Paciflc. I am confident that we should nDw
be preparing to build our freeziug and storage
facilities upon a larger basis than we ever
dreamed of 'building them before.
We have nu ships to carry that uew traffie
over the seas. Many of the ships built ln this
wax are already obsolete. They were merely
cargo carriers louiât as rapidly as possible to
carry the largest volume of tonnage in the
shorteat possible time. Only one country in
the world bas increased its tonnage. The
tonnage of the British Empire, 1 understand,
has fallen from some 22 million tons to between
14 and 15 million tons. Germany's, Japan'a
and Italy-s tonnage has been practically wipecI
out; su has that of Belgium, Norway and
several countries. Because of these facts 1
believe that in every shipyard in Canada we
should be *moving to build ships designed to,
carry our ever-increasing foreigu trade over
every ocean. Yes, we are in the export trade,
and our foreign commerce is going to be far
greater than it bas ever been before. ln
addition to lending hundreds of millions of
dollars to people abroad, who are going to pay
for our exports out of our own loans, we
ought, to have sume clear regard for .what.
the Federal Government should be doing in
building up facilities that çwill make it possible to carry the foreign trade in ships built
in Canada, out of Canadian material, by
Canadians, and operated by Canadians fromn
Canadian docks.
It seenis to me rather an unhappy experience to pick up the newspapers and find that.
England bas a representative in Ottawa seeking aid, and that he has been. in Washingtont
on a similar mission. We in the British Empire own 43 per cent of the world's -agricultural land and 50 per cent of the world's
known resources. Surely the time bas come
when theTe should, be a great British Empire
conference to work out the problem of coordinating the exehange of these re.sources
among ourselves for the purpose of building
the Empire's defences, industries and resources.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Empire trade, too.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Yes, Empire trade if
you wlll. We are, I think, forgetting some
of the old idjeas of what the Empire means.
1 remember hearing over and over again thnt
famous statement of Sir John A. MacdonaldAs for myself, my course is clear. A British
subjeet I was born, a British subject I shail die.
Well, I eau echo that iu saying: A man of
the people 1 was born, and a man of -the people Il shahl die.' But 1 am not so far removcd fromn England that I do nut see the
plight she is iu to&iay, an'd 1 tbink that we,

82

SBNATE

should. hear the eall and respond to, it openly
and generously.
Sir John A. Macdonald
voicod a similar sentiment; and lie was not
the only one, for Sir Wilfrid Laurier said:
Any thouglit of separation from Great Britain,
if any sucli tho-ught exiets anywhere-and I do
net boliers Jt does--woîld lie a folly and a
crime. When England je at wax, we are at war,
and the thought of being neutral would be like
thle command o.f King Caaiute to 'the sea te recede from his feet. No action of ours could
bring that about. When England je at war,
we are at war.
The true conception of the British Empire je
the conception ef new, growing, strong and
wealtliy nations, each une developing itself on
the line of its own needs and conditions, but ail
jeining in the case et comnion dlanger. and from
aIl pointe eft te earth ru.ehing uipon tlie commun
enemy.
On another occasion lie said:
England bas proved at ail times tliat sie
can light lier ownl battîce. but if the day were
ever te cerne wben Englaud was ia danger, let
the bugle sound, let the tires lie lit on the bille,
and in ail pacte of tic colonies, thougli we nîlgit
flot be aile te do mucli, wvhatever we ecaîs do
ishall be donc by tlie colonies te help lier.
Now, wiîli England in a desparate pliglit
for food, are we going te say something
dilTeront trorn wliat we said in the midst of
war? 1 do net know hiow it impressd lionouýrable senaters, but the proudest moment ln my
lite was when, sitting ln the House ot ýCenmens, I heard our Prime Minister stand up
;and say that lie would ask Parliament te proyide means for flnancing the forwardinýg te
Engiand et a tliousand million dollars worth
et tood and war materials, and lie added that
it would bie sent torward as a gitt wit.lout any
strings, the only consideration being that it
wo.uld lielp towards success ot the com-mun
cause.

reason te, believe that we can afford t-o have
a disagreement among thle English-speaking
races et the world. If ever there ws a time
in our history when our future peace and
security depended on the kind of unity that je
born of good will, it was in the dark days
of 1940, when we st-oed alone facing the meet
appalling danger that lied ever threatened us;
but new the danger that miglit develop in a
short peried of time je infinitely more powerful
t-ian anything t-bat Hitler ever had in hie

fact that additionai funds will be requîredat

Appropriation Bill passed last month covered
approximately two-twelfths of the estimated
war expenditures for the year, but that the

On the Order:
That the Standing Committee on Finance be

the estimates laid before Parliament, and by
resalutions relating to war -and other prposed
financial Ineasures of whieh notice lias been
given to Parliament, in advance of the Bis
based on the said estimates and resolutions

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, it had been my intention
to proceed with this motion taday, but a few
minutes ago I was advised of a. propnsed
amendment-I have not its exact phraseology
-the purpose, of which, I understand, is to
enlarge my motion so that all resolutions and
buis laid before the other House should, in
advance of their reaching this House, automatically go to our respective standing comnmittees for consideration conrurrently with
their consideration in the Commons.
I arn not prepared at the moment to express
any opinion as to, the desirability or otherwise
of the suggested amendment, but I may say
that the principle lias to a certain extent been
adopted in our practice of referring estimfttes
to our Finance Committee, and in respect ta
the report of the Interim Commission on Food

and Agriculture, which we referred ta our
Standing Committee on Agriculture and

ronsider the possible ramifications of a blanket
reference, and I would azsk that the motioni

BUSINESS 0F THE SENATE
INQUIItE

On the Orders of the Day:
Hion. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, before the Orders of the Day are cal.led,
would the Leader of the House give us some
idea of the legisiatian that is likely ta came
befare us? I sec the estimates are down taday. What are the prospects of adjournment?.
Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON: 1
am glad the leader opposite bas asked that
question, because it gives me an opportunity
ta acquaint the House with the exact circumstances, as far as I know them.
The imînediate business to which we, must
attend this week is the interim supply bill
and the measure with respect to the ratification of Canada's participation in the Food
and Agriculture Commission. As this Comnmission meets next week, it is diesirable that
C-anada, if Parliament sees fit, ratify ber
participation in it. TJ.he measure necessary
to arcomplish this will be before us perhapstomorrow, an~d already has received some
consideration in committee. It is expected
that there may be a completion of business,
including Royal Assent, tomorrow afternoon.
1 had, intended to state to honaurable
senators that when, we adjourn tomorrow
afternoon, or Friday, we will stand adjourned until October 29. 1 had sa intimated to some honourable senators, with the
qualification that circumstances beyond my
control miglit cause a change of plan. Such
a circuatance lias -arisen, inasmuch as it is
necessary and desirable that Parliament pas
a resolution concurring in the Charter of the
United Nations so that it can he signed and
ratified in London before the end of October.
As this resolutian bas not yet been considered
in the ather place, I must ask honiourable
senators ta consider an adjournment, until
Tuesday, October 23, at 8 o'clock in. the
evening..
Hon.' A. D. McRAE:
Hanourable senators, I amn not going ta abject ta the proposaI of the leader..
Hon. Mr. COPP: He lias nat made one
yet.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. McRAE: I would remind this
House that its weakness during the war period
was the all-too-frequent adjournments. During the war there was not a great deal to
be done; but now the war is over and the
country is faced with many problemas which
demand careful consideration. We have not
forgotten the very able address delivered by
my colleague, the honourable senator from
Vancouver-Burrard (Hon. Mr. MeGeer) last
evening, in which he set forth the responsibilities of this honourable House and the powers it
enjoys. I now want to go on record as being
opposed to frequent adjournments such as
we have had in the past. We owe a duty to
the people of this country, and I should like
to sec it discharged.
I want to compliment the honourable leader
on his progress so far. It has been most
encouraging. We must not lapse into a period
of silent sleep for anything like two weeks.
Too often in the past we have done this, and
have given the excuse that there was no business coming to us from ,the other House.
That day is past. The door of opportunity is
wide open for us to co-ordinate our efforts
with those of the House of Commons-to inquire into and investigate the many problems
with which Canada is now confronted. I am
sure that such a policy would be approved b'
the Government and appreciated by the couintry. I feel very deeply about these adjournments, and I hope the one now proposed will
not be regarded as a precedent. I should like
to see this House give continuous service
during the session. We have many things to
deal with. Let us continue to work.
INCOME AND EXCESS PROFITS
TAXATION
DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Campbell:
That a Special Comiittee of tc Senate be
appointed to examine into the provisions and
workings of the Income War Tax Art and
the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940, and to
formulate recommendations for the improvement, clarification and simplification of the
niethods of assessment and collection of taxes
thereunder and to report thereon;
(2) That the said Committee be composed of
the Honourable Senators Aseltine, Beauregard,
Bench, Buchanan. Campbell, Crerar, Euler,
Farris, Haig, Hayden, Hugessen, Lambert,
Leger, MeRae, Moraud, Robertson, Sinclair,
and Vien;
(3) That the said Committee shall have
authority to send for persons, papers and
records.
Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, in view of some speculation as to the attitude of the Government
Hon. Mr. COPP.

in connection with this motion, I wish to take
advantage of this opportunity to make a brief
statement. The Government looks favourably
on the motion of the honourable senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell) for the setting
up of a committee to study the provisions of
the Income War Tax Act. The necessity is
recognized for some revision of the administrative procedure of our income tax law. As
indicated in the Speech from the Throne, if
an agreement is reached with the Provinces
it "would make possible reorganization of the
Dominion tax structure on a simpler, more
equitable basis, conducive to expansion of
enterprise and employment."
I desire, however, to draw to the attention
of honourable senators the great pressure of
business which has faIlen on the shoulders of
the officials of the two departments concerned
with taxation, and would impress upon the
minds of honourable members of the proposed
committee the magnitude of work involved
in this connection and the necessity at the
present time of arranging their meetings so
as not unduly to interfere with the work of
departmental officials pending the conclusion
of the Dominion-Provincial Conference.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Leger, the debate
was adjourned.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY ADOPTED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the opening of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Robinson
for an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. W. D. EULER: Honourable senators,
while the Speech from the Throne is supposed
to forecast the legislation of the session, the
debate on the Address provides an opportunity for a general discussion by honourable
members of matters which they mîay consider
to be of public importance. I propose to avail
myself for a brief period of that privilege.
First of all, I associate myself with the
felicitations so eloquently and profusely showered upon His Honour the Speaker, the two
new leaders, and the mover (Hon. Mr.
Robinson) and the seconder (Hon. Mr.
Dupuis) of the Address. I should like also
to pay my compliments to honourable members who have preceded me in this debate.
I am net going to particularize. I have had
a fairly long parliamentary experience, stretching over some twenty-five years, and I should
say that for facility and felicity of expression,
for quality of matter discussed and for general

OCTOBER 10, 1945
excellence, the speeches so far delivered in this
debate need not take second place to any
that have been delivered elsewhere.
My remarks will be addressed very largely
to matters that have already been mentioned
in the debate. My geniàl friend the leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) spoke strongly in
favour of the single transferable vote. While
I quite appreciate that members of the other
Chamber, who are elected, might conceivably
think this matter was not the concern of a
non-elected body, I may say that since members of that Chamber have been known to
express themselves freely in favour of the
abolition of the Senate, perhaps we may be
allowed to return good for evil and to suggest to them some method whereby they
might properly prolong their own lives. I
agree with the suggestion made by my honourable friend, for I have long been in favour
of the single transferable vote. If it were an
experiment, there might be cause for hesitation; but it is not an experiment. It has
been applied successfully in the western provinces for a good many years. I would base
my support of the adoption of the single
transferable vote throughout this country on
the principle that each member of the House
of Commons-I have never been able to
understand why we have been more or less
prohibited frorn naming the other Chamber
-that each member of the House of Commons should represent the majority of the
electors who voted in his constituency. Under
our present system there can be no assurance
of that in any constituency where there are
three or more candidates. The method proposed by the honourable gentleman is to my
mind the only remedy for the present unsatisfactory condition.
I want to make a brief reference to a matter
which in the other House and perhaps in this
bas at times been the subject of some controversy, namely, the matter of divorce. I
happen-more or less unfortunately, if you
like-to be a member of the Divorce Committee, as is the honourable leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Haig). I understand that Prince
Edward Island has adopted the procedure of
hearing divorce applications in its courts.
Therefore, we now have only one province
whose courts are without jurisdiction to handle
divorce cases, the Province of Quebec. I hope
I shall not be giving offence to anyone in what
I am going to say. When the bill to grant
divorce jurisdiction to the Ontario courts was
before the Commons, I was a member of that
House, and I recall that one of the arguments
against the measure was that it would facilitate the granting of divorces and that cases
would become more numerous. Well, in this

85

session the Divorce Committee of the Senate
will have to deal with more than two hundred
applications, al. of them, with one exception,
from the Province of Quebec. So although
the other eight provinces have divorce jurisdiction, it is very much to be doubted whether
the ratio of increase in the number of cases
has been greater in those provinces than in
Quebec.
The argument that I want to present on this
matter is twofold. In the first place, I submit
that the matter of granting divorce should not,
for obvious reasons, be left to the Parliament
of Canada. I am not going to enlarge upon
that point, for I think it ought to be selfevident. Secondly, I submit that, as the
granting of divorce for a certain reason is in
accordance with the law of Canada, the residents of one sprovince who apply for divorce
are discriminated against in being compelled to
undergo -the expense and inconvenience of
coming to Ottawa, with their lawyers and
witnesses, when the residents of other provinces can make application direct to their local
courts.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: But you are not
against majority rule?
Hon. Mr. EULER: I arn and always have
been in favour of majority rule. I do not
see the application of my honourable friend's
remark.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: I do.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I should like to refer
particularly to certain observations made by
the honourable member from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen). He pleaded for Canadian
citizenship without any racial implications.
Perhaps I am not putting it very well, but I
take it he is in favour of our citizens calling
themselves and being regarded as Canadian,
without a hyphen.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I was personally interested in his statement because, while I was
born in Canada, my father came here from
another country-from Germany-before he
was three years of age. I am not, therefore
descended from either of the two dominant
races in this country. There has been an
improvement, in that in recent years racial
prejudices have become less and less evident,
but there is still room for improvement. I
can remember very well that during the first
war it became rather difficult and embarrassing at times for the descendants of persons of
enemy alien origin where all their neighbours
were of British origin. That condition has
disappeared almost entirely, and I can speak

80

SENATE

for my own community, the county of Waterloo, where the majority trace their descent
from what was lately an enemy alien race. If
you search the records of enlistment from that
part of the country, I am confident you will
find that they compare very favourably with
those of any other part of Canada. I think
we might well take a lesson from our friends
to the south. Whatever the reason, and I
believe it results from the teaching in their
schools, when a man from a foreign country
enters the United States, both he and his
children become out and out Americans, and
they are proud of their citizenship.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I question whether
Mayor LaGuardia regards himself as anything but an American, rather than an
Italian-American.
I doubt whether, let
us say, General Eisenhower or General
Eichelberger, Admiral Nimitz, or the new
Secretary of Labour, Mr. Schwellenbach,
regard themselves as anything but Americans.
That their fellow citizens so regard them is
evidenced by the fact that they have entrusted
those men with the most responsible duties.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I might go further. I
cannot think that Lord Mountbatten considers himself anything but an Englishman
because his name is merely the Anglicized
form of Battenberg.
Coming home, the
General who was selected to lead the
Canadian Army in the Pacific war undoubtedly
considers himself a Canadian-General Hoffmeister.
There can be no real national
consciousness until we think of ourselves as
Canadians without a hyphen.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. EULER: That is one of the
reasons why I congratulate the Government
on its intention to adopt a distinctive Canadian flag. I think that will help to promote
the desired condition of which I have spoken.
My next reference is to the eloquent speech
of the honourable senator from VancouverBurrard (Hon. Mr. MeGeer).
He dealt at
some length with the responsibilities and
activities--or perhaps one might say inactivities-of
the Senate of Canada.
He
reminded us that the powers of the Senate
are not well understood.
I believe be is
correct in stating that this Chamber is coequal with the Commons, except in one
respect: we cannot initiate legislation which
requires the expenditure of money. My honourable friends from Lincoln (Hon. Mr.
Bench) and from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck), and particularly the honourable
Hon. Mr. EULER.

member from Vancouver-Burrard reminded
us that the public is sornewhat critical of the
Senate for its inactivity. I think to some
extent this criticism is justified. It may be
true as the honourable member from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae) said a few, moments ago, that during the war there was, to
put it bluntly, very little for the Senate to
do. As much of the legislation from, the
other House involved the expenditure of
money for war services, naturally it was not
opposed in this Chamber, and there was not
a great deal for us to do.
But to my mind there are four principal
reasons for the inactivity of the Senate. First,
the limitations imposed upon the Senate by
the British North America Act.
I have
already referred to this. Second, the limitations which we have imposed upon ourselves.
We have gradually taken the mental attitude
that the Senate should never interfere with
anything coming from the House of Commons involving the expenditure of money. As
my honourable friend from Vancouver-Burrard pointed out last night, there is nothing
to prevent the Senate, if it so desires,
decreasing, we will say, an expenditure in a
bill that comes to us from the other place.
Hon.
that.

Mr. MeGEER:

They

have

donc

Hon. Mr. EULER: Yes, they have done
that. My honourable friend could have given
other instances where the Senate did a very
good job. When Sir Wil'frid Laurier was in
power his Government proposed to build a
railway through to the Yukon. The Senate
in rejecting the bill showed a degree of wisdom which was not appreciated until some
years later. The third reason for the inactivity of the Senate is that its members are
not elected, and, consciously or unconsciously,
feel that they have not quite as much authority
as is enjoyed by members of the other House.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. EULER: The fourth and last
reason, which I advance with considerable
hesitancy and which perhaps will subject me
to criticism from some members, is that
because we are appointed for life, we may,
subconsciously, feel our responsibilities less
keenly than we should, since we know that
we need never subject ourselves to the
electorate.
I wonder if I have offended in saying that.
I believe that if we search our consciences
we will find, apart from the fact perhaps that
we are getting a little older and less active,
that because we are not subject to the

OCTOBER 10, 194581
approval or disapproval of the electors we are
prone to be a little less diligent in some matters than we otherwise would be. Of course
I arn not at the moment arguing that we
should have an elected Senate-4 thought one
of the speakers yesterday was going to suggest
that; te my surprise he took'the opposite view
-but I would point out this anomaly. In
almost every instance when there is a change
of gevernment, -the new government, fresh
from the ýpeople, finds itself faced by a
theoretically hostile Senate. For example,
after the electiens of 1935, when a Liberal
government was returned te power, the Senate
consisted of 32 Liberals and 64 Conservatives.
If those 64 Conservatives had desired te act
in a partisan way tihey could have defeated.
the will of the people of Canada as expressed
by their elected representatives in the House
of Cemmons. If, -after the last election, the
Progressive Censervatives or the 'C.C.F. had
been a majority in the Blouse of Commons, the
situation would have been reversed. After
the eleotion which is te ceme three, four or
five years from now, it is probable that the
disparity will be still greater.
That situation is undemnocratic. However,
it is to the credit of the Senate of Canada
that its members have seldom availed themselves of their power te exercise a partisan
spirit. May I say te the credît of nine of my
fellow Liberals, and of myself, that the very
first vote we cast in this Chaînher was against
a Govemnment bill. The bill proposed te apply
the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act te
the Province of Manitoba. We proposed in
amend.ment t1hat, decisions should be subjeet
te appeal. When that amendment was rejected
by the other Blouse, the Senate refused te
withdraw it, the resuit being that the bill died
a natural death. My memory is that the
measure came back te us the next year, with
our amendment incorporated, and we passed it.
Seme Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
-Hon. Mr. EULER: This indîcates that while
the Senate has the power te, nullify legîslatien from the Blouse of Commons if it so
desires, it nevertheless considers questions on
their menit and votes accordingly, and this is
as it should be.
I believe the maximum service which the
Senate can render lies wîthin the boundaries
suggestecl by my honourable friend fromn St.
Catharines (Hon. Mr. Bench), my honourable
friencl fromn Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell),
and the suggestions macle last night by the
senator frorn Vancouver-Burrard (Hon. Mr.
McGeer). Great service could be rendered
te the people of Canada by the members of the Senate, with their vast legislative
47704-8

experience, if they macle inquiry, 4xamination and investigation into public matters. If
the Government believed that Senate committees were to be appointed with thae sole
purpose of rendering service, and not to
embarrass the Government, such committees
could do a more practical job than any commission and be of greater benefit to the people
of Canada. It is necessary, however, that
members of the Senate continue to exercise
their powers in a non-partisan way.
I now turm to two matters of international
concemn. One, which has already been referred
to by the leader is the San Francisco Conference. A brilliant writer of a columan in the
Toronto Globe and Mail rather severely
described it as the San-Fiasco Conference,
but I have no hesitation in saying the sentiments expressed at that conference, and some
of the actions taken there, were of tremendous
value. Like the League cf Nations, the
United Nations organization was formed for
the purpose of maintaining the peace of the
world. It was my honour te be delegated te
the League in 1929, and it is my belief that
the League failed for two principal reasons.
The flrst was the abstention of the; United
States frorn membership, even though its
President was the father of the League; the
second, that it had no real power to enforce
its decreeýs. Nothing could be clone in the
way of restraining an aggressor nation unless
there was unanimous action and consent. This
last mientîoned defect exists in the charter of
the United Nations drawn up at San Francisco. Any one of the five big nations who
are permanent members of the Security
Council-Great Britain, Russia, United States,
China and France-can restrain the league
from taking action against an aggressor. While
the league has authority to caîl upon its memherg, including Canada, for certain military
contributions, if any one of those five nations
says ne, the organization can take no action.
Hon. Mr. FARiRIS: Which one of the five?
Hon.,Mr. EULER: Any one of them. No
great wars have ever occurred in which. some
great nation was net participating. We are
quite sure the United States would net be the
aggressor, or Great Britain; and we hope none
of the others. If any one of the great nations
became an aggressor-and 1 exelude China and
France because at the moment they are not
great-naturally t1hat nation would net vote
against herseli; and since the resolution to
restrain the aggressor nation must be unanimous, ne action could be taken. And the veto
is still mere far-reaching. For example, if
Bulgaria attacked Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia
or Greece, and the Union of Socialist Soviet

NEVIBK XUOTION

88

SENATE

Republics or any other of the Big Five voted
against the league taking action to restrain the
aggressor, nothing could be done. I cannot
see how that security clause can be of any
great benefit to the smaller nations or the
peace of the world. One can see by the trend
of events in Europe today that the people
of the smaller countries may very well come
to the conclusion that they have exchanged
one dictator for another.
The second matter of international concern
arises out of the Atlantic Charter. The charter
was conceived with the highest motives and
embodied the finest sentiments and principles
for the benefit of the human race that could be
conceived. It was framed, as we all know, by
the late Franklin D. Roosevelt, then President
of the United States, and Mr. Churchill, then
Prime Minister of Great Britain. Honourable
members should remember that the charter
was acceded to by the Union of Socialist
Soviet Republics. One important declaration
contained in the charter, among many other
admirable ones, was that the nations who
were signatory to it had no intention of acquiring further territories without the consent of
the people of those territories. But what has
happened? We know that the three little
republics in Central Europe have been
absorbed, and that nearly halif of Poland has
been taken despite the bitterest opposition of
the Poles. While I am reluctant to say it,
this action was agreed to by Mr. Churchill
and Mr. Roosevelt, and is in direct violation
of the principles laid down in the Atlantic
Charter. The only answer is that there was
nothing else to do but accept the situation.
Certainly the re-partition of Poland was
wrong, because the people of Poland were
bitterly opposed to being divided again. It
is not very convincing to say that in order to
bring about ultimate good and to avoid a
greater misfortune, it is sometimes necessary
to do a wrong.
The principle is pitifully
unsound.
I visited Moscow and Leningrad in 1936,
and was greatly impressed by what I saw. In
Moscow the whole city was being rebuilt;
the people were very busy, men and women
working together. The city had a library
which was said to house 12,000,000 volumes.
Fine apartment bouses and factories were
under construction. The foundation had been
laid for the Palace of the Soviets, which was
supposed to be higher than the Empire State
Building in New York City. I had a talk with
the British Minister there, and asked him
whether he thought the Russians were going
to make a success of it. He thought they
would; and as we now know, they did.
Hon. Mr. EULER.

After that I visited Berlin, and as some of
you may know, I had the doubtful honour
of an interview with Herr Hitler himself. I
mention it because in 1936, as Minister of
Trade and Commerce, I was there for the
purpose of making a trade agreement. Hitler
invited me to his offices, and I had a halfhôur talk with him. One of the outstanding
statements he made was his claim to have
saved Europe from communism.
I believe
there is a certain amount of truth in that
claim, for communisn was making progress,
in Germany.
I believe the greatest potential threat facing the world to-day is that Germany, which
once was turning communist, may turn in
that direction again. If she ever does, and
joins hands with the present great communistie
nation of Europe, the great organizing ability
of the Germans, together with the great
resources and population of Russia will result
in a combination of power stretching from the
Pacifie Ocean nearly to the English Channel
and the Mediterranean.
Now, I am not saying, and I do net wish
te be understood or reported as saying that
there necessarily are sinister intentions on the
part of that great country which did such a
wonderful job during the war in helping to
defeat our enemies; but I fear that after the
United States retires from the continent of
Europe, as in due course she will, the situation
of the other western nations on the continent
will net bo a very desirable one. I do not
know whether the danger is real, but I think
it is potential, for after all we should remember that the ideologies of the western democracies and the Soviets are poles apart. And
while we should be grateful for the: assistance
we got from Russia, we should bear in mind
she was fighting, not for Britain or the United
States, but for herself. It scems to me that
no one can blame her now for carrying out
her aims in the way that she considers to be
in ber own interest. It may be that these
observations are injudicious but they express
the thoughts that are going through the minds
of the people, and dangers that are known
can be more readily coped with than if
suppressed.
In returning to domestie affairs, I desire to
diseuss, first, one or two things said by the
honourable gentleman from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck). He dealt largely with
labour matters, and I enjoyed his speech. I
entirely agree with him that in the event of
a slackening in employment it would be
wrong for the employers of this country to
use the needs of the working men to reduce
wages below the level necessary to maintain
a decent standard of living. In fact, I will
go so far as to say, as I have said before,

OCTOBER 10, 1945
that I believe the industrial workers and
farmers of this and other countries have not
for many years received the full reward of
their toil. But I do not believe that the
great majority of employers have any such
intention. I believe in unions and in their
right to protect themselves, though I sometimes think there is a danger that the possession of power may lead to its abuse.
What particularly interested me in my bonourable friend's remarks was his statement
that high wages do not necessarily mean
higher cost of production. I think that is
true.
It does not necessarily follow that
high wages never increase costs of production;
and they may do so. The bhonourable gentleman might have cited the example of Henry
Ford, who a few years ago created a sensation
throughout the industrial world by declaring
that no man in his plant would receive less
than five dollars a day, which was more than
his competitors paid. Yet his business became an outstanding success.
If there is
sincere co-operation between labour and employers, and continued improvement in machines, it is quite possible that high wages
will result in lower costs of production, though
not necessarily so.
There was one argument which my honourable friend perhaps did not follow through.
As he says, capital must secure a profit if it
is to continue in operation. That is selfevident. But if production costs go up-and
labour is now asking for a thirty per cent
wage increase, the fairness or unfairness of
which I am not now considering-and if the
Government maintains ceiling prices, how is
the employer going to make a profit? The
answer may be, as it bas been during the war
years, that the man who because of having
to sell at a certain fixed price cannot produce
at a profit will be given a bonus or subsidy.
That system bas been pretty well fastened
upon the country; it was in use even before
the war. I am not going to debate the propriety of setting a fixed price, which was really
in the nature of a bonus, for the wheat farmers of the west. During the war we gave
bonuses to agricultural producers and manufacturers of various things needed for war
purposes.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: And to the banks.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I remember reading that
a large textile concern received something
more than a million dollars by way of subsidy. I do not think the subsidy is good, in
principle. Indeed, I should think that if it
were followed to its logical conclusion it would
lead us faster than ever in the direction of
socialism. Nor do I believe that a reasonable
rise in prices would necessarily be disastrous.
47704-8i

89

It bas been going on for fifty years and more..
My honourable friend seemed to make light
of foreign trade. Perhaps I am wrong in that,
but that is the impression I got. Well, I
think that foreign trade is of great importance. In the old duys before the war, as I
recall, about fifteen per cent of our production
was exported.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Thirty per cent.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Twenty-two per cent.
Hon. Mr. EULER: It happens that I was
Minister of Trade and Commerce some years
ago and I used to be pretty familiar with the
figures. Let us say twenty per cent. That
may seem a small percentage, yet it might
mean all the difference between prosperity
and depression. A country like Canada, which
produces a surplus of lumber, wheat, minerals,
fish and so on, bas to find a market for these
products or depression will be on the doorstep.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Let us get more people
in Canada.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: If the honourable
member will allow me, I should like to correct his impression as to what I said about
foreign trade. I said that if it were true that
foreign trade would result in reducing our
standard of living, then we had better not
have foreign trade; but I said that was not
truc.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I thank my honourable
friend, and I apologize. I understand now
that he considers foreign trade to be as
important as some of the rest of us do.
The honourable gentleman suggested there
were three things that must be done if business was to be maintained on a profitable
basis. In the first place, be said that the
cost of government must be reduced. That
would be a step in the right direction, but I
fear that it would give very little relief from
the present burden on industry and on the
taxpayer. His second suggestion was that we
should have more immigration. That is all
right, too. I agree with him when he says
that twelve million people have not the right
to arrogate to themselves full control over a
country so large as this, when thousands and
perhaps millions of people in other countries
are in need. His third suggestion was that
taxes should be lowered. Everybody agrees
with that. I think that in all fairness the
Government must repeal the excess profits tax
at least, because so long as that tax is in
force there is no inducement for the investment of capital. If capital is invested in a
going business and a profit is made, most of
the profit is taken up in the excess profits tax.

90

SENATE

the -corporation tax and individual income
taxes. The excess profits tax was a wartime
measure, and it is the duty of the Governmentment to remove it now that the war is
over. The only ·way that a man with a little
money can make a profit nowadays is to
invest it, not in any business of producing or
manufacturing goods, but in something that
he thinks may increase in capital value. After
he makes his investment he does nothing
about it but wait for the unearned increment,
and takes a profit which is not taxable. That
is not a healthy condition. At the same time
I appreciate the difficult position of a government which even in normal times will
have a budget of little less than two billion
dollars-four times our pre-war expenditures
-and
an ultimate national debt of nearly
twenty billions.
What I have said may sound like the talk
of an alarmist and pessimist, which I am not.
I do net for one moment think that the people of this country should or will yield to fear
and hopelessness. I wonder whether I might
take a minute or so to tell a story?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Stories are not popular
in Parliamentary debate and I do net think
they should be; but I liked the story told by
my honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) about the robber barons
on the Rhine, and it was well received. What
I have in mind is an 'allegory illustrating the
fear which is pcrmeating this country. The
story is one of the Far East, where the disease
known as the plague from time to time takes
its toll of thousands and hundreds of thousands
of people. As a traveller stood upon an eminence outside a city looking down into the
crowded streets, he was joined by the Spirit
of the Plague, who said to him, "I am going
to take the lives of five thousand people in
this city." The traveller passed on, and in the
course of his journey he heard that fifty
thousand people in that city had died of the
plague. Some time later he again met the
Spirit of the Plague, to whom he said, "You
told me you were going to take five thousand
lives in that certain city, but you took fifty
thousand." "No," said the Spirit of the Plague.
I took only five thousand; the other fortyfive thousand died of fear."
There is in that a lesson for us. Fear is
the mother of failure, and if we yield to it
there is not much hope for us. Our difficulties are truly formidable, and they will continue to be so for some time; but if we
grapple with them courageously, co-operate
with one another-especially if labour and
capital co-operate as they should-and if we
Hon. Mr. EULER.

make the best of our resources, human as well
as material, Canada can win through to the
prosperity to which her people are entitled.
Hon. TELESPHORE D. BOUCHARD:
Honourable senators, in rising to take part in
the debate on the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne, I wish to offer to
His Honour the Speaker my personal congratulations and those of the citizens of the
electoral division of Laurentides, which I am
privileged to represent in the Senate. I also
wish to offer the same congratulations to alI
those who enjoyed the confidence of the
Government of the day or of their political
party and, having been granted posts higher
than they held when the last Parliament
ended, have now a better opportunity of
serving their country in this upper Chamber.
In order that my remarks may be kept as
brief as possible, I will refrain from congratulating individually those who have been
promoted to leadership in the Senate and
those who have recently become members of
this House. Colleagues better qualified than
I am have already expressed appropriate eulogies. I concur in what they said, and am convinced that our honourable friends to whom
tribute has been paid will in their new spheres
render service of which Canada will be proud.
In this Twentieth Parliament there are
new and interesting personalities. Many prominent veterans were returned to the House
of Commons, but unhappily others who
night well have continued in public life
have fallen in the electoral battle. The defeat
of several men of merit, whatever their party
affiliations, may be attributed to our faulty
eloctoral system. As the honourable leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) stated, reform is
needed in order to ensure that each successful candidate really represents the majority
of his constituents. The problem, which the
honourable gentleman so ably presented to
us deserves careful study, and it is to be
hoped that before the next general election
the Government will solve it in a practical
way.
Whatever the merits or defects of our
present electoral system, I am happy that the
Government vas returned to power under the
same leader who directed its policies in the
difficul-t days of war. Canada, with its two
cultures and its varied local interests, is a
difficult country to govern. The result of the
election in Great Britain was a great surprise
to the world.
Notwithstanding his defeat,
Winston Churchill will remain one of the
most striking figures in the history of the
democratic world. He has, I believe, more
admirers in his country than has any other

OCTOBER 10, 1945
statesman or politician. Mr. Mackenzie King,
the leader of the Cana-dian nation was more
fortunate, for hie enjoys flot only the esteem
but the confidence of the people.
The appalling destruction of wealth accumulated by nations through centuries of
toil, the slaughter of huinan lives and the
inferno of suffering brought about by the
struggle between two great ideologies, demoaracy and absolutism, have so disturbed the
souls of men that the question is being asked,
whether we should flot com.pleteiy revise our
economic and political systemn-a systen, it
must be granted, under which great progress
bas beenl made during the past century. Owing
to the improvement in the weapons of war,
we are! faced with the urgent necessity of
devising a formula to remove causes, direct
and indirect, which le-ad to the setting of one
section of humanity ýagainst another. History
shows that these causes are many. It shows
nasa that plans to rernove themn are numeraus.
These plane vary from sage to insane, from
practical to impractical.
Men with the
mentality of those respansible f or the RomeBerlin-Tokyo Axis now suggest that we
revert to the form. of a mystical and totalitarian gavernment; oth-ers, ranging from the
extremes of right and left, propose a, revolutionary f orm of Comýmunism, or Trotskyism.
Even Soviet Russia rejected this brand of
Cornmunism. Where shall we find the, solution? In the happy medium, the old Meden
Agan of Pindarus? Very likely. But the
masses are asking for something -new, and
their political tbinking shows no leaning
towards the right.
The Conservative party, which at one time
was a power among us, and stili bopes to,
again become dominant, is no longer able to
elect any candidates in Quebec. The LiberalConservative party was overwhelmed. by the
Castors of o-ur ultramontane, sohool. The
party was victorious in Quebec when it had
leaders like Sir Georges-Etienne* Cartier and
Chaplesu, men of broad view and true Canadian feeling; but now the party has become
the Union Nationale. This is the name of
the party of Oliveiro, Salazar, the dîctator of
Portugal. The Union Nationale of Quebec
is inspired hy the samne principles that anîmate
its prototype of the Iberian Peninsula. Inherent in the programmes of these two, parties
are the saine weaknesses, but the Quebec
leader completely lacks Salazar's prudence in
financial administration. This quality alone
ba's maintained the Portuguese dictator in
power, and to it must be attributed his great
popularity. Conversely, the lack of this quaIity in the Quebec leader bas witbin three
short years ruined the credit of the province

91

and resulted in his sudden downf ail. In
the recent provincial election be came ta the
surface again tbraugh the help af the Conservatîve party, but he has refused ta supporib
it openly in the Federal field. It is fair tao
say, however, that theProgressive Conservative party and. the Union Nationale are not
working hand in hand. Tbe slogan of the&
Union Nationale seems ta be: No true Canadian need apply.
It seems obviaus that in a quest for liberty
in ail its forms, however extreme they may
be, political minds are leaning towards the
left. Salazar himself, soan ta be in the throes
of a general election, has recently announced
that hie will re-establisb aîl essential liberties,
Mr. John Bracken, who once said at my home
that hie was my friendly political enen1y, lias,
stretched the namne of his party ta, suit the
present political tendencies of the masses, and
today my "friendly political enemy" leads the
Progressive-Conservative party.
Wbat happened to him in the recent general
election is similar to wbat happened ta
Winston Churchill, and perhaps for the samne
reamous. It cannat be said that Churchill às the
champion of the big financial interests; rather,
he is known as a statesman ever read.y ta
serve tbe common man. The British electorate
did not rejeet Churcbill the statesmnan, but
Churchill the leader of a political party known
ta he against economic reforms. Mr. Bracken
had nat been long enough at the be-ad of bis
party ta be able to offer, as Mr. Mackenzie
King did, a guarantee ta bring the war ta a,
victariaus conclusion and, in the perîod of
reconstruction, ta introduce legislatian for theý
purpase of furthering the best interests of theý
people af Canada.
The task ta be undertaken is no easy one.In order ta bring about a solution of the problems of peace there must be co-operation
among men af good will, and notahly among
the main political groupa tbat have co-operated
so freely in the war effort. There are measures
of national security on wbich these leaders will
bave ta agree. 'Canadian unity must be safeguarded; aur system af free competition must
be preserved; a reasonable standard ai living
mu6t be assured ta aur agricultural and industrial workers; provincial autonomy must be
safeguarded, but at the saine time certain
essential powers must be granted ta the
central gaverument in order that it may nat,
become a mere tax-collecting agency for the
benefit of provincial administrations, alwayprepared ta spend. Finally, the rights of
minorities as well, as af mai orities must berespected.

SENATE

I maintain that all men of good will should
come to an understanding with a view of
preserving and strengthening Canadian unity.
We have enjoyed political unity since Confederation, a period of more than threequarters of a century. In spite of the critical
tone which pervaded some parts of the eloquent speech of my colleague and friend, the
honourable senator from Vancouver-Burrard
(Hon. Mr. McGeer), I feel this political unity
has produced good results. In order to realize
the importance and value of this political
unity, one has only to consider what would
have happened during the war if our country
had been divided into two independent states.
I am not here to defend those who might have
done their national duty more efficiently. But
who will pretend that Canada could have done
more than she did towards assuring victory
to the allied nations? It must be admitted
that in directing the war effort those in
charge of national affairs met with obstacles
that should not have been placed in their
way. They surmounted those obstacles in a
fashion that has not been readily acknowledged as the best by everybody. Could it have
been otherwise in a country like ours, where
British liberty has allowed various racial
groups to shape their own particular mentalitics according to their own national aspirations? The result is. as in my province, that
.a small and noisy group may make it appear
that they represent the majority. The loyalty
of Canadians of French origin was amply
established during the last election. If the
separatists succeeded in undermining the war
effort, they failed to disturb the loyalty of
the masses to our political institutions.
We are well aware that in a country as
large as ours there are various economic
interests. Beause of geographical situation

strengthen national unity, must be on a
generous and impartial basis. The new Parliament must find among its members men
strong enough to combat those who would
substitute for our system of free enterprise
a form of revolutionary socialism or fascist
corporatism, the second of which, in the
province of Quebec, is offered as a panacea for
various ills and a means of improving the
standard of living of the middle classes. A
campaign, the object of which is to revive the
corporative system which was destroyed in
1789 by the French Revolution, is being
carried on openly by persons in high positions,
and its adversaries dare not publicly denounce
it. Before corporatism becomes a religious
dogma which cannot be discussed in my provHon. Mr. BOUCHARD.

ince-unless somebody objects in time to protect the freedom of labour and individual
enterprise, I feel it my duty to point out the
attempts that are being made to introduce
this sort of economic fascisrm in the province
of Quebec. I have already mentioned the
similarity between the Union National regime
in Quebec and that of Salazar, which favoured
the establishment of corporatism among the
Portuguese.
While I may be blamed for speaking as I
have done on what may appear to be a purely
provincial question, I am now trying to show
that it has a direct connection with federal
politics. It is admitted, of course, that labour,
financial and industrial problems are matters
of federal jurisdiction. We all know that it
would be absurd to allow our industries in
Quebec to become subservient to a corporative
regime, while those of other provinces are
left to free enterprise. The strongest partisans
of corporatism have publicly declared thenselves willing to make of the province of
Quebec a Catholic and French state. An
anomaly would exist if our province were
under an industrial regime different from that
in other provinces. Corporatism is another
way of preaching disunity in Canada. The
other provinces will never accept Catholic
labour unions, which are the greatest promuoters of corporatism, neither would they
adopt labour-employing corporations dominated by the unions. The obvious result
would be the disruption of Confederation.
As far as socialist activities are concerned,
they are not quite as dangerous and are less
to be feared than corporatism.
The Government, supported by those who
place the interest of the country before that
of party, should meet attacks on our economic
system by a strict control of abuses which
have prevailed in the past. Otherwise these
abuses may recur when wartime restrictions
are abolished, and allow profiteers in the commercial, finanèial and industrial fields to
accumulate excessive profits by depriving the
workers of a standard of living which enables
them to maintain their human dignity and to
properly feed and clothe their families. I
believe that as soon as possible, we should
remove the restrictions imposed by war upon
private enterprise; but the excess of liberty
which gave birth to abuses in the past should
not be re-established. The freedom to exploit
one's neighbour never really existed, because
no one is moralily free to compel a worker
to starve by accepting a salary unworthy of
a human being. It is the Government's duty
to control the law of supply and demand;
and if, in this century of progress, control
over certain industries is not sufficient to per-

OCTOBER 10, 1945
mit a fair standard of living, state competition should be instituted. Great evils require
great remedies.
We hear a good deal about provincial
autonomy, especially from those who desire
to break up the Confederation pact. It is
well that our provinces exercise freely all the
rights guaranteed by the constitution; but
requests for autonomy should not be allowed
ta become simply caîls for dissension and sedition. I will gladly support any constitutional
amendment which will improve the living
conditions of the citizens of Quebec and the
other provinces, even if such amendment
infringes upon provincial rights. I do not
see anything wrong in strengthening the
powers of the central government if to do so
would benefit the citizens of Canada.
Under the British North America Act, the
rights of minorities must be respected. No
one wants to restrict them, but many persons
wish to utilize them in ýorder to maintain and
increasc a spirit of disunity between the races.
This is one of the means employed to isolate
us, one from the other. T-hese illusive rights
and ugly conflicts which bring such harm upon
our race may benefit a small group of professional or born politicians, but I ar n ot one
of them. I do flot believe that Canadians of
French descent are being victimized. I believe
they have enough abilýity, energy and honesty
to attain first rank in any econornic or social
sphere without assuming an attitude o-f
martyrdom. There are m.any thousands of
instances that prove the trutb of this
assertion.
Those who are continually making demands
seem to forget that if minorities have rights,
majorities also have rights. These rigbts,
which are well established, should be respectedi.
It is unfair, simply 'because requests are macle
in the name of minorities, to condemn the
majority for rejecting them.
In conclusion, honourable senators, we are
inaugurating a new Parliament under the
*wings of Victory-victory dearly won. Let
us hope that the sacrifices of our glorious
dead, of our wounded and all those who during the six long years of war have served
with the allied forces may not have been in
vain; and let us hope that aur country, together with our democratic allies who joined
us in saving civilization, will be successful in
establishing throughout. the world the peace
on earth which was promised to men of good
wilI.

submitted to us.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:

Hear, hear.

Hon. GERALD G. McGEER: Honourable
senators, I want to give notice of an amendment to the present motion. My proposed
amendment reads as follows:
That the said motion be amended by striking
out all the words after "that" in the first line
thereof, and substituting therefor the following:
"any Standing or Special Committee of the
Senate be authorized to examine any resolution
or proposed Bill laid before Parliament in
advance of the resolution or Bill reaching the
Senate."
May I say in explanation of this amendment that I discussed it with the leader of the
Government in this House (Hon. Mr. Robertson) and then wrote him the following letter:
My dear Senator Robertson:
Please find enclosed copy of an amendment
which I suggest should be made to your motion
of last evening. J tave conferred with the
Clerk of the Senate and with the Law Clerk.
and I am advised that there is no rule of Senate
procedure or other reason why this amendment
could not be passed. This amendment would
include all that is contained in your resolution

and would also include all other legislation. You
will notice it is not mandatory, but permissive.
If this resolution were passed and acted upon
the Senate could have before it, through the
medium of the appropriate committee, or through
a committee to be specially appointed. or
through the Senate as a Connitte of the Whole,
any legislation under consideration by the
Commons. It would completely eliminate any
justification for the complaint that the Senate
did not have ample opportunity to examine and
revise legislation because it did not receive it

in sufficient time.
Getting legislation from the Commons in
time to give it proper consideration is something with respect to which the Senate is not
dependent upon the action of the other House.
The moment a bill is introduced in the House
of Commons, whether it be by the Government or by a private member, that bill is
public property. The press tas possession of
it, and any individual, whether a member of
the Senate or a private citizen, can secure a
copy. The principle involved in bringing legislation before the Senate is exactly the same
as the principle adopted by the Senate when,
in 1942, it decided to deal with budget resolutioxns at the same time the other House was
dealing with them.
The charge that the Government and the
House of Commons are to blame because
the Senate has not had sufficient time to
consider legislation from the other House
is entirely unfounded. If anybody is to blame
it is the Senate itself.
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

Hon. Mr. HAIG:
Mr. Speaker, may I
raise a point of order?

Hon. Mr. McGEER: Then, with the consent of the House, I will move the amendment and speak on it.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: You do not need consent
to make a motion. I do not mean to stop
the honourable gentleman. A motion has
been made by the honourable the leader
(Hon. Mr. Robertson), seconded, and put to
the House by His Honour the Speaker.
According to our practice-my honourable
friend will pardon me for mentioning what

to move an amendment and speak on it as

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
I migtt say
that what I received from the honourable
gentleman from Vancouver-Burrard
(Hon.
Mr. McGeer) was an amendment, not a
notice of motion. I think the honourable
senator used the words "notice of motion" by
a slip of the tongue and not intentionally.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: As I say te can move
his amendment now.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: Then I would move:
That the said motion be amended by striking

I
present practice of dealing with the Budget
makes it possible for the Senate to give as
much time as the Commons gives to the consideration of Budget proposals. The other day
I walked into the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry and found Government
officials explaining to the Committee the details of a bill having the widest ramifications in
the international food situation. I inquired if
this bill had been presented to the Senate, and
was informed that it had been introduced into
the House of Commons but not as yet into the
Senate. Nevertheless, the Senate committee

OCTOBER 11, 1945
had taken possession of the measure and was
conducting a full investigation into it. In
doing this the committea was rnerely exercising powers which every comrnittee of the
Senate eni oys. Once a bill is introduced in
the Commons, why should it net be taken
under review by this bouse, which has the
responsihility of giving or refusing it final
sanction?
According te my conception of the purposo,
powers and responsibilities of the Senate, we
are not beholden, te the Commons; we are
independent of the Gommons. W'hatover the
rules of procedure rnay say, certainly the rules
of obligation, if they were ever de<fined, would
recognizo that the first responsibility of evory
momber of this bouse is to the territory that
he represents. Surely the first obligation of
the twenty-four representatives of the Maritime Provinces is to proteot the rights of that
territory. There is a sirnilar obligation on the
members froni Quehec, from Ontario, and
from western Canada to their respective territories. But the Senate, as one branch of
Parliarnent working in co-oporation with another, bas the primary obligation and duty of
informing itself upon the whole field of legislation under considoration by Parliament. In
discussing the matter with the Cierk of the
Senate and the Law Clerk, I put this plain
question: When a bill is introduced in the
House of Commons, where is the con.stitutional or Gommons or Senate rule that prevents the Sonate from taking the moasure
immcdiatoly under review?
bon. Mr. LEGER: Will the honourable
gentleman allow me? We could easily do what
ho suggests if the measure before the Cernmons were introduced in the Senate as a
Sonate bill. We cortainly should have ne
jurisdiction over a bihl until it cornes before us.
bon. Mr. MeGEER: 1 agree that my
honourable friend is technically right. But
every bill must sooner or later be introduced
in the Senate be-fore it can become law. The
present practice as te a ýGovernment bill, as
I understand it, is te wait until the bull is
passed by the Cemmons and then te have it
introducod here by the Gevernment, leader in
the Senate. New, why net deal with it earlier
by introducing it, if you like, and referring it
te the appropriate comnmittee for consideratien?
bon. Mr. COPP: îhe Commons rnight net
pass iL.

bon. Mr. McGEER: Il the henourable
gentleman will wait till 1 complete my observation., I shahl be iglad te answer any questions.

As I understand it, in Washington bills are

95

introduced in the Senate and the lieuse of
Representatives concurrently, and referred to
appropriate committees. Then coxnmittees of
management are set up, and after bis have
been. considered by each Huse the committees confer and adjust any differences.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is flot quite correct.
The bis introduced in the two bouses are
flot the same.
bon. Mr. McGEER: Not necessarily. But
the two buses do try to get together, even
when their respective bis dealing with a
subject are entirely different in detail and
principle. Bef ore a bill can become law it
must bc passed by both bouses, just as here.
Let me give an illustration to show what
I mean. The Old Age Pensions Bill came
before this bouse after having been passed
by the Commons. This bouse made a number
of amendments, only one of which. was acceptable to the Commons. Then there were conferences, which ended in a deadlock. I venture
to suggest that if the procedure I am proposing had been followed, there would have
been no d'eadlock on that occasion, because
through the interchange of views both bouses
would have coma to an agreement.
The matter I arn discussing is one of long
standing. On the 7th of May, 1868, a select
commnittee of the Sonate presonted a report
in which this was said:
The Committec would furtber renîark that
the Constitution, in .establishing an Upper
flouse cf Parliament composed of if e members,
contemplates on the part of that branch a
supervision, undisturbed by temporary political
currents and partisan warf are, cf the logislation of the day. It is impossible, the Committee believe, that the Senlate shahl adeqoately
fill its place in the Constitution and discharge
those funetions upen which its usefulness to
the country se much depends, unless ample
opportunity is given for the discussion in that
lieuse of ahl measures submitted for its
consideration.
And here is what was proposed as a remedy:
In thé absence cf any other remedy, it might
become necessary to secure this, even by the
extreme measure of declining te consider bills,
with certain exceptions, brougbt up from' the
Gommons within a fixed period of the end of à

session.
Fromn what is the
bon. Mr. LEGER:
honourable gentleman reading?
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: I arn reading from a
report that was quoted in a speech by the late
Senater Charles Murphy on the work of the
Senate. I arn unable te give the exact reference, but 1 suppose ne member of this House
is unfailiar with that speech.
Once a bill is intreduced inte the bouse
ef Commons there is nothing to, stop me, as
a senator, from examining it before it is intro-

96

SENATE

duced in the Senate; and there is nothing to
stop me from gathering together a group of
senators to discuss the bill and determine what
action we are going to take upon it when it
cornes before the Senate. The idea that the
Senate has not the power to consider legislation immediately it is introduced in the Commons, but that it has to wait for action by the
Commons and the Government of the day, is
entirely wrong.
Honourable senators, I have made this proposal in order to suggest a means by which
we, as members of the Senate of Canada, by
the exercise of our own powers of initiative,
can properly fulfil our full constitutional responsibilities with regard to legislation introduced in the House of Commons.
Hon. J. J. DONNELLY: Honourable senators, to some extent I agree with what has
been said by the honourable senator from
Vancouver-Burrard (Hon. Mr. McGeer). The
control of the Senate is vested entirely in the
Senate. The honourable gentleman asks what
objection there is to consideration by the
Senate of any bill as soon as it is introduced
in the other House. An objection that occurs
to me is this. Many bills after their introduction into the Commons are amended, and some
of them are almost entirely changed before
they are given third reading and sent over to
us. It seems to me that we could not deal
intelligently with a House of Commons bill
until we knew in just what form it would be
when finally approved by that House.
The honourable gentleman referred to a
meeting of the Committee on Agriculture and
Forestry the other day. What the committee
was dealing with then was the first report of
the Interim Commission on Food and Agriculture. The report had been referred to the
committee for consideration; and we asked
Government officials to appear at the meeting
in order to make available any information
that they had. Before we adjourned we decided not to present any report to the Senate
until the bil. itself was referred to the committee in the regular way.
Hon. Mr. McGEER:
May I be allowed
to reply to the first point made by the
honourable gentleman?
Once an amendment was proposed to any bill before the
House of Commons, regardless of the stage
which the bill had reached-whether second
reading, committee, or third reading-the
amendment could be brought before the
Senate Committee considering the bill. There
is no reason in the world why committees
of both Houses, concurrently considering a
bill, should not be in communication with
each other. The fact is that if we are going
Hon. Mr. McGEER

to work in co-operation with the Commons,
we should be exchanging views. Look at
what happens under the present procedure
of waiting until the Commons has completed
its consideration of bills. Some of these bills
do not reach the Senate until Parliament is
about to prorogue. If any of them contain
provisions of which wc do not approve, we
then send the measures back to the Commons
with our amendments. In the late days of
a session the whole thing has to be done in
a hurry. That has happened on innumerable
occasions.
Would it not be better for us
to have a committee enunciate our proposed
amendments to a bill while it was still before
the House of Commons or one of the committees of that House? There is no reason
why amendments cannot be brought forward
just as the bill is brought forward.
Hon. THOMAS VIEN: Honourable senators, I should like to point out that the discussion is somewhat unusual. In my opinion,
it would be unwise to accept the amendiment
moved by the honourable senator from Vancouver-Burrard (Hon. Mr. McGeer).
The powers of the Senate are not involved.
The Senate has power to appoint committees
and to give them orders of reference. The
Senate within its constitutional right can
create committees and determine their jurisdiction. That is exactly what the honourable
leader of the Government is proposing. His
motion is:
That the Standing Connittee on Finance be
authorized to examine expenditures proposed by
the estimates laid before Parliament, and by
resolutions relating to war and other proposed
financial measures of which notice has been
given to Parliament, in advance of the Bills
based on the said estimates and resolutions
reaching the Senate.
That is proper parliamentary practice. We
have a Standing Committee on Finance, and
this motion is of the nature of an order of
reference to that committee directing it to
examine into all expenditures set forth in the
estimates.
The estimates have been distributed to senators and members of the
House of Commons. Legislation based on
those estimates has not yet been introduced
in the House of Commons. There the members are studying the budget resolutions. The
House of Commons itself could not compel
the Government to introduce legislation. The
budget resolutions must be disposed of before
any legislation is introduced by the Government.
As I have said, the powers of the Senate
are not involved. The Senate has exactly the
same powers as the House of Commons,
except in one respect. Under section 53 of
the British North America Act, money billa

instance, recent social legislation might well
have been introduced in the Senate. J believe
that it would have received here a more impartial and dispassionate study. The Senate in
considering such legislation would be actuated
exclusively by consideration of the publie
interest. Although members of the House of
Commons are also mainly concerned with
questions of the public interest, they are influenced by political, and partisan considerations,
by the declared policies of the group to which
they belong. We have no power to compel

House in time for full consideration. Well,
honourable senators, if instead of taking time
to consider bis on the floor of this House
,we substituted a procedure of considering them
in committees attended by only a relatively
few member-and I have no doubt that
wouid be the effect of the amendment-the
change, I submnit would flot be in the public
interest.
I want to repeat what I have %aid
here more
than once, that I do flot absolve the Government of blame for the situation in the Senate.
I for one do flot intend to vote for any expedient that would give the Government, as
I believe this amendment would, an excuse for
flot introducing into. the Senate certain legislation which cou-Id a.ppropriately be introduced
here. I arn on record as stating in this House
on several occasions that there are many bills
which could be introduced and have their
principle discussed in the Senate prior to their
introduction in the other House.
Hon. Mr. -HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I arn most strongly
opposed to my honourabie friend's, suggestion,
in so f ar as it implies a hole-in-the-corner
method of dealing with bis by a committee,
as a substitute for the open discussion of the
principle of bis on the floor of this House.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: HonourabIe senators,
I object to having the considerati'on of bills
by any committee of this House referred to as
a hole-in-the-corner rnethod.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS:

Ail right.

Hon. Mr. McGEER: I rise to a point of
order, and ask that that remnark be withdrawn
if it îs in any way associated with my proposai. The Senate has no hole-in-the-c orner
committees. Every one of our committees is
a responsibie group of honourable senators,
appointed to censider certain matters because
the Senate believes they are quaiified to do so.
I certainly object to a remark of that kind.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Honourable senators,
I repeat myý statement. With ail respect to
comrittes--and I arn a member of some of
thern, just as my honourabie friend is-Il say
that in contrast te our present practice of approving of the principie of bis before referring them to committees, the procedure of
having them considered in committees first
wouid be a h oie-in-the-c orner meth-od.

without much opportunity to discusa it, and
that plans are made for having it a.ssented

donc in the past; but I do object to giving our
blessing to that kind of thing as a general

that the method proposed by my honýourable

On motion of Hon. Mr. Haig, the debate

SENATE

INDUSTRIAL UNREST
DISCUSSION

On the Orders of the Day.
Hon. GERALD G. McGEER: Honourable
senators, before the Orders of the Day are
called, with the consent of the House I should
like to draw the attention of honourable
senators to a situation disclosed in this morning's press. One newspaper headline reads,
"Steel men may strike across Canada".
Another says, "To take strike vote in all
Burns' plants across Canada". Like many
other people I have felt the growing seriousness of the difficulties facing labour and capital, employers and employees, in Canada and
the United States. I do not know whether
the Senate can do anything about this question. It seems to me that the members of
labour unions are a minority in Canada, as
are also the employers of labour.
Now, we have a committee on Immigration
and Labour. I wonder if during the coming
recess honourable senators might not take
into consideration the possibility of the Senate intervening and offering its services in
an effort to compose these differences between
employers and employees, and thereby provent the appalling hardships that are certain
to follow a general unsettlement of labour
conditions here. It is not only Canadians
who may be crying for food and shelter.
Across the Atlantic there is want that will
ce terribly intensified if our lines of production and transportation are disrupted at this

time.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK:
Honourable
senators, I wonder if I, as Chairman of the
Committee on Immigration and Labour, nay
speak briefly. In the last two days our good
friend the honourable senator from Shediac
(Hon. Mr. McDonald) has approached me
at least seven or eigbt times, and I believe
he has seen my leader and others, to ascertain if we could net take some action in
connection with the unfortunate and longstanding strike in the Ford plant at Windsor.
I told him that I thought the Government of
Ontario and the federal Department of Labour had that particular question fully under
consideration and that it was up to them to
take whatever action might be deemed appropriate. I expressed the fear that we might
be entirely misunderstood if one of our conmittees undertook, as he suggested, to summon
representatives of the employers and employCes from Windsor to come here and present
their arguments to us in order that we might
make a decision.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS.

I have been a member of a labour organization for more than fifty years, and it is
only fair for me to say that I am entirely
surprised and dumbfounded by some of the
positions that have been taken. In the light
of my own experience-I do not know whether
it is creditable or not, but I believe I have
been in charge of more strikes in the United
States and Canada than any other Canadian
has-I feel that the positions that have been
taken are altogether undernocratic.
Maybe
that is because I am old.
Hon. Mr. EULER:

Taken by whom?

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: My honourable
friend to my right asks, "Taken by whom?"
I say, by labour. Just recall tihe qualms of
horror we all had when we heard of what
Germany ddd and Japan did to labour organizations. Well, for the last few weeks we
have been reading in our papers about employers and businessmen with offices in certain places not being permitted to go near
their offices. What are we coming to? I
know from experience that we had labour
troubles after the last war, and I am guessing that we are going to have more of them
in this post-war period. But labour cannot
further its just and proper claims and get
adequate rewards by the extreme measures
which, a'cording to press reports, bave been
resorted to in onnection with some of the
present controversies. My friend from Shediae
(Hon. Mr. McDonald) suggests to me that
the committee of which I am chairman should
call the parties to the dispute before it and
hear their representations, and then recommend certain action. I am absolutely against
his suggestion, because, to start witlh, I confess that I an unduly prejudiced by the
attitude assumed by men who, like myself,
I cannot
belong to a labour organization.
concede that it is the proper attitude to take.
My position is the same in respect to what
miy honourable friend has mentioned about
the proposed strike in the parking plants.
The attitude should be: Come, let us reason
together.

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Has that been the
attitude? No, not at all. It has been a case
of the iron fist and the laid-down demonstratien before the employers of what is going to
be done to them. We cannot have a worthwhile democracy if labour persists in such
an attitude. That is my humble judgment.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. J. J. BENCH: Honourable senators,
I should like to ask the honourable member
from Vancouver-Burrard (Hon. Mr. McGeer)

OCTOBER 11, 1945
whether any inquiry of the nature suggested
by hlm would not have ta be restricted to,
ma.tters over which. the federal autbority has
jurisdiction. It seems ta me that with respect
ta the Fard strike at Windsor, the war now
being ovar, the relevant Order in Couiicil,
P.C. 1003, cannat be said ta apply ta that
particular industry, sine it may no longer ba
regarded as a war inclustry. That being Sa,
naturally the matter is again within provincial
jurisdiction. If 1 am correct in my viaw, it
seems ta me that if we were ta take the
course suggested in that cannectian we should
be assuming a jurisdictian that we do not
actually have. But when it cames to a
nation-widýe strike in the meat-packing industry, with this, in turn, being ralated ta wage
contrai anti a nation-wide eontraI of meat
distribution or the fulfilmant of a national
obligation for the supply of meat and foodstuifs ta other countrias, it seems ta me the
case would be on a different footing. If that
situation shoulýd develop, and the bonourable
gentleman suggests that the Senate appoint
a committee sa that the parties may appear
before it and ventilate their problams in
public, he may find me amangst his supporters.
Han. Mr. McGEER: Honourabla sanators,
may I say that I had not in mind any individual strike now engaging public attention, but
a national situation with the possibility of
international complications. I bappened ta
meet the honourable sanator from Parkd-ala
(Han. Mr. Murdock) in 1906 at the Dominion
Trade Congress of Canada. At tbat time he
represented, the Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen and I representad the Iran Moulders. I
have kept in touch witb labour organizations
and te, a large extent I can endarse bis
remarks. I raise this issue because 1 have the
same fears IR ha bas, and, I balieve that wben
the confliet cames between the legislative
authority of the Parliament of Canada, witb
its National War Labour Board, and the
regional jurisdiction of the pravincial legislatures, witb tbeir regional labour boards, we
more inta a situation of grave consequence
and possible disaster. I feel tbat we sbould
avail oursalves of the ample powers contemplated by the Fatbers of Confederation, and
conferrad on tbe Senate by tbe British North
America Act, in order, if possible, ta avart
that danger.
I venture ta affer tbis suggestion ta the
henourable senator. I do not tbink we bave
many precedents ta guide us in the years that
lie ahead. We are moving into a worldcondition that we bave neyer known beforaHon. Mr. MURDOCK: You are right.

Hon. Mr. McGEER: -and,' if I reati the
signs of the times correctly, we may find that
some of tbose conditions in labour wbicb he
diseussed-and what be implied was mare
significant than wbat be said-must be expoeed ta the ligbt of public opinion, so that
Canadian good .iudgment and comman sense
may unite ta, pratect the national interest.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Wall, you and 1,

Hon. Mr. MeGEER: I amn glad ta hear itHon. Mr. BENCH: The Windsor strike is,
notHon. Mr. McGEER: I neyeýr menýtioned the
Windsor strike.
Hon. GUSTAVE LACASSE: Honourable,
senators, coming from the district most
affected at tbe prasent time by strikes, I maysay that, rightly or wrongly, the general trend
of public opinion is tbat tbe powers that be
are just passing the buck from ane ta another.
That opinion prevails almost evarywhere
today.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: If tliat is sa, the.
Senate aught ta be an tbe maya.
Hon Mr. LACASSE: That trend of opinion
would seem strongly ta support tbe contention just axpressed hy my bonourable friend
from Vancouvar-Burrard. Sa far as Windsoris concerned, I happen ta know conditions a
littie better than soe of my colleaguas. Many
af the workers affected by the strike bappen
ta be patients of mine. Tbe wheals of industry are stopped, and so many subsidiary companies are affected tbat if the strika lasts any
lengtb of time the whole automobile industry
in Windsor will collansa.

In that avent, indus-

gives a national aspect ta the problam, asmy honourable friand from Vancouver-Burrard
contends.

SENATE
making that demand; and honourable senators
know how all these organizations are linked
together for a common purpose-aiming at
one goal. I do not condemn them. I know
from personal experience that they have legitimate grievances. But, like my honourable
friend from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock), I
challenge the right of the employees to close
the offices of the company which for years
has been giving them their daily bread. I
think such action not only is non-social, it is
non-moral, and it is a challenge to constituted
authority.
As to the Senate attempting to reach a solution of the problem, in my view once we
regard it as -anational problem we are perfectly
justified in taking action, because both collectively and individually we are less interested
than any other body which might be called
in to adjudicate the dispute. We would act
on general principles and strictly from the
viewpoint of public interest rather than the
interest of any particular group.
That is my stand as a member of this House
coming from the district most seriously affected
right now. I go further. I do not hesitate to
say that I suspect that in this trouble there is
interference from abroad, that there is some
Communistic move behind it all.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I would remind
honourable senators that this discussion is
quite irregular. On the Orders of the Day a
member may ask a question, but on that
question there should be no general discussion. I merely call attention to the matter
now so that this procedure may not be cited
as a precedent.
APPROPRIATION BILL No. 4
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the third
reading of Bill 17, an Act for granting to His
Majesty certain sums of money for the public
service of the financial year ending the 31st
March, -1946.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.
THE ROYAL ASSENT
The Honourable the Speaker informed the
Senate that he had received a communication
from the Assistant Secretary to the Governor
General, acquainting him that the Honourable Patrick Kerwin, acting as Deputy Administrator, would proceed to the Senate Chamber
at 9 p.m. this day for the purpose of giving
the Royal Assent to certain bills.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE.

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. W. de B. FARRIs moved the Second
Reading of Bill G:
An act to amend an act respecting Vancouver,
Victoria and Eastern Railway and Navigation
Company, the Nelson and Fort Sheppard Railway Company, and Great Northern Railway
Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill in
reality, is a supplement to a bill passed by
this House last session. The Great Northern
Railway bas been operating some lines in
British Columbia in the names of two subsidiaries, one known as the V.V. and E., or
the Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern railway,
and the other as the Nelson and Fort Sheppard railway. The first is the line out of Vancouver to Seattle, on the Canadian side. The
V.V. and E. at one time owned and operated
in the interior a road from Brookmere down
to Oroville, on the way to Spokane. That
line, in part, bas been abandoned. The scheme
of the Great Northern railway is to eliminate
the subsidiaries and to have properties held
in the names of those subsidiaries-they are
not very extensive-turned over to the parent
company to be operated under the jurisdiction
of the Board of Transport Commissioners.
Under the powers granted last year certain
agreements were entered into with the subsidiaries, and the Great Northern was authorized te turn over any of these lines to the
C.P.R. or the C.N.R. In accordance with the
powers thon given, a small section of line
from Otter Summit to Princeton has been
sold te the C.P.R: That is part of the Kettle
Valley line, and that runs from Vancouver
through the mountains down to Penticton
and on to Nelson.
The lawyers for the C.P.R., who are almost
as technical as laymen, have raised the point
that the power to acquire does not embrace
the power to convey. This power is being
given by this bill.
There are also some other slight changes.
There are four schedules to the bill, the first
two of which deal with conveyances of the
V.V. and E. and the Nelson and Fort Sheppard, to the Great Northern-that is from the
subsidiaries to the parent company.
Apparently, we did not go far enough last
year. This bill if passed will ratify those

brought up in committee. As far as I know
there are no material matters that this Parliament should concern itself with respecting the
conveyancing of the subsidiaries to the parent
company, except that the C.P.R. bas entered

Prineeton. It ig a short line; it looks like
about fifty miles on the map. The C.P.R.
now operate it as part of their system, but
under this bill they will buy it.
There is a rather interesting clause in this
agreement, to which I might refer. It reads:
This agreement shaîl be subject to sanction
hy two-thirds of the vote of the shareholders
of the Great Northern and of the Vancouver
Company present or represented hy proxyThat ia, unless the power to convey is
ratified by this bill, the agreement must have
the sanction of two-thirds of the shareholders.
There was some doubt in my mind as to
whether we bad the power to ratify a conveyance between a foreign corporation and the

C.P.R.
that we have that power; and, on second
thought, I am inclined to agree, because the
Great Northern Railway bas by a previous
Act of Parliament submitted itself to the
jurisdiction of this House.
There appears to be nothing in principle
which would justify us in ref using to pasa
the supplementary bill. I intend to move
that it be ref erred to the Commîttee on
Railways, Telegraphs and barbours.
bon. Mr. VIEN: May I ask the bonourable
senator, if any of the rigbts of minonity shareholders' would seem to be injuriously affected?
bon. Mr. FARRIS: No, there are no rights
which are affected in any way whatever. I
may say that the Transport Department and
the Board of Transport Commissioners of
Canada have had the matter before them, and
while they have not given any formal assent,
the appropriate officiaIs are ready to appear
before the committeýe and indicate that tbey
have no objection to this bill.
bon. Mn. VIEN: The only question in my
mmnd was as to why we should nelieve a
company of the obligation to have the agreements ratified by a two-thinds vote.
I would ask the
Hon. Mr. FA.RRIS:
honounable senator to defer bis final decision
on that question, because counsel for the
Great Nortbenn Railway will appear before

explanation.

nead the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of bon. Mr. Farris the Bill was
nefenred to the Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours.

INCOME AND EXCESS PROFITS
TAXATION
MOTION

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. Campbell:
That a Special Committee of the Senate be
appointed to examine into the provisions and
workings of the Ineome War Tax Act and the
Excea Profits Tax Act, 1940, and to formulate
recommendations for the improvement, clarification and simplification of the methods of
assessment and collection of taxes thereunder
and to report thereon;
2. That t'he said Committee be composed of
the Honourable Senators Aseltine, Beauregard,
Benchi, Buchanan, Campbell, Crerar, Euler,
Farris, Haig, Hayden, Hugessen, Lambert,
Leger, McRae, Moraud, Robertson, Sinclair,
and Vien;
3. That the said Committee shaîl have authority to send for persons, papers and records.
Hon. A. J. LÈGER: Honourable senators,
it is my purpose to make only one or two
observations on the motion under discussion.
I believe it is a step in the right direction
which is long overdue. The Finance Committee, undýer the chairmanship of the honourable senator from Rougemont (Hon. Mr.
Beauregard), has done excellent work. It is
to be hoped that the present committee wilI
do as well as the previous one, and that, when
it has completed its work and reported to
this Huse it will not be relieved or discharged, but will be amalgamated, as it were,
with the Finance Committee, so that the
two may constitute, in effect, a Committee of
Supply and a Committee of Ways and Means,
to study financial resolutions and items that
may be introduced in the other bouse.
When those two committees have been sO
constituted, and have studied a resolution or
an item they should report to- this bouse

sit again. In this way we could study better
the different items under consideration.
1 had intended to go -over the powers and
prerogatives of the Senate; but as the subjeet
has been ably deait with by the honourable
senator fromn De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien)
this afternoon, I do not propose to go into it.
When this matter of taxation was brought
before the Senate I read an interesting editonial published in the Ottawa Journal underthe title of "The Senate and Taxation". The
concluding paragraph of the article states:
The Senate is not ia a position to change
the ]aws. It la in position to shed some light
upon their inequalities as will compel othersto change them. It will render a great servie
if it aces.

SENATE
0ow I do not criticize the newspaper for
having published that article.

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: What paper is that
in?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: The Ottawa Journal,
Tuesday, October 9.
Writers with good
intentions, public speakers, parliamentarians
and even historians have said exactly the
same thing as that newspaper article said.
But where does that come from? It comes,
as bas been stated by the honourable senator
frorn De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien), this
afternoon, from a standing order of the
House of Commons which says:
All aids and supplies granted to His Majesty
by the Parliament of Canada, are the sole
ouse of Commons, and all bills
g ift of the
for granting such aids and supplies ought to
begin with the House, as it is the undoubted
right of the House to direct, limit, and appoint
in all such bills, the ends, purposes, considerations, conditions, limitations, and qualifications
of such grants, which are not alterable by the
Senate.
Under that standing order, only one conclusion is possible, because it is taken word
for word from a rule passed on resolution in
the House of Commons in England in 1678,
almost two centuries ago. That resolution
states:
"That all aids and supplies. and aids to His
Majesty in Parlianent ara the sole gift of the
Commons; and all bills for the granting of any
such aids and supplies ought to begin with thc
Commons; and that it is the undoubted and
sole right of the Commons to direct, limit, and
appoint in such bills the ends. purposes, considerations, conditions,'limitations, and qualifications of such grants, which ought not to be
changed or altered by the louse of Lords."
I say the standing order was obviously
taken from that rule, because they are word
for word. When the British North America
Act was passed the rule had been in existence
for at least two centuries and must have
been known to members of the British House
of Commons. As was said by the honourable
senator frorn De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien),
if they bad intended to make it part of our
constitution they w'ould have enacted it in
place of section 53 of the British North
America Act. I would suggest that the Senate make a humble request te the House of
Commons to repeal that standing order.
Hon.

Mr. EULER:

Why humble?

Hon. Mr. LEGER: Well, I want to be as
polite as possible. Its only effect lias been
in the past and would be in the future to
lead people into error. I think the Senate
would be well advised to convey to the
House of Commons a humble request that
ýthat standing order be expunged.
Hon. Mr. LEGER.

Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I am not prepared to go on this
afternoon. I know the mover of the motion
(Hon. Mr. Campbell) is anxious to have it
adopted, but as we are likely to have an
adjournment, after today or tomorrow nothing
could be done to give effect to the motion
before we come back. I, therefore, 'intend to
move adjournment of the debate, but first I
should like to make a few remarks.
To begin with, let me say that I am
grateful for the contribution made in this
debate to what is a vital question. I recollect
clearly that about six or seven years ago the
Government of the day brought down a bill
that would have made certain provisions of
the Income Tax Act retroactive and the
Senate threw out that amendment.
Both
newspapers in my city criticized me severely,
not because I had voted against the retroactive feature of the amendment, but because
my vote implied a belief that the Senate had
a right to reject a measure of that kind
passed by the House of Commons. I always
thought the British North America Act gave
the Senate that right, although I candidly
admit I had grave doubt on the matter after
I had seen Standing Order 61 of the House
of Commons.
I confess that I did net
examine the question as thoroughly as did
honourable members who have preceded me.
My remarks on this motion will be postponed until after Friday night. I want to be
fair to the Minister of Finance. I have some
appreciation 'of the burden that ho is carrying, and that his officials are carrying, and I
am net unaware of the service that representatives of his department are rendering in
my own city.
I hope the Budget will reveal, substantial
reductions in both the excess profits tax and
the personal income tax. I am particularly
anxious to see changes in some of the pernicious features of both these taxing laws.
For instance, the so-called normal tax of
seven per cent on incomes is a nuisance. I
have no idea how much revenue it brings in,
but I do know it causes a tremendous amount
of work, not only to taxpayers but to officials
in the income tax offices. I have run across
some very troublesome cases arising out of
this tax.
The other night the mover of the motion
made some reference to labour. I appreciate
the effect that the income tax had upon
labour during the war. In many instances
men refused to work overtime because a
large share of their overtime pay would be
taken from them in 'taxes.

One partieular suggestion that I want to
make is that the formn for repnrting incomes
up to $3,000 or, say, $5,000, should be made
simpler-,so simple t-hat he who runs May
read. I arn speaking of gross, mot of net, ineorne. Men and women with a gross income
in exeess of $5,000 should be required to file
a complete and detailed return, but we need
a simplified form for incomes below that.
Many a £armer with a gross ineome of $5,000
has net receipts of perhaps only $1,200 or
$1,500.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: My honourable
friend is aware that two years ago the form
for incornes up to $3,000 was greatly simpllified.

should continue sitting between now and six
,o' ock, unless some honourable members feel
the measure may reach us in the meantime.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I know, but people with
fairly small incornes stili find mucE_ difficulty_
in making their returus. In Manitoba we
have a gond many farmers, and most -of them
are seriously disturbed by their income tax
returns;* I personally have met a number who
were, as the saying is, scared to death, althougb
there was no need for t-hem to be disturbed
to the slightest degree, since on going into
figures one found there was no taxable income
at ail.
Let me give an illustration of the bad effeet
nf the present tax. We are desirous nf raising
more hogs in order to jucrease our export nf
bacon to the starving people oi Europe, but
we might as well face the fact that many
farmers fear that increased hog production
would place them in a higher incorne tax
bracket, and that after doiug a lot nf extra
work aud assuming additioual risks they would
be no better off than before.
Ail the departmeutal officiais whom I have
met would like to have the income and corporation taxes as simple and reasonable as
possible. Therefore I believe that not on'ly
the members of the proposed committee but
aIl honourable senators can make a real contribution by offering suggestions to the
department.
As I have some further things to say, I
move the adjournment of the debate.
On motion of Honourable Mr. Haig, the
debate, was adjourned.

H-on. Mr. SINCLAIR: His Honour the
Speaker might caîl it six o'clock, and we
could resumne at eight.

BUSINESS 0F THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, the latest word I have is that the measure
we are awaitiug from the other bouse is still
in the second reading stage, but is expected
to be given third reading and to corne before
this bouse in time to enable it to receive
consideration and the Royal Assent by nine
o'clock. As we have no further busifness on
our Order Paper, I sec no reason why we

Hon. Mr. LEGER: May I ask what measure
it is?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It is the measure
authorizing Canada to enter into the international agreement with respect to food and
agriculture. The reason for urgency is that
the measure would also -enable Canada to
j oin the international organization whose conferenýce opens at Quebec City next week. It
Ï9 desired, if Parliament sees fit, to have the
Royal Assent given before we adjourn.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: We might resume
at seven-thirty in order to give honourable
senators a littie extra time to consider the
measure.
Hon.. Mr. SINCLAIR: The other, Huse
may not. have passed the measure by six
o'clock.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Let us call it six o'clock;
then, without any motion, we meet again at
eight.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It being six
o'cloýck, I now leave the Chair.
At six o'clock the Senate took recess.

The -Senate resumed at 8 p.m.
BUSINESS 0F THE SENATE
Honourable
lion. Mr. ROBERSTON:
senators, the legisiation which we expected
from the other bouse bas flot yet reached us.
Royal Assent has been postponed until .10
o'clock tonight. In the ineantime there is no
business before the bouse. The legisiation
which we are waîting for is important, and I
leave it to you to decide whether or not you
feel that when the Bill does reach us there
wi1l be sufficient time to discuss it. I suggest
that we ad.journ during pleasure.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Why not adjourn until,
say, 11 o'clock tomorrowý morn-ing.
bon. Mr. DON NELLY: If the bill reaches
us at 10 o'cloek, I think we would have
sufficient time to dispose of it.
Hon. Mr. MURflOCK: The leader opposite
(bon. Mr. Haig) expected that the bill would
reaeh us some time this evening.

106

SENATE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: 1 may say that
thse suggestion of setting the Royal Assent for
10 o'ciock was macle with the approval of the
honourable leader opposite. It is a matter of
great regret to me that in the circumstances
we have flot more time within which to consider the bill referred to. Last week I consulted the chairman of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Porestry (Hon. Mr.
Donnelly) and we endeavoured as best we
could to have the committee deal with the
subjeet-matter before the bill itself reached us.
I had hoped that it would have reached us
last Tuesday.
1 wouid suggest that thse Senate adjourn at
the eall of the bell.
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN: Before the Senate
adjourns, there is one point I want to raise.
It had been my impression that the urgent
necessity for consideration of Bill 14 arose
from the -fact that the flrst meeting of the
international organiz-ation on food is to be
held next Tuesday, and in order to permit
Canada to becýome a party to that organization it was essentiel thiat in the mneantime
Parhiament pass this mensure. That does not
appear to be the case at ail. I refer honourabie
senators to the second paragraph of the
preamble:
And whereas Canada is traîîsmitting ain inistrument of aceeptance of the Constitution to the
Jnterim Commission oi Food and Agriculture.
In other words, the Government is of its
own motion agreeing that Canada shial become
a party to this international organization, and
the wliole purpose of the bill is to enable the
Governor in Couincil to mnake such appointments and expenditures, and establish suchl
offices, as may be necessary by reason of
Canada having beconso a member. In these
circumHtances, honourable senators, it seems
to me that there is not so much urgcncy as
lias been suiggested, and that, if any lionourable member wislies to disetiss tise bill, wo
could -very easily postpone its consideration
uintil we meet agnin the week after next, without doing any substantial harm.

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Is not the agreement
in force now because it hias been signed by at
lest twenty nations?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I believe that is so.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
It was urged
upon me in Government circles thsat it was
desirabie to have the bill passed in order that
the agreement might be subscribed to by
Canada's representatis e on or before the
passing ont of existence of the interim commission and the formation of its successor.
lion. Mr. MIJRDOCK.

I am not famihiar with the point my honourable friend bias raised, and so amrn ot in a
position to discuss it.
The Senate adjourncd during pleasure.
Thse sitting of the Senate was resumed.
Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, in view of the fact that
the other House is not through with the legis-

lation in question, I would suggest to honourable senators that we adjourn until tomorrow afternoon at 3 o'clock. Royal Assent
will be at a quarter to six. This will give us
an opportunity to discuss the legishation when
it comas before ns.

HOUSE OF COMMONS

EXPENSE ALLOWANCE TO MEMBERS

On the Orders of tisa Day:
Hon. ARTHIUR ROEBUCK: Honourable
senators, may I, on the Ordars oftise Day, ask
a question of the honourable leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Robertson), based on
a notice of motion which appears in yesterday's Votes and Proceedings of the House of
Commons?
This notice of motion reads as follows:
The Prinme Miinister On Monday niext-Jo
Comimittee of the Wlsole-The folios ing resolution:!Resolvcd, That it la expedient to present a
measure to amend the Scuate anîd House of
Commoîs Act, to provide for paymeîst of an
allowance to each mensber of the Hoîise of
Commons for axpenses iiscidental to, tise discharge of bis duties as a memiber of tise House
of Commons at the rate of two thoîîsand dollars
par 3 ear for the period when lie is n membas,
and to provide furiher that such mensure shail
be deemed to have come inito affect on the
sixth day of Saptember, one thousnd iiîna
hundrad and forty-five.
My questions are:
(1) Do 1 understand corractly that this
rasolution means that mambers of Parliamant
in tise bouse of Commons are to ba paid
$2.000 per yaar for expansas incidental to the
discharge of their duties and that mambers
of Parliamant in the Senata are not?

OCTOBER 12, 1945
(2) le this a mere oversight on the part of
the Government or is it the policy of the
Administration to draw a distinction between
the members of this Chamber and the mnembers of the House of Commons?
Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON.
Honourable senators, anticipating that the
matter referred to by the honourable senator
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck)
migbt be brought to the attention of the
House, though I had no knowledge of the
particular form in wbich it would corne before
us, I -arn prepared to make the following
statement on behaif of the Government:
The whole matter of an allowance for members of Parliament for expenses incidentai
to the discharge of their duties bas been under
consideration by the 'Government, but the
only decision reacbed up to the present is
that indicated by the notice of the proposed
resolution in the other place.
Hon. J. W. de B. FARRIS: Honourable
senators, may I be permitted to make a statement? I heard of this matter only a littie
while ago. The fo-rm of the questions put
by the honourable gentleman from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) rather suggests
that the Senate might be concerned on the
ground that the re.solution does flot provide
for the payment of this allowance to senators.
It seems to me that in view of the heavy war
expenditures this coun.try bas incurred and
the necessity for a reduction in taxes, what
the public might be concerned about is the
payment of any allowance to any members
of Parliament at this time.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, as the legisiation relating to the international food and agriculture organization bas
flot yet passed the other House but is expected
to, pass at an early hour, I would move that
the Senate adjourn during pleasure, to reassemble at the, cali of the bell.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
The sitting of the Senate was resumed.
FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION 0F UNITED NATIONS BILL
PIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 14, an Act for carrying
into effeet the agreement for a Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
between Canada and certain other nations
and authorities.
The Bill was read the first time.

loi
SECOND READING

The Hlon. the SPEAKER: When shaîl this
Bill be read a second time?
Hon. WISHART MeL. ROBERTSON:
With Teave of the Senate, now.
Honourable senators, the purpose of this
Bill is to sanction Canada's joining in the
Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations, preparatory to an international conference to, be held in Quebec on
the 16th of this month. The proposed international organizatio s based on the report
*
of tbe Interim Co01mm.ission on Food and
Agriculture. Tbis commission first met in
May, 1943, at Hlot Springs, Virginia, on the
direct invitation of the late President
Roosevelt.
The object of the international organization
mnay he stated briefly. It is to attempt, internationally, to solve the great long-standing
problem of scarcity in the midst of plenty.
This is a stupendous undertaking, but I think
you will readily agree with me tbat, if successfuI, it will bave an important bearing on the
future of the whole world. Tbe various
member-countries of the international organization are uniting in, an effort to solve not
only the pro'blem of raising the nutritional
standards cf their respective pe-oples, but that
of increasing tbe production of food and agricultural products of e.very kindý. Tbis is initeresting te Canada from tbe bumanitarian
standpoint, but even more so because Canada
is one of the great food-producing countries
of tlhe world, and on more than one occasion
bas evidenced a readiness.to share its abund4ance with countries that are in dire need of
f ood.
So far thbe governments of thirty countries
have signified their intention cf j oining this
international organization. Its funetions will
be advisory only. The representatives of the
member-nations will report the conclusion
arrived at tea tbeir respective governments,
to be a guide in formulating policies to increase tbe output of the products of agriculture as well as those of fiaberies and forests.
It is estimated tbat in normal times the
budget requirements will be about five million
American dollars a year. Tbe immediate
budget is for two and a bialf million dollars,
of whioh Canada's share is 5-06 per cent, or
approximately $125,000. Already tbe Interim
Commission bas made some illuminating and
interesting reports -on nutrition and food, management, anid on agricultural, fisheries, and,
primary forest products. These reports soon
will be avaîlable, to honou-rable meinbers, and
undoubtêdly they will flnd tbem, informative
and 'helpful in thair study of this important
subject.

SENATE

Honourable senators, when I think of the
perplexing problems facing the world today
I sometimes am bewildered, but I fall back
on the simple faith that, after all, the peoples
of all countries are the same. I cannot help
believing that no matter what the nationality,
race or colour of parents in any part of the
earth, they no more desire their sons to kill
or to be killed than we desire such a fate for
our boys. There seems to be a general hope
that in the future the wisdom of the welldisposed nations shall be applied to assuring
every person in the world enough to eat, and
a chance to sing, play and worship God as be
or she secs fit; and if honourable members
feel as I do, that Canada is in a position to
make a splendid contribution to that worthy
objective, then this measure should receive
not only the earnest but the favourable consideration of the Senate.
I am sure I voice the sentiments of all
honourable members when I say that we welcome to Canada this international Food and
Agricultural Organization and wish them Godspeed in the great work they have undertaken.
Hon. A. D. MeRAE: Honourable senators,
I am entirely in agreement with what bas just
been said by the honourable leader of the
House (Hon. Mr. Robertson). The effort
which this bill initiates is of great importance
to Canada, particularly as it has to do with the
distribution of food and other agricultural
products, on which the future prosperity of
our country so much depend's. In listening
to the debate in another place I realized that
there are a great many details to be worked
out and differences to be adjusted, but I think
we can safely leave it to the organization to
sec that these things are donc in a way satisfactory to us. I have heard some objections
raised to the application of the bill to fish and
However, the agreement
forest products.
expresses the consensus of opinion of some
forty-odd nations, whose representatives did
such good work at the conference in Hot
Springs, and I believe it presents one of the
most promising opportunities for adjusting
the problems now facing us and the rest of
the world. I should like to sec it made
effective.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: With leave of the
Senate, I would move the third reading now.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.

UNITED NATIONS CHARTER
MOTION TO REFER TO COMMITTEE
On Notices of Inquiries and Motions:

Hon.

WISHART

McL.

ROBERTSON:

Honourable senators, with leave, I should like
to say that it is my intention to give notice
of a resolution designed to approve the Agreements establishing the United Nations and
constituting the Charter of the United Nations.
In the meantime, in order that honourable
senators may have as much information as
possible, with leave of the Senate, I move now:
That the copy of the Charter of the United
Nations, including the statute of the International Court of Justice, together with the
Interim Arrangements est'ablishing the Preparatory Commission of the United Nations, signed
at San Francisco on the 2th of Jiue, 1945.
Treaty Series 1945, No. 7, laid on the Table
of the Senate on the 11th of September, 1945,
be referred to the Standing Committee on
External Relations.
Honourable senators, if this motion is agreed
to there will be an opportunity tomorrow
morning to bear some explanation of the matters referred to. My suggestion is that notice
could be given here in the afternoon, and the
resolution might be considered on Thursday.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
the hour at which the Committee on External
Relations is to meet tomorrow morning is a
little uncertain, due to the fact that the Minister of Justice, Mr. St. Laurent, who has kindly
agreed to appear to make a statement, and who
probably will bo willing to answer questions
of honourable senators, is not sure whether
he can come at ten o'clock or eleven. The
meeting will be called for eleven o'clock, I
believe, but I should like honourable senators
to watch the notice board to see if there is
any change. As to the members of the committee, I shall make it my business to telephone them in the morning when I learn at
what hour the minister can come.
I am sure it would please us all if His
Honour the Speaker would attend the conmittee meeting and give information to honourable me;mbers respecting the San Franciseo

Conference, at which he was a delegate. I
understand that the honourable gentleman
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

from La Salle (Hon. Mr. Moraud), who also
was a delegate, is at present in South America.
Anticipating the approval of the Senate, we
have asked two other delegates, Mr. Gordon
Graydon and Mr. M. J. Coldwell, to come to
our meeting, but so far have received no
acknowledgment from either of them.
I feel, honourable senators, that the story of
the San Francisco Conference will be a very
interesting one to hear. Despite the misgivings
that some of us had at first, I think we all have
to admit that a marvellous task was achieved
there, and that every one of the Canadian
delegates is entitled to our heartiest congratulations. Many honourable senators seem
to be impressed now with the necessity of
keeping up interest in the proposed organization. Obviously it will take some time to get
the machinery working, and in the interval
we want to avoid the feeling that nothing is
being done. I think that discussion in our
committee and on the floor of the Senate
would be very helpful in that regard. It is to
be hoped that as many senators as possible
will be present at tomorrow morning's meeting.
Hon. J. J. BENCH: Honourable senators,
I have no objection to the proposed resolution,
but as a member of the Committee on
External Relations I desire ýto take this opporunity of voicing my humble protest at the
circumstance of having received tonight notice
of a meeting of the Committee to be held
tomorrow morning at an hour which is as yet
uncertain. This matter being of the highest
importance, my respectful submission to honourable senators is that we should have had
considerably more notice of the meeting than
has been given te us. I may say that I have
the very deepest respect for the Minister of
Justice, but I venture to suggest that a comrittee of this House, a committee of Parliament, should not be kept in the corridors
awaiting the convenience of any individual
member or officer of the Government. As I
understand it, meetings of other committees
are scheduled for tomorrow morning: for
example there is a meeting of the Banking
and Commerce Committee, certain members
of which are also members of the Committee
on External Affairs. Clearly, if these senators
attend one committee meeting they must miss
the other. Now I suggest, with great respect,
that it is this sort of thing which brings this
Chamïber into disrepute. Why shouid we be
pushed around-if J ;may use that expression
-by the Government or anyone else in matters of this kind? I think we are all entirely
in sympathy with the United Nations Charter;
but if we are to function properly we should
have an opportunity of studying this measure,
and should be given reasonable notice of pro-

OCTOBER 23, 1945
posed meetings and definite information as to
the hour at which they are to ho held. I take
this opportunity of vo.icing my personal protest, in the hope that the chairmen of our
-eespective committees will resist to the utmost
,lhe practice of having the memabers of Senate
committees run around like chore boys for the
convenience of ministers of the Governjment.
Hon. Mr. MURD 0CR: I concur entirely
in what bas been said, and personally insist
on the rules of the Senate being adhered to
in respect of this resolution.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
If honourable
senators will pardon me for speaking a second
time on this motion, withi ]eave, I should
like to offer a word of explanation.
The
suggested change in the time of meeting was
not. the result of any indecision on the part
of the bonourabie senator frorm Vancouver
(Hon. Mr. McRae), whýo is chairmnan of the
committee. The hour ýwas set for il o'clock
in the morning, and arrangements were made
with the Minister of Justice to be presenit.
Later, hnving ascertained that a meeting at
the time fixed would confliet seriously with
other committee meetings. after consultation
with the leader opposite I took it upon myself to arrange, if the Minister of Justice could
corne then, to have the meeting at 10 o'clock
instead of il o'clock, so that honourable sonators who wished to attend other committees
could do so.
The honourable the Chaiýrman of the Coinmittee on Externat Relations (Hon. Mr.
McRae) undertook to get in touch with Mr.
St. Laurent. Unfortunately the minister had
had a vory stre-nious day and was flot aveulable. There was no question of uncertainty.
I simply took the responsibility of suggesting
te, the Chairman that to meet at an earlier
hour might better serve the convenience of
honourable senators.

GOLD PRODUCTION IN CANADA
NOTICE 0F DISCUSSION
Hon. A. D. McRAE rose to give notice of
the following resolution:
That on Tuesday, October 30, 1945, I wll
eall the attention of the Sonate to the development of Dur gold resources and what an active
programme to inerease our gold production
could moan to the general prosperity of Canada,
particularly the empinyment of labour, the
establishment of new communities, and the
importance of the gold which it will provide in
taking care of our foreign obligations.
He said: I may explain that I have set the
date considerably ahead s0 that honourablo
members may bo prepared to discuss this
issue, which I regard as of great importance
in our programme of recovory. I have purposely confinod my motion to gold, which I
know a litîle about. But I may point out
that the honourable senator from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar), whom I regard as the
most able Minister of Mines that Canada bas
ever hadSome Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. MT. McRAE: -is the best qualified
authority in Parliamont to discuss the subjeetmatter of this motion. H1e understands the
problemn froma every angle. It would be far
beyond my ability to take up our base motel
development, and I hope that some time this
session the honourable gentleman may see
fit to talk to us on tbe subjeet.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT- Would
the honourable senator bo willing to include
in bis motion the development of our silver
resourees?

Hon. Mr. CALDER: And platinum?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Silver particularly.
I am out of order, but I should like to say
that I believe it would be of particular interest from the economic standpoint to include
silver with gold.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: No, you Lad better
keep them apart.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: I quite agree with the
honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert), but I shall find it difficult to deal
with my motion in forty-five minutes. I eau
fill up that time in giving the Senate a picture
of the possibilities of increasing our gold production, which I believe is one thing we need
not worry about. Of course, I am out of
order in speaking to a notice of motion, but
while on my feet I did want to express my
high regard for the honourable senator, the
former Minister of Mines.
INCOME AND EXCESS PROFITS
TAXATION
MOTION

The
Senate
resumed
from
Thursday,
October 11, the debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. Campbell:
That a Special Committee of the Senate be
appointed to examine into the provisions and
workings of the Income War Tax Act and the
Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940. and to formulate
recommendations for the improvement, clarification and simplification of the methods of
assessment and collection of taxes thereunder
and to report thereon;
2. That the s'aid Conmittee b eomposed of
the Honourable Senators Aseltine, Beauregard,
Bench, Buchanan, Campbell, Crerar, Euler,
Farris, Haig, Hayden. Hugessen, Lambert,
Léger, McRae, Moraud, Robertson, Sinclair, and
Vien;
3. That the said Committee shall have
authority to send for persons, papers and
records.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, when this motion was last before us, I
adjourned the debate to give an honourable
senator a chance to speak on the subject, but
I am sorry to say he is not able to be
present.
I am heartily in accord with the objects of
the motion, provided-and I say this quite
candidly-those objects are not political, but
are purely constructive and intended to help
the Income Tax Department to get out a
simple form that small income taxpayers can
complete without the assistance of a firm of
chartered accountants and of the best firm
of lawyers in their home town.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is about the help
required now to fill out income tax returns.
Even then they are sometimes all wrong. I
should like to see a simple form that a
farmer with a total income not exceeding
$5,000 could complete without much outside
help. A similar form should be available for
small business men in our towns and villages.
In our cities a business man can consult a
firn of auditors, and then all he has to do
is pin their report to his income tax return.
If the Income Tax Department objects to the
return, the business man can say, "I paid the
auditors for their report. Let them justify
their work." I believe that by using simpler
forms more money would be collected, and
there would be a better feeling on the part
of income tax payers. Undoubtedly many of
our smaller income tax payers dislike income
tax because of the difficulty of making out
their returns. The proposed committee can
do a great service by undertaking the work
set forth in the motion. Already the appearance of this motion on our Order Paper has
done something. As honourable members are
aware, it bas been announced in another place
that the whole system of income tax assessment and collection is to be overhauled. I
do not think that announcement was spontaneous; rather it would seem as if somebody
had been listening at the keyhole and heard
what the Senate intended te do. I repeat, I
am heartily in accord with the motion. I
believe the work of our special committee
will be very helpful not only to our people,
but also to the Government, and especially
to the departments concerned.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, in the absence of the sponsor
of this motion (Hon. Mr. Campbell), I
should like to say that I hope it will be passed
unanimously, so that the committee may be
organized and make the necessary arrangements to proceed with its investigations. It
was made clear by the honourable senator
that any benefit which might accrue from
the work of the committee would be reflected
on the taxpayers in the lower brackets rather
than on those in the upper brackets. I am
certain from the reception which a similar
proposal received in another place during the
presentation of the budget, and particularly
from the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition there, that my honourable friend
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) may set his
mind at rest regarding the purposes of this
proposed inquiry. I feel that the very life
of responsible government rests on the raising
of revenue and the system of taxation which
it involves. Any tendency to administer such
an important taxation measure as the Income

OCTOBER 23, 1945
Tax Act by arbitrary decisions or compromises
must have a disturbing effect upon the rank
and file of our people and undermine their
confidence in the law generally. On the other
hand, if income tax legislation can be so
clarified and simplified as to bring about
uniform administration, undoubtedly it will
tend to strengthen the confidence of the
people in our system of government. It is
because of my desire to see the administration
of the Income Tax Act placed on a sound
foundation, reflecting, incidentally, benefits in
other directions, that I hope the Senate will
accept this motion without delay.
On motion of Hon.
debate was adjourned.

ESTIMATES
EXAMINATION

BY

FINANCE

COMMITTEE

The Senate resumed from Thursday, October 11, the ad'journed debate on the motion
of Honourable Mr. Robertson:
That the Standing Committee on Finance be
authorized to examine expenditures proposed
by the estimates laid before Parliament, and by
resolutions relating to war and other proposed
financial measures of which notice has been
given to Parliament, in advance of the bills
based on the said estimates and resolutions
reaching the Senate.
And the amendment moved by Hon. Mr.
McGeer:
That the said motion be amended by striking
out all the words after "That" in the first- line
thereof, and substituting therefor the following:
"any Standing or Special Committee of the
Senate be authofized to examine any resolution
or proposed bill laid before Parliament in
advance of the resolution or bill reaching the
Senate."
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I am opposed to this amendment, because
I think the Senate itself should retain control
over the reference of matters to its committees.
True, during a session, I may not oppose a
single one of the motions for referring bills
and other matters to committees. Then why
47704-U9

113

do I oppose this amendment? I do so because
I want the Senate to retain the power to say
which committee should consider any specific
matter. I am very much afraid, that if this
amendment were passed there would sometimes be a dispute between committees as to
which had the right to take up a certain bill
or resolution. For instance, the Banking and
Commerce committee might think it had jurisdiction to deal with a piece of proposed legislation which the committee on Finance felt
specially fitted to handle. Another measure
might be the subject of a dispute between the
Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills and
the Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and
Harbours. The safest thing to do, in my
opinion, is to retain control in the Senate itself.
His Honour the Speaker will recall that during
his tenure of office as Government leader in
this Chamber we agreed to all the motions
he made for the reference of bills to committee.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
a change.

Sometimes we made

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, sometimes we did
not agree that the reference should be to the
committee suggested, but we always sent the
bill or whatever it was to some committee.
My honourable friend's remark supports my
statement that there is not always general
agreement as to which committee should consider a particular matter. We arp not so
busy that we need to save time by authorizing committees automatically to examine any
proposed legislation prior to its introduction
into the Senate.
Notwithstanding my opposition to his
amendment, I have very great respect for
the parliamentary experience of the honourable gentleman from Vancouver-Burrard (Hon.
Mr. McGeer). Few if any of us have for so
long represented the people in the framing of
legislation. I have the honour to live in the
city in which he was born, which is no mean
honour. He has served as head of the municipal government of his adopted city; he has
been a member of the legislature of his
adopted province; he has represented a constituency of that province in the House of
Commons; and now he is a member of this
Chamber. I admit that his experience is
much wider than mine. But the experience
I have had as a member of the Manitoba
Legislature, and as a senator for nearly eleven
years, has convinced me that it is wise for a
law-making body to retain control over the
reference of matters to its committees, for
when that is done all members are kept informed of what is going on. I repeat that I
am opposed to this amendment.

MEAT RATIONING, CONSUMPTION,
EXPORT AND PRODUCTION
INQUIRY

On the inquiry by Hon. Mr. McRae:
1. In our ration limitations why was no
increased allowance made for the use of mutton
as compared te beef or pork, as obviously
mutton does not lend itself to being eut up
to provide as much actual meat as either beef
or pork?
2. What is our present annual consumption
per capita in pounds and percentages, of, (a)
beef; (b) pork; (c) mutton aid lamb?
3. Is any mutton exported in carcass to Great
Britain or Europe and, if se, what is the total
so exported since the beginning of the war?
4. What steps, if any, are being taken to avoid
this Fall the large surplus of mutton which
existed 1ast Fall?
5. Is mutton being canned for expert? If so,
where is it being canned and what is the contemplated volume likely to be required,?
6. What is the prevailing price (on foot) at
point of canning for sheep bought for canning
purposes?

115

OCTOBER 24, 1945
7. What was the estimated anmber of sheep
in Canada in 1944 and how does this compare
with the number of sheep in Canada as shown
by the first census following Confederation?
8. Liver being a constituent part of UNRRA's
canned meat preparation, bas any firm or
individual in Canada holding a contract to
provide same had to discontinue, even temporarily, on 'account of inability to obtain the
necessary liver? If so, when and where?
9. Have arrangements been made for canning
horse meat for export to Europe? If so, to what
ccuntry is this horse meat product exported?
10. Where is this horse meat being canned?
11. What is the contemplated production of
canned horse meat?
12. What price is paid for horses at point
of canning?
13. Why do we continue to sell excessively fat
pork on the local market when the private purchaser bas no facilities for rendering the same
and conserving the fat?
14. Is any effort being made to conserve this
excessive fat through existing rendering facilities, with a view to increased shipment of fats
to Europe?
Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON: I
should like to say to the honourable senator
from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae) that I
have been endeavouring to secure an answer
to his inquiry. Part of it involves the Department of Agriculture, and I am advised that
the Deputy Minister is attending the Conference of the Food and Agriculture organization
at- Quebec. He is expected back shortly, and
on his return I will do my utmost to expedite
the answer.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: I appreciate the
explanation of the honourable leader of the
House. I had feared the Senate was again
going to meet with delay in securing answers
to inquiries by honourable members. My
inquiry can be answered by reference to statistics and information readily available to
the Government. I take this opportunity of
expressing the hope that in future inquiries
will be answered more promptly than they
have been during the past few years.
DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL HEALTH
AND WELFARE BILL
SECOND

READING

ROBERTSON
McL.
WISHART
Hon.
moved the second reading of Bill 9, an Act
to amend the Department of National Health
and Welfare Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to correct a typographical error
by the substitution of the word "eight" for
the word "nine". I am advised that though
the change is retroactive to October, 1944, it
does not in any way affect the rights of
individuals.

Hon. Mr. LEGER: Is the change made
retroactive because of that error alone, or
was the Act already in force?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It will be retroactive to the time the Act was originally
passed.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: The retroactive part
has reference only to the change from nine
to eight?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

That is right.

Hon. Mr, CALDER: May I inquire as to
what the eight and the nine apply to? It
might be very important.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: This is the
explanation which the Minister gave in the
other House:
It is designed to correct a typographical
error which appeared in the bill and Act as
passed in 1944. This measure would substitute
for the word "nine" the word "eight" in the
reference to the Act setting up the Department
of Veterans Affairs.
Upon inquiry I found that the error occurred
through one of the sections of the bill which
intends to establish the Department of Veterans
Affairs having been struck out when in comnittee, and the persons responsible'for proofreading, or doing whatever was necessary, not
having observed this error in printing the
bill. The bill is designed purely to correct
that error.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: We do not know yet
what the error is.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I would suggest
to honourable senators that the bill be referred
to committee, where an explanation could be
given on the point brought up by my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: All right.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
CAPITAL REVISION BILL
SECOND READING

WISHART McL. ROBERTSON
Hon.
moved the second reading of Bill 11, an Act
to amend the Canadian National Railways
Capital Revision Act, 1937.
He said: Honourable senators, Section 12
of the Canadian National Railways Capital
Revision Act, 1937, incorporated the Canadian National Railways Securities Trust, and

116

SENATE
SENATE

appointed the trustees thercof. Three of these
trustees are deputy ministers and the other
two are officers of the railway. The trustees
nanied in the Act are the Deputy Minister of
Finance, who is Chiairman, the Deputy Minister of Transport, the Deputy Minister of
Justice, the Chairman of the Board of Dircctors cf tie National Railîvayes and the VicePresident of Finance of the National Railways.
In a reorganization folicwing- the recent retirement of flie Vice-President of Finance, there
were set up two positions, one. being that of
Vice-President and Treasurer, îxhicb is occupied by Mr. C. D. Cowin, and the other that
of Vice-Pre.sident and Coîuptroiier, whicb is
occupied by Mr. T. H. Cooper. Thus the.
actuial titie of Vice-Prcsident of Finance bas
dis.ippcarcd from the organization, and it is
riecccszary to amend the Act accordingly.
in order that future changes. in tht. ciganization may not necessitate furthcr amiendments to the Act, it bas been considercd desirable to provide that the two railway officers
to net as trustees bc those appointed from
time to time by resolution of the Board cf
Directors of the National Railwavs. andl that
in the rcsolution thcy ho named radiber than
designated by titie.
Opportunity has beeîî taken at the. saine
tinie to rernove a tecchnieail defeet iu the

Department of Justice questioned whether the
section did not refer to the actuai persons
holding office in 1937. The amendment makes
(it.'i
thiat the. reference is to persons who
beld the respective offices from time to tirne.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Honourable senators, I
arn afraid the bill gocs a littie further than
indicated by the honourable leader. Ileretofore Parliament bas designated certain pi rsons
as trustees, but t'lis measure delegates to a
board of directors the power to make these
appointments. Tbere is a distinct difference in
.principle.

truistees, which power Parliament itseif exeer-ised in the past.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Does the honourabie

OCTOBER 24, 1945
, The Act provides that the Securities Trust
shall not sell, pledge, release or otherwise dispose of any of the indebtedness transferred to
it or the collater-al securities in respect thereof,
except with the approval of the Governor in
Council.
No portion of the loans made to the railway
system for capital purposes prior to 1937 was
cancelled. The Act provided that the initial
stated value of the capital stock of the trust
was te be the .amount of such loans and that
such capital stock should be owned directly by
the Dominion.
Generally speaking, it might be said that the
share value of the Securities Trust represents
the capital investment or book equity of the
Dominion in the National Railways system other
tnan the position of the Dominion in respect
te the railways for interest-bearing advances.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Why is it that the
debtor is permitted to name from time to time
the trustees of the property of the creditor?
It is unsound.
Two of the trustees.

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN:

Government Railways. Prior to the establishment of the present Canadian National System they made an investigation of the Grand
Trunk and the Grand Trunk Pacifie, and in
1923 worked on the consolidation of the
accounts of the present National System.
Since that time, with the exception of the
year 1935, they have been auditors of the
National System.

The proposed committee is composed of
eleven distinguished legal gentlemen and seven
laymen. That is all right, considering wliat is
to he discussed. But I understood that a
di.,tinguished senator from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. Farris) when he was present last week
said lie would not he back in the House for a
considerable time. I would suggest therefore
that the Senate add to the comnittec another
distinguislsed senator recently appointed frocm
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. MeGeer).
I want to suggest also, since some of us
are not lawyers, that there should he a
stenographic report of the entire proceedings
before the committee, so that the uninitiated
and uninforned among us may learn a little
more about the subject, perhaps, than we know
at this time.
I desire to direct the attention of hionourable senators to an article which appeared in
Liberty of May 26, 1945. It is pretty lengthy
and I shall net attempt to read it in full,
but I do want to place before the Senate
the first paragraph. The article is by Harold
Dingman and is headed:
Used-Car Racket. Millions are being made
by crooked dealers. The black market is still
a rising market, mocking the law with an
immunity guaranteed by the publie.

INCOME AND EXCESS PROFITS
TAXATION
MOTION ADOPTED
The Senate resumed froi yesterday the
debate on the motion of Hon. Mr. Campbell:
That a Special Committee of the Senate be
appointed to examine isto the provisions and
workings of the Income War Tax Act and the
Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940, and to forinulate
recommendations for the improvemîent, clarification and simplification of the methods of
assessment and collection of taxes thereunder
and to report thereon;
2. That the said Comimittee be conposed of
the Honourable Senators Aseltine, Beauregard,
Bench, Buchanan, Campbell, Crerar. Euler,
Farris, Haig, Hayden, Hugessen, Lambert,
Léger, MeRae, Moraud, Robertson, Sinclair,
and Vien;
3. That the said Committe shall have authority to send for persons, papers and records.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: If His Honour will
wait till I get tlrough, I think he will find
it is distinctly in lino with what the committee
is to consider. If he is going to decide otherwise before I get to the part I have in mind,
I suppose I must accept his decision. In
other words, we are not going to have a
decent consideration of the things that the
committee is to consider.

Hon. JAMES MURDOCK:
Honourable
senators, I am not going to take up very much
time in discussing this motion. I am heartily
in favour of it. Last night I could have
completed what I had to say in a few moments,
but I wanted the mover of the motion (Hon.
Mr. Campbell) to hear me.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Your Honour, this
is one of the things distinctly in line with this
motion, as I understand it. There was a
particular reason why I wanted to read the
first paragraph of this article.
Of course,
ordinary senators and others are to be shut
off when they get into a discussion of any-

Hon. Mr. HAIG.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Order, please.
Honourable senators, I do not think that the
matter now being referred to is in line with
th motion before the Senate.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: There will he
an opportunity for the honourable gentleman to discuss this matter at the proper time.
I think the article has nothing to do with the
motion before the House.
The honourable
Hon. Mr. HOWARD:
gentleman can bring up the matter in committee.

thing that might be embarrassing to the
grafter and the greody man; but 1 wanted to
place this before the flouseHon. Mr. VIEN: Honourable senators, I
rise to a point of order. We have before
us a motion that a certain subi ect ho referred
to a committee, and the Chair bas ruled that
the remarks of the honourable senator from
Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) are out of
order. That ruling can ho made the subj oct
of an appeal to the flouse, but it cannot ho
discussod. I do no't believe it is in keeping
with the dignity of the Sonate to suggest that
honourable senators are being shut off
unfairly. from reasonable discussion. That i,
my point of order.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: "The wicked fiee
whien no man pursueth." Ail right, Your
Honour, I bow to your ruling. But I ask honourablo senators to read this article and thon
decido who is the "nationally known senator"
roferred to in the paragraph I quoted. At a
committoe meeting early in the session 1
referred to this articleThe Hon. the SPEAKER: Will my honourablo friend please desist?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I am apologizing
to a distinguished senator, if you wilI lot me.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: No; you are
continuing to discuss the same subj oct. Permit me to say that it is ont of order to do
so, and I have so ruled.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I beg your pardon.
I wanted to apologize to a senator.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The paragraph
that the honourable gentleman read doos not
specifically name any senator. That is one
roason why I think it improper to read the
article in the Sonate. There is an implication
that should not ho allowed t.o go on our
records.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: If you will pardon
me, 1 want to say that at a committee meeting in the first days of the session 1 suggested
that my distinguished friend from Rougemont
(Hon. Mr. Beauregard) was the "nationally
known senator" referred to in this article. I
want to apologize to him now, because
information before me in the files bore is
that ho was not in any way connected with
any mattor of this kind.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:

I have a botter

idea now than I had befoie

as to who is

responsible.

119

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I should liko to
point out to the honourable gentleman from
Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) that the paragraph ho read cast an aspersion upon some
honourable member of this flouse, and since
ho bas suggested that honourable members
read the article for themselves I would ask
him if ho will acquiesce in the deletion of
that paragraph from our records.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Sure I wiIi. I only
wanted to request that we have a stenographic
report of what this committeo doos when it
meets, and to offer an apology to my friend
the honourable sonator from Rougemont.
Hon. Mr. BEAUREGA RD: 1 thank my
honourable friend for the apology ho bas
made, insofar as it concerns me.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators,
referring to the point raised by the honourable senator from Saint John (Hon. Mr.
Foster), as I understand the rule, when the
Committee reports a bill without amendment,
it can be read the third time. It is only when
there tas been an amendment that it cannot
be read the third time without the consent
of the House.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That is what is
being donc in this case.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I want it to be clear. The
honourable senator suggested that the bill
could not be read a third time. I now raise
the point that when a bill comes back just
as it went out it can receive third reading
that same day.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Honourable senators,
according to the rule there should be an
interval of at least one day between the presentation of a committee's report on a bill
and the motion for third reading. However,
it has become the practice to waive that rule
by unanimous consent when a committee
reports a bill without amendment.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: I tave not a copy of
the Senate Rules before me, but I know
ttere is a rule which says that a private bill
cannot be read a third time on the same
day that the bill is reported from committee.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
bill be read the third time?

The honourable senator from Saint John
(Hon. Mr. Foster) drew attention to rule 129,

honourable leader of the Government (Hon.

UNITED NATIONS CHARTER
RESOLUTION OF APPROVAL

Hon.
WISHART
McL. ROBERTSON
moved:
That it is expedient that the Houses of
Parliament dû approve the Agreement estfblishing the United Nations and constituting the
Charter of the United Nations and the Statute
of the Internaional Court of Justice signed at
San Francisco on June 26, 1945, andThat this House do approve of tic same.
He said: Honourable senators, before dealing
specifically with the subject-matter of this
resolution, I would make two general observations. First, it is desirafble that whatever action
honourable members decide to take in this
matter should be taken before we adjourn
this week. With this in mind, I would suggest that if at 6 o'clock the debate is not concluded we should resume at 8 o'clock rather
than tomorrow, in order that the Senate may
adjourn this evening.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Until when?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Until Tuesday
evening. I may add that, in view of the
increasing pressure of work, our future weekend adjournments will be only until Monday
evening.
On October 10th I said it was desirable that
Parliament should pass a resolution concurring
in the charter of the United Nations, so tha-t
it could be signed and ratified in London
before the end of October. I should have said
that concurrence was desirable so that the
charter may be signed by His Majesty the
King, to be deposited in Washington before
the end of October.
I intend to speak but briefly on this motion;
then I shall follow the practice of my predecessor and avail myself of the unquestioned
talent and ability of honourable members
behind me by asking them to take part of my
responsibility. In the present instance I have
asked the honourable senator from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) to assist me, for I am
confident that he is in a better position than
I am to discuss the charter of the United
Nations in all its detail.
The charter of the United Nations as it has
emerged from the San Francisco conference
is a great improvement on the Dumbarton
Oaks proposals, which formed the basis for
discussion in the conference at San Francisco.
It breathes an aitogether more liberal spirit
and contains a number of important new
provisions resulting from the work of the
conference. .
Among the outstanding changes introduced
into the charter at San Francisco are the
following:

[22

SENATE

1. A preamble now introduces -the charter,
and in simple language gives expression to
the motives which have inspired the peoples of
the United Nations to come together to set
up an international organization.
2. The purposes and principles of the organizationave been expanded. They now include
a statement to the effect that the organization
shall seek to achieve international co-operation
"in promoting and encouraging respect for
human rights and for fundamental freedoms
for all without distinction as to race, sex.
language or religion".
3. The functions of the General Assembly
have been widened so that that body occupies
a central position in the organization. The
Assembly has broad powers of discussion. but
at the same time possesses the right to initiate
studies and to make recommendations for the
purpose of promoting international co-operatien. It may well come to be regarded by al
the nations as the forum in which their interests can be effectively presented and promoted.
This is fully in accordance with the policy
pursued by the Canadian delegation at San
Francisco, which was that the powers of the
General Assembly should be as wide as possible, but that the responsibility for ser ing
disputes between states nust be put squarely
on the shoulders of the Security Council.
4. Both the wide powers given to the Security
Council and the special position of the Great
Powers on the Council, which formed an outstanding feature of the Dumbarton Oaks plan,
were retained in the United Nations charter.
The overriding necessity for unity of action
among the Great Powers led to the setting up
of a Security Council charged with "primary
responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security." It is the purpose
of the Security Council to achieve the peaceful
solution of international disagreements, and
only as a last resort to apply economic and
armed force.
The adoption of the so-called "Yalta voting
formula" produced some of the outstanding
debates of the conference at San Francisco.
Under that voting formula any one permanent
member of the Security Council has wide
powers of veto over the many activities of the
organization which depend upon decisions
taken in the Security Council. Many of the
middle and smaller states at San Francisco,
while prepared to admit the necessity for the
unanimity of the Great Powers in applying
coercive measures for the maintenance Of
peace, were opposed to many other aspects of
the veto power. After long debate the Yalta
voting formula was adopted by the conference.
The attitude of the Canadian delegation
throughout the controversy was that these very
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

extensive veto powers were undesirable. However, it was cleably recognized by the Canadian
delegation that this voting formula represented the greatest possible ineasure of agreement which could be attained among the Great
Powers at this time. The Canadian delegation
therefore felt that the price was not too high
for a world organization which promised so
nuch in other respects. They therefore did
not oppoe- the final adoption of the Yalta
voting formula.
5. The Canadian delegation pressed strongly
at the San Francisco Conference for the adoption of some qualifying rules for election to
the Sccurity Council whici would recognize
the functional principle in the election of
menibers, so that among the six non-permanont nembers of the Council there should be
several states wiich could make a really substantial contribution to the purposes of tIhe
organization. As a result an amendment was
intrcduced which now finds ifs place as the
final phrase of the first paragraph of Article
23 of the Charter. It states that in the electien of non-permanent members of the
Security Council due regard should be
"specially paid, in the first instance to the
contribution of Members of the United Nations to the maintenance of international
peace and sccurity, and to the other Purposes of the Organization, and also to equitable goographical distribution".
6. An important Canadian amendment is
inceorporated in Article 44 of the Charter. This
Article ensures that when the contribution of
a state's armed forces to peace enforcement
action is under consideration by the Security
Council, any member of the United Nations,
even though not a member of the Security
Council, should have the rigbt to sit and vote
as a member in the decisions concerning the
emruployment of its own forces.
7. The Canadian delegation played an important part in the discussions concerning the
Economic and Social Council. Canada will
no doubt have an outstanding contribution te
nake to the work of the organization in the
economic and social sphere. it was therefore
a source of satisfaction to the Canadian delegation that the Economie and Social Council
emerged from the Conference at San Francisco
as one of the most important organs of the
United Nations organization.
8. Amendmrents-The Canadian delegation
at San Francisco, together with many other
delegations, tried to ensure that the amendoutlined in the Charter
ment procedure
should not be too rigid. They were not, however, entirelv successful in securing a flexible

OCTOBER 25, 1945
amendment procedure, and under the Charter
as adopted each of the five Great Powers
possesses -the right to veto the coming into
force of any amendment.
It was the general view of the Canadian
delegation at the conference that the charter,
while it contains imperfections, represents a
great step forward in the direction of international co-operation and is a foundation upon
which the structure of peace can be built,
provided there is a continuing will to peace
among the nations of the world.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
The Hon. the Speaker left the Chair.
Hon. Thomas Vien in the Chair.
Hon. J. H. KING (Speaker): Honourable
senatorsSome Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. KING: -as one of the members
from this Chamber who had the honour to
represent the Parliament of Canada at San
Francisco, I feel it incumbent upon me to
give a brief review of events at the Conference, as they appeared to me.
We are to-day concluding our deliberations
on one of the most difficult matters that has
ever come before the Canadian Parliament,
and it is interesting to observe that fortyseven nations are concerned in the subject
.under consideration.
The invitation came to us last April, and
with it came a formula with respect to which
we had an opportunity to become familiar.
Not only was it your delegates to San Francisco who had an opportunity of being advised
of matters to be brought before the conference, but members of this Chamber and of
the House of Commons were able to consider
the proposals suggested by the four great
powers.
While attending the conference I listened
to probably all the leaders from the various
states who spoke to the plenary session, as
they voiced the views and desires of the
countries they represented, and stated the
reasons why they had accepted the invitation
to come to San Francisco and take part in
that great international gathering.
We in Canada were represented by a group
chosen under unusual conditions. Because the
Nineteenth Parliament was expiring a special
session was called, and from the House of
Commons a group was selected which included
the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, the
lady member from Edmonton, the leader of
the Progressive Conservative Party, and the
leader of the C.C.F. Party. 1, with my hon-

123

ourable friend from La Salle, (Hon. Mr.
Moraud) shared the honour of representing
this Chamber.
The conference proceeded very much along
the lines usually followed by conventions in
this country. At the plenary sessions the
leaders of the various national groups expressed their views, but the detail work in
relation to the various phases of the charter
was done in committees. Four committees
were entrusted with the consideration and
revision of the sections of the charter. I do
not intend to go at length into what was
done by these committees over a period of
eight weeks; I merely wish to indicate that
they were at work morning, afternoon and
evening, six days a week.
Each and every phase of the charter received
thorough consideration; yet the amendments
made had to do chiefly with phraseology, so
that the principles of the charter as explained
to us last session were pretty well retained.
In general the changes clarified and liberalized
many of the clauses. There was a long debate
on the principles set forth in the first chapter
of the proposals for the establishment of the
United Nations, and Field Marshal Smuts
had much to do with the liberal expression
found in the charter as it now stands.
The ehoice of San Francisco as the seat of
the conference was, I think, another demonstration of how the mind of the late Presiden.t
Roosevelt worked when he was dealing with
matters of great public interest. San Franeisco
is not only a very beautiful city, but it had
the advantage of being almost midway between
the then existing theatres of war, and thus was
secure from danger by enemy action.
As we know, nearly all the nations of the
world except the aggressors were represented
at the conference, and sooner or later became
members of the International Organization.
That important fact is one that I think we
should keep in our minds today, because at
the conference the great body of world public
opinion was represented by accredited delegates
of those nations. In that respect the conference differed from any previous world peace
conference, and world public opinion will be
a great factor in the possibilities of success.
There is no doubt that Mr. Churchill and
the late President Roosevelt felt it desirable
that the conference, should take place before
the cessation of hostilities. Unquestionably
the delegates were impressed wiâh the fact
that they had nothing to do with the making
of peace terms; but I am afraid that the
people in general have not as clear an under.
standing of this. Certain complaints that we

SENATE
hear from time to time and read of in magazine articles are based on a misconception as
to the objects and purposes of the conference.
I have already referred to San Francisco as
a city of great beauty. It is also, as honourable senators are aware, a city possessing many
advantages for the holding of a large gathering.
To my knowledge no other city on the
American continent has a larger number of
excellent hotels. The United States Government was host to this international assembly,
and I wish to state that everything humanly
possible was done to see that the delegates
were comfortably billeted and accommodated.
We of the Canadian delegation had our suite
on the sixth and seventh floors of the St.
Francis Hotel. Also in that hotel were large
delegations from Russia and from Central and
South America. Similarly, the representatives
of the other nations were billeted in other
hotels. That arrangement made it possible
for delegates of the various nations to meet
one another at breakfast, luncheon and d'inner,
instead of only at business sessions. One other
matter, of perhaps relatively small importance,
to which I should like to refer, just to give an
idea of how thorough were the facilities for
our convenience, is this: within two days after
our arrival there was distributed a good-sized
telephone directory containing the name of
every d.elegate. If you wanted to get in touch
with a certain delegate from England or
Australia or anywhere c4, all you had to do
was to look him up in the directory and ring
his number.
I also wish to state that there was the
utmost co-oporation among the members of
the Canadian delegation itself. I doubt if
this or any other country was ever represented
by a group of persons who carried out their
duties in greater good faith and harmony.
Unfortunately, beeause of the election campaign then going on in Canada, the Prime
Minister, the acting leader of the ProgressiveConservative Party and the leader of the
C.C.F. Party were not able to remain until
the end of the Conference. To the representatives of . the Department of External
Affairs and of other departments, who accompanied our delegation, I wish te pay tribute.
They were the equal of the advisers froin any
other country. The Canadian secretarial staff
also merits the highest commendation.
It
was over-worked, but efficient.
We bave
reason to be proud too of the Canadian
journalists at the conference. The Press of this
country was represented there by a particularly brilliant corps of men and women. Members of the Press were not admitted to conmittee meetings, but every day they were
given an outline of actual and proposed activiHon. Mr. KING

fies. To their credit it should be said that
our journalists did net anticipate any decisions, yet they were able to make their reports
interesting and comprehensive.
The work of the convention was carried on
in the Civic Centre, a memorial of the last
war. In it is situated the magnificent Civic
Opera House, capable of seating 4,000 people.
All plenary sessions were held in this building.
In the adjoining Veterans Building most
excellent accommodation was found for the
various committees.
The city bas a large number of beautiful
homes and clubs, many of which were made
available to the assembled delegates, and as
one of the Canadian delegates, I wish to
express my thanks to His Excellency the
Governor of the State of California and the
people of California-particularly His Worship
the Mayor of San Francisco, his Council and
the citizens of San Francisco-for their gracious and kind hospitality.
Once or twice during the conference there
were reports of a deadlock, and on several
occasions the proceedings reached a stage
when it seemed doubtful whether any further
progress could be made. This happened on
tho question of the veto, and the threatened
decadlock caused us great concern. We found
îiit the four Great Powers, which were undertaking through their armed might to give
security te the rest of the world, would net
surrender their rights in this regard. Their
attitude was much the same as that presented
to us in this Chamber by my colleague the
junior senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr.
Farris), who, in a remarkable speech addressed
to us in April last, contendod that although
we might attempt to eliminate the veto power,
the great nations in their might and power
would, if occasion arose, exercise that power
on their own initiative.
In sorne matters the conference modified
its viewpoint, as by the acceptance of an
amendment fathered by the Canadian delegation to the effect that if a nation had agreed
with the Security Council to supply armed
forces and other war requirements it would,
in the event of hostilities, have the right to go
before the Security Council and discuss not
only the strength of the support that it might
be required to give, but also how such force
could be best utilized. In this amendment we
were supported by the American and the British delegations, and eventually it was adopted.
Our delegation proposed that, say at the end
of ten years, in the light of experience gained
during that time, the charter might be subject
to amendment. This caused some controversy
and lengthy discussion. It was eventually
agreed by the four Great Powers that the

OCTOBER 25, 1945
vote required of the General Assembly to convene any conference should be reduced from
three-quarters to two-thirds, and that the conference, if it had not been held before the
tenth session of the General Assembly, could
be reconvened by a majority vote of the Genral Assembly, with the concurrence of any
seven members of the Security Council. Furthermore, the ratification provisions were
modified to make them identical with those
covering ordinary amendments under article
108.
The Canadian delegation was helpful in obtaining these important modifications, and
undoubtedly they improved the charter now
before us.
The honourable leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) has just given us in
brief the important amendments to the
charter, with which, as I have already stated,
the Canadian delegation had a great deal
to do. I think, therefore, it would be futile
for me to attempt to supplement his remarks,
particularly as the Minister of Justice and
Mr. Coldwell and Mr. Graydon appeared
before our External Relations Committee this
morning and gave us a very clear explanation
of the charter and what it might be expected
to accomplish.
I should, however, add that there has been
a tendency on the part of some people -to
regard the meeting at San Francisco as being
for the purpose of making the terms for the
peace treaties now under considýeration by the
United Nations. Of course any such purpose
was absolutely foreign to the conference, for
it was definitely understood that it would not
concern itself wi.th such treaties The work
of the conference of the United Nations will
be in the years to come, after the peace terms
have been arranged, of a character to prevent
future wars and, to assure that under the
charter certain bodies will be set up. One of
these is the Security Council, which is composed of the five Great Powers-the United
States, Great Britain, Russia, France and
China-and six members from the Assembly.
These five nations have, with the support of
other nations of the world, undertaken to see
that armed conflict does not take place.
Another body to be set up will be the
General Assembly. Its work will be international in character. Through conferences, ,it
will try to bring about a better understanding
between the nations, and it will formulate
policies for adoption by the consenting nations
to bring about better international relationships. In this they will be assisted by what,
to my mind, is one of the most important

125

committees-the Committee on Economic and
Social Welfare. The scope of this committee
will be wide and comprehensive. Its studies
will be reported to the General Assembly, and
no doubt will influence that body as well as
the Security Council. Its work will have an
influence on the international policy which
will eventually be formulated by the Assembly, which will, I hope, as time goes on,
assume the character of an international
parliament.
The Court of International Justice follows
largely the practice laid down by the League
of Nations. Great care was taken in setting
up the formula for this court. The legal representatives of the various nations spent
some days in Washington building up a plan
for an International Court of Justice that
would best serve the world. A few amendments were made in the final draft, but generally the work of this committee was accepted.
There have always been and I suppose there
always will be doubting Thomases in the
world, and they may serve a useful purpose
in stimulating the enthusiasm of those who
believe in a world in which, eventually, war
shall be outlawed. We should not be discouraged' by the speeches and articles in our magazines and newspapers in which these doubting
Thomases express their scepticism of the usefulness of the San Francisco conference. Those
who attended the conference realize that there
is a long, hard road ahead; but they believe

that if security can be maintained over a
period of years the principles of fair play and
justice between nations will be applied as a
matter of course, as they are in the laws of
the various nations. Our hope that social
progress will be achieved by the nations of
the world, and 'that respect for international
law and order will gradually emerge, will be
realized if we support the work of the conference. With this goal in view, Canada should
dedicate herself to the principles laid down
in the charter, and to the fullest extent of
her power assist in the application of those
principles to world affairs.
In closing I should like to mention something that struck me very forcibly. There were
two official languages at the conference, French
and English, and it was amazing to find men
from Liberia speaking both languages
extremely well. Surely, with our two languages
in Canada, this should be an incentive to our
English-speaking boys and girls to learn
French and our French-speaking boys and
girls to learn English, and thus be in a better
position to understand one another and to
acquire a still better knowledge of international affairs.

126

SENATE

Canada has attained international stature,
and has her own place among the nations of
the world. An honourable senator some time
ago expressed the hope that her delegates
would not throw their weight around at San
Francisco. There was no occasion to do so.
As the representatives of Canada, our delegates
were consulted by the representatives of many
of the smaller nations, and it was very pleasing to me to see that our standing was so high
among the nations of the world. In the years
to come Canada's place will be increasingly
important, and if the present generation and
the children now growing up are wise enough
to become equally versatile in our two
languages, I feel confident that in international
affairs the people of this country will be
greatly benefited.
It is my earnest hope and desire that the
great nations will bring about a just peace,
and that the principles laid down at the San
Francisco conference will be applied to world
conditions, thus bringing about a state of
world peace that today is the dominant
thought of all mankind.
The Hon. the Speaker resumed the Chair.
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN: Honourable
senators, I think the first word of anyone rising
to take part in this discussion should be one
of admiration for the part which Canada
played at San Francisco. I will go further, and
say that that admiration should extend to the
work accomplished by every one of the delegates we sent to that conference.
I should like to refer particularly to the
two delegates from our own Chamber, His
Honour the Speaker and the honourable senator from Quebec (Hon. Mr. Moraud), and,
for the benefit of those who did not attend
the meeting of the Committee on External
Affairs, presided over by my honourable
friend from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae)
this morning, to recall the words of the
Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Graydon, as
to the great part which the two members
from the Senate played in the deliberations
at San Francisco.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: As honourable
senators know, the delegation which we sent
to San Francisco was not a party delegation,
and it approached the problem of representing
Canada there in a truly national spirit. Moreover, as the Leader and His Honour the
Speaker pointed out, the Canadian delegates
took considerable part in drafting and improving the document which had originally been
laid before us in the- form of the Dumbarton
Oaks resolutions. The charter of the United
Hon. Mr. KING.

Nations, the instrument which we are now
asked to approve, is the result of the efforts
of our own and other delegations.
I do not propose, honourable senators, to
deal with the details of this document; it is
one which you have all read and with which,
in general, you are familiar. However, I do
wish to discuss its general purpose and spirit,
feeling that "the letter killeth but the spirit
giveth life." I think it is quite clear, as has
been said by honourable senators who have
preceded me, that if the peoples of the world
are willing to work together for peace and
security in the spirit of this charter all will
be well, and we may achieve that which we
most arden'tly desire; but if not, the most
perfect paper constitution will be valueless
and will go very rapidly down into the limbo
of forgotten things.
In that connection I think it is well worth
while for us to consider the atmosphere in
which this charter was worked out at San
Francisco. As was indicated by His Honour
the Speaker, it represents a serious attempt
at collaboration by many nations, following
difficult and tedious negotiations lasting week
after week and almost month after month.
His Honour the Speaker remarked that it is
common knowledge that there were many
hitehes; that at times one was almost led to
despair of agreement ever being achieved. The
important point is that agreement was ultimately achieved; and the document before us
is the result of joint effort, of the thoughts and
brains of the best men of fifty nations, meeting in the shadow of the greatest catastrophe
the world bas ever known in an attempt to
prevent the recurrence of such a catastrophe
in the future.
It is obvious that this document is not perfect; but after all, when we say that it is not
perfect, surely that is another way of saying
that it is human. It is not perfect, but it
does represent an accurate measure of the
distance which, at this juncture in human
history, the great powers of the world and
associated nations are ready to go together
along the road of peace.
I think we might very well compare the
circumstances surrounding the creation of this
charter with those surrounding the creation
of the League of Nations. The League of
Nations was born in the midst of the Peace
Conference of Versailles. It was, one might
say, superimposed on the Peace Treaty of
Versailles. It was the product of a few brilliant minds, and was accepted without much
thought or discussion by the remaining statesmen at Versailles. However that may be, it is
perbaps not too much to say that the covenant

OCTOBER 25, 1945
of the League of Nations was for that roason
a littie ton idenlistic-which of course constitutos ne criticism of it. I think it is perfectiy clear that the statesmen of Versailles
did not give the samne careful and meticulous
consideration te the League of Nations covenant that lias been given to, every paragraph,
overy line, every syllable almost, of the
document now before us. Thereforo, I think
the Ulnited Nations charter is probably more
realistic, more practical, or, as we lawyers
say, more viable-it is more able to sustain
life thýan the covenant of the Loague cf Nations
proved to be.
I should like to instance one or two
examples of what I mean when I say this
document is more practical. In the first place,
as I have already said, it was ontered into
aftor minute inquiry, exhausting discussion
and a full knowledge by the mombers of the
nations taking part in it of ail the respensibilitios involved. Socondly, it recognizes that
in order te maintain world pence the basic
and practical requirement is that the groat
and powerful nations must work together;
and must, in the last analysis, enforce peece
together, by arma if necessary. Thirdly, it
sets up machinery by which, in the case of
aggression, armed force cen promptly be
brought te bear-a General Staff Committee,
and agreements te ho made betwoen the
Security Council and varioes nations providing for the furnishing of ýarmed force by
those nations as and when required. Fourthly,
and I think this is very important, it ackowledges that erganization on a political level
alone, ne matter how streng, cannot. in
itseif .provide alI the conditions that are necessary for a world peace.
The Versailles Treaty did net recognize that
dosideratum sufficiently well; almost the
entire empha.is wes on the political erganization of the Longue. It is true the Treaty
of Versailles did set up the International
Labour Office, an organizetien which has9 done
a great deul of excellent work in its particular field in the lest twenty-five years;
but generally speaking, I think it cen be said,
that the League ef Nations did nGt pay sufficient attention te the social and ecenemic
preblems which semetimes lie et the reet of
war. Now I thînk it is important also, when
we consider what the League ef Natiens did,
te realize that its best work was performed in
fields other than these of higli politics; that
is, in those parts of social and economnic fields
ever which it h.ad jurisdiction-for instance, in
such matters as the prevention of the white
slave treffic, the centrol of narcotic drugs and
dealing with refugees in varieus lEuropean
countnies. I repeat, the field allotted te the

127

Leàgue of Nations was flot broad enough to
give jurisdiction over ail those- spheres of
human endeavour in wvhich you may find the
seeds of war.
The framers of the United Nations Charter
have avoided that mistake. They have recognized that the seeds of war can be found in
human misery, in insufficient nutrition or in
erroneous or selfish national, fiscal, economnic
nnd monetary policies, ju.st as much as in the
territorial ambitions of a ruler or in the infiated ego of a nation or race.
How right thoy arc!1 Lot us consider for a
few minutes the origin of the late war. The
train. of oircumstances which, amongst others,
caused the war was the great inflation in the
United States followed by the oconomic
collapse in 1929; the forcing of Great Britain
off the gold standard in 1931, which was
followod by the collapso of the Credit Anstait
in Vienne in the ane year, and finally, as a
direct resuit, the droadful unomployment and
misery in Europe. Thoso were the things
which gave a Hitler his chance of power.
The Economie and Social Council, an intograi part of this strong international body, is
cherged with the responsibility of dealing with
problems such as 1 have enumerated, and of
contending with themn directly or indirectly
th'rough other international bodies which have
beon or are being set up to cover particular
Some
aspects of international well-boing.
examples of those bodies which corne to my
mind are, the International Labour Office, of
which 1 spoke a few moments ago; the Bank
for International Settlements and International
Credit Funds, which are to bo evolved out of
the Bretton Woods Agreement of 1M3; theý
Food and Agriculture ohrganization, now holding its first meetings in Quoboc; and the international Civil Aviation organization which has
just been set up with its head office in
Montreal.
To summarize this branch of my reinarks,
I think it may be said, without ton much
optimnism, that we have hère on paper a
world organization whicha is set up on a more
solid and realistic hasis than the Loague of
Nations. I emphasize that it is on paper, hocauses what matters no-w is flot this paper
document itself-great as wes the achievement
of making it-but the will and spirit of the
nations of the world to, make it work. You
mey draft the meat elaborate and admirable
paper constitutions, but if the spirit to work
them is absent they wiIl absolutely feul. I have
in mmnd two lines'from one of the eighteenth
century poets--Pope, I think it was--which
run like this:
For forme of governmen't let fools contest:
Whate'er is best administer'd is best.

128

SENATE

Honourable senators who remember their
history of the French Revolution will recall
that at a certain period the Constituent
Assembly-known, I think, as La Constituante-appointed one of its members, the Abbé
Siéyès, to draw up a constitution for the
future government of France. Well, he drafted
a number of constitutions, each one better
than the last. In fact, it became a joke among
the people of Paris at that time to say that
if you happened to meet the Abbé Siéyès on
the street he would pull out of his pocket a
new constitution for the government of France.
But, as everybody knows, not one of those
constitutions was ever put. to practical use.
Everyone of them fell into the wastepaper
basket when Napoleon took control of the
country. So I repeat that what we have here
is a paper document which will be valuable if,
and only if, we can translate it into realities;
if we can clothe its bare bones with living
flesh and breathe into it the spirit of life.
And in the last analysis that depends upon
whether the nations which sign the document
can work together to make it effective.
Now I want to direct a few remarks to one
very practical aspect of this problem, an
aspect that is much in the minds of ail of
us to-day. Can we of the western democracies
work hand in hand with Russia te make this
charter effective? That question has been
brought into prominence by the failure a few
days ago of the London Conference of Foreign
Ministers--a failure largely caused, it would
seem, by the fact that Mr. Molotov's outlook
upon and attitude towards the questions under
diseussion there were very different from those
of the foreign ministers of other great powers.
I make no apology for raising this question,
since upon the answer to it depends, to a
great degree, ultimate success or failure of the
Charter of the United Nations. I propose to
discuss the situation calmly and dispassionately, without intending offence to anyone,
because I believe that, treated in that spirit,
it is far better to bring it out into the open
than to let it lurk in the back of our minds,
where it might well breed doubt, suspicion and
distrust.
There is not much doubt that the nations
of the western world, the western democracies,
can work together to make this organization
a success. I mean the United States, the
other countries of the Americas, the nations of
the British Commonwealth, and France. I
;bink the same may be said of China, under
ts great leader Chiang Kai-shek.
When thinking on this question the first
thing to remember is that the system of
government in Russis is entirely different
from our own, and that it works by different
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN.

methods. Russia is not a democracy in the
sense in which we commonly use that term.
Some wise words were said on that subject
in an editorial in the Ottawa Journal of October 3. I take the liberty of reading part of
it te the House:
So much humbug has been talked about
Russia being a "democracy", many are shoeked
at the behaviour of Foreign Commissar Molotov
at the London five-power conference; they
cannot understand why, having taken up a
position, he refuses to compromise by a hair.
The explanation, of course, is that Russia
is not a denocracy, and does not deai in international affairs by democratie methods. lu
London Mr. Bevin is the representative of the
British Government and people, and -Mr. Byrnues
is the representative of the Arnerican Government and people. As representatives, under the
democratic technique and tradition, Bevin ad
Byrnes are free to exercise their individual
judgments within the framework of certain
principles. Mr. Molotov is not a representative:
he is an agent. As an agent-which is far
different from being a representative-he eau
not exercise his own judgment, but must follow
rigidly the line given him by his masters in
the Kremlin. That is what autocracy means,
as distinguished froin demoracy.
Note that the writer of this editorial talks
about autocracy. That in no way implies a
criticism of the Russian form of government.
It is simply a bald statement of fact that the
Russian conception of government differs from
our own, and that this at tines makes mutual
understanding between our two countries difficult to achieve. Now, it might be said that
authoritarian government is indigenous to
Russia. That certainly was the form of government in the times of the czars. But it
should also be pointed out that that form of
government did net prevent the Russia of the
days before the last war from getting on extremely well with France and Great Britain in
the Triple Entente, nor did it prevent cordial and friendly relations of many years'
standing between czarist Russia and the United
States of America.
The chief difference between the authoritarian government of the czars and the -authoritarian government of present-day Russia is
that the latter has a far wider basis of support
among the masses of the people, and that its
great object, in which it has been remarkably
successful, has been to raise the standards of
life and general level of education of its
people. In the mind of everyone there is one
criterion of the success achieved by Soviet
Russia in the short period of twenty-five years.
Compare the heroic and victorious resistance
of the Russia of 1945 with the complete collapse
of the Russia of 1917; and in doing so bear
in mind that the Russia of these two periods
was fighting against the same aggressor nation,
Germany, which was much stronger in the
second war than in the first.

OCTOBER 25, 1945
There is no need for me, honourable senators, to dilate on the magnificent feats of
valour of the Russian armieS from 1942 to
1945. They are a saga of heroism that will
live as long as history remains to be written.
When some people today voice criticism of
Russian actions in Central Europe and express
alarm at ber supposed ambitions there, I
think they are but further examples of the
shortness of human memory. I should like
to ask such persons a very simple question:
Which would you prefer-Russian influence in
Central Europe or the Beast of Belsen and
creatures of his kind? Remember, it was one
or -the other. There was no third choice. If
it had, not been for the Russian armies which
are there today, Hitler and all the unnameable horrors with which his regime is associated would dominate in Europe at this very
moment.
I admit that it will not be easy for us to
reach a final settlement with Russia of all the
immensely intricate questions involved in the
remaking of the continent of Europe, which
is really what it amounts to. It will take a
long time, much negotiation and a great deal
of patience. To people who tell me they are
suspicious of Russia I am inclined to put
these questions: May not Russia, too, at times
be suspicious of us? And bas she not good,
historical reasons for those suspicions? Call
to mind the period of 20 years between the
two great wars, during which the Soviet Union
was treated as a pariah amongst the nations.
Call to mind-I regret to have to mention itthe odious time of appeasement, almost exactly
seven years ago to this very day, when Chamberlain and Daladier combined with Hitler and
Mussolini to exclu-de Russia from the Munich
Conference. Call to mind the apathy and
contempt with which Maxim Litvinoff's
championship of collective security was treated
at Geneva, year after year. Call to mind the
hope publicly expressed by a former member
of the British cabinet, that if there was to be
another war Germany and Russia would fight
one another · o a state of complete mutual
t
exhaustion, when the western world would
walk in and pick up the pieces. Let us cah
to mind all these and many other things, and.
ask ourselves whether we alone have the
right to take a high moral tone and to be
suspicious of the motives of others.
With that background of suspicion on both
sides, and bearing in mind the difference in
outlook and mentality between them, is it to
be wondered at that Russia and the western
powers are finding it not easy to reach agreement on all the tremendously difficult and
complicated problems which the war has left

129

in its wake? Surely it is only logical to
assume that final settlement of all these questions will take lengthy negotiation, much compromise and almost inexhaustible patience.
A great deal of melancholy emphasis has
been laid on the failure of the London Conference of Foreign Ministers, and most gloomy
predictions have been made. I agree that that
failure was most disappointing; but surely
there is something to be said on the other
side. First, let us remember that the fundamental aim of all the United Nations is the
same. That aim can be expressed in two
words-peace and security. Now, peace and
security are every bit as necessary for Russia
as for every one of the other allies, and perhaps even more necessary. How can anyone
in his sober senses suppose that any nation
which has suffered such vast losses, human
and material, as Russia has suffered in the
last four years, losses greater than those of
all the other allies combined, can have in
ber mind any thought of aggression for years
to come?
People talk about aggressive Russian action
in taking over parts of Poland and in trying to
set up along ber western boundaries a series of
friendly states under communist control. I
shall not attempt to justify everything Russia
has done or is doing in Central Europe. For
myself, I have insufficient knowledge of all
the surrounding circumstances to enable me to
form a judgment. But I will say this. All the
steps that Russia is taking are to me an
evidence, not of aggressive designs, but of precisely the reverse. To me they are evidence
of an overwhelming desire for security and for
an opportunity of improving the condition of
her people. Russia has been attacked twiee in
the last twenty-five years by a brutal aggressor from the west. Let us try and put ourselves
in ber place. One of the most difficult feats
a man can try to accomplish is to put himself
into the mind of another. But if Canada had
a long western boundary, difficult to defend,
over which she had been brutally attacked
twice in twenty-five years, ber people massacred, ber economy ruined, and herself almost
brought to complete decay, I suggest to you
that she would be taking exactly the same
steps on her western boundary as Russia is
taking in Central Europe today.
There is another interesting thing that I
think should be said here. What Russia is
attempting to achieve in Central Europe is,
to my mind, a precise counterpart of the proposals of the United States for a chain of
naval bases across the Pacifia and the Atlantic
to protect ber approaches from the sea. It is
of the same nature as the step's taken by

130

SENATE

Britain to retain Gibraltar and Malta and the
Suez Canal in order to protect her vital routes
to the East. It is merely the reverse side of
the same medal. The only difference is that
the United. States and Britain are great naval
powers and need security by sea, whereas
Russia is a great land power and needs security
by land.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Would the honourable
gentleman allow me a question?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Is this policy in keeping
with the fundamental principles of the charter?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Well, it might be
said that the taking over by the United States
of a naval base formerly belonging to some
other power in the far Pacifie was no more in
keeping with the principles of the charter than
are the actions of Russia. I am merely trying
to point out that both nations are seeking
to provide for their security.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Will the honourable senator dilate a little on why in 1939 Russia made
a treaty with Germany, which remained in
force until Germany attacked Russia? Does
that look hopeful for the future?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: That is a difficult
question for me to answer. I am not suggesting that in the period before the war all
the faults were on one side, but I would recall
to my honourable friend's attention the
enumeration that I gave of what Great Britain
did in the period before the war, which in
some ways was just about as bad as the
treaty which Russia negotiated with Germany.
I repeat, peace and security is the aim of
us all. The western democracies may sometimes differ, and differ very sharply, from
Russia on some specific details as to how that
mutual aim is to be achieved; but the mutual
aim is there, and compared with all other
considerations it is of such overwhelming force
that, without being accused of too great optirnism, I think one may believe that in the end
that aim will be achieved.
There is something else which I think has
not been given sufficient attention: that the
western powers and Russia are already
co-operating in many fields of international
endeavour. We hear all these weepings and
lamentations over the failure of the Conference
of Foreign Ministers in London, and to my
mind these tend to obscure from our view
other recent developments, less publicized but
perhaps more favourable. Let me enumerate:
One, yesterday the Soviet union formally
ratified this charter. Two, the preparatory
commission which is set up as an annex to this
charter to arrange the first meeting of the
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN.

Security Council in December, and thereafter
the first meeting of the General Assembly, has
been working fast and harmoniously in London
for several weeks. Three, complete agreement
has been reached on the machinery and the
procedure for the trial of the Nazi war criminals, whieh is about to begin in Nuremberg.
I might say parenthetically that it must have
been quite an achievement to bring together
the entirely different criminal procedures of
countries such as the United States, Great
Britain, France and Soviet Russia, for the
purpose of conducting this trial. Four, the
Food and Agriculture Organization of forty
nations, which is now meeting in Quebec, is
another illustration. A strong Soviet delegation is taking part in the deliberations of
the organization, but unfortunately it is true
that Russia has not yet formally become a
member-nation. Five, to turn to the Far
East, within the last few weeks Russia and
China have signed an agreement covering
the return of Manchuria to China and settling
to their mutual satisfaction all outstanding
matters between them in that area. As an
immediate effect of the agreement the dispute
between the government of Chiang Kai-shek
and the Chinese Communists, which was so
threatening, according to newspaper reports a
week or two ago, seems to be in a fair way
of amicable adjustment.
I agree with honourable senators that anybody who contended that world conditions
as they are today are all for the best in the
best of all possible worlds would be living
in a fool's paradise. I repeat, there are
many difficult questions still to be settled
between the western democracies and Russia.
But there is one point gained-that we and
Russia are willing to sit around a table and
discuss those questions, and that this charter
with its machinery and its organization, its
Security Council, its General Assembly, its
Social and Economie Council, provides what
one might call a permanent international
parliament where such discussions can be
carried on.
I think I should add a word of caution here.
It is no use blinking facts. It is idle to deny
that recently there have been signs of a
tendency on the part of the Russian Government to isolate itself from the other allies and
to take unilateral action without consulting
them. It seems to me that we must do all in
our power by the most friendly means to dissuade Russia from pursuing that tendency.
We must be temperate, forbearing and patient.
But, allow me to add, let us not on this continent assume too lofty a moral tone either,
because that policy of isolation, of withdrawal
from former allies, of living to one's self alone,

13'

OCTOBER 25, 1945

was precisely the policy which was adopted
by the United States of America after the
last war. I think it is only fair to add that
it was a policy which met with approval in
many circles in our own country as well.
Some Hon. SENATORS:
Hon. Mr. HAIG:

Hear, hear.

Unfortunately, too.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I have tried to
deal as temperately and as dispassionately
as I can with the position of Russia as regards this charter and its chances of functioning successfully, because, as I said at the
outset, this is perhaps the greatest question
that faces the world today, and because, as
I also said at the outset, it seems to me far
better to bring it into the open and to lay
our cards on the table than to let it remain
in the background to create suspicion and
distrust.
Now I have a few words to add-and they
shall be very few-about the position of
Canada under this charter, and the attitude
that we should adopt. First of all, I think
we are unanimously agreed that we should
ratify this charter as soon as we possibly can.
But that is not quite enough. I think it is
our duty as public men to try to make it
more widely known to and universally supported by the people, because, as we all know,
no government can go very far beyond what
public opinion will allow. It seems to me
to be necessary for us to build up a body of
public opinion in support of this charter which
will enable our government to undertake
whatever obligations Canada may be called
upon to assume in future years. In that connection I welcome the educational campaign
which the United Nations Society is now
carrying on throughout the country. I believe
it deserves our very widest suppôrt.
Secondly, I think we should make an agreement with the Security Council under chapter
5 as to our supply of armed forces in case of
conflict. That agreement will of course take
a good deal of careful working out; and it
might be well if, following the precedent of
the San Francisco conference, the government
would see to it that our delegation which goes
to make that agreement with the Security
Council is an all-party delegation, such as we
had at San Francisco.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Thirdly, Canada
should do all in its power in all those bodies
in the organization of which we are going to
form a part, to help the big powers to reach
agreement where there is divergence of view

Canada, as bas been said

many times, is in a unique position. Being
a member of the British Commonwealth and
at the same time a North American nation,
we are peculiarly well fitted to interpret
Great Britain to the United States, and vice
versa. I venture to suggest that this position
of international interpreter is perhaps capable
of further extension, and that Canada may in
some degree qualify to act as a mediator and
solvent between Russia and the United States.
There are several reasons for that. We are
known by Russia as well as by every other
country to have no selfish aims. It is known
universally that by reason of our prosperity
depending on export trade peace is a more
important objective to us economically than
to almost any other country in the world.
Then again, physically our country has much
in common with Russia. We are a northern
land, and have the same problems of nature
to contend with; and psychologists will tell
you that men who have to deal with similar
physical problems tend to think alike in other
matters too.
The great development of air navigation at
present, and its inevitable immense extension
in the very near future, have directed attention

strikingly during the -war by the large number
of American aircraft which, manufactured in
factories in California, were flown up to Edmonton and thence to Siberia for the Russian
Government.
There are many other ways in which Canada can help; but we must always remember
that it is not the wording of the document itself that is important, but the spirit and will
to work out the provisions of this document.
Honourable senators, I must apologize for
the inordinate length of my remarks, and for
having entered upon a field which perhaps
might be considered a little different from
what might be expected in a discussion on
this resolution, but which, I submit, relates to
the matter in a very vital way. I have ventured to comment previously in this House
upon the increasing importance of Canada
in the international picture, and to express the
opinion that that is a situation which the Senate
is peculiarly well qualified to discuss. It is
for that reason I have ventured to offer
the observations that I have made this afternoon on the resolution before the House, fully
realizing that it relates to one of the most important subjects which we have ever been
called upon to consider.

Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN:
atorsSome Hon. SENATORS:

Honourable senHear, hear.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I regret very much
the absence of the honourable senator from
La Salle (Hon. Mr. Moraud), who was one
of our delegates at San Francisco, and who,
with His Honour the Speaker represented
this House so brilliantly. No doubt he would
have given us a very interesting speech on
the charter.
The document before the House for approval is a very momentous one. It carries
with it the ultimate hope of all peoples of all
times. If it is fulfilled, humanity will be reborn to a new life of peace and happiness; if
it is not, man will continue to tread the road
of despair, perhaps to his ultimate destruction.
I shall net attempt to analyze in detail all
the clauses of the charter. This task I ]eave
to the honourable members who, in the dying
4ays of the last session, spoke so fittingly on
this subject. I may, however, be permitted to
address myself to a few of the important
clauses. A perusal of the report on the San
Francisco Conference, submitted to Parliament by the Department of External Affairs,
offers us an opportunity to express to those
who were our delegates at that conference
our warm appreciation of the brilliant manner
in which they represented. Canada and thereby
materially contributed to the clarification,
extension and strengthening of the Dumbarton Oaks proposals bequeathed to us by the
great statesmen who, by the mercy of Providence, guided the allies through the war.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Canada has grown
tremendously in stature during tlis terrible
conflict. Her magnificent fighting men, ber
productive activity and resourcefulness, her
-ontributions to Great Britain and the allies,
as well as her ministration to the needs and
sufferings of so many, especially through the
Red Cross, have justly earned for our country
a coveted standing aud authority. Our
delegation at San Francisco rose to the height
:f Canada's new dignity, and spoke and acted
in a manner befitting her new national
importance.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Within the limited
scope of my remarks I shall not attempt to
detail all the eminent services they have
rendered; but I shall attempt to point
out some which especially concern the secondary nations, and therefore affect Canada. The
Canadian delegation, more than any other.

44 of the charter. This article provides that
nations which do not belong to the Security
Council shall, when called upon to provide
armed forces, have the right to participate in
the decisions of that Council in respect of
their own contribution. The old slogan "No
taxation without reptresentation" was invoked
and implenented. The powers of the major
nations, who could veto armed intervention,
exven by the dissension of one voice, were in
striking contrast to the powers of secondary nations who, while likely to provide the
armaments, would have neither a vote nor
a voice in the decisions to be made. This
injustice was fully rectified, and any na:ion
required to furnish military help was also
enabled to express its views te the military
staff. Further, our delegation requested and
obtained for the Economic and Social Couneil
a far greater authority and a means of
greater and more certain efficiency.
The war bas demonstrated Canada's extensive resources and the part they must play in
any economic policy in the future. The best
possible foundation was wisely laid for our
contribution in that regard. The Economic
and Social Council, as well as the International Labour Bureau, will reinforce the
Assembly and the Security Council in their
efforts to bring about better uniderstanding
through more extensive
co-operation
in
economic, social, cultural, edutational and
hiealth fields. Let us remember that a stranger
is at first blush usually regarded with suspicion
if not with hostility. When be is known, this
antipathy generally disappears.
The promotion of the codification of international law, which is of paramount importance
in the establishment of the rules of justice,
was strongly urged, and was entrusted te the
Assembly.
A coalition basrd on the necessities of war
usually disintegrates after the defeat of the
enemy; such coalition should now be preserved
by turning its efforts to the betterment of
mankind.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: A code of international laws is essential to establish what
is right and permissible and what is net.
The conference obviously could net write
such a code, but it charged the Assembly
with the responsibility of encouraging the
development of international laws. A great
deal of valuable work bas been donc in that
respect, and it is hoped it will soon be brought
to fruition, as it will infinitely strengthen the
authority of the International Court of Justice.

Quebec, I should like to thank our delegates

the devastation of her country, the lack of

still more by reason of a deep and rankling

of which were almost equal to this last
visitation, and has been resurrected as by

France and a powerful French army.
The charter of the San Francisco Conference is a wonderful accomplishment-all the
more so because it was the child of continual
consultation and the spontaneous assent of no
less than fifty nations. We cannot forget
that President Wilson imposed the League
of Nations on Clemenceau, Lloyd George and
Orlando as a sine qua non of the Treaty of
Versailles. In San Francisco the great majority of the delegates acted freely, upon convictions resulting from the untold sufferings
and horrible losses of conquered and oppressed
peoples, and the terror experienced by the
-rest of the world as it stood aghast on the
brink of disaster. The present charter is a
great victory over the outmoded balance of
power policy, zones of influence and persistent
isolation.
President Truman has stated that the charter
is a solid foundation upon which to build a
better world. It is, however, only a foundation,
and the erection and consolidation of world
peace will be a long, difficult and perhaps
disheartening task. To disarm and control
two bloodthirsty nations, and raise them to
the political, spiritual and moral level of the
allies will require dogged determination. We
must net only disarm the enemy, but we
must see te it that for a long period they
remain disarmed. With the discovery of the
atomic bomb, the future control of armaments
will be extremely difficult. The production
on a large acale of tanks, guns and planes
requires a huge distribution of easily detected
industries; yet, folilowing the first Great War
we failed lamentably te control armaments.

the past, have become true prophets. Their
zeal, so persistent for years, has played a
large part in the accomplishments of to-day.

SENATE

The road ahead, of us is not free from
dangers and obstacles. I an aware that the
San Francisco Charter is by no means perfect.
The right of veto makes of the great powers
an oligarchy far removed from democratic
rule, I admit; but in this respect the situation
is no different from what it was prior to the
charter. We have lost nothing. Truc, the
veto right constrains the great powers to act
unanimously. But reality clearly shows us
that if they pull apart, the charter will be
torn to shreds. Whatever happens, we must
constantly bear in mind that the first and
fundamental necessity is te maintain the unity
of the big powers.
I admit that troublesome questions already
loom on the horizon. Some nations have
made decisions and adopted policies which it
would seem could only with difficulty receive unanimous approval. The fact that no
one can contemplate a new outbreak of war

at present may be an incentive to risk dangerous steps. Such considerations and others will
no d'oubt fully test the prudence and skill of
the mon at the helm. But the mass of the
people must not be permitted to forget that
whatever 'the subject of contention may b,
it is almost a trifie compared ·o the necessity
t
for maintaining world peace.
The atomie bomb has opened the door te
new and almost limitless forces of nature.
Einstein says that matter is nothing but compressed energy. The impact of the neutron
atoms on uranium and plutonium causes the
explosion of trillions of atoms, with a devastatien previously unheard of. The warring of
one great power against the others would
precipitate millions of men into battle and
bring about unimaginable losses and calamity.
It is because of this that Canada bas an
especially great part to play. Useful in the
past in helping to maintain harmony between
the United Kingdom and the United States,
this country must now redouble ils efforts to
that end. In truth, we should mark our approval of the wise policy of our governments
which in the past have accomplished so much
along this line. So long as the British Empire
and the United States stand: shoulder to
shoulder, the peace of the world should the
botter be assured. Let us every day be mindful of our privileged position with respect to
our good neighbour and Great Britain, a position that affords us the opportunity of rendering to net only our own people but the entire
world a supreme service. Let us go forth with
faith in humanity; let us trust the wisdom if
net the virtue of man; let us turn from the
critics who sneeringly proclaim "homo homini
vulpus"-"man behaves as a wolf towards his
fellow man"; let us proceed with unfaltering

steps on the high road of law and justice, fol-

lowing and supporting the men of faith and
vision who have made this day possible.
General MacArthur said a few days ago
that in times past humanity could choose
between peaceful settlement and war, but that
now there is no such choice. War bas become
suicidal for humanity. The only road open
to the world must be that pointed out alike
by reason and by Christianity. The United
Nations are humanity's only hope for a
peaceful and happy world.
In the happy days of yore, on entering
Bohemia I was struck by a graceful monument
at the entrance of a very old convent. It bore
a statue of the Holy Virgin, and on the pedestal was this inscription: "A fame, peste et
bello libera nos, O virgine"-"From famine,
pestilence and war, save us, O Virgin."
This touching invocation, centuries old, has,
in part, been answered. Famine bas virtually
been banished by mutual help between nations.
Pestilence is almost elimina)ted by international
agreements. War alone, the worst of these
calamities, still persists. Humanity bas been
permitted partly to answer this pions invocation. Why net fully? Man's instinct of selfpreservation still dominates him. His wisdom
is far more enlightened and bis genius has
attained heights hitherto unsuspected.
Standing at the threshold of a new era,
perhaps the most wonderful and beneficent
ever known since the foundation of Christianity, with a shuddering glance at the past
and a heartening look at the future, Canadians,
I feel certain, will readily take their place
among untold multitudes who with hope and
fervour will take up the gospel of the United
Nations.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable senators. I have no desire to take the
place of any honourable member who would
now like to participate in this debate. As a
matter of fact, I shall be quite content te remain in my seat and listen to the views of my
colleagues with regard to this charter.
I
trust that ample time will be given to discuss
this motion fully, and, should it be necessary
to continue the debate at 8 o'clock, I hope
the attendance thon will be as representative
of all sections of the House as it is at present.
I should like to associate myself with the
complimentary ýreferences to the delegation
from our two Houses of Parliament on the
good work they did at the San Francisco
conference. To them must be given the credit
for the recognition which Canada received
there as a result of the part they played.
During the debate in this Chamber on the
Dumbarton Oaks proposals it was said that
San Francisco might easily become the mirror

OCTOBER 25. 1945
in which Canada would for the first time see
herself in true proportion. If the image reflected in that mirror is net yet as clear as
some of us would like it to be, I trust that
what took place at the conference will eventually have the effect of defining more clearly to
her own people Canada's position in the world
today.
At the beginning of this debate the honourable leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) referred to the deadline fer the
registration of the charter after it is ratified
by the Parliament of Canada, and said that
it would be necessary to have our ratification
flown to the United Kingdom, to be signed
by His Majesty. It strikes me that it would
be more fitting to follow our usual constitutional procedure and have the charter ratified
on this side by the Governor General, representing the Crown. I think it is peculiarly
fitting that that procedure should characterize
the ratification of t'he charter by this country,
because of the added status which undoubtedly
our people feel Canada has gained as a result
of our participation in the San Francisco conference.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: It seems to me that
the discussion of the charter falls naturally
into two divisions. First, that relating to its
factual view, arising out of the discussion in
this House of the Dumbarton Oaks proposals.
The charter has already been signed tentatively
by fifty nations, and according to today's
press dispatches, it has been ratified by some
twenty-nine countries whose representatives
were present in San Francisco.
Secondly, we must view the charter in the
light of developments which have followed its
adoption last June. Bearing in mind the conclusion of the war in Asia as well as in Europe, and the revelation te the woild on July
G of the atomic bomb, and also of the uncertainty which surrounds the negotiation of
basic treaties of peace, I am grateful to the
honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) for having dealt so frankly with
that aspect of the charter. He takes a realistic
view of its possibilities at this time.
As was anticipated during our debate on
the Dumbarton Oaks proposals, there have
been many amendments incorporated in the
charter as distinct from the original proposals,
but on the whole it is an attempt to embody
in a solemn agreement the aspiration of
humanity for future security; and, as honourable members are aware, this was the fundamental reason for the gathering together of
the world's representatives at Dumbarton

Oaks. Undoubtedly the charter is a substantial improvement upon the proposals that
we debated last spring. It is now a question
of ways and means, and only time and experience will give us an adequate answer.
Throughout all the nations identified with the
San Francisco conference there is a realistic
appreciation of the weaknesses and shortcomings of the charter, and they have been
emphasized in all speeches made in this Parliament and elsewhere. I was much impressed
by the critical and constructive addresses in
the other House when the charter was under
consideration there; only one speech was
deprecatory, and it was delivered by a member from Alberta. I read it with great interest
and found it to be a sincere contribution to
the debate. But that speech does not begin
to compare in severity with that of a certain
noble lord in England. Later on I intend to
quote a passage from it.
But in spite of all criticisms and doubts
the charter is being accepted by both cynics
and pessimists as the best that can be secured
at this stage. It is being accepted in the hope
that time and experience will bring about
improved international relations. With this
approach it is important, I think, to analyse
the effect of the developments which have
taken place following the San Francisco
conference.
The elation which naturally the world felt
at the conclusion of the war was, I think
everybody must admit, modified very considerably by a certain feeling of fear followThe
ing the atomic bomb attack on Japan.
world was awed by the revelation of the
mysterious and destructive force of atomie
energy. Then, too, there has been a good
deal of uncertainty with regard to the saltisfactory negotiation and adjustment of basic
treaties which will constitute the formal
termination of the war. Another ground for
uneasiness is the breakdown of the conference
of foreign ministers in London, to which my
honourable friend from Inkerman referied.
After all, the acid test of the successful application of the charter with all that it stands
for will be the ability of the Big Three or
Four or Five to bring about a sound basis
for peace. If it is impossible for those Great
Powers to arrive at satisfactory conclusions
on adjusting boundaries and establishing
spheres of influence, then I fear that the
democratie countries will have to attempt a
new approach to a satisfactory solution of the
world situation.
In connection with this subject I have
received a good deal of illumination from
perusal of some of the speeches delivered in
the House of Lords. There, as you all know,

136

SENATE

are assembled men of wide experience and
outstanding ability in the scientific, commercial and political fields. I believe that a few
short extracts from these speeches will be of
interest to honourable senators. The possible
need for a new conference as a result of
developments since the meeting at San Francisco is referred to very definitely by Lord
Strabolgi.
Speaking on the ratification of
this treaty, he said:
With the best will in the world, the representatives of fifty nations drew up this world
charter, but it will have to be replaced presently
by something more powerful, more robust and
more-if I may use the words-rogue-proof.
I presume His Majesty's Government will

He said:

He refers also to the threat to the world

statement is significant and of great value
to our discussion, in that it opens up for us
a point of view regarding the relations between the United States and the other
English-speaking countries.
Lord Strabolgi
made tbis significant statement:
'eb brutal truth, which we may as well face,
is that war as an instrument of national policy,

United States for the time being, and only for
the tiume being, bas the vast plant needed to
make the explosive product. Therefore, for just
a few years, the United States will be the
only great nation able to wage war as an
instrument of national policy.
Fortunately, the American people accepted as
wholebeartedly as we did the full implication
of the Briand-Kellogg Pact and they are
pacifist in the best sense of the word. We
should be very grateflul and humbly thankful,

I had intended while in our Committee
this morning to ask the Minister, who so
kindly came before us and gave a very
excellent summary, what the positiqn was in
connection with the interpretation of Section
44. Does it mean that Canada, or any other
country in a similar position, has only the
privilege of engaging in discussion, or is it
to have a voice in making the decision? The
Article, as it appears in the Charter, states
that we shall have a right to participate in
the decision. I did not have an opportunity
of asking that question at the meeting this

reading some other notes and did not hear
that question this morning. It does cover
the point. I am referring to it particularly
because, in my opinion, that discussion in the
House of Lords fails to make the point clear
from our position.
Another very important feature of the provisions of the charter was brought out by
Viscount Trenchard, relating to Articles 45, 46
and 47. I refer to the provision for the enlisting of armed forces by all countries who undertake to become members. He indicated that
it was necessary to know what commitments
were to be undertaken by his own and other
countries, and the size and type of force which
should be contributed. He made the very important suggestion, which I think should apply
to every feature in the administration of the
charter, that the information with regard to
the strength of these forces should be publicized to the world at large; and that publicity and propaganda in connection with the
work of the military staff advising the Security
Council will be one of the main factors in
making the charter a success.
I notice, honourable senators, that the hour

such subjection that they cannot become bad
again. It is taken for granted that tlie good
will always remain so.
A little further on ho says:
Let nie paint an imaginary pictuie of how
the next war may happen. Some nation will
get a grievance from the Peace Treaty or fromi
the past or will hateh a new one in the future,
and instead of bleating it out to the world. as
Hitler used to do, the nation will keep it quiet
for fear of possible intarterence by the Security
Council, and confide it to one group of people
only-its investigating scientists and ehemists.
One day-it may be in ten years, fifty years
or a hundred years-when it has got all it
wants, all the key towns and arsenals and the
politicians of the country whiLh ilt regards as
responsible for this grievance will be destroyed.
The politicians, bereft of even one moment of
time for reflection, will find themselves part of
a huge black mushroom of dirt and smoke

Some Hon. SENATORS:

Six o'clock!

At six o'clock the Senate took recess.

At eight o'elock the sitting was resumed.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Honourable senators,
jiist before we adjourned I had the liberty
of quoting extracts from statements made by
noble members of the House of Lords and
bearing upon various points in the United
Nations Charter. I should like to be allowed
a few moments longer to make a couple of
additional quotations which I think would be
interesting and helpful to compare with views
expressed in our own Parliament.
I referred earlier to -a critical statementa constructively critical statement-made in
another place by an honourable gentleman
from Alberta, and I should like to contrast
with it one that was made in the House of
Lords by the noble Earl of Darnley. For the
last ten years the Earl of Darnley has been a
consistent exponent of a pacifist point of view.
In discussing the charter of the United
Nations he said he believed "that force and

going up to the str-atosphere, from their late

supposed stronghold-perhaps I should say a
white mushroom. Possibly, a few minutes later,
another ceuntry, friendly to the one attacked,
will wreak similar treatment on the aggressor,
so that by the time the Security Council get
out of their comfortable beds and reach their
office to consider action under Article 39, whieh
states:
"The Security Council shal ldetermine the
existence of any threat to the peace, breach of
the peace, or act of aggression, and shall make
recommendations or decide what measures shall
be taken in accordance with Articles 41 and 42
to maintain or restore international peace and
security"-the war will be over. Two or three
countries will have been entirely destroyed and
the ears that might have listened to the
Council's warnings will be sailing in the sky
in particle form, together with fragments of
attaché cases, gaiters, and tIe other bits and
pieces that used to make up a normal existence.
That statement in the ancient and honourable House of Lords so completely overshadows the speech of the honourable member
from Alberta as to make him appear one of
the mildest mannered pirates who ever attempted to scuttle a ship.
One other quotation. It is by Lord Balfour
of Inchrye. He was well known in this countrv as Sir Harold Balfour during his visits
here in connection with our air training plan.
In his maiden speech on the charter he had
this to say with reference to the atomic bomb:
This weapon is different from every other
weapon which bas been developed. Hitherto
in war, as the noble Viscount, Lor.d Stansgate,

SENATE
who was a colleague of mine at the Air Ministiy
over whichb he ow presides, knows full weli.
every techical development whieh we have lad
lias bail its antidote, varying in dgiree of
success. Your Lordships will reiemober the
msagnetic mine, which took a great toll of our
shipping. The antidote was the degaussing of
ships. We had the day raider, and we had
radiolocation. We had the night bomber, and
for that we had what was known as Al. The
pilotless or piloted aircraft carrying the atomie
bomb is in a different position. The antidote
will do its best, but if one weapon gets through
the resuit for which the enemy wislies is
achieved. Thus for the atomic bomb there is
no antidote which is 100 per cent effective. . . .
One can say that the final issue in iodern war
is not in the hands of the far-sighted comnmander so mueli as in those of the short-siglîted
physicist.
Those two quotations express the most
pessimistic point of view expressed in that debate, and I have cited them simply as a background for my submission that we can regard
the charter as one more example of the agelong struggle of mankind to mould his social
destiny against the forces of adversity. In
that struggle, which generally speaking has
been a struggle of morals against science,
science would seem to have all but won the
victory. But I submit that our alarmists with
a flair for the sensational, make a mistake
when they array science and morals in opposite
and hostile camps. Centuries ago in the days
of Aristotle's Greece, when there was a golden
age of human relations which in some respects
at least msight well serve as a pattern for the
modern world, philosophy embraced three
fields-cconoinics, ethics and science; to-day,
when in reality they would still be united in
the interest of humanity, through specialization they have been divided. There is nothing
aew in this challenge of science to tho leaders
>f philosophic thought as it bears upon our
political and social relations. For example,
:here is soinething prophetic in the lines of
Alexander Pope, written in 1734. Here agaîn
I wish to pay deference to flic honourable
senator from Inkerman, because he too cited
the same author. In Pope's Essay on Man will
be found these lines:
Let earth unbalanc'd from her orbit fly,
Planets and stars rii lawless througls the sky;
Let ruling angels froi their spieres be hurl'd,
Being on being wreck'd, and world on
world; . . .
Go, wondrous cieature! mounîît wlere science
guides;
Go, measure earth, weigh air, and state the
tides;
Instruct the planets in what orbs to run,
Correct old time, and regulate the sun; . . .
Atoms or systems into ruin hurl'd,
And now a bubble burst, and now a world.

i' so miany quarters over the revelation of
atomic energy must be dissipated by appreriation of the fact that science has achieved,
througlh the medium of the human mind, a
great miracle which can lead mankind into
new paths of peace and prosperity. After all,
fear docs not bring progress. History shows
that progress lias developed out of the positive
desire to create something new.
That, I
submit, should b the key-note of our approval of this motion.
The Minister of Justice in his address before
our committee this morning expressed the
feeling tlat the charter is based on the conscience of mankind. He said it represents
tIse aspiration of flic common people of the
world, and that if those who represent them
at great international conferences today and
in flic future are always maindful of that fact,
we may well have hope for the days abead.
What a great responsibility rests upon the
outstanding leaders of the participating nations,
particularly those wlio represent the democratie countries in this great organization.
There is no doubt about the desire for peace
and happiness on flic part of the rank and
file of humanity everywhere. This was impressed indelibly on my mind after the last
war, wlsen it was mîy privilege to sec the
liost of people who thronged the streets all
the way from Buckingham Palace to flic
Guildhall in the city of London, when tie
late President Wilson went there carrying his
message of hope to the world. Not only in
London, but in Paris and in Rome the people
acclaimed bim. IL is with keen regret thsat
we are compelled to admit that great idealistie
aspiration was not realized.
lere was no
doubt then nor is there any today about the
desire of humanity for peace and happiness.
Why, then, is that aspiration not realized?
I believe it is largely due to the fact that
too often a sense of power turns the minds of
those in highs places, and interferes with the
realization of what is closest to the heart of
humanity. The late C. P. Scott, for fifty
years editor of the Manchester Guardian, and
one of the world's great influences for good,
is credited by his biographer with this thought
on the failure of certain statesmen to measure
up to tise world's requirements at Versailles:
Perhaps only Gladstone could have succeeded
in such an effort, for it demanded a combinations
of qualities which lie possessed. not to be found
in any living statesman.
Gladstone liad a
ieligions sense for the unity of civilization, and
a conviction justified by his career, that he could
fire a people with his own passionate faith.

I would commend those lines to the present
generation as worthy of a good deal of thought.
The apprehension which bas been expressed

I cite that to stress again the importance of
the value of leadership in the realization of
human aspirations.

Hon. Mr. LA-MBERT.

Honourable members, the very moment in

people said the League was a failure. While in
a practical sense it wýas a failure, it did not.
It kept alive within ail aur

hearts the realizatian that peace was a good
thing throughaut the world. It is true that
many mistakes were made. But wha amang
us does not make mistakes? It cannot ho
denied that things were donc which were detrimental ta the purposes for which the League
was formed. However, it kept alive in aur
minds the ideal that peace for the world
was botter than war. The world naw realizes,
flot through bratherly love, but rather through

instinct, that with the development of the
instruments of war there can no longer ho a
confliet hetween two nations-it is a world
war every time.
The lest few words spoken by the honourable gentleman from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambort) appealed to me very strongly. Oratory
is a strange thing. Hitler rode ta power on
oratary. It is a gift that some men possess
and others do not; and I have neyer been able
ta find anynne who could define it. It can inspire men, lif t them up and cause them ta
forget themselves. I was struck by the remark
of tise Minister of Justice this marning that
only when the common men and wamen af the
world are allowed ta express their desires we
will have no more war. It is when people are
unable ta declare their wishes that war is
likely ta occur. Naw, any member in this or
in any other flouse cauld criticîze the shortcomings ai the charter. And again I want ta
refer ta what was said this marning by some
of the gentlemen who appeared bcfore the
committee-it matters not which-when they
painted ta the tremendaus advances af the
past twenty-five years, and nated the fact that
fifty natians cauld assemble and put dawn on
a piece af paper samething that laoks like an
agreement.
flan. Mr. HTJGESSEN:

flear, hear.

Han. Mr. HAIG: We have an agreement,
and whether it works or not, xwe at least have
made a gain. Imagine the leading senatar ai
the Republican party in the United States and
the leading senatar in the Democratie party
gaing ta San Francisca and entering inta the
kind af agreement that came aut af the canference. They did flot do that sort ai thing
in 1920, and their failure ta do sa prabably
cost their country a million men.
May I go hack for a moment and pay my
respects ta tise memory of anc man and ta refer
ta another. I believe that history wiIl write
of aur times that the late President Roasevelt and ex-Prime Minister Churchill contributed as much ta world advancement as any
two men in previaus warld history.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

flan. Mr. HAIG: The Atlantic Charter, not
the one drawn at San Francisco, was the first
charter. There were only two people present
when the Atlantic Charter was made; but
those two gave ta the world an ideal, and
started us thinking alang certain lines. They
knew, as good practical politicians, that the
canference at San Francisca shauld be held
befare the war was ended and priar ta the
peace treaty. During the six years of war
did you ever hear criticism ai what the gav-

140

SENATE

ernment was doing, eitber from this side of
the Huse or the other? We knew we were
engaged in a life and death struggle. Now
that it is ail over, we are getting a few facts
which indicate to us just how close we came
to losing the war. These two men knew that
Linder the conditions prcvailing in war timo the
prospects of getting mon together to stop war
would be better. And so we met at San
Francisco.
Before proceeding to briefly ýroview some
matters for the benýefit of those who .erc flot
presont in Committee this morning, I should
like to make the statomont-it is nlot correct
to call it a protest-that I ar nflt c 1uitc as
cnthuýiastic as the honourable s(coator frorn
Inkerman (Hoo. Mr. Hugesson) about the
position of Russia. I admit that in June, 1941,
thore was na doubt in the miod of any Canadian that we wcre ail out to support Russia.
The United States, Great Britain and Canada
were, as far as thcy could go, ail out to back
Russia. Canada, which is the only country we
tan spoak for. did get bohind Russia and do
al] sho could for hier. 0f course thero tvas no
choice. One question. however, bas always
worried me: Why did Russia in 1939 mako an
agreement with Germany to dix ide Poland?
Russia kniew thon that Gormany wxas going to
attace lier nexi. Some mon argue that Russia
needed the agreement because site was not
ready for war, and wanted two yoars to propare. That may bo truc. Nevertheless, that
situation worries me n littie. 1 do not believe
you could have induced Great Britain or the
United States to make an agreemeot of that
kind. That is the pbulosophy of Russia that I
do flot like. However, I do know that if this
United Nations Charter is to bc a success,
Ruissia lias to ho a party to it. I agree with
the attitude of Mr. Bevin and Mr. Byrnes at
the Ambatssadors' ýConference wben., if rumour
is correct, they spoke very plainly to Mr.
Molotov. They spoke very plainly and thc
w orld will ho botter because of that fact. It
niakes thie future more bopefu]. I arn not

illustration my honourable friend bas givon.
We flouted Russia during the last two decades.
[ want to ho fair to Russia,, but at t.be same
time I want to speak plainly to bier. I think
Mr. Bovin ond Mr. Byrnes made a real contribution to world peace wlien tboy candidly
told Mr. Molotov what they tbought about
world conditions. There is no doubt that the
Russian people mean well, but I am not sure
that under their prosent form of governmont
they are able to express their good intentions.

Hon. Mr. PATERSON:
reported?

Was the meeting

Hon. Mr. HAIG: No. His Honour the
Speaker addressed us here this afternoon, and
his remarks will, of course appear in Hansard.
I am not trying to summarize what was said
at the committee by the three delegates; I am
simply stating my own impression that, whatever may happen to the United Nations
Charter, our foreign policy for years to come
will be influenced by what was done at the
San Francisco Conference.
As we all know, the five Great Powers, about
whom so much has been heard, are the United
States, Russia, Great Britain, China and
France. I share with the honourable senator
from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) the
belief that France will once again be a powerful nation. I also think it is a splendid thing
for the world that that great eastern country,
China, is included among the " Big Five."
I do not intend to deal with the charter in
detail, as all honourable members are aware
of its provisions. It provides for a General
Assembly, a Security Council, an International
Court of Justice, and so on. Here let me say
that I do not think that any man in Canada
could have made a more valuable contribution
to the deliberations on the International Court
of Justice than was made by the Honourable
Mr. St. Laurent. It was most pleasing that
one of our delegates was so outstanding a
lawyer, and one so highly respected and
greatly liked by the legal profession throughout Canada.
Some Honourable SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: In his quiet and unassuming way he admitted that he did "a bit"-I
believe that was how he put it-with respect
to that part of the charter setting up the
International Court.
Our delegation sought to obtain at the
conference some understanding or advice as to
what would happen if we were called upon to
contribute armed forces in another war. The
original agreement provided that the Security
Council-composed of the five Great Powers
as permanent members and six nations elected
for a term of two years each-could by the
vote of two non-permanent members and the
unanimous vote of the five permanent members declare war, in which event we could be
called upon to send armed forces where needed.

141

Before any demand of that kind was made a
representative of Canada would attend a meeting of the Council and agree upon how many
soldiers, airmen, sailors, ships and so on we
should supply; and the whole thing would be
subject to confirmation by our Parliament.
That was the original understanding, and it
was clear. But because of the way sections 43
and 44 of the charter are worded I inquired of
the Minister of Justice as to what was intended, and he gave an answer-perhaps I
should say an opinion-that the Chiefs of
Staff of the five Great Powers would be in
charge of military operations. If some Canadian forces were to be required, our own Chiefs
of Staff would no doubt be consulted as to
what should be done. At the meeting to
decide whether or not Canada was to be called
upon for a military contribution, a Canadian
representative would take part in the proceedings and vote. However, if he voted
against the use of Canadian forces but the
majority was in faveur of it, our men would
have to be made available. That is the position, as I interpret these sections, and as
explained by the Minister of Justice this
morning.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The same thing is
true with regard to every country.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: May I remind the
honourable gentlemen of another point,
namely, that if the majority vote was in
favour of the employment of armed forces
and our Parliament supported the contrary
recommendation of a Canadian delegate, Canada would automatically withdraw from the
United Nations.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is quite correct, and
I thank the honourable gentleman for remninding me of the point. But it is inconceivable
that the parliament of any country would
adopt that course.
The most important thing stressed at this
morning's committee meeting was that unless
Russia, the United States and Great Britain
are in agreement, it is practically impossible
to have world peace. While in our view it
may be undemocratic that one nation should
be able to veto the decision of ten other
nations, yet when we look at the stark realities we can see that there is no way of avoiding the situation. If the United States, for
instance, refused to co-operate, the whole
organization would collapse.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That is what happened after the last war.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Why did the Great
Powers insist on having the right of veto?
It means nothing, anyway.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It may seem a strange
thing to say, but I am in favour of it. If
they have the right to veto, they will be less
eager to exercise it. Suppose that in a certain situation the Council decides, contrary
to the wish of Canada as expressed by our
representative, that we should be called upon
to send 20,000 men abroad. If we had not
made our views known we might feel that
failure to make them known was the reason
for the decision going against us; but having
presented our case we would know that we
had donc everything possible. Even though a
person loses a case, if he lias presented his
views to the best of his ability, he feels more
satisfied tIhan he otherwise would.

I did not expect to speak so long. In closing
I want to say that I intend to vote for the
charter, because I think it is a step forward.
It may be that twenty years from now other
men and women sitting in this House will say
that in approving this charter we made a
mistake; but we know we are doing it because
we trust in God that there will be a world
worth living in.

Hon. Mr. EULER: The honourable gentleman bas net answered my question. Why did
the Great Powers want the right of veto?

Hon. Mr. CRERAR: It may be that the
important place the Fathers of Confederation
in their wisdom assigned to the Senate of
Canada, and the long and honourable associations this House has had, are influencing me
at this moment.
Before dealing with the subject-matter of
the resolution, I should like to be permitted to
extend to you, Mr. Speaker, warm congratulations upon your elevation to the Chair, an
honour well deserved because of your long
experience in the publie service of this country. I desire also to add a word of congratulation to the two honourable leaders (Hon. Mr.
Robertson and Hon. Mr. Haig) who in this
session have succeeded to the responsible
posts which they now occupy. Finally, I wish
to offer a word of thanks to the older members
of this honourable body who have been so
cordial in their welcome to us neophytes on
our entry into this Chamber.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Russia, I presume. wanted
it.

Hon. Mr. EULER: Why?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: After what she has gone
through she certainly would try to avoid
being forced into another war. Russia does
not yet trust the western nations. That is my
personal opinion, and it is the only answer J
can give. I think that if Russia is fundamentally as democratic as is indicated by the way
her people voteHon. Mr. LACASSE: She is not.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I am not saying she is,
but I think we can depend on her developing
in that direction. I admit that the Russian
question is a very difficult one.
I will ask another difficult question: Why
did the United States not enter the League of
Nations in 1120? It seemed to be as plain as
anything possibly could be that they should
have donc so. When I read in the paper that
the United States Senate had refused to ratify
the Peaee Treaty, I had difficulty in convincing
myself that it was truc. But there it was.
Therefore it seems to me that just now we
ought not to be too critical of Russia or too
sure that we understand ber. Regardless of
what anyone may say to the contrary, she
would appear to have suffered, so many casualtics in the last war that she will do ber utmost
to avoid other wars. Like my honourable
friend from Essex (Hon. Mr. Lacasse) I am
not too confident of Russia, but I agree with
the honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) that we should, try to judge
ber fairly and co-operate with ber as best we
can.
Hon. Mr. EULER.

Hon. THOMAS A. CRERAR: Honourable
senators, in rising to address this House for
the first time I must confess te a feeling of
some trepidation.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Surely not.

In discussing this important motion, may
I say that I believe we are all impressed with
the gravity of the step we are about to take.
The charter is net perfect, but when one
considers the difficulties that faced the delegates at San Francisco, the number of nations
represented, their different forms of government, their diversified cultures, and their
varying standards of living, the wonder is
not that the charter may be imperfect in
certain particulars, but rather that there is any
charter at all.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: This affords a substantial margin of hope that the nations,
having been able to compromise their differences in this first step, may be able te
continue in the great work which the charter
is designed to carry out.

OCTOBER 25, 1945
It is well that we should refleet on the
failure of the League of Nations. I recail that
in 1918, when my colleague in this Chamber
the honourable senator from Saltcoats (Hon.
Mr. Calder) and I were members of the Government of 'Canada, discussions took place in
respect of the proposais for a League of
Nations. Undoubtedly it was fervently hoped
that the League would be an effective instrument to prevent future wars, and that the
great sacrifices made from 1914 to 1918 would
neyer again be necessary. I shall not attempt
Vo analyse ail the Teasons for the failure of
the League; but while we are giving adherence
to the charter, it is wèll to review the story
of the League to find out, if possible, why it
failed, and then to use that knowledge to
prevent a similar catastrophe overtaking the
new organization we are now helping to set up.
It is fair to say that the abstention of the
United States from the League of Nations, the
failure in the early stages to invite Russia Vo
become a member, and also the absence of a
few other nations, had a very definite bearing
on the League's lack of success. The absence
of the United States was of tremendous consequeilce; but, rightly or wrongly, I arn among
those who believe that the League might
stili have proved a success if there had been
an honest effort Vo make it function. In
saying this I do not wish to refiect on the
government of any country, but the story of
the League makes it clear that from its inception there was too much jockeying for
position between the various nations.
In the early years the League bad some
achievements to its credit, but long before
it passed out of existence it was given its
death blow when Japan, in direct violation
of the Covenant, invaded Manchuria. The
war with China lasted only a short time, and
it was renewed later on. The failure at that
time to impose sanctions on Japan as the
aggressor nation was the first breach in the
great edifice of peace. The rise of the
Fascist and Nazi powers completed its ruin.
By the beginning of N35 it was abundantly
clear that Italy intended to attack Ethiopia,
despite the fact that Italy herself had sponsored Ethiopia before the League. Honourable members know what happened. When
Italy did attack Ethiopia the League proved
to be wholly powerless to deal with the situBecause the major powers
ation. Why?
could not agree on united action against the
aggressor nation. It is an open fact that at
that time high personages in France, andI
think also in Great Britain, said in effeet:

country, it has no future, and it will be a
good thing if one of the so-called civilized
powers takes control of it."
I might go on with the story: Germany's
reoccupation of the Ruhr; her re-arming in
the face of the very provisions of the Versailles treaty; her attack on Austria in the
spring of 1938; Munich in the autumn of
1938, o'ne of the most-well, perhaps I had
better not say what is in my mind. HÀtler's
uncompromising stand at Munich was definite
evidence that the aggressor powers were on
the march and that the League was impotent
to prevent them. The aggressor nations believed then that the demnocratic powers were
becoýming decadent and would flot intervene
to proteet the smaller nations against aggressio. At Munich Hitler gave a solemn pledge
to Chamberlain that if the Sudeten question
was settled on his own ternis he would have
no further territorial ambitions in Europe.
Yet six months laterHon. Mr. LACASSE: In 1939.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: -without a moment's
warning he inarched into Czeehoslovakia. la
the autumn of 1939 hie attacked Poland.
The honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig) has commented on Russia's foreigu
policy. I am flot bere to defend Russia-not
for a moment-but I do think history will
show that if the western democracies had been
prepared to stand against Germany at the
Munich meeting Russia would have j oined
,them. Russia came to the conclusion, with
I arn bound to say some warrant, that the
western democracies would at no stage make
a stand against Hitler, and so in the summer
of 1939'she entered into a non-aggression pact
with Germany.
In 1939 1 was asked to be the representative of the Canadian Government at a
confernuce in London that Mr. Chamberlain,
then Prime Minister of Great Britain, had
invited the overseas Dominions to attend.
This gave me the opportunity of meeting a
good many public men, one of whom, a
European statesman of some prominence-I
&hall not mention his name-impressed me
greatly. He had an intimate knowledge of
German-Russian relations, and as well a
thorough grnsp of the whole European situation.
I asked him about the RussianGerman rapprochement and bie said, "1V is
not worth the paper it is written on." He
felt that either country might break the
treaty, and he predicted that Germany would
break it first. His prediction proved only too
truc. But I cannot escape the feeling that
the Russian Goveroment hail corne to the
conclusion that the western democracies would

SENATE

not attempt to halt Germany, and that the
only recourse was to enter into this nonaggression treaty in order to gain time to
prepare against the impending attack. Whether
or not that policy was sound time alone will
reveal.
It is interesting ta note that today under
the Soviet Government the guiding principle
of Russian foreign policy is virtually the same
as that which prevailed under the Czarist
regime-further proof, were any necessary,
that nationalisrn always exerts a potent influence on a country's foreign policy.
I believe that the international authority to
be based on this charter will begin to function
under much more favourable auspices than
those which attended the birth of- the League
of Nations. Let me enumerate briefly two or
three reasons for my belief. In the first place,
the United States and Russia, two of the Big
Three, will take a prominent part in the
organization.
I agree with my honourable
friend from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen)
that if Russia and the United States and
Great Britain cannot work in close co-operation for the maiptenance of world peace, then
the outlook will be gloomy indeed. And a
powerful factor in helping to make the new
organizýation work is the sense of imminent
danger in the mind of every civilized, yes, and
of every semi-civilized person, and the awful
conviction of what another war will mean. As
honourable members know, when a group of
people are fighting like cats and dogs, and suddenly a great danger threatens them collectively, they promptly compromise their difficulties, for the time being at any rate, and
concentrate on mutual protection. A sense
of imminent danger prevails today throughout the whole civilized world. It is nonsense
to think that if a war breaks out in some part
of the world the rest of the world may escape
its ever-widening repercussions. That was the
view of the people of the United States after
the first Great War, but it is no longer held.
No country can isolate itself from the dangers
that threaten the peace of the world. So the
sense of imminent danger creates a community of interest which in turn tends to unite
the peoples of the world in an endeavour to
preserve the peace. I am not despondent over
the failure of the conference of foreign ministers in' London. The frank discussion between those gentlemen was all to the good.
Another matter I should like to emphasize
is the effect of world opinion. There is such
a thing as public opinion, and I am sure
honourable senators have noticed the efforts
being made by various countries to get their
cases before the court of public opinion
throughout the world. It was of some sigHon. Mr. CRERAR.

nificance that after the failure of the Foreign
Ministers' Conference in London, Mr. Byrnes
gave to the Press a statement that went to
every corner of the world. People of almost
every nation, be they forward or backward,
knew the reasans given by Mr. Byrnes for
the failure of the conference ta reach its
objective. It was not very long afterwards
that Mr. Molotov was telling the world his
version of the incident. That could only mean
that the Russian Foreign Minister in London
felt the need of getting his case before the
court of world opinion. If he had taken the
attitude that Russia was going ta travel her
own way and not consider the rest of the
world, he would not have gone to the trouble
of having a conference and getting ber case
before the world. Later on, in the House of
Commons, Mr. Bevin gave the Britisb version
of why the conference failed to reach its
objective.
May I cite two other instances? A few
days ago I was interested in reading in the
morning newspaper a statement from the new
Nationalist leader in the Dutch East Indies,
where they are seeking to get self-government
from Holland. I trust honourable members
will forgive me if I do not mention the
leader's name, because to me it is unpronounceable.
It was significant that this
gentleman went on the radio in order to put
the case of the Malayan peopleHon. Mr. DUPUIS: Indonesians.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: -before
the world.
That is an evidence that even in that remote
part of the Pacific the idea has taken hold
that if the natives are ta get anywhere they
must be able to make some sort of appeal
to world opinion.
The second instance which I wish to cite is
that of the controversy at present raging
between the Jews and the Arabs on the question of peopling Palestine. I am sure honourable senators have had the same experience
I have had; scarcely a day passes that I do
not get some bit of literature intended to
impress me with the value and strength of one
particular side of this issue. I am bound ta
say that a good deal of this propaganda goes
to the wastepaper basket. Why are the Arabs
and the Jewish people making an appeal ta
world opinion? It is because they recognize
that in the final analysis world opinion is
going to be a powerful factor in any settiement that may be reached.
The San Francisco conference, and others
that are taking place, such as the one in
Quebec at the present time, are all agencies
for the creation of world opinion. I am sure

OCTOBER 25, 1945
that other honourable senators are gratified,
as I am, that that is the case, because it is
obvious that only by means of the widest
publicity, and by getting the greatest number
of people considering, discussing and forming
judgments on these questions, can some solution be reached.
I just want to say a few words more, and I
apologize for speaking so long on the first
occasion.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I wish to comment on
the part that I think Canada can play in
this new organization, and the part thàt she
played in the war. I had some little part in
the supervision of Canada's part in the war
effort. The part that she played was a great
and glorious one, a very necessary part. We
do not realize yet, honourable senators, how
close the cause of freedom and liberty was to
complete disaster in the early years of this war.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I sometimes reflect
that if the German-Nazi power, combined
with that of Italy and Japan, had triumphed,
the story today would be vastly different.
Great Britain and the freedom-loving countries will never be nearer disaster, and escape,
than they were in the early years of this
war. If Britain had fallen, and she might
have done so if it had not been for a few
colossal mistakes on the part of Germany,
the South American countries would probably
have given their adherence to the new power
in Europe, Africa and Asia. North America
would -then have been left alone, the citadel
of freedom and liberty in the world. Now,
because of the part that she played in the
war, Canada occupies a very high and honourable place in the council of the nations.
Just here I should like to pay pribute to
the permanenf staff of Canada's Department
of External Affairs. I think that in the
senior meibers of that staff, and in the
Ambassadors abroad, Canada has a group of
men who are unequalled in any other nation.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: They deserve our
thanks for the work they did on behalf of
Canada prior to the San Francisco Conference.
We in Canada are a modest people, and it
has been surprising to me at times to hear
how highly the representatives of other counp
tries evaluate Canada's world position. We
are perhaps the leaders of the second-class
nations in the world to-day. I do hope and
pray that in the future we may realize our
opportunities as well as our responsibilities,
47704-11J

and thus play our part fully in the effort to
make this new agreement work. The agreement with the Council will defermine the
extent of the aid which we may be called
upon to give; but I say that we should support to the utmost of our ability the charter
and the organization that gave birth to it,
because only in that way can future disaster
be prevented. Of the dangers that threaten
the successful operation of this charter, I
would say that the greatest is suspicion. Suspicion is one of the deadly sins. I do not
know whether Dante so classified it, but at
any rate it is deadly. If we are suspicious
of the motives or thoughts of others, if we are
suspicious of what they propose to do, our
suspicion will undermine the possibility of
success.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I think too we must
be conscious of the fact that there has been
a great loss in the world of moral and spiritual
values.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Mankind cannot pass
through six years of war close on the heels
of a previous war without the moral conscience
suffering from the terrifie impact. After all
the progress of the world has always been
based on spiritual and moral factors. If we
permit moral and spiritual factors to become
weakened, dead or obliterated, we make it
more difficult if not impossible to bring about
the kind of world that is necessary if we are
to have permanent peace.
If this United Natione organization suffers
the same fate suffered by the League of
Nations, the consequences will be too terrible
to contemplate.
Humanity's margin that
keeps it on the onward and upward path is not
very wide. When we consider a country like
Germany, which was great and may be great
again in the many arts of peace, we will
realize that the influences which corrupted
her and put her on the wrong path were
largely the product of the last hundred years.
I often think the so-called "intellectuals" of
the world have often led the people down very
false paths.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: You would not call
Hitler and Goering intellectuals, would you?
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: No; I did not say
they were intellectuals.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: They were the false
prophets.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: There was Rosenberg.

146

SENATE

Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Long before the time
of Hitler and Goering there were people
recognized in Germany as great intellectuals.
However, ,what I am trying to point out at
the moment is that the failure of the International Organization would probably within
twenty-five or thirty years lead to another
world war. In my humble judgment, be it
right or wrong, another world war would
destroy what is left of our Christian civilization and set the world on paths leading back
to the jungle, and centuries of slow and painful
work would be necessary to restore it to its
present position. It seems to me, therefore,
that we have a tremendous stake in this
charter. If it fails, there is nothing but disaster
ahead. If it succeeds, then once the troubles
and difficulties of today are passed the world
will march steadily forward to still higher
levels of civilization and progress.
Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, if you will permit me,
I should like to reply to a question that was
raised in respect to my earlier suggestion that
this charter would be signed and ratified by
His Majesty the King on behalf of Canada.
During the recess I asked for some information from the Department of External Affairs,
whirh has given me this statement:
The Charter was signed by the Prime Minister
and the Minister of Justice under the authority
of a ful power issued by the King on the recomIn
mendation of his Canadian Ministers.
accordance with customary practice the instrument of ratification would be similarly issued
by the King under his Sign Manual at the
request of the Canadian Government.
I presume that means as the King of Canada.
It goes on:
The Great Seal of Canada would be affixed
to the instrument.
Aside from this, honourable senators, I was
in doubt about a point that has probably
occurred te the minds of honourable senators,
namely, in what respect this international
agreement differs fronm one such as the Food
and Agriculture Organization agreement, the
bill sanctioning which was recently passed by
Parliament and assented to by the Administrator. I made an oral inquiry about this and
have been advised that prior to the San
Francisco Conference there was some doubt
as to whether the international agreement
would.be entered into between the heads of
states or between governments. That agreement was signed under the authority of a full
power issued by the King, and the instrument
of ratification was issued after Parliament had
Hon. Mr. LACASSE.

signified its assent. The Food and Agriculagreement, however, is
ture Organization
between governments, and as such it is
approved by the representatives of the King.
The honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig) has already given to the House the
nanies of the Conference delegates who were

prescent at the committee this morning.

I

should like to say what a great pleasure it was
to me to listen to their statements. Mr.
Graydon's reference to the very important
services rendered at San Francisco by the
representatives of the Senate was particularly
gratifying. I want to thank the Chairman of
the Committee on External Affairs (Hon. Mr.
McRae), for arranging the committee meeting,
and to express my personal pride at being a
member of a legislative body which can produce such excellent addresses as those we have
heard this afternoon and this evening.
The resolution was adopted.
MEAT RATIONING, CONSUMPTION,
EXPORT AND PRODUCTION
INQUIRY

Honourable
Government.

Mr. MrRAE inquired of the

1. In our ration limitations why was no
increased allowance made for the use of mutton
as compared to beef or pork, as obviously
mutton does not lend itself to being cut up
to provide as much actual meat as either beef
or pork?
2. What is our present annual consumption
per capita in pounds and percentages, of, (a)
beef; (b) pork; (c) mutton and lamb?
3. Is any mutton exported in carcass to Great
Britain or Europe and, if so, what is the total
so exported since the beginning of the war?
4. What steps, if any, are being taken to avoid
this Faull the large surplus of mutton which
existed last Fall?
5. Is mutton being canned for export? If so,
where is it being canned and what is the con-

templated volume likely to be required?
6. What is the prevailing price (on foot) at

point of canning for sheep bouglit for canning
purposes?
7. What was the estimated number of sheep
in Canada in 1944 and how does this compare
with the number of sheep in Canada as shown
by the first census following Confederation?
8. Liver being a constituent part of UNRRA's
ranned meat preparation, has any firem or
individual in Canada holding a contract to
provide same had to discontinue, even tenmporarily, on account of inability to obtain the
necessary liver? If so, when and where?
9. Have arrangements been made for canning
horse meat for export to Europe? If so, to what
country is this horse meat product exported?

10. Where is this horse meat being canned?
11. What is the contemplated production of
canned horse meat?

OCTOBER 25, 1945
12. What price is paid for horses at point
of canning?

pork on the local market when the private purchaser has no facilities for rendcring the same
and conserving the fat?

I
lion. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
have an answer to the hoonurable gentleman's
inquiry. I have already passed a copy of the
answer to him, and with permission I would
ask to have it placed upon Hansard.
1. Broadly, the plan followed in grouping
meats into categories in the Consumer Meat
Value Ration Chart was aecording to the
amount of meat contained in each retail eut
after removal of bone, gristie and excessive
fat. The same general plan was followed for
aIl classes of meat-beef, veal, lamb, mutton
and pork.
On October Il a concession was made in
respect of certain mutton duts which appeared
to be. rece'iving poor consumner acceptance.
The following were moved fromn Category D
(2ý lbs. per coupon) to Category E (3 lbs. per
coupon);
Flank

2. The last available per capita figures of
meat consumption in Canada are those issued
by the Dominion Bureau of Statisties for the
year 1945 and are as follows:

give the following exports to 'the United
Kinagdom:
459,024 pounds

1945 (to Sept. M0)...357,249 pounds
4. There was no restriction on the export of
sheep to the United States fromn September,
1944 to July, 1945. Following the discontinuance of export of sheep to the United States,
an agreement was negotiated with the United
Kingdomn for the export of medium and
higher qualities of mutton. Mutton of lower
quality can be incorporated in canned meats
heing manufactured for shipment to UNRRA
and the liberated areas.

5. A formula for canned meat heing manufactured for UNRRA includes up to 4 per
cent of boneless mutton. Canning lines are
operating at the following centres:
Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary, Saskatoon,
Winnipeg, Toronto, Kitchener, Hamilton and
Montreal.
The use of boneless mutton in canned meat
is optional and the quantity that may ho
used will largely ciepend on availabîlity.
6. The average prices per hundredweight
paid in September this year for low grade
sheep of the quality that might be use-d for
canning wcre as follows:

SENATE
NATIONAL RAILWAYS AUDITORS BILL
ANSWER TO INQUIRY

On the Orders of the Day.
Hon. M-r. ROBERTSON:
Honourable
senators, I should like to reply to a question
asked by the honourable senator for Alma
(Honourable Mr. Ballantyne) respecting the
fees paid to the auditors appointed by the
Canadian National Railways. I have already
communicated the information to him personally.
The amount paid last year was
$51,800, and it is not expected that there
will be any change during the present year.
Hon. Mr. LBGER: I think the honourable
gentleman from Alma wanted to know a little
more than that. He asked whether there had
been an increase in the fees since 1931-1932.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I did not so
understand the question. I personally communicated to the honourable gentleman from
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

Alma the information that the fees last year
were $51,800, and that they were approximately the same for the year before. How
this amount compares with what was paid as
far back as the years mentioned by my honourable friend from L'Acadie (Hon. Mr.
Leger). I cannot say.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Honourable senators,
the business of the railway has increased so
much in the last few years that more auditing
would be required, and I can understand that
there might be an increase in the au-ditors'
fees. Usually these charges are based more
or less on the actual work the auditors have
to perform.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I am not so
advised by the Department of Transport.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: I should not be surprised if there were an increase.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, October
30, at 8 p.m.

APPENDIX
BEAUTIFICATION 0F OTTAWA
ADDRESS BY MR. JACQUES GREBER TO
MEMBERS 0F PARLIAMENT

Mr. JACQUES GREBER: Mr. Minister,
honourable members of the Senate and of the
House of Commons:
I have been many times in this beautiful
house, even late in the evening during your
sessions. I know your work, sa my address
will be as brief as possible.
Hlowever, I beg to express, in a few words,
my deep gratitude for the honour you have
made me, in coming ta hear how we propose
to proceed for laying out the future of your
The Honourable Mr.
national capital.
Fournier has, too kindly introduced me and
praised rny merits in such a way that I certainly shaîl have to caîl for your indulgence.
The j ay of being in this wonderful country,
after five years of sarrow and sometimes af
despair, for a rnan whose profession is to foresee, and efforts to create better conditions of
lufe, is like a great ray of hope. And I arn
greatly indebted to your Prime Minister ta
bave given me this j1oy, in asking our chief,
General de Gaulle, ta let me corne to work
with you.
City planning is, or ought ta be, really considered as an obviaus common place. Far
from being a luxury or an academnic matter of
studies, it is, it must be, the essential af
sound polities. It is the safest investment of
the community. When reasonably canceived,
it is as preciaus as lufe, because its airn is ta
arganize if e, with methad, foresight, dignity,
comfort and pleasure.
A good city plan brings a good civie lufe, it
is the material chart af social order, af strang
finance, of sure prosperity. And the best plans
are those of great vision, Daniel Burnbarn,
the master of city planning in the United
States, wha made plans for Chicago, San Francisco, and continued, and extended the Lenlent Plan ai Washington, used ta stress this
great truth: "Make no small plans, they are
a waste." They certainly cast twice and give
less satisfactory services than master conceptians.
Naw is it apportune ta speak af great plans
alter the amazing efforts, the exhausting expenditures, the buman sacrifices made during
the atrociaus war just ended? Should nat we
wait for better tirnes, af narrnal ecanomie and
pohitical conditions? I arn afraid this wauld
be another waste.

A .wide planning is a factor of rapid recovery, and the essential perhaps. Reconstruction of normal life and reconversion of industries are precisely depending upon rational,
careful and broadminded planning. In France,
for instance, a stricken, irnpoverished, weakened, devilishly devastated and demoralized
country, a 'fter four and a half years of slavery,
we dare to hope in greater, younger and finer
civie life, than when we enjoyed the happy
years of pre-war prosperity. We stili believe
in a better world, and my present visit to Canada, especially to Ottawa, decidedly canfirms
my optimistic hopes. for Canada is perhaps of
ail the allied nations the true land of hope
and of unlimited future.
City planning, which I caîl the technique of
hurnan geography, -is made of the harmony and
of the equilibrium. of man and nature. Need
I tell you what nature has given ta Ottawa?
An ideal setting of untouched beauty; a fortunate and symbolie association of AngloSaxon and Latin cultures, a destiny of universal friendship.
By its arnazing and generous contribution
in men and resources in the world's liberation
war, Canada bas acquired an unquestionable
position arnong the great nations. Its capital
must and will grdw at the rhythm of the
national pragress.
You certainly remember the prophecy of
your great statesman Wilfrid Laurier, in 1893:
1 consequently keep a green spot in xny hcart
for the city of Ottawa and when the day cornes,
as it will corne by and by, it shail be tny
pleasure and that of my colleagues, I arn sure,
to make the city af Ottawa the centre of the
intellectual development of this country and
the Washingtàn of the North.
And thîs explains why the decision of yaur
Gavernment to. make the plan of the capital
a lasting and living mernorial to the war has
been so warrnly praised in Europe, and given
as an example that sbould be repeatedly followed. This conception, however, of a memarial city~plan does not exclude, in the general
Iayout ai the plan, the contribution af plastic
works af art, sculptural or pictural, to coimmernorate glorious feats of the war. But they
will be a part of the great work, and placed
in the proper setting, to their best advantage.
The few illustrations which will follow rny
remarks will endeavour to show the universal
trend toward better cities, the methods used
to make themn of benefit to the people. to elimmnate utopical and dcceiving schemes, to bring,
with better conditions of housing, of trafflc

and transportation, of working, of enjoying
education, rest or recreation, to bring with all
those material improvements, moral progress
and consequently social order. As you will
see, city planning has no relation with unnecessary adornment or building speculations, Real
beauty is always the result of sober lines, good
proportions and good taste. These qualities
often proceed from restrictive rules.
Therefore, we reinforce our plans by regulations, zoning, by-laws, building codes, to bring
order and discipline, to stress public interests
against the abuse of private rights.
Consequently, to make Ottawa and its
environs more beautiful will rather be an easy
task, and in some instances a costless programme: protection of nature, control and
restriction of building density, all measures
that involve no private loss, no extravagant
expenses, but on the contrary promote realestate value in a more prosperous community,
for a healthier population.
You might be interested to know the main
lines of our programme of work, and a few
details about the vast problem which has been
entrusted to us.
Let me tell you, in the first place, how I
conceive that such a problem should be
treated.
In a little more than half a century, Ottawa
had become such an important city, from its
modest Bytown childhood, that in 1915, a
most comprehensive work had already been
done under the auspices of the Federal District Commission, with the valuable contribution of Mr. Edward Bennett, city planner of
Chicago. This first plan known as the Holt
Report, and many studies made a few years
later by the late Nolan Cauchon, as well as
the plans I have been preparing between 1937
and 1939, are the basic elements from which
we shall develop and extend the programme
of the work. In other words, we shall continue, as others will, in the future, the long
and common endeavour to make and prepare
the city to the scale of its constant progress.
Now the problem is quite larger than what
it was in 1915 or even in 1939.
The exceptional function of Ottawa, not
on-ly Capital of the Dominion of Canada, but
also city of great conventions, of national or
international conferences, professional congresses and worldwide manifestations, must
appear in a plan that preserves and emphasizes its natural frame and environment.
Welcome, dignity, stately public buildings in
a frame of gardens, vast hotel and recreational
facilities, art and educational centres, large
tourism possibilities, without neglecting modern
housing and efficient working equipment. This
r'sion must become a tangible fact, and made

a realistie scheme along the following principles:
The capital region, as outlined by the
recommendations of the Joint Committee of
the Senate and of the House of Commons,
August 1, 1944, covers an area of 900 square
miles, extending approximately 35 miles NW,
20 miles NE, 15 miles SW, and 15 miles SE,
from the Peace Tower. Of this territory, 364
sq. miles are in the Province of Ontario, 536
sq. miles are in the Province of Quebec, a
symbolic demonstration of the bi-racial Unity.
The cities of Ottawa and Hull, and sixteen
municipalities of various importance are included in the region, with a total population
of 252,672. Their present built up a-rea is
approximately 19 sq. miles, leaving 479 sq.
miles of farm lands, 332 sq. miles of woodlands
and 70 sq. miles of waters (rivers and lakes).
Before attempting to make plans, a methodical and profound survey of all existing conditions is the first work to consider. It will
depend upon its accuracy and extensive research, that we can reach the appropriate
conclusions toward the far-reaching planning
and equipment of the capital and its environs,
in accord with the various functions, present
and future, of the different parts -of this large
territory. The quality of the survey is the
essential guarantee of the efficiency and of the
economy of the plan, also of the speed of its
elaboration.
PRELIMINARY

PROGRAMME

OF WORK

1. The demographic analysis will determine
the reasonable limits of the urban development
in the best conditions of modern housing.
2. The economic survey will show the most
favourable localizations for commerce and
industry.
3. Transportation and traffic will be coordinated to serve the common needs of the various
inhabited centres, in function of their relative
activities.
4. Public services will be distributed to avoid
unnecessary waste of time, money and energy.
5. Cultural and recreational centres will
assure their permanent enjoyment and an
easy access, from every part of the residential
units.
6. A special study will be devoted to the
already mentioned particular function of the
capital, in regard to its international importance, due (1) to the unquestionable position
acquired by Canada in the World War, among
the great nations, (2) to the natural beauty
and the extensive possibilities of the site of
Ottawa, and (3) to the natural qualifications
of Canada as the meeting point of both AngloSaxon and Latin cultures, on American soil.

OCTOBER 25, 1945
7. As a consequence of the above special
function, the parks and reservation system
will be exceptionally developed, within and
outside the urban zones.
Beside the normal equipment of the cities,
towns and villages, in publie gardens, parks,
sport centres (including an Olymupie Stadium)
and local playgrounds, eonsidered as public
services, the larger part of the open spaces and
f orest reservations will consist in the preservation of the natural scenery, either by acquired
property, or by protectcd zones under special
restrictions, by-laws and adequate zoning,
under proper control.
The recreational equipment of thc region
will include, at ýappropriate places: camping
sites, ski grounds, skating clubs, hunting or
flshing reservations, parkways, horse riding,
bicycle and footpaths, organized trails, hostels
and shelters, log cabins, belvederes, bathing
beaches, model farms, Canadian botanical
garden and eventually a Canadian zoological
garden. Special protections will be applied to
private golf and country clubs.
8. The power, light, water and sewage
equipment will be proposed in accordance
with the urban and rural planning.
The whole study (survey, plans, by-laws,
and proposals) will be embodied in a general
report to be prepared, with the assistance of
Canadian experts, engineers, architects, and
specialists.
The work will be submitted to a National
Advisory Committee, ýcomposed of personalities qualified by their functions or their
competence.
The Federal District Commission, by its
experiences, will, 'I am sure, be in a position to make a substantial contribution to the
work. The city of Ottawa, the city of Hull
and the entire capital region are greatly
indebted to this great institution. Its achievements on both sides of the Ottawa River, and
far up the Gatineau River, deserve the highest
praise.
We are assured of the full co-operation of
the cities of Ottawa and Hull and of ahl municipalities involved in the master plan.
Permanent contact for advice, information
and requiremenýts will be established with the
Parliament, with alI Departmental offices as
well as with the great public services such as
the Railways administrations, industrial corporations, etc. The public spirited citizen will
also be represented in the Advisory Committee, and adequate publication of the progress of the work ýwill be periodically
released for maintaining public interest in
our work.
47704-12

Such procedure will permit to undertake,
while the plan is beîng prepared, such emergency work as may seem desirable, and procure employment for mýany classes of workmanship.
Definite operations, on pre-planned sehedule,
will assure the rapid reconversion of various
public works and building industries.
The plan we are going to prepare will be
a long range scheme, of gradual and flexible
execution, in accord with the emergency of
tbe needs and the financial possibilities.

HYDRO-ELECTRIC DEVELOPMENT
NEW BRUNSWICK
INQUIRY

AND

IN

DISCUSSION

Hon. J. E. SINCLAIR rose in accordance
with the following notice:
That he will eall the attention of the Senate
to the proceedings and report of the Standing
Committee of the Senate on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours in the session of 1944
on the possibilities of developing tidal power
at the confluence of the Petitcodiac and
Mesnramcook rivers in the province of New
Brunswick and will inquire:
(a) Has action been taken by the Government to implemient the recommendation of the
report of the cominittee?
(b) If so, has the investigation been carried
on by the Federal Governmeot, or by the
Goverument of the province of New Brunswick,
or jointly by both?
(c) What hydro-electrie engineers were engaged to maake the investigation?
(d) Has a report of the investigation been
received by the Federal Government and, if so,
when will At be tabled?
He said: Honourable senators, it may be in
order for me to explain shortly my object in
bringing this inquiry before the Senate. It
will be remembered that, as a result of a
motion by the late Senator C. W. Robinson
in the session of 1944 a committee was
appointed to go into this matter, and that thie
committee in its report recommended investigation by competent engineers into the possibilities of developing tidal power at the
confluence of the Petitcodiae and Memramcook rivers in New Brunswick. An eminent
engineer, Dr. W. R. Turnbull, appeared before
the committee and gave what was, in my

SMVBED EDITION

152

SENATE

opinion and in the opinion of the committee,
a very favourable report on the possibilities
of developing a large volume of electrical
power at that site. He was supported by
Mr. J. F. Parsons, President of the Moncton
Board of Trade, and by Honourable J. Walter
Jones, Premier of Prince Edward Island.
Senators from New Brunswick are aware
that the federal government has acted on
the recommendation of our committee. I am
encouraged to say this because the leader on
this side (Hon. Mr. Robertson) has graciously
handed me the answer to my inquiry. The
federal government engaged the firm of A. G.
Acres & Company, consulting engineers of
Niagara Falls, Ontario, to make the survey
during the past season. Since my inquiry
was put on the Order Paper a return has
been brought down in another place showing
the correspondence in the matter; but up to
the 2nd of October the Government had
received no report of the investigation. I do
not know whether the answer to my inquiry
covers the period from that date to the present
time or not. However, I understand there are
two reasons for the delay. First, the airways
company which was engaged to take an aerial
photograph of the site has not yet supplied
it to the engineers; and, secondly, the head
of the firm of consulting engineers passed
away.
I might explain what prompted me to bring
this matter to the attention of the Senate.
Honourable members are doubtless aware that
on October 15 the Minister of Justice made a
statement in another place outlining the
progress of the negotiations between Canada
and the United States for the joint developIt
ment of the St. Lawrence Waterway.
appears that the agreement between the two
countries is now before the Congress of the
United States and may be expected to reach
the Parliament of Canada in the near future.
Should that work be undertaken it will make
available to the central provinces a large
block of cheap electric energy.
With all deference to honourable members
from the central provinces, I share the opinion
of many Canadians that the economie situation of Canada is unbalanced because of the
fact that the great development of hydroelectric energy in Ontario and Quebec has
built up the industrial strength of those provinces, while the lack of hydro-electric energy
in the Maritime and Prairie Provinces has
been a serious handicap to their industrial
growth, and leaves them at a marked disadvantage in the home market when their
manufacturing products come into competition with those of central Canada; and they
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR.

are forced to rely on an export market. This
state of affairs, as I say, leads to an unbalanced economy.
I think it wise to bring the matter to the
attention of the Senate at this time since, as
is well known, it was realized during the
Confederation debates that in order to counterbalance the influence of the large and
thickly populated provinces and protect the
small thinly populated provinces the membership of the Senate would have to be on a
territorial rather than a population basis. It
was realized that only in this way could the
rights of the small provinces as well as the
rights of minorities be safeguarded. It being
the function of the Senate of Canada to safeguard these rights, I think the question of
hydro-electric development in New Brunswick
should arouse the interest of all honourable
members.
To give you the complete picture, I am
going to refer to works, projects and expenditures that it is necessary for this country to
undertake in the post-war era. We must develop our resources and encourage more
population. We must do this in such a way
that the outlying provinces will get their fair
share of the benefits, the quid pro quo te
which they are entitled under Confederation
-something
which the concentration of industry in central Canada does not give them
today. In 1928 the Canadian National Advisory Committee presented a report stating
that when the St. Lawrence Waterway was
completed, it would make available to central
Canada about 2,000,000 horsepower in electrical energy. Such an addition to the present development in that arca would bring
about a situation that would not be in the
best interests of the outlying provinces. These
are matters that must be considered if we are
te develop this country in a balanced way.
In the debate on the Address we listened
to a very informative speech by the honourable senator from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr.
Gershaw), in which he referred to the improvements that were needed in the Prairie
Provinces, where, in order te reclaim and improve the area known as the Palliser Triangle
from recurring periods of drought, it is necessarv to extend the benefits of irrigation and
make available the waters of rivers now going to waste. Such an undertaking requires
a large expenditure of money, but I think the
expenditure is justified; and sooner than we
now expect, the project may be undertaken
by the Government of Canada. My concern
is that expenditures of this kind should be
made in such a way as to benefit all sections
of Canada.

OCTOBER 30, 1945
There are many things that could be done
in the Maritime Provinces for the benefit of
those provinces and Canada as a whole. The
basic requirement of industry is cheap power.
The report of the committee to which I
refer, and the investigation that was ordered,
gave promise of a large development of cheap
electrical power in the province of New
Brunswick; and if the project is feasible, I
submit that it should be undertaken at as
e'arly a date as possible.
Of course the Maritime Provinces have
other resources that must be developed. I
refer more particularly to the province of
Nova Scotia, where at Sydney we have immense deposits of coal adjacent to the steel
mills. In the neighbouring .colony of Newfoundland there are deposits of iron ore that
would keep that industry going for many
years to come. Also, the shipbuilding industry in the province of Nova Scotia should
be started at an early date, for it would give
employment to our people and create nearby
markets. The harbours .there are open and
available twelve months of the year, and there
is no reason why such an industry should' not
be undertaken.
Another situation that requires early attention in the Maritimes is the renewal of and
the further development of the dykes on the
marsh lands around the Bay of Fundy, where
roughly 10,000 acres of as good land as you
will find in Canada are practically idle because of the destruction of dykes built in
those areas by early settlers with hand labour.
It is scarcely feasible to renew them by hand
labour, but with ýthe advantages of modern
machinery and with some expenditure the
land could be brought into production.
During the war the agriculturalists throughout Canada responded nobly to the request
for greater production. In the Maritimes we
increased our livestock, beef and dairy cattle,
hogs and poultry by many times. We were
enabled to do that by reason of the fact that
the Federal Government absorbed the freight
rate on coarse grain coming from the head of
the lakes to the Maritime Provinces. We find
ourselves at the present time with a larger
number of livestock on our farms than we have
ever had before. With the present short crop
in the West. it appears that it will be difficult
for us to get the necessary food to maintain
our livestock. I submit, therefore, that it is a
sound proposition for the Federal Government
to take up the problem of dykes on our marsh
lands, so that we can grow within reach of our
livestock the necessary coarse grain and hay.
I wish to impress on this Chamber that the
basis of our hopes for manufacturing in the
Maritime Provinces is cheap power. We have
47704-121

153

just come through a very serious war, and we
have learned a good many lessons during that
time. We have learned the danger from acrial
bombing and of the atomic bomb. Great
Britain, with her manufacturing industries,
learned how necessary it was not to have such
industries concentrated in one small area. We
know that the very best assurance against a
recurrence of war is preparedness for war.
Therefore, I say an added reason why this
project should be looked into and a report
brought down at once, if possible, is the fact
that if the hydro-electric development were
proceeded with it would make for a better
distribution of industries throughout Canada.
Cheaper power in the Maritime Provinces
would help to increase our population and
would create employment. There is nothing
like cheap power and proximity to natural
resources for attracting industries.
I mention these points, honourable senators,
just to show the importance of this proposed
development and the necessity for having the
investigators' report at the earliest possible
date. So strongly do I feel about the possibilities of power development at the confluence
of these two rivers that I say without hesitation that if the report proves to be as favourable as the one we got, the federal government
should declare the work to be for the general
advantage of Canada and undertake it as a
straight federal proposition. I do not hesitate
to take that ground because I think it is the
right one. I hope that my honourable friend
the leader of the House (Hon. Mr. Robertson)
may see fit to encourage the Department of
Mines and Resources to obtain the report from
the engineers as quickly as possible, so that
when we are required to consider proposed
expenditures for other large projects we shall
know exactly what we are doing for every
part of Canada.
Hon. ANTOINE J. LEGER: Honourable
senators, I want to collaborate and say a few
words in approbation of the remarks of my
honourable friend from Queen's (Hon. Mr.
Sinclair). When, about two years ago, the
proposed development of the tidal power of
the Petitcodiac and Memramcook rivers was
brought to the attention of this House by the
late Honourable Senator C. W. Robinson, it
received not only the sympathetic but 1
should say the enthusiastic attention of the
Senate, of the other House and of the Government of Canada, so much so that the proposal was submitted to a firm of engineers
for a report. If the project is feasible, then
it is to be hoped that the Senate, which took
the initiative in the matter, and the other
House and the Government, will interest

SENATE
themselves in the enterprise and see that the
construction is undertaken without delay.
In doing so they would to a degree compensate the Maritime Provinces for some of
the sacrifices they made when they entered
Confederation: the sacrifice of their natural
market, in the United States; the sacrifice of
their main industries, which eventually, for
reasons that I need not mention, moved to
Central Canada; the sacrifice of their population, which followed the industries; and
many other sacrifices, unnecessary to mention
at this time, which have ever since handicapped the Maritime Provinces.
All these impediments were anticipated by
the provinces down by the Atlantic when they
joined the Union. But their generosity of
heart and their patriotism for a greater and
more united Canada seized them and carried
them along, with the result that they led the
way to Confederation.
To remove some of the impediments bound
to follow the union, the British North America Act provided for the construction of the
Intercolonial Ra.ilway, connecting Halifax
with the river St. Lawrence. It was well
understood, although not so mentioned in the
Act, that this railway was to be owned by
the Government and operated by them in a
way specially favourable to the Maritime
Provinces. All went well for a time, but the
Intercolonial Railway now forms part of the
Canadian National Railways, and limited
consideration is given to the Maritime Provinces. I refer especially to freight rates.
I have made these few observations, not
with the idea of recriminating against the rest
of Canada, but merely to show that after all
there is a moral obligation on the part of the
more fortunate provinces to come to the
rescue of the ever willing but always handicapped Maritime Provinces.
So, honourable senators, should this project
prove feasible it is to be hoped that it will
receive the support necessary to its completion and operation. Then the Maritime Provinces, with an abundance of cheap power
available, with the energy and enthusiasm
ever characteristic of their people, will move
forward for their own betterment, but remaining always willing, as in the past, to lend
assistance, to endure sacrifices if need be, and
to make this country as a whole a happier,
more united, progressive and attractive place
in which to live.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Honourable senators, I
have no desire to find fault, but simply wish
to keep the record straight. I thought I
understood the honourable senator to say that
the Maritime Provinces had been discriminHon. Mr. LEGER.

ated against in regard to freight rates. Is it
not a fact that there are special freight rates
for the Maritime Provinces?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I said limited consideration had been given with regard to freight
rates.
Hon. Mr. EULER: But there are special
freight rates for the Maritime Provinces.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: There has been some
reduction, but not the reduction that we
should have.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: How much should you
have?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Well, we should have
enough to protect our industries.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Free rates would be
very satisfactory.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Honourable senators,
may I ask a question of the honourable
gentleman who made the inquiry (Hon. Mr.
Sinclair) and the honourable gentleman from
L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Leger)? As one who was
a member of the committee and heard the very
interesting evidence that was given last year
by Dr. Turnbull and others, I have wondered
if the governments of the Maritime Provinces
have taken any steps by themselves to present
the interests that have been so ably represented here direct to the Government of
Canada?
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: The province of
New Brunswick, in which the property in
question is situated, co-operated with the
federal government in having the survey
macle by the firm of engineers I have mentioned, and contributed approximately half
the cost of that survey. According to the
return I have referred to the full cost of the
survey was not known at the time. In the
first instance the cost was estimated at $50,000,
later that estimate was increased to cover
certain unforseen expenses. The Government
of New Brunswick paid one-half of the $50,000
and, if I remember rightly, undertook to pay
anything in excess of the original estimate.
So far as I am aware, nothing was paid by the
other provinces, the site of this proposed
development being entirely within the province
of New Brunswick. When the late Senator
the investigation he
Robinson proposed
stated that the province of New Brunswick
was so much interested in the possibility of
developing this tidal power that the project
was mentioned in the Speech from the Throne
which opened the 1944 session of the provincial
legislature.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I .desire to make
these specific answers to the honourable gentleman's inquiry:

OCTOBER 30, 1945

(b) The investigation hias been carried, on
at the expense cf both governrnents.
(c) The firmn of A. ýG. Acres & Cornpany,

GOLD PRODUCTION IN CANADA
DISCUSSION

Hon. A. D. MeRAE rose in accordance witb
the following notice:
That lie will caîl the attention of the Senate
to the devel.opment of -our gold resources, and
wbart an active programme te increase our gold
production could mean to the general prosperity
of Canada, particularly in the employment of
labour, the e8tablishment of new communities
and the importance of gold ln taking care of
our foreign obligations.
He said: Honourable members, in these
days cf my declining commercial responsibilities, 1 usually find that in many discussions
in this House I arn net in the position cf a
personally interested. party; but I should like
te. state that arnong my remaining business is
gold inining, and the remarks, suggestions,
and recommendations that I may have te
make during my talk will be based on my
actual experience and the general knowledge
which I have acquired cf its preblems and
its possibilities. Se far as possible, I will try
te divorce ail personal interests from my views
and treat the gold problems of Canada on an
entirely national basis. You will be the best
judges as to how far I succeed. in that aim.
Tbe romance of gold bas carried on tbrcugb
the centuries. The allure of gold is as strong
today as it ever was. When we review history we find that gold has been sougbt for at
least five tbousand ycars, probably seven
thousand years. It may interest honourable
senators to know that prior to the outbreak
of the war a British company was successfully mining the tailings frern an old Egyptian mine supposed to have been worked at
least five thousand years ago. The recovery
made by the Egyptians at that time was net
very thorougb.
The first mention we 'have cf prospecting,
the advance guard cf industrial mining, is
in the time cf the seventh king cf the third
dynasty of Egypt, about 3,000 years B.C. The
first prospecting expedition on record is that
cf Jason of Greece, who set eut in bis ship
the Arqo te rob thie Armenians. That was
in 1250 B.C. This trip resulted in wbat is
called the myth of the Golden Fleece. I arn
not sure that this was a myth. I arn of tbe
opinion that the old prospectors found that

155

by running water and sand or gravel containing gold over the fleece of sheep, the gold,
being heavier than water, settled into the wool,
and if the fleece was not dried and shaken out
once in a while it would soon assume a golden
colour. In fact it is iuteresting to note that
that principle is stili used in modern dredging,
but matting instead of sheep's fleece is used
in the side flumes to catch the fine flake gold
that otherwise would go back into the dredge
pond.
The first great gold rush recorded in history
was Spain's invasion 'of South America in
the l6th Century. Then two centuries later
came the outstanding discovery of gold in
California in 1848-ninety-seven years ago.
That discovery produced, 1 believe, $550,000,000 in gold in the first ten years, and
brought about a prosperity sucli as had neyer
been known before. The whole world was
affected by that d.iscovery and as a resuit, if
I remember rightly, the gold reserves of the
world were increased something like 50 per
cent.
Coming down te our country, we had the
rush to the Cariboo in my own province of
British Columbia in 1865. This was followed
by the Klondike discoveries in 1898, whicb
extended into Alaska. This was ail alluvial
or free gold recovered from gravel and sand,
but usually gravel. These alluvial deposits
are cf varying ages, some of them millions cf
years old. Tbey are flot always in the
streams; they are sometimes on the bencli
land where the upheaval has placed thein, but
nevertheless they were the river channels of
past ages.
Following these alluvial gold discoveries,
stamp milîs were established and used in the
recovery cf free gold from crushed quartz.
The rccovery of what is known as gold frein
bard rock was not then known, but the development which foilowed along, the increase
in the size cf the xnills and the heavier
machinery, made it practicable te crush the
very hard rock which contains gold and te
make a reasonable recovery. This, however,
was again revolutionized by the discovery cf
the cyanide precess. With the assistance of
cyanide as much as 97 per cent cf the gcld'
in the cre is recovered. It alse solved the
problemn cf complex ores. That is regarded
as efficient rnining. In fact practically ail our
gold today cornes frorn this kind cf development. No new alluvial gold deposits on this
continent remain te be discovered, and today
our alluvial production is but a srnall fraction
of our total production.
It rnay be interesting te honourable senators
te know that during the long period cf search
for gold the trend has always been upwards.

156

SENATE

The value of gold has advanced, I believe,
several times over the centuries; but for nearly
one hundred years prior to the end of the first
World War it remained stationary. Then it
began to climb. This reeulted finally in legislation being passed in the United States in
1934 fixing the value of gold at $35 an ounce.
As a matter of fact, the United States was
the onty country which passed legitimato
legisiation increasing the price of gold It did
se, by reducing the gold content of its dollar.
On the matter -of the increased price of gold,
I have always eontended that we have the: cart
before the horse. An ounce of gold is an
ounce of gold. It does not change in value.
It is the La,1 in value of the respective currencies in the different countries that resuits in
the erroneous impression that gold has incrcased in value. It is a question of what an
ounce of gold is worth in the currency of any
particular country. I think this is an illusion
wbich should be corrected.
As proof of this, the United States in 1934
reduced the gold content of its dollar to
15 5/21 grams of gold, nine-tenths fine, and it
toolc thirty-five of these dollars to consume
one ounce of gold. That was a perf-ectly
legitimate way of dealing witb the matter.
Following the depression of 1930 many
people spent wakeful nights worrying about
the seeurity of gold. and trying to devise saine
substitute unit uf value. I rernember reading
in the press that Mr. Hlenry Ford had
suggested wheat as a unit of value instead of
gold. This suggestion, to my mind, was one
of the most ridiculous of many schemes proposed. Wheat is a bulky commodity, requires
large storage facilities, its market value is
very uncertain, it depreciates rapidly. None
of these objections applies te gold.
War has se, impoverished the Eýuropean
nations that their ability to return to the gold
standard is not now a question. Nevertheless,
gold, in my opinion, is more secure as a
medium of international exchange today than
it has ever heen hefore. Some permanent
medium as a basis of international exehange
must remain if a world trade is to be carried
on. Otherwise we must return to the. old
barter system, which is impractical commercially and would in effeet be a return to the
Dark Ages.
During the discussions as to the uselessneas
:)f gold, much reference was macle to the gold
of the United States huried in the hills of
Kentucky. As a matter of fact, that issue is
like the myth of the Golden Fleece-a thing
of the past. ýIt may interest honourable
senators to know that while eome years ago
the United States had a 200 par cent coverage
Hon. Mr. MeRAE.

for its outstanding currency, the coverage at
the present time is somewhat lees than 40 per
cent. Its reserves of gold were so depleted that
last January legisîntion was passed by Congress reducing the coverage froma 40 per cent
ta 25 per cent in anticipation of that country
not having gold enougb to maintain the official
coverage of 40 per cent.
You may well ask: Where has this gold gone?
During the war the United States bought
much more froma South America and other
countrieis than it sold to ýthem, and these
countries invariably tank payment of their
lnalante of trade in gold. Some of the gold
was exported ta the respective countries and
somed, of it remained earmarked as their
property in the vaults of the United States.
For instance, gold valued at one and a haîf
billion dollars now storerl in the United States
vaults belongs to, France. Other European
countries bave gold stored there.
I am told by well informed financial men
that if ýwe took the balance sheet of the United
States todlay and deducted froma it their commitments and other obligations payable in
gold, they woulcl have little or no gold left.
0f course, that will not occur, because tbese
obligations do not aIl mature at one time.
But ýcertainly the Americans are willing to
buy ahl the gold we can produce at $35 an
ounce. At one time it was said that the
United States had 90 per cent of the gold
above ground in its vaults. Todýay they bald
only 50 per cent of the gold reserves of the
world. These figures do not include Russia,
whose gold reserves are unknown.
Supporting the value of gold, is the inherent
dýesire of people of all nations ta acquire gold.
That desire seems ta have been instilled into
the people of the world clown through the
centuries. Today a man cao travel in any
country of the world if he bas a gold brick
that is large enough. Gold can be sold at a
premiumn over $35 an ounce in US. funds in
any country on earth. This statemnent is borne
out by the fact that in the few remaining
open markets, such as exist in South America,
gold is selling around $55 an ounce, payable
in U.S. funds--a premium of about 50 per cent
over our ýCanadian price. It bas been higher,
but I believe that is about the present price
in the open market.
Soýme people complain about aur gold mines
receiving a premium of 10 per cent and getting
$38.50 an ounce for gold instead of $35. They
overlook the fact that 75 per cent of this
premium is taken from the gold mines by
special legialation and that the net to the
mining rompanies is $35.87j an ounce, flot
$38.50. This, I believe, is special legislation
and is not aff ected by the reduction in 'the

OCTOBER 30, 1945
Excess Profits Tax to 60 per cent. Few people
realize that there is a real ceiling on gold. If
we, had a free rnarket we miglit expect to get
more than $50 an ounce in US. funde instead
of $35, an advance, of about 50 per cent fwhich
would be a great boon to gold mnining in this
country.
Were it not that I believe that consolidation, of our gold production will be necessary
in the future to take care of our foreign obligations, as will be shown ini my later rernarks,

I would advocate the removal of the gold
ceiling. I propose therefore to, deal tonight
with the production of gold only as the basis
of international exchange.
It miglit well be asked, what chance has
Canada to increase her gold production. To
begin with, the glacial era pretty well removed
the cover in the Canadian mining areas, particularly in the northern part of our country.
It has been said that in this country we have
ten times as much pre-Cambrian sbield exposed as has the United States. I think
that is far too modest an estimate. The proCamibrian rock in place is where we find our
mines. It runs across the northern part of
Canada, through every province from the
Atlantic to the Pacifie, with the lone exception
of British Columbia, where the upheaval
resulting ini the Rocky Mountains bas stood
much of the original rock on end making minimg in that province more difficuit, more
uncertain and more expensive.
As honourable senators from the province
of Quebec will agree, we have seen rapid
development in that area. Following across the
continent we have similar gold discoveries in
northern Ontario. Northern Manitoba is also
produeing gold, and successful mines are
operating in the eastern section of Saskatchewan. It is reasonable to expeet that similar
deposits will be found along the northern
parts of Saskatchewan and Alberta; but as
the cover there is deeper, that section of the
country will perhaps remain unexplored for
many years. Then we corne to the Northwest Territories, the Yellowknife District,
whcre there is practically no cover at aIl. The
rock is exposed for miles, except for occasional pot holes and muskeg, and the general
ýdiffusion of gold is over such a large area that
it promises the development of many success-

surface bas heen barely scratched. The same
situation applies to 3,000 miles across Canada.
I do not think I am too optimistic when I
say that under an active prograrn of development our gold production at the end of ten
years rnight be something approximating
$500,000,000 annually. This rnay be considered
too optimistic by more conservative men, but
I think rnost will agree that with a real minimg program we should be able to double our
1941 production of $205,789,0W0.
That would
mean an annual production of $411,000,000,
which is not very far removed from the gold
production I hope for. I arn confident the
developmnent of the Yellowknife district on a
large scale could casily make up the difference.
Before dealing with what this would mean
to Canada and Canadians, rnay we take a
look at the present situation nof our gnld
mining industry. Here I feel I arn going to
be very disappointing.
According to Government records, our gold production in 1941
was $205,789,000. In 1944 under war conditions, our production
droppcd down to
$112,532,000, and it is still falling. Our production of gold in 1944 was the lowest in
twelve years. We are back where we were in
1933.
The production for the first seven
months of the present year shows a further
loss of 12 per cent, compared with the same
period in 1944. The latest Governrnent report
available, July of this year, shows that again
there is a falling off in goldý production as
compared with the sarne month laat year,
The situation is serious. We rnay well ask
ourselves, honourable senators, whether we are
going to let our gold industry, which can and
should occupy such an important place in our
internal economy, gradually die out, or are
going to do what is necessary to make it a
thriving industry again.
At the outbreak of the rece.nt war our
existing gold mines were urged to increase
production, and new mines were encouraged
to get into production, the gold being necessary to pay for our purchases from, the United
States. Later, when labour became scarce
and lend-lease was put into effect, gold production was no longer considered an essential
inciustry, and many of the smaller mines were
obliged to close for lack of labour, and they
are stili idle. Only the large mines wîth large

resulted in reduced earnîngs and, in most
instances, arnaller dividends.
When experienced minera are availableand there is little improvernent to be reported
at the present time-it is going to take these
mines at least two years to do the necessary

SENATE
pre-development work to get back to normalcy. They cannot plan any increased production before they catch up with their
underground work. This is the really serious
thing confronting our. major mines. They
have drawn on their reserves to the point
where they are almost up against solid rock,
and many of them will take at least two years
before showing much increase in their milling
operations.
The gold mines cannot carry the load of
taxation to which they are subjected today.
in my judgment the industry is rapidly closing
up. An examination of the balance sheets of
many gold mines shows clearly that their
margin of profit is so small that, with a fixed
price for their production and with increasing
costs, they cannot hope to continue to operate
very long at a profit. And when the day
comes that they cannot operate at a profit
they must close down.
Right now gold
mining, under excessive taxation, has in reality
little chance of interesting investors. The
reduction of the excess profits tax to sixty
per cent is of little or no value to the old
established gold mines and is totally uninteresting to the new mines. The forty per
cent corporation tax, and the other charges,
such as municipal taxes, unemployment msurance, silicosis protection costs, etc., in all
probability take half of the profits of the
corporation. Honourable senators may feel
that the price of gold shares today is a contradiction of this statement.
The fact is,
though, that the real investor is interested
only in our well-established mines, where there
are ample reserves to secure his capital. He
considers this investment the best hedge
against inflation, which he feels certain will
result in an increased price for gold. This,
however, does not apply Io the new mines.
They are always a gamble People will always
gamble in the hope of quick returns. But
it requires large capital expenditures to bring
these new gold mines into production, and no
sound businessman would risk his money in
an investment of that kind, knowing that half
the profits of the venture, if successful, woulýd
go to pay taxes. It would be like taking
in a silent partner who got half the profits
without assuming any of the losses.
Developing a new gold mine is always a
venture. Even with the help of competent
geologists, engineers and managers, I have had
substantial losses. No way has yet been
devised of exactly measuring the extent of
the deposits, the value of the ore under
ground, or difficulties you may encounter.
You have got to get underground to find
out, and that costs money. We need lots
of venture money to develop our new gold
Hon. Mr. McRAE.

mines, but we should see to it that the
prospect has a reasonable chance of success
and that the man who takes any part in the
venture-I will not call him an investorgets a run for his money.
Our mining legislation should not penalize
the successful mines which have become well
established and make satisfactory, perhaps big
returns. They are necessary to the success of
the enterprise as a whole. You might as well
try to run a lottery without prizes as to
develop a gold industry with no outstanding
successful gold mining companies.
While I am on this subject I want to say
a word for the successful gold mines. In my
judgment they are today showing the way
to the highest class of employment. Most of
them not only maintain and contribute to an
employees' pension fund, but they also maintain hospitals and have an arrangement for
providing doctors to look after the miner and
his family. It is very high class employment,
as I view it. A visit to one of the big mines,
where one can see the accommodation
afforded the men, is most interesting. They
change into mining clothes before they go
down the shaft in the morning, and when
they come out of the mine at night they have
a shower bath before changing back into their
street clothes. There is a sun lamp room in
which they can spend as much time as they
please, and the local papers are provided for
their reading. I think these conditions of
employment are such as to make every Canadiah feel proud, and I am rather impatient
with the criticism which sometimes is directed
towards our outstanding mines.
Before the war Canada was able to pay
her unfavourable balance of trade with the
United States by sending to New York the
sterling she received from London in payment of her favourable balance of trade with
Great Britain. That gate is now closed, even
if we had hopes of a continuance of our lopsided business with the British Isles. I think
we are well disillusioned as to the possibility
of that. This triangular arrangement is possible no longer.
Unfortunately the United States produces
practically everything we produce in Canada,
so the opportunity for a substantial increase
in our exports to that country is not bright.
Some of our exports to the United States are
on a sound footing, but many of them are
the result of war and cannot be depended on
to continue under peace conditions. We
Canadians may anticipate that with lower
tariffs and the desire of our people to buy
American goods, our importations from the
United States will increase, and it is reasonable to expect an unfavourable balance of

OCTOBER 30, 1945
trade with the United States of as much as
$400,000,000 annually. That would include
the visible as welI as the invisible balance of
trade, the latter being the interest, dividende
and so on payable Vo American citizens and
corporations. 1 know of only two, things that
we can safely figure on Vo pay this increase
in our unfavourable trade balance. These are
our gold, and the monies spent in Canada by
United States Vourists in exeess of the amount
spent in the United States by Canadian
touriste.
I have said that it would take from. five
Vo ten years Vo develop a gold mine and
bring it into production. That is a long time
these days. But if we present an attractive
programme for our gold development, from
present indications it would appear that the
inflow of American capital for the next few
years Vo develop our gold reserves would equal
and take the place of the increased amount
of gold we hope Vo send thema eventually. I
think honourable senators will agree that we
must cash in on some of our natural, resources
Vo bridge the chasmn that is now in front of
us. Gold presents the opportuLity to do so,
at lcast in part.
It is for this reason ýthat I do noV advocate
the ýremoval of the ceiling on gold. I feel
the Government should continue Vo consolidate our gold production, in view of the unfavourable trade balance we may bave with'
our neigbbours. I make this statement aithougb I appreciate that with a free gold
market we would get much more than the
present price of $35 an ounce. Our Government must realize that with the increasing
costs and the present burdensome taxes, the
margin of profit on many of our gold miines
will disappear entirely and the mines will
close down. Taxes and various regulations
must be eased, if înterest in our gold mining
is Vo revive.
Furthermore, such an unfavourable situation
as at present affects our gold mining will
leave much of the lower grade ore in the
ground. That will neyer be recovered. The
companies will as a imatter of course be obliged Vo high-grade their mines in order to
continue operating as long as possible.
One Vbing that I do noV ýthînk is fully appreciated by the Canadiian people is the value
of the development, of ýour gold resources to
the country as a whcole. Giving evidence before Dr. James' committee on reconstruction
in another place, Mr. Scott Turner of the
United States Bureau of Mines stated that
bis Bureau eetimated that one man on a mine
payroll provided a liveli'hood for Vwelve other
individ>uals, which 1 presumne would include
the miner's family if he had one.

159

IV is wortby of note that in 1940 our mines
purchased $100,000,000 of supplies. This included agricultural produce, flour, beef, canned
goods and ail food commodýities required in
an ordinary community, as well as mine machinery and supplies. Thus these purchase.s
provided work for the farmer, the mechanie,
the machinist, the railway man-, and every
citizen. In fact, ail our citizens benefited,
just as they do fýrom increased business in
general.
It is estimated that our mining industry as
a whole provides now for about ten per cent
of our population. An annual production of
35C0,000,000 of gold at $7 a ton, and averaging two, tons peýr day for every man on the
payroll, would furnish employment for roughly
one hundred thousand men. On the basis of
twelve to one siîggested hy Mr. Turner, our
gold industry alone would provide sustenance
for a population of 1,200,000. If we could put
this develoýpmen-V into effeet overight, there
would be no problem of unemployment. But
that cannot be donc. We must be prepared
Vo spend. a long time on it, for it wilJ take
at lesst five years to geV any worth while results from a mine, and ten years to get maximum results.
1 believe, honourable senators, that the
development of our gold reserves is perhaps
the most promising avenue we have in our
efforts Vo provide employment and take care
of our obligations. If my deductions are
sound even in part, I believe you will feel that
no ime should be lost in getting the development under way. These are the days thaz
cail for action. If we appreciate the situation
that is now on our door-step,,we should flot
wait for tbings Vo happen. Bold and prompt
action by our Government will be requircd in
many instances in the next few years. We
have no time to wait and see. The development of our gold industry is only one of
many probiems that cry out for a decision on
the part of tbe Government.
1 came now Vo what I think is necessary
Vo bring about the development of the industry. I said last session that the Mining Act
in force at the outbreak of the 'war was a
very good one, and that under it the gold
development we desired could be brougb t
about. This general statement would necessitate a return to pre-war taxation, the followinýg being the changes necessary:
1. The excess profits Vax should be cancelled
A reduction Vo 60 per cent is of value Ve very
few of the old established mines, and of no
interest whatever Vo new mines exoept as a
red ]ight Vo, frighten away would-be investors.

160

SENATE

2. The corporation tax on gold mines
should be reduced to the pre-war rate of 20
per cent. With a ceiling price on gold and
our increase in costs, investors will not look
with favour on a business which pays out
half of its earnings in the form of war taxes
and other Government taxes. Gold mining
gets no bonus. It is obvious that if operating
costs continue to rise there will have te be
a rise in the price of gold too, because while
a reduction in taxes will probably answer the
purpose at present, it will not forever solve
the problem.
3. The depletion allowance
should be
restored to 50 per cent. The present 30 per
cent is not sufficient, as will be borne out by
the records of the many companies which
have never been able to repay their capital.
The loss of revenue from these three items
would soon be fully made up by the increase
in sales taxes collected frorn increased business, income tax and various other Government sources of income, which would come
about by the increased business resulting from
the larger production.
4. The Government obliges all gold mines
to send their gold to the Mint at Ottawa for
refining. It is felt by the mining companies
that this refining should be donc at actual
cost. Canadian mines are charged 35 cents
an ounce by our Mint. The United States
Mint at Seattle for identically the same work
charges me 13 cents an ounce, and makes a
slight reduction for shipments of 600 ounces
or more. That does not seem so very much
money, but let me remind the House that in
1940, when the Mint reported the receipt of
5,545 thousand ounces of gold, the profit which
it makes of 22 cents an ounce would amount
to $1,219,939; and on the reduced production

of 1944 it would amount to $643,000.

This

charge, as I understand it, is not statutory, but
is just a mandatory charge. These figures
are very conservative, for I am advised that
although the gold is accumulated here it is
not minted in Ottawa. Apparently it is sent
to some mint in the United States, and I am
idvised the Government are charged 8î cents
in ounce. They have some further expense
:or express and insurance, but, strange to say,
'hese charges are very reasonable having regard to the value of the gold. That expense
might amount to another cent an ounce,
maybe slightly more, leaving 25 cents an ounce
profit, 3 cents an ounce more than my estimate.
In any event the Government makes 22 cents
profit on every ounce of gold produced in
Canada-gold that it never touches at all
except to accumulate and ship to a mint in
the United States. To my way of thinking,
this is a very unreasonable charge to impose
Hon. Mr. MeRAE.

on our mines, and I feel the industry has
strong grounds for asking to be relieved of
everything but the actual cost. I submit that
the pinching off of these huge sums by mandatory orders should be discontinued.
5. There should be a restoration of the threeyear exemption from taxes on new mines. This
is a great encouragement to the small operator.
Usually a new mine is a small one te start
with. The profits, if any, are put back in
the development of the mine, and thus supplement the capital provided for, which is frequently found insufficient. The credit for this
excellent encouragement to new mines belongs, I think, to the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), who was the
Minister of Mines during the period it was
put into effect.
New mines should not be obliged to provide
depreciation or depletion during this period.
A rule by our income tax authorities in this
regard frequently nullified or greatly reduced
the effect of the three-year exemption for new
mines as contemplated by the statute. This
Act while in effect was a great help to the
prospector. It gave him a strong talking point
to get people interested in examining his
prospect and, if favourable, undertaking its
development. I believe the Act cost the
country very little, if any, money, but it
certainly was a great encouragement to mining.
I would think that the renewal of the
three-year tax exemption for new mines might
be included in the present budget, as it does
not affect the revenue of the country one
cent. These mines are non-existent and cannot
produce until they are in operation, so the
present budget would not be affected by any
action the Government might at the present
time take along that line. But it would be
an encouragement to prospectors and to the
mining industry generally. This I think is
necessary, particularly having regard to the
fact that the present burden of taxation will
apparently rest on the mines until at least
another budget is brought down.
In conclusion, honourable senators, I would
refer briefly to the prospector. The prospector
is every inch a man, with spirit, faith and
courage unlimited. Our prospectors are the
pioneers of the industry. They are rapidly
passing on. It is important to Canada with
its far-flung acres and vast mineral resources
that this gap should be filled. It has occurred
to me that some of our returned soldiers who
have learned to like the open-air life, who have
courage and do not fear the wilderness and
are not averse to being alone and on their
own, at least some of the time, might be
given the necessary elementary training in
geology and mineralogy to qualify thern to

161

OCTOBER 30, 1945
become intelligent prospectors, and thus fill
the places of the grand old veterans who are
rapidly passing off the scene.
As my tribute to the prospector I should
like to quote Mr. T. A. Rickard. In his
book The Romance of Mining he writes:
Let us give credit to whom it belongs. To
the man with the faith of a child and the heart
of a viking. To the man who has tramped and
toiled until he heard the mile-wide mutterings
of imagined rivers, and beyond the nameless
timber saw illimitable plains. To the miner
who has crossed the last range of hills and lies
in the only prospect hole he could not dig. To
the man who was the Herald of Empire and the
pioncer of industry-to him that blazed the
trail.

Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, before this bill is read a second time,
may I say to the honourable senator from
Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Beauregard) that while
generally speaking I have no objection to the
bill, I think it is unfortunate that the English
name of the company reads as follows "Trust
Company of Canada." It might be confused
with the Bank of Canada. It is too significant
a name. I would respectfully suggest to my
honourable friend that a substitution be made,
especially for the two words "of Canada."

162

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BEAUREGARD: I understand
that there is no possible objection to the
French name "Compagnie de Fiducie du Canada"; and I do not know of any better English translation of the French than the words
that have been used by the translators. I may
say, with all due deference to the honourable
senator from Alma (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne),
that there are cases similar to this one. We
have the Bank of Canada and we have La
Banque Canadienne Nationale-which is the
Canadian National Bank-and, I do not think
anyone has confused the two. It is purely my
opinion, but I do not believe any confusion
has ever occurred between the Bank of Canada
and the local bank.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: We have a
great many trust companies in this country,
such as the National Trust Company, the
Montreal Trust Company and the Royal Trust
Company; but such a name, as "Trust Company of Canada", is, I think, going too far.
Hon. Mr. BEAUREGARD: Perhaps I
should say a few words. Every honourable
senator who has looked at this bill has seen
that it is an ordinary bill to incorporate
by special act of parliament a new company
for carrying on the business of a trust company, in the city of Montreal and elsewhere,
under the Trust Companies Act. The company does not acquire any special privileges.
After the bill has been read a second time,
I will move that it be referred to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, where this question of the name can be
considered.

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. ARISTIDE BIAIS moved the second
reading oi Bill W2, an Act to incarporate the
Catholie Episcopal Corporation af Whitehorse.
H1e said: The purpose af this bill is ta
incorparate the Right Reverence Jean Louis
Coudert, Vicar Apostohie of the Vicariate
Apostohie of Whitehorse, and his successors,
under the name of "The Cathohic Episcopal
Corporation of Whitehorse". The bil' provides in clause 2 that the head office of the
corporation shauid be at Whitehorse in the
Yukon territory. The other clauses of the
bill follow exactly the terms of the Act passed

during the 1913 session of Parliament incorporating the Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Mackenzie.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Biais, the Bill was
referred ta the Committee on Mi.scellaneous
Private Bis.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN moved the second
reading of Bill X2, an Act respecting the
Lake Erie and Detroit River Company and
Pere Marquette Raiiway Company.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: Will the honourable
senator tell us something about this bill?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: The purpose of this
bill is similar to that of a bill that was
brought before the Senate hast year, and
which came before the House again this year
for amendment-an Act respecting Va.ncouver, Victoria and Eastern Raîlway and Navigation Company. The purpose here is twofold. The Pere Marquette raiiway is. the
parent company, and the La.ke Erie is a
wholly owned subsidiary. In connection with
the wholly owned subsidiary, a lease bas been
approved by the Governor in Council on the
recommendation of the Board of Transport
Commissioners, for a period, of twenty-one
years, which is the limit under the Railway
Act. It is provided that with the appraval
af Parliament a ýlease between a subsidiary
company and the parent campany may run
for a periad of fifty years.
There is a second provision of the bill
under which it is saught ta give the subsidiary company power to seli, and the parent
company the power ta buy, the assets of the
subsidiary company at any time it may be
desirabie ta do so.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion af Hon. Mr. Hayden the Bill
was referred ta the Committee on Railways,
Telegraphs and Harbours.
ESTIMATES
EXAMINATION

BY FINANCE COMMITTEE

The Senate resumed from Tuesday, October
23, the adjourned debate an the motion of
Hon. Mr. Robertson:
That the Standing Casnmittee on Finance be
authorized ta examine expenditures proposed
by the estirnates laid before Parliament, and

104

SENATE

by resolutions relating to war and other proposed financial measures of which notice bas
been given to Parliament, in advance of the
bills based on the said estimates and resolutions
reaching the Senate.
And the amendment moved by Hon. Mr.
MeGeer:
That the said motion be amended by striking
out all the words after "That" in the first line
thereof, and substituting therefor the following:
"any Standing or Special Comnmittee of the
Senate be authorized to examine any resolution
or proposed bill laid before Parliament in
advance of the resolution or bill reaching the
Senate."
Hon. ARTHUR MARCOTTE: Honourable
senators, it would take just a few words to
explain my vote against the amendment. The
reasons given by the honourable senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris), supplemented by those of the honourable leader
on this side (Hon. Mr. Haig), would be
sufficient to do se, because I agree with them
that it is necessary for us not only to keep
control of our proceedings but to adopt the
principle of any bill before it is sent to a
committee.
It is true that on several occasions bills
have been sent to committee before their
principle was adopted; but they had been
before the Senate and had been read a first
and second time, on the understanding that
the principle could be taken up and discussed
before third reading. These were exceptions.
Besides, as an honourable member stated,
every senator has an obligation to study and
scrutinize measures before deciding on them.
If the Senate had no notice that a bill was
Deing considered by a committee, how could
Senators who were not members of that comnittee follow the study of the bill?
The
Senate does not proceed in the way that
%vould be necessary if the amendment were
adopted.
While I am nentioning notice of a bill
being studied in a committee, I shoutd like
to make a suggestion. When a committee of
the Senate is te meet, the Clerk of Committees
sends to every member of the committee a
notice, stating that it will sit in a cetrain place,
at a certain heur on a certain date. to considcr
such and such a measure. Why could net
the Clerk at the same time send the same
notice to the other members of the Senate?
The only change would be that this notice
would be a general one. In this way, every
senator would know whenever any committee
was meeting, and what it was considering.
I have before me a notice stating, "The
Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs
and Harbours, of which yeu are a member,
will sit" te consider a certain measure on a
certain date and at a certain hour. In sendHon. Mr. HAYDEN.

ing such a notice te senators who are net
members of the committee, it would merely
be necessary to strike out the words "of which
you are a member". This would take only a
few mniutes of the Clerk's time and> would
cost nothing. Yet this practice would inform
all of us as to what matters were coming before
the various committees, and it would probably
result in a larger attendance at committee
meetings.
Coming back te the amendment, we should
net forget that one of the main functions of
the Senate is te consider, adopt, amend or
reject bills or measures coming from the other
House of Parliament. As the main motion
and the amendment involve the powers of the
Senate te deali with money bills, there is
more te be said.
The honourable senator from De Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Vien) in his eloquent and very
lucid address gave a resumé of the powers
of the Senate, and disproved the claim of the
House of Commons that money bills were
the sole gift of that branch of Parliament. If
I may, I should like to elaborate on that
phase of the discussion.
In his cloquent remarks on the Address in
reply to the Speech from the Throne, the
honourable senator from Vancouver-Burrard
(Hon. Mr. McGeer), the mover of the amendment, incorporated the report of the Special
Committee appointed by the Senate in 1918
to inquire into the Senate's powers with respect te money bills. But, honourable senators, the report incorporated in his address
is net complete, for it does net include the
memorandum prepared by Senator Ross and
the legal opinions of Messrs. Lafleur, Geoffrion
and Ewart, the eminent lawyers who had been
requested to study this question.
This matter of the powers of the Upper
House with regard te moncy bills is net new.
It was not new in 1918, nor new in 1868. For
three centuries it has been the subject of diseussions, controversies, even bitter quarrels
between the House of Commons and the
House of Lords in England, not te mention
what has taken place in the colonies.
The reading of the 1918 report, and of the
memorandum and legal opinions forming part
of the report, is illuminating te any student of
constitutional law. But these things are net
all. Honourable senators would, I am sure,
read with great interest and satisfaction the
speeches made in the Senate during the discussion on this report in 1918. I would net trespass on your patience by covering the whole
history of these controversies.
Honourable
senators are surely conversant with them. But
it may be interesting te give in a short way the

OCTOBER 30, 1945
reasons for the conclusions arrived at by the
Special Committea. The first five clauses of
the report relate to money bille. Let us read
them agaÀn. I amn quoting from the Journals
of the Senate, 1918, voýume 54, page 194:
The folwing summing-up thereof is suhmitted as the conclusions of yuur committee on
the riglits of the Senate in maffers of finaucial
legielation:
(1) Thaf the Senafe of Canada has and
always lied since it wae created, the power to
amend bille originatiug in the Commune appropriating auy part of the revenue or imposiug
a tax by redueing the amounte therein, but lias
nof the riglit f0 iucrease the saine wifliouf the
consent of the Crown.
(2) That flue po'wer was given as an essenfial
part of the Confederation contract.
(3) Thaf the practice of the Imperial flouses
or Parliament in respect of mouey bille is no
part of the Constitution of the Dominion of
Canada.
(4) Thaf the Senafe in the pasf bas repeafedly
amended so-called meney bille, in seime cases
wifhouf protesf fromn the Communs, while in
other cases the bills were allowed f0 pase, the
Commune protesting or claiming that the Senate
could not amend a money bill.
(5) Thaf Rule 78 of the flouse cf Commens of
Canada claimiug for that body powvers and
privileges in conneef ion wifh m.ouey bille identical wifh those cf the Imperial flouse cf
Commune je unwarranfed under flie provisions
of The Britishi North America Act, 1867.
The memorandum which formed part of. fhe
report covers a succinct but complete history
cf the controversies between fthc Imperial
flouses of Parliament on this mooted question.
I shaîl cite only the pointe Ieading the cernmit tee te ifs conclusions. A -comparison is
madle between the powers of the flouse cf
Lords and the Senate of Canada as f0 money
bille, and the conclusion je fIat the Senaf e
bas more powers than the flouse cf Lords.
The Senate je nof subject fo what is called
flic "swamping power" cf the flouse of Commens in England.
I arn now oifing extracte from the memorandum, at page 105:
It will be noticed that these powers cf the
Communs and these disabilities ut the Lords
are net settled by a law but by practice sud
custom. founded on resolutione cf flic Commons
backed up by threats te which the Lords yielded
under prutest. Mr. Asquifb's resolution (1910)
"That if je expedient that the flouse of Lords
be disab]ed by law froin rejecting or asnending
a money bill, etc." je an admission cf flue fact.
At page P97:
The Constitution of fthe Dominion of Canada
was therefore new ini the line of colonial constitutions. The legal effeet cf the worde cf the
Britishi North .Ameerica Act will have te bie
eetfled (as Acte cf Parliament are construed)
by the plain meaninýg cf the words used.
There are five thinge that are new-age,
properfy, residence, life tenure and the fixed
number. Ini the old provincial constitutions

165

theee are net found. Iu those above mentioned
(1791) and (1840) a Counicillor was required
only to be a British subject twenty-one years
of age.
The statute shows a fundamental. dýifference
between the Senate and the flouse of Lords.
Then the Senate ie an Upper House in a
federation and nlot in a unitary State or Legielative Union as je the flouse of Lords. The
Senate is more like that of the United States
or the upper bouse in Germany or Switzerland.
If it je flot the firet duty of the Senate to
proteet provincial interests it ie impossible not
to infer from the termis of the Act that thia
je a duty caet upon it. Why else the appointment by provinces a.nd electoral dietricte with
the qualificatione of property and residence?
Why not an appointment to the Senate simply
as in the flouse of Lords or the noeninated
legislative councils alre-ady referred to? Sucb
fundainental changes are not made for nothing.
The firet duty of the Senate je to protect and
preserve provincial rights and interests. No
sucb duty je required of the flouse of Lords or
of any of the legislative councile in the provinces. More than that f rom the Act it je quite
elear that to enable the Senate to do this it
was mnade an independent body by the abolition
of the "swarmpinq power," and inaking the
tenure of the position for lif e. It bas, of course,
other powere and duties consequent on ite being
an independent part of the Constitution.
The British North Ainerica Act imposes one
extremely important limitation on the powers
of the Senate. Sections 53 and 54 of the Act
read: 53 Bille for appropriating any part of the
public revenue or for imposing any tax or
impoet sbaîl originate ini the flouse of Comnmone.
54 It shaîl not be lawful for the flouse of
Commons to adopt or pase any vote, resolution,
addreee or bill for the appropriation of any
part of the public revenue or of anvy tax or
impoet te, any puýrpose that bas not been firat
recommended te that flouse by message of the
Governor General in the Session in whicb sucli
vote, resolution, address or bill is proposed.
At page 198:
Principles and pract-ices or customs -are very
different things. On principle the flouse of
Lords je co-ordinate witb the Ilouse of Commous and the Senate of Canada is co-ordinate
with the flouse of Commons, except in this one
matter of originatiug money bills. The flouse
of Commons iu England, liy its use of the
"swamping power" bas reduced the flouse of
L:rds to a state of impotence in all financial
matters. The flouse of Commnone in Canada
lias ne sucli power. A law without a sanction
je uothiug. A practice or cuistum or convention
witbout the power te enforce it is uothiug, even
if the practice were applicable.
The constitution of the Senate aN already
outlined je fundameutally different from the
flouse of Lords and ifs funefione of safeguarding
provincial iuferests in a federal system ie one
unkuownv te an upper house in a uuitary system,
as is the flouse of Lords. Then thie Senafe
is lu a measure representafive altliough nonuuafed. This le lirouglit about liy the property

inces or districts and their firet duty is to them.
Tien the "swamping power" was taken away
for the express purpose of making the Senate
independent of the House of Commons as a
condition precedent to Confederation. On what
implication or analogy can a practice forced
on the House of Lords by an all-powerful House
of Commons be applicable to an independent
House like the Senate? It would require a
statute to effect this, like sections 53 and 54.
At page 199:
When the House of Commons of Canada
claims that it can drag the Senate beneath it
as the Commons did the House of Lords in
England and through the "swamping power"
the answer is that it has not got this power
and is as much bound by the British North
America Act as the Senate. We have a Constitution that can only be altered by the Imperial
PaTrliament. The House of Commons can not
by passing rules add to its powers or diminish
those of the Senate. Rule 75 of the House
of Commons is quite outside of the powers of
that House.
At page 201 under the heading of Senates
and Upper Chambers, I find:
At page 224 Temperley says: In theory the
Senate of Canada possesses equal rights with
those of the Lower flouse except that it can
not originate money bills. It has, however,
the full power either to amend or reject them.
Three eminent lawyers, Mr. E. Lafleur and
Mr. Aimé Geoffrion of Montreal and Mr. John
Ewart of Ottawa, gave written opinions which
are also part of the report by the Special
Committee. I am quoting a few paragraphs
taken from pages 202 and 203 of the Journals
of the Senate.
At page 202:
Sections 17 and 91 of the British North
Ainerica Act place the Senate on exactly the
same footing as the House of Commons as
respects all legislation.
The only material derogation to this general
rule is contained in section 53, which provides
that bills for appropriating any part of the
public revenue or for imposing any tax or
impost shall originate in the House of Commons
The denial of the right to originate money
b:lls does not involve the denial of the right to
amend them. Nothing therefore in the text of
the British North America Act takes away
the latter right from the Senate.
At page 203:
It is remarkable that of the two restrictions
on the rights of the Lords which the Commons
by its resolution of 1678 tried to impose, naiely:
the denial of the right to originate and the
denial of the right to amend money bills. the
British North America Act. while mentioning
the first in section 53, should not mention the
second .against which the Lords had specially
protested.
If it had been the intention of the British
Parliament to impose the two restrictions on
the Senate it surely would have mentioned them
both, or if content to rely on the preamble as
ncorporating the whole British constitution it
would have mentioned neither.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE.

To those reasons might be added this further
consideration, that there is very little analogy
between the Lords and the Senate. The Lords
represent themselves, the Senate represents the
provinces. The Lords are not in an independent
position, as the House of Commons can use its
influence over the Crown and induce it to add
as many members as are needed to the House of
Lords to obtain a favourable majority.
It is probably for that reason that section
18 of the British North America Act when
dealing with the privileges, immunities and
powers of the Senate refers as the maximum
for such privileges, immunities and powers to
those held, enjoyed and exercised by the
Imperial House of Commons (and not by the
House of Lords) at the passing of the Act.
Under the circumstances, we are of the
opinion that the Senate of Canada may amend
a money bill originating in the House of Commons as fully as the House of Commons can do.
Now, honourable members, before I cite
excerpts from speeches made by some senators at the time this report was presented for
discussion and adoption, I will read clauses
6 and 7 of the conclusions of the report:
6. That the Senate as shown by the British
North America Act, as well as by the discussion
in the Canadian legislature on the Quebec Resolutions, in addition to its general powers and
duties is specially empowered to safeguard the
rights of the provincial organizations.
7. That besides general legislation, there are
questions such as provincial subsidies, public
lands in the western provinces and the rights
of the provinces in connection with pending
railway legislation and the adjustment of the
rights of the provinces, thereunder likely to arise
at any time, and it is important that the powers
of the Senate relating thereto be thoroughly
understood.
Senators Ross, Bostock, Choquette, Poirier,
Beique, Dandurand and Sir James Lougheed
took a prominent part in the debate. They
were all old parliamentarians, and some of
them eminent jurists. The memorandum had
been prepared by Senator Ross. It speaks for
itself.
I cite these extracts from the speech of
Honourable Senator Bostock, as reported in
the Senate Debates of 1918, at page 557:
The question we have to consider in relation
to this report is as to what action we should
take later on in regard to money bills. The
change in the attitude of the Senate in regard
to these matters is very important, and one
that should not be adopted without very careful
and serious consideration. But in the interest
of the country we must maintain our position
and see to it that the rights and responsibilities
of the Senate under the Britisi North America
Act are properly exercised. That Act placed
the Senate in all financial matters very largely
on an equality with the House of Commons,
except that we have not the power of originating
money bills.
The fact that we are governed by a written
constitution, as bas been explained by the
honourable gentleman from Middleton (Hon.
W. B. Ross), puts us in a position very

OCTOBER 30, 1945
different f rom. that of a flouse sueli as the
flouse of Lards, or any other Upper flouse
whicli is subject ta a superiar power that cauld
swamp tlie power of tliat Upper flouse by
appointing mare members, and thus prevent
action by that flouse wliich naight rua counter
te the wislies of the Orown or tlie views of
the Lawer Hanse.
I think that we sliould give very careful and
very close attention ta this repart. The opinians
tliat bave been expressed by leading caunsel
are also very valuabie, and add greatly ta the
strengtli of the position in whicli we find
ourselves placed today.
There are in this Chamber many honourable senators wlio remember Senatar Beique.
Tliey had the opportunity of valuing bis
legai knowiedge and vast experience. From
what I arn about ta cite from bis adidress on
this repart you will see that the repart, the
memorandum of Senator Ross and the legal
opinions, cbanged bis point of view and
convinced him tbat tbe Senate bad powers
whidh bad been doubtful in bais mnd, up to
tbat time.
At page 665:
May I be allowed ta add a word ta what I
have already said? Wlien I spoke first I took
it for granted that it liad always been assumed
by tliis flouse up ta this r4oment tbat money
buis were within the exclusive jurisdiction of
tlie flouse of Commans.
I must confess that the lionourable gentleman
fromn Middleton (flan. W . É~. Ross) lias tlirown
a good deal of liglit on the question, and, as
presently advised, I must say that I think lie
is quite riglit. fie has stated tlie unquestianable
priniciple tliat tlie Parliament of Canada is, not
governed by common law, so ta speak, as are
tlie Imperiai flouse of Gommons and tlie flouse
Tliey are net acting under any

statutory law; tliey are acting under custems
and usages, whicb are the resuit of long practice; but the Parliament of Canada is acting
under a written constitution and must remain
witliin tlie four corners of that statuite. Sa far
as tliey are within the four corners of the
statute they are entitled ta exercise ail the
riglits and privileges which are given ta tliem
by that statute.
At page 666:
I think that unless we flnd soe restrictions
in that Act tlie two flses are placed on a
par as f ar as legisiation is concerned, wlietlier
it lie on one subject or another.
Tbat is net tlie case with us in Canadafie was making a comparison witli the
flouse of Lords.
-because we have a written constitution; and,
uniass the flouse of Gominons, with tlie consent
of the Grown, takes tlie responsibility of disregarding the riglits and powers of this brandia
of Parl-iament, tliese, rights have te bie respected.
At page 667, citing
1867, bie said;

from the

debates of

167

Mr. Derion taook the, saine view. Hie pointed
out that the effect of abolishing the swamping
power was ta make the Senate entirely
independent.
Sa we have, on one liand, an Act which is
perfectly plain in its terms, confiding the power
ta bath the Senate and the flouse of Gommons,
without any distinction, without any preference
aone over the other, except sectians 53 and 54;,
and, on the other liand, the important fact that
it was intended to make the Senate independent
of the flouse of Gommons, because the Senate
was entrusted with the protection of the
initerests of the provinces.
I think it is aur duty ta realize what are
aur powers, but not witli a view of abusing
themn or exercising tliem unduly. I think this
flouse should be commended for the way in
which it lias exercised its powers in the past,
especially in money matters.
Bis for appropriating any part of the
public revenue, or for imposing any tax or
impost, shail originate in the flouse of
Cammons.
That unquestianably curtails the pawers of
this flouse, but it curtails them oniy to the
extent stated. Because a bill of tliat kind must
ariginate in the flouse of Gommons is no
reason why we should be deprived of the riglit
of dealîng witli it freely, pravided that the
amount autborized by the Crown is not
exceeded. I think tliat aur position in that
respect is on a par witli tliat of the flouse
of Gommons. Private members of the flouse
of Gommons are not allowed ta present a
money bill. It must originate with the Cabinet,
because it must be accompanied by a message
framn the Crown. But tlie moment tlie message
has been received and the bill lias been intraduced by the Government, the members of the
flouse of Commons deai witli it most freeiy in
every way, except that they cannat inorease
the amount specified by it witliout the consent
of the Crown. They can amend the bill, and
they exercise theiýr power in that regard very
freely. Why sliould aur ýosition be different
from theirs? Wliere can we find that our riglits
in respect ta amending a mioney bill are
curtailed ta a greater extent than are those
of tlie members of the flouse of Gommons?
Lt is only recently that this Chamber
suffered the loss of Senater Dandurand. For
many years lie gave the Senate the benefit of
his wide experience in world affairs. I do nof
think that hie had any superior in bis knowledge of the work and powers of the Senate.
I am quoting from bis speech on this repart.
At page 671 will be found the following
passage :
Tliere was a certain purpose in view: it was
that we sliauld represent, not a small section of
the population, but tlie provinces from. whieb
we came; and I wouId ask my lionourabie
friends if in reading tlie Quebec resolutians
and tlie federai compact tliey do not notice that
the financiai clauses of the contract play
a most important raie. If tliey do play an
important raie and if we are liere ta eee that
the latter and spirit of tliat agreement are
maintainad, doas it nat f oliow iogically that
we bave a special duty ta watcli aver the
financial administration of the country?

168

SENATE

I recognize that, though we may have equal
powers with the House of Commons, they should
be exercised by us in a different spirit. We
have equal powers, but we have not the same
mandate. If the Commons, when acting according to the letter and spirit of the constitution,
have a clear mandate from the country, their
authority should go unchallenged in financial
as in other natters. Our duty, I surmise, is to
assure ourselves that the Commons have that
clear mandate. If in this respect the Senate
fulfils its duty seriously, i't can play an
important, a paramount part in the safeguarding
of the Federal treasury. I claim that very
often we have been individually convinced that
the Commons, in disposing of the money and
the credit of ,the country, bas not given sufficient
consideration to the general initerests of Canada,
and, in common with many of the most
prominent citizens of Canada who are concerned over the proper administration of the
country, and who watch its expenditures with
a careful eye, we have felt that the House of
Commons was at times quite improvident. It
is natural that we should see such things.
At page 672:
It is very desirable that the powers of this
Chaimber should be defined and established so
far as it is possible for us to define and establish them, in order to prevent any misunderstanding, conflict or clash with the House of
Commons. We are a co-ordinate branch of
Parliament, and therefore it is very desirable
that there should be a complete understanding;
not only on the part of this Chamber but on
the part of the House of Commons, as to what
our powers are. It is only by having a clear
understanding of this nature that good relations
will be maintained between the two Chambers;
and I regard this report as contributing in
that direction in a more valuable way than
any other purpose it may serve.
Honourable members have, of course, read
the addresses by the Fathers of Confederation,
especially those by Sir John Macdonald.
Their addresses show exactly what they had
in mind when they framed our constitution
and made the Senate the independent branch
of Parliament which it is.
Not only have we the powers to do certain
:hings, but it is our duty to exercise those
powers. We are bound to safeguard provincial rights; to protect minority rights; to
protect the country at large against hasty
legislation, improvident measures. But in so
doing we should be careful to devote the
necessary time to the study of any measures
coming before us. Some of these measures
can be anticipated and studied before they
reach this Chamber, and in these rare circumstances it may be possible to have some
of our committees make the necessary inquiries, reserving judgment until the matter
is brought before the Senate. But I do not
think it is good practice. The Senate, through
its committees, could make investigations on
matters before the public, although not before
Parliament, and make suggestions. This will
come in its proper time.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE.

In reading the addresses made in 1918 by
these wise and experienced men, we can see
that they had a true appreciation of their
duties as members of the Senate. The Fathers
of Confederation had expected senators to
deliberate calmly and carefully on all measures
coming to them from the other Chamber.
In perusing the report of the speech made
by the late Senator Murphy on the usefulness
of the Senate, and that by the Honourable
Senator from Lincoln (Hon. Mr. Bench) on
the same topic, we can feel satisfied that this
branch of Parliament has done remarkably
well and fulfilled expectations. Some honourable members seem to worry about criticism
of the Senate. The great trouble is that our
work is not sensational. As was stated by
Right Honourable Mr. Meighen, the most
useful work of the Senate is done in its
different committees, but not being known to
the public, it cannot be appreciated. This
should be enquired into. In the meantime,
the Senate will survive these criticisms, will
continue to play its important role in the
legislative affairs of our country, and, as in

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. C. J. VENIOT moved the second
reading of Bill Q3, an Act to amend the Act
ta incorporate The Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, in view of
the lateness of the hour, I shall be very brief,
although it had been my intention to explain
each clause of the bill sufficiently to enable
us to dispose of the bill tonight. However,
may I say a few words concerning the set-up
of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, who are asking for this
measure?
This organization was incorporated in 1929
by an Act of Parliament.
That Act was
amended in 1939 to enable the College to
undertake the certification of specialists in
Canada; that is to say, to determine the conditions under which doctors of medicine could
call themselves specialists in certain branches
of medicine and surgery, and practice as such.
The Royal College, like its parallel organizations in Great Britain, France and the United
States, groups together members of the medical profession who by long years of practice,
by teaching in medical schools and hospitals,
by special discoveries in the medical field, or
by undergoing special qualifying examinations

1Ô~9

OCTOBER 30, 1945
determineà by the regulationa of the college,
have distinguished themselves and achieved
eminence in their respective fields of activity.
These men are associated in the common aim
of elevating to the highest possible level the
standards of medical and surgical teaching and
practice, and it bas been chieýfly through their
efforts that medical achools ini this country
have attained such high standards of excellence, and are recognized today as second to
none among the medical schools of the world.
Forty years ago a young man could hop

from the ranks of atreet-car conductors, store
clerks or labourera into any medical school
on the continent, and receive a degree 'of
doctor of medicine after a four-year course.
This is not truc today. Before a candidate
can enter a achool of medicine in Canada he
must have completed at least one year, and
in moat cases two years, of pre-medical studies
in the basic sciences of physies, chemistry,
biology, higher mathemnatica, languaies and
so forth, to fittingly prepare himself for a
four-year course in medical subjects, at the
end of which he must serve for one year as
an interne in a recognized hospital. This is
the set-up of the organization which presents
thia bill to the House.
The experience gained through the years
since the College was founded and the impact
of changing conditions in the medical professîon have revealed the desirability, if not the
necessity, of seduring a further amendment
to the Act of incorporation. This is necessary
if the influence and prestige of the College
is to be maintained and broadened, and the
standards of the fellowahip raised to an even
higher point of excellence. It is for that
reason that an amendmnent is asked to four
of the sections of the original Act of
incorporation.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I largely agree with what
the honourable gentleman has said about the
College of Physicians and Surgeons, but I
should like to knnw what is the objeet of the
bill.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I think it is stated in
the new section 5.
Hon. Mr. VENIOT: If it is the desire of
the House, I should ho only too glad to explain
the whole bill. The first sectionHon. Mr. HAIG. The honourable gentleman does not need to go into the bill in detail.
Would he juat tell us what its purposes are?
Hon. Mr. VENIOT: I said that the purpose
of the bill waa to provide for further raising
the standards of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons. That is a summary of
the purpose of the bill, and I cannot explain

it more fully unless I go into certain details
concerning the variou2 sections. Section 5 of
the original Act is to be repealed and replaced
by the following:
The Council may, at any time after the coming
into force of this Act, and without examination,
select and admit as Fellows, physicians and
surgeons of distinction who are gradu-ates of
at least twenty years' standing of a medical

sehool or un'iversity, who are domieiled in
Canada, and who, in the opinion of the Council,
have given evidence of h.igh ability in one or
more hranches of medicine.
The Act imposed a time limit of two years
during which the fellowship could be granted
without examination. Faced wîth an enormOua amount of work in its organization, the
College found the time allowed to be inaufficient, with the resuit that many physicians
and surgeons of distinction, many of whom
important positions in medical
110W hold
schools and are outstanding in the commumitics in which they live, were not enrolled in
the College. In order to correct this condition, to extend the influence of the College,
and to enhance its prestige, it is highly desirable that the College be given the power to
admit such persons to the fellowship. This
it is proposed ta do by deleting the words
"within two years"' in the flrst line of the
section as it now reads. To prevent any
lowering in the standard of the fellowship it
is expressly stipulated that a period of twenty
years

from

graduation

salT

have

elapsed

before Fellows can be admitted. Therefore,
the purpose of this section is ta raise the
standard of fellowship in the College.
Section 6 of the Act is to be repealed and
a new section substituted, to provide for
similar improvements in the fellowship by
means of exchange or reciprocity between
fellowships in other Colleges and in the Royal
Coilege of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada.
Having established in section S a minimum

standard of flys years' post-graduate training
for applicants for the fellýowship *by examination, it seems only logical and reasonable
that the same restriction should be imposed
upon applicants for the ad eundemn fellowship
without further examination, and that the
quality of their post-graduate training should

ho subj ected to the same scrutiny.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: What this does, really, is
provide for the giving of an honorary title
of Fellow to certain physicians and surgeons?
Hon. Mr. VENIOT: Some doctors would
receive an honorary titie, but others would be
made fellow-s by virtue of the fellowships
they hold in, for instance, the Royal College
of Physicians and Surgeons of England, the
Academy of Medicine of France, or the
American College of Physicians and Surgeons

170

in the United States. This bill would give
the Roya] College of Physicians and Surgeons
of Canada the power to admit as fellows,
physicians and surgeons holding a fellowship
in other colleges, but these physicians and
surgeons have to comply with the conditions
laid down in the bill.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I understand if now.
The motion was agreed ta, and the bill was
read the second time.

BUSINESS 0F THE SENATE
On the Orders of the day:
Han. WISHART
MeL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, realizing that fi is difficuit ta make travel reservatians at this time
I desire ta give notice naw of a prapased
ad.journrnent of the Senate. I have made al
the inquiries possible as ta the progress of
legislation in another place, and have consulted with the chairmen of aur committees
as ta the wark thcy have in hand, and I suggest that ta-morrow aftcrnoon we adjourn
until Monday evening. November 12.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senatars,
I arn on record1 as having protested several
times against prolonged adjournrnents, and I
feel so deeply about the matter that pcrhaps
I may hje pardoned if I express uiy objection
ta the adjournment that has just been proposed. I quite appreciate that we prohahly
could nlot be lkcpt busy next week hy husiness coming ta us frein the allier House, but
surely we have enougli energy ta look inta
and try to selve sarne of the outstanding
issues confronting Canada today. I mnust say
that I arn amnazed at this proposed ad.Iournment,. I believe it is concurred in hy my
own leader (Hon. Mr. Haig). Hlonourable
senators will rerncmber very well that he fi on
record as having protested against long
adjournrnents many tirnes in the past sixc or
eight yearsHon. Mr. HAIG: Ten.

OCTOBER 31, 1945
lien. Mr. McRAE: -in
words much
stronger than 1 can employ to-day. Those
protests were uttered while the war was on,
when we had very littie opportunity to initiate
anything in this House. During the war most
of us felt it behooved us to keep our ideas
under cover, and to reserve any criticism that
we might wish to express, in the hope of
thereby furthering the war effort. But now
this country is faced with problems almost
beyond our ability' to solve. It is nlot good
enough to say that we have nothing to do
and so are going to adjourn for ten or twelve
days. I arn sure these long adjournments are
annoying to a good many senators, as -they
certainly are to me. If I have to sit around
week after week I cannot help feeling that
I amrn ft
employing my time in the best
interests of the country.
Today I had the pleasure-and it was a
pleasure-of -attending the meeting of the
Special Committee ap.pointed, to examine into
the Income War Tax Act and the Exoess Profits Tax Act, and the programme there outlined by -the honourable gentleman, from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell) impressed me
with the great amount bf work before the
committee. It will nlot be possible for the
committee to present more than an interim
report this session, but the hope is that within a couple of mon'ths after the beginning of
next session somet.hing in the way of a final
report ýcan be hrought in. I know the people
of thýis country are almost to an indlividual
interested in taxation, which is one of our big
problems.
We had some discussion this afternýoon, of
the proposal -to reduce the number of merbers neeessary to fora a quorum in one of
our committees. If the Senate is going -to
adj ourfi for ten or twelve days, will there *be
enough senators in Ottawa to enable committees to continue? Indicative of the work
to be done are notices before me of three
committee meetings set for tomorrow. The
times of meeting of two of them are only haîf
an heur apart. Thiat may be long enough
te permit honourable senators who are on the
two committees to attend the meetings of
both; but it may nlot be. If there were fewer
adjournments of the Senate, it w6uld be possible te regulate the sittings of committees
s0 as to make it convenient for more members te attend.
Now, honourable senaters, I do not want
te force this question to an issue; I do not
like protesting against every adjournment; hut
unless other resns than those stated this
afternoon are given for adjourning, I will offer
an amendment that we do net adi ourn but re-

cenvene on Monday next instead of a week
later. I do not knew *how many hon-ourable
members are in- sympathy with what I have
said. I belýieve my protest has ment and is
in line with what the country expecta from us.
Hon.. Mr. MURDOCK: Your Honeur,
would it be in order for me te say a couple
of words? I think it is encouraging for the
werk and future of the Senate to hear these
remarks from an honourable gentleman who.
in the past ten or twelve years has missed
more sittings of this House than bas any
other member. I think that what ihe bas
said sho-uld, be rcgarded by us all as encouraging for the future of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: The honourable gentleman well knows that there was a war on.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, if I may be perinitted to speak on this
matter again, I should like te assure the
House that I suggested the adi ournment only
af ter very careful consideration. I arn as
desirous and willing as anyone that the Senate
should be kept as active as possible. Belore
I reached a conclusion that an adjournrent
ever next week would be adivisable I censulted with the 'chairmen of .the D ivorce Cernmiittee, which is being kept constantly busy,
and of the Special Committee on taxation,
and both assured me that an adjournment of
the Senate until the l2th of November would
flot interfere with the work -of their respective
committees. Rightly or wrongly, that is. what
I was advised. An adjournment of the Senate
next week might even facilitate rather than
hinder the work of these committees. Truc,
in the absence of any business before the
Sonate we could go through the motions of
meeting and adjeurn every day next week, but
I do net think that procedure would meet with
the approval. of honourable senators.
I arn as desirous as any other honourable
senator that we sheuld in some way or other
develop a programme for the employment of
more time, net on.ly in committees but in the
Senate itself, on legislative matters. We -have
already moved «long that line in considering
the reports of cemmittees, se that we may be
better prepared when the main questions corne
bof ore us. I amn hopeful that some precess can
he devised by which we may deal with legislatien in the manner mest in keeping with parliamentary procedure. Certainly, we cannot
know tee much about any bilL9 that we may
have te consider-I apeak for myself at any
rate. In this particular case, I repeat, it was
only after consul ting with the active committees «nd giving as mueh consideration as I
could te the prngress of legislation in the ether
House, that I came te the conclusion it would

be better to do as I have suggested than to

assure honourable senators that if there is any
considerable body of opinion in favour of
adjourning merely over the week-end, I shall
be happy to so move tomorrow or whenever
we have dealt with current business.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, in view of the fact that my name bas
been mentioned by the honourable senator
from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae), I admit
that the responsibilities of office may have
changed my views.
Hon. Mr. McRAE:

I am afraid they have.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: While I was opposed to
adjournment, I was always conscious of the
futility of our meeting when there was no
business for our consideration. That in my
view was worse than any lengthy adjournment.
An Hon. SENýATOR: That is right.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I have always believed
that important legislation of a non-political
nature shou'ld be introduced in this House
rather than in another place. I can quite
understand that any government would prefer
to introduce in the Chamber elected by the
people all legislation of a political character
to which there would probably be opposition.
But this session there were two or three bills
that should have been introduced in this
House. For instance, the Naturalization Bill
might well have originated with us. Then we
could have referred it to one of our standing
committees or a special committee in order to
hear representations for and against the
measure. Similar remarks apply to the question of a national flag for Canada. I think we
could have dealt with this subject rnuch more
satisfactorily than the other House, for here it
would have been considered dispassionately,
and those who desired to express their views
on the subject would have had an opportunity
of appearing.
In my opinion it would be a great mistake
to meet next week if we have nothing to do.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Nothing is so disappointing as to attend here for half an hour and
then adjourn. It bas too much the appearance of playing a game. I quite agree with
the honourable senator from Vancouver that
there should be no adjournment so long as
there is any work to be done. I have had
the great pleasure of being consulted by the
honourable leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) with respect to the advisability of nearly every adjournment, and I
appreciate his courtesy very much. I am
trying to the best of my ability to maintain
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

the high honour of this House and to see
to it that we discharge our constitutional
obligations to the fullest extent. The honourable
member from Vancouver-Burrard
(Hon. Mr. McGeer) the other day pointed
out what the Fathers of Confederation
intended the Senate to be. It never should
be and never was intended to be a political
Chamber, but rather a Chamber where second
thoughts would have a chance of prevailing,
where the Maritime Provinces would get a
fair deal if Confederation could give it to
them. That is why those provinces were
given one-quarter of the Senate membership.
The minute we drift away from the purpose
for which Confederation set up the Senate,
we become a House unsatisfactory not only
to ourselves but to all Canadians.
I happen to be a member of one of the
active committees. We consulted among ourselves and decided that next week the committee would sit every morning and afternoon.
Hon. Mr.
mittee?

MoRAE:

The

Divorce

Com-

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes. The chairman and
other members of the committee will remain
here to carry on the work. As to the committee on taxation, I do not sec how it is
possible for the members to meet before the
13th or 14th of next month. For one thing,
they have to arrange for the appearance of
witnesses. They cannot just run over to the
Finance Department or the National Revenue
Department and say, "Mr. Jones, come over
and address us." They have got to advise
Mr. Jones what they want to know, and
if he is not the man who cao give the information and Mr. Smith is, he should be
secured so that wlatever evidence they may
require will come from the very best source.
Honourable senators, I had not intended to
speak at all on this matter, but I feel very
keenly that if there is any work for the Senate
to do we should not adjourn for a week or
ten days-and I know tihat feeling is shared
by every member of this House. If I want
to go home for a week I can do so in the
knowledge that I have sitting beside me an
bonourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne)
who knows more about the duties of my position than I do, and is more capable of discharging them. But while I am averse to
adjourning so long as there is any business
before us, at the same time I do not tihink we
should assemble and go through the usual
spasms and then adjourn from day to day.
Sueh empty gestures will only make the Senate
ridiculous. I arm therefore heartily in accord
with the motion proposed by the honourable

OCTOBER 31, 1945
leader of the Government, that when the
Senate adi ourns it stand adi ourned until the
12th of November.
Let me again express the hope that next
session the Government will originate important legisiation in this flouse, so that we may
be kept fully occupied. I think if the Government took this course it would reap benefits
that now apparently it neither realizes nor
expects.
RIGHTS 0F SENATORS
QUESTION 0F PRIVILEGE

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. THOMAS VIEN : Honourable senators, since I entered public life in 1917, some
twenty-eight years ago, today for the first time
I find myseif compelled to rise on a question
of privilege. In this instance I feel that the
honour of the Senate, the honour of several
honourable senators who are members of the
bar at Montreal, and my own honour are
involved.
The question of privilege arises out of statements made in this flouse on October 24, as
they appear at page 134 of the current Debates
of the Senate. Those statements were madeb
the honourable senator fromn Parkdale (Hon
Mr. Murdock), when hie attempted ta read an
article that had appeared several months previously in Liberty magazine. I shaîl refer ta
it later as being also, the basis of my
objections.
The words of the honourable senator which
are complained of are the following:
Son. Mr. Mordock: -If His Honour will wait
tili I get through, I think hie will find it is
distinctly in line with what the committee is
ta consider. If hie is going to decide otherwise
before I get ta the part I have in mind, I
suppose I must accept bis decision. In other
words, we are flot going ta have a decent consideration of the things that the committee is
to consider.
His Honour the Speaker called attention ta
the point of order, but the hanourable gentleman continued:
Yonr Honour, this is one of the things
distinctly in line with this motion, as I und-erstand it. There was a particular reason why I
wanted to read the first paragraph of this
aiticle. 0f course, ordinary senators and others
are ta be shut off when they get juta a discussn)n of anything that might be emharrassing
to the grafter and the greedy man; but I wanted
to place this before the flouseWhereupon I rose on a pýoint of order, which
was uMeld by the Chair. And the honourable
senator added:
"The wieked flee when no man pursueth."
All right, your Honour, I bow ta yaur ruling.
But I ask honourable senators ta read this
article and then decide who is the 'nationally
knawn senator" referrcd ta in the paragraph
I quoted.

173

An innuendo is apparent, and it is ta the
effeet that the senator to whom reference is
made in the article is a grafter or a greedy
man, and that the point of order was raised
for the purpose of shutting off discussion when
such grafter or grabber happened to be a
"1nationally known senator."
It is alýways dangerous to refer ta yellow
press articles bearing flamboyant titles without lirst asccrtaining if the facts alleged justify
the titie. In such cases one must guard
against exaggerated language un'warranted by
the facts. In substantiation of my question
of privilege I shahl have later to refer to the
pertinent parts of this article.
It bas been reported ta me by hon-ourable
senato-rs that my honourable friend from
Parkdale continues ta spread around that my
conduct in this instance, as a member and exSpeaker of this flouse, bas been most undig
nifled. Furthermore, when hie apologized tht
other day ta the honourable senator fror
Rougemont for having mentioned him as thE
one involved, the implication was that the
senatar guilty of the practices alleged in the
article is certainly unworthy of sitting in this
flouse or of presiding over one of its
committees.
Honourable senators. there is nothing in
the article to substantiate such insinuations.
This article is signed by Harold Dingman.
The titie is flamboyant. It reails as follows:
Millions are beîng made hy crooked dealers.
The hlack market is still a ri 'sing market, mocking the law with an immunity guaranteed by
the public.
The prosecuting attorney described it to me
as one of the "really hot" cases in the Montreal
regional drive to eliminate the hlack market
in used cars. It was hot flot only hecause a
vital issue was at stake-one affecting alI
regional offices in Canada-but aiso because a
wealthy company, with friends in the highest
places, was charged with illegal dealings, and
hecause the ùompany had engaged a nationally
known senator as defence counsel.
I should like first ta point out that a barrister who happens ta be a senator is not
thereby precluded from continuing bis professional practice, nor fromn accepting a :brief,
even in a case involving an infringement of a
government regulation. A lawyer, even if hie
happens ta be a senator, can accept a brief ta
defend any accused person. If the honourable
senator fromn Parkdale were accused of murder
-which God forbid-I could defend him. 'Me
charge here, as we shail see, is much less than
murder. The question involved was of interest
not only ta my client, one of the most reputable companies in Canada, but aIso to ail
motor car dealers from Halifax to Vancouver.
There was no allegation of black marketing;
therefore the title of the article is misleading.

174

SENATE

The honourable senator from Parkdale, had he
read the article attentively and dispassionately,
would not have been exercised and would have
cast no aspersions.
The question at issue involved only the
proper construction of a regulation of the
Wartime Prices and Trade Board. Since the
war, there being a priority on new cars, all
motor car dealers have dealt, almost exclusively, in used cars. Black marketing entails
an element of bad faith; the act of wittingly
selling above the ceiling price and concealing
the excess.
In this case an exhaustive examination of
the books, of not only my client but other
dealers in Canada, had revealed that the following practice had developed: a motor car
dealer, buying and selling used cars, is asked,
to sell a car standing in bis showroom. He
says: "The price of that car is so much"a price below the ceiling established, by the
Wartime Prices and Trade Board-"but I shall
not sell it to you unless you have another used
car to trade in." If the prospective purchaser
bas a used car to trade in, a mechanic is sent
out to appraise it. It may be worth $25 or
$200 or more. There is no floor, or bottom
price fixed by the Board below which no dealer
can go. Wiben the subject was discussed with
the Wartime Prices and Trade Board, they
agreed that they could not establish minimum
prices for used cars traded in. The obvious
reason is that these cars vary in quality and
in their degree of general depreciation. Following a lengthy discussion between the motor
vehicle administration and representatives of
the trade, a new regulation was published
which was perfectly satisfactory to all concerned. R4 was agreed that when a traded-in
car is purchased by a dealer, reconditioned and
re-sold, the re-sale price may include the purchase price, the cost of reconditioning, fixed
charges, overhead, expenses, interest, insurance
and other carrying charges, and a reasonable
margin of profit over all. Since then the trade
bas continued to follow exactly the procedure
that had been complained' of, but its re-selling
price is governed by the new regulation. This
was a test case by the Wartime Prices and
Trade Board, and related exclusively to the
proper construction of an order of the Board.
Honourable senators, that is all that was
involved.
I have given this explanation so that no
other honourable senator practising law in
Montreal may be subjected to the indignity
suffered by the honourable senator from
Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Beauregard) a few
days ago, and by myself in the instance
referred to. I have no advice to give to my
honourable friend from Parkdale, nor indeed
Hon. Mr. VIEN.

to any other honourable senator, but I might
perhaps be permitted to suggest that at a
time when this honourable body is being
attacked from right and left, and when
honourable senators are doing their best to
uphold the honour, powers and privilèges of
the Senate, it is unseemly for a senator to
lend bis high office to the diffusion of a
yellow press article published only for the
purpose of creating a sensation. The sting of
that article was in the title only. The facts
related in the article itself do not justify the
extravagance of the language used. In these
facts there is nothing derogatory to the
honour of the Senate, to the honour of a
senator, nor indeed to the honour of a member of the bar. As a result of what was
brought out at the trial in Montreal, the
practice complained of was allowed to continue, with the correction indicated, but there
was no bad faith alleged nor proven.
Slander and calumny are dangerous things,
and once uttered they cannot be completely
withdrawn. I should like to quote the words
of Voltaire:
Tell lies and more lies. Some of them are
bound to stick.

Nobody knows that better than the honourable senator from Parkdale himself, for a few
years ago he was the victim of a similar
incident. He does not seem to have learned
anything as a result of bis bitter experience.
Honourable senators, the explanation I have
given should be sufficient to dispel these
regrettable and disreputable insinuations. It
It should
should suffice in that connection.
vindicate the honour of senators who happen
to be practising law at Montreal. There is
no justification for the attacks that we have
suffered at the bands of the honourable senator from Parkdale.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Your Honour.
would I be in order in saying a few words?
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Mr. Speaker, I spoke on
a question of privilege, which is not debatable.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Then on a question of privilege I rise to say that I am distinctly glad to have had the explanation that
bas just been given by the honourable senator
from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien). It shows
me something that I did not know. I wrote
to Harold Dingman, the author of the article
in Liberty, and ho told me to apply to the
Wartime Prices and Trade Board in Montreal,
but I realized that that probably would do
no good. I now understand better than I
did before something that occurred in the first
days of this session. In September last I
noticed that my honourable friend who bas
just spoken on a question of privilege had

OCTOBER 31, 1945
nlot been here for a day or two, and when 1
saw him I said:- "Tommy, glad to see .you.
This is the first time you have been here."
Re said: "Oh yes, Jim. I have got to make
my living, don't you know?" I have nothing
to retract from the position I have taken.
The other day I wanted to inform. the honourable senator fîrom Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell) and other members of the Special Coinmittee on taxation that this article involved
two questions of law that required their consideration. These questions were quoted verbatim. Evidently the honourable gentleman
defending in this case had nlot noticed one
of them, because previously he had, pleaded
nlot guilty, but when the attorney prosecuting
the charge d.rew his attention to the other
quotation from the law he changed bis attitude and pleaded guilty. I have nothing to
suggest further; only I do think that the committees should look into these two questions,
because when they fooled a, capable and
on-the-job lawyer what would they do to the
uninitiated like myself?

On the Orders of the Day:Hon. J. J. ýBENCH: Honourable senators,
I should like to draw attention to a news
article which I submit directly concerns the
privileges of this honourable House. Lt is
reported by.the Ottawa Citizen this morning
that in an address to a political gathering in
this city last evening, one of our bonourable
colleagues made certain references to this
Chamber. The article quotes him as having
said in part as follows:
The time is long past due when the Canadian
people should say wbo sits in the Senate, for
the Senate would be more powerful and more
effective if its members had to face the voters
periodically.
The Senate is flot a House of Lords ..
but
an advisory body representing the people.' At
present, the senators are appointed for life, and
with a comfortable plush-lined, chamber to ait
in, it is the finest oId age pension club in the
world. Thougli senators are now comfortably
looked after witb salaries of $4,000 yearly, it
was not long ago that the same Senate vetoed
an old age pension scheme to provide $20
monthly to needy people reaching the age of
seventy. If lobbying in the Senate could have
been as effective for the old age pension as it
is for the protection of insurance companies and
banks. the pension would easily have been
raised to $50 instead.
Now,,ho-nourable senators, undoubtedly that
is very sensational, but in my respectful submission it casts a definite slur on the inýtegrity
of every gentleman who sits in this honourable
Chamber.

Hon Mr. COPP: And lady.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Any honourable senator is, of course, perfectly free to attend
meetings and make such public criticismn of
the Senate as he in bis wisdom. may think
proper. However, I suggest that such aspersions as were evidently cast upon this Bouse
by the honourable senator from VancouverBurrard (Hon. Mr. MeGveer) in his speech
last, evening are greatly to be deprecated. I
was nlot in the Senate wben the Old Age
Pensions Bill was first considered, but notwithstanding what the honourable gentleman
is reported to bave said at last night's meeting, I am perfectly satisfied that the bill was
rejected here on the high ground whicb bionourable members at that time considered to
be in the best interests of the country.
The honourable gentleman was perfectly
with*in his rights in suggesting that mexnbership in this Bouse sbould be on an elective
basis. May I say to him, without intending
any offence-incidentally, I am sorry bie id
not in bis seat-tbat to me it seems strange to
couple that statement with the suggestion that
membership in this House is sometbing in the
nature of a gift from the Crown. I find it
strange indeed that that remark should comeand I suggest it came with iii grace-from the
gentleman wbo bas been the latest recipient
amongst us of 'wbat be apparently regards
as His Majesty's beneficence.
Hon. Mr. MUTRDOCK: May I ask the
bonourable gentleman a question? Does bie
neot know that "labour skteS" like McGeer and
Murdock have been gettini into this kmnd of
trouble for years?

and evidence in only five or six of this session's
cases have been printed. This situation is
caused by the fact that the Printing Bureau
has lost the services of sixteen or more of its
linotype operators and is far behind with its
work. If there is any objection to proceeding
with these reports before the evidence bas
ben printed and distributed, I am quite content that the motion should stand.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable members, a distinguished senator, not of the same
religious persuasion as myseif, asked me before
the House met to hold up further consideration
of these bills until, in compliance with the
rules of the Senate, the evidence is before us.
I mentioned the matter to my seat-mate, the
honourable member from Queen's (Hon. Mr.
Sinclair), and I understood that he had spoken
to the honourable member from West Central
Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Aseltine). Otherwise
I do not know that I would have raised the
question, although I do think that when we
are talking about the lack of work before the
Senate we should at least observe the rules in
relation to whatever business we happen to
have in hand.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Stand.
DIVORCE REPORTS
Hon. W. M. ASELTINE, Chairman of the
Committce on Divorce, moved consideration
and adoption en bloc of divorce reports, Orders
of the Day 59 to 81 inclusive.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Are not these reports in exactly the same position as the bills,
the third readings of which have just been
postponed?
They are in the
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE:
same position, except that the reports with
the evidence attached have been tabled, and
every honourable senator thus bas an opportunity of examining them. We are anxious
to have these reports adopted so that we may
make progress with the bills to be founded
on them. There are two hundred and fifty
or more divorce cases pending, and it will be
impossible for the Divorce Committee to proceed with its work if the bills based on these
reports are held up for a week or more. Honourable members will have ample opportunity
to read the evidence later on, and as chairman of the Divorce Committee I shall be
obliged if the House will agree to the motion.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I submit it is not necessary that the divorce evidence should be
printed and distributed before a motion to
adopt a report of the Committee on Divorce
is agreed to. The report is complete. It bas

mittec, and it bas been on the Order Paper
for the required time. I think the honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) should name the senator who aSked

these reports. To withhold it is net fair to
other senators.
Hon. Mr.

Hon. 'Mr. HAIG: The honourable senator
from Parkdale should take the responsibility
of naming the honourable gniitleman. These
reports arc completo in themoselves, and I
submit no objection can be taken to their
adoption.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: All right, I will
rame the honourable senator. It is Senator
Marcotte.
Hon. A. MARCOTTE: Honourable senators, I made my request to the honourable
senator from Parkdale because I did net
expect to be in my seat when these orders
would be reached. I cannot understand why
we should be asked to pass a bill when we
have not had a chance to read the evidence
and convince ourselves that the report should
be adopted and the bill based thereon passed.
The reason
advanced for accepting the
motion, that the Committee on Divorce bas
many cases pending before it, is beside the
point. I regret that thero are so many petitions for divorce, and that in order to deal
with the work expeditiously it bas been
found necessary for the main committee and
a suocommittee to sit simultaneously. The
honourable chairman of the committee (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) and the honourable leader on
this side (Hon. Mr. Haig) have stated that
the evidence is attached to each report and
that any honourable senator bas a chance to
examine it. True, the typewritten transcript
is attached to the original report, but it is net
a part of the report which comes te us.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: My point of order is that
the report is complete. There is no occasion
te produce the printed evidence regarding
these Orders 59 te 81 inclusive.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: I have less objection to the reports being adopted than I
have to the passing of the bills founded on
these reports.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: That is all I want.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I may remind
honourable members that this question came
up two or three years ago. At that time the
honourable gentleman from Parkdale withdrew his objection te the motion for adoption

OCTOBER 81, 1945
on its being explained that the report was
complete in itself. So I will put the question:
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to

SENATE

INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANIZATION-PROTECTION OF WORKERS
RESOLUTION APPROVING CONVENTION

Hon. WISHART MeL. ROBERTSON moved
the following resolution:
Resolved, That this House do approve of the
convention concerning the protection against
accidents of workers employed in loading or
unloading ships (revised), which was adopted
by the General Conference of the International
Labour Organization of the League of Nations
at its sixteenth session in Geneva, on the 27th
day of April, 1932.
He said: Honourable Senators, the International Labour Convention (No. 32) concerning the protection against accidents of
workers employed in loading or unloading
ships was adopted by the International Labour
Conference at its 1932 session. It is a revision
of a convention of 1929.
The Canada Shipping Act was revised in
1934 and was proclaimed on August 1, 1936.
Provision was made in it for the appointment
of an Inspector of Ships' Tackle, and for the
making of regulations to protect persons
employed in loading or unloading ships. The
Act repealed the rather meagre provision that
had previously been made for the protection
of dockers.
On December 14, 1938, an Order in Council
approved regulations for the protection of
dockers along the lines required by the
convention.
The regulations follow closely the British
Docks Regulations of 1934. As a result, a
clause requiring the regulations to be posted
at the docks was inadvertently omitted from
the Canadlian regulations. The British regulations were made under the authority of the
British Factories Act, which requires all regulations made under its authority to be kept
posted in such position as to be conveniently
read by the work people. This omission was
discovered in 1942 and brought to the attention
of the Department of Transport. Accordingly,
the regulations were amended by Order in
Couneil of February 19, 1943 to stipulate that
copies or summaries of the regulations must
be posted at all docks.
The obvious question that came to my mind,
and perhaps it came to the minds of other
honourable senators, was why the delay between the time of the adoption of this convention by the International Labour Organization and the adoption by Canada. On that
point I have been given the following explanation:
The parliamentary history of the Canadian
Docks Regulations is as follows:
In February, 1935, both Houses of Parliament
passed a resolution purporting to approve the
convention of 1932 preparatory te ratification.
Hon. Mr. BEAUREGARD.

At that time, the Canada Shipping Act, 1934,
was not in effect and the necessary regulations
had not been made. This order of procedure,
however (that is, approval by Parliament of
ratification before the enactnent of legislation),
was in line with the then Prime Minister's
opinion as to the proper procedure in connection
with the international labour conventions.

How-

ever, through a clerical error, the unrevised
convention of 1929 was attached ta the resolution adopted by the Houses of Parliament in
1935.
The Honourable Norman Rogers, Minister of
Labour, took up the question of ratification
again on March 30, 1939, after the regulations
of December 1938 had been approved. A notice
of motion to approve the convention was
drafted, but the parliamentary session ended
on June 3 and no action was taken.
It is important to know that while the convention had not been formally ratified by
Canada, its provisions for the protection of men
engaged in the loading or unloading of ships
have been in effect and undoubtedly have proved
of great value, particularly during the war
period.
As I understand it, during the war period no
further action was taken to secure formal
ratification.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Haig, the debate
was adjourned.
ORGANILABOUR
INTERNATIONAL
ZATION-WAGES AND HOURS OF
WORK
RESOLUTION APPROVING CONVENTION

Honourable WISHART MeL. ROBERTSON
moved:
Resolved, That this House do approve of the
convention concerning statistics of wages and
hours of work in the principal mining and
manufacturing industries, including building and
construction, and in agriculture, which was
adopted by the General Conference of the
international Labour Organization of the
League of Nations at its twenty-fourth session
in Geneva, on the 20-th day of June, 1938.
He said: Honourable senators, this convention, adopted at the 1938 session of the
International Labour Conference, requires each
country ratifying it to compile and publish
regularly statistics as to wages and hours of
work, and to furnish the data compiled to the
International Labour Office. The convention
also requires the compilation of information
concerning average earnings and the hours
actually worked. The information relates to
the principal mining and manufacturing industries, including building and construction, and
to agriculture. The convention makes certain
stipulations as to the frequency of publication,
index numbers, and other matters.
No new legislation is necessary in Canada to
give effect to this convention. The Statistics
Act and the Labour Department Act authorize
the Dominion Bureau of Statistics and the

NOVEMBER 1, 1945
Department of Labour, respectively, to compile and publish statisties. The only question
is as to the practice under these statutes.
The Dominion Bureau of Statisties compiles and publishes statisties conoerning earnings and hous of work; statistics concerning
rates of wages and also of hours of work are
compiled and published by the Departmnent
of Labour. The International Labour Office
is furnished with data by both. Thus, the
carrying out of the convention is a joint
undertaking of the Dominion, Bureau of Statistics, the Department of Trade and Commerce and the Departmnent of Labour.
In a letter of February 24, 1943, signed by
the late Dr. S. A. Cudmore, Dominion Statistician, the statement is made that, in his
opinion, "the statistics of wage;s and hours of
work collected hy this Bureau comply with
the ternis of Convention (No. 63)Y.
I might say that the parliamentary history
of this convention is similar to that of
the preceding one. In 1939 the then Minister of Labour, Honourable Norman Rogers,
prepared a resolution for ratification of the
convention, but up to the time Parliament
adjourned in June no action had been taken.
Afterwards the pressure of business pertaining to our war effort was such that it was not
possible to proceed with the ratification until
quite recently.
I move adoption of the resolution.
The motion was agreed to.

HIon. W. M. ASELTINE: Honourable

I should like to refer to the objection taken
yesterday by the honourable senator from
Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte) to divorce bills
being proceeded with. After the Senate rose
he told me that he was interested. in only
one or two bills, pa.rticularly the Gelinas bill,
Order No. 57. I told him a copy of the
evidence in this case was attachcd to, the
report, and was available to him. R1e said

ESTIMATES

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. ELIE BEAUREGARD moved the
second reading of Bill A4, an Act to consolidate and amend the Aets relating to Alliance
Nationale.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: What is it about?
Hon. Mr. BEAUREGARD: The Alliance
Nationale first came into existence in 1893
under the laws of the Province of Quebec as
the Association Provinciale. It was described
as a fraternal and mutual insurance company.
As a matter of fact its insurance business was
of a minor character. In 1917, by federal
legishation, the company was incorporated
under its present titie as a fraternal and
mutual insurance company. Since then the
Act has been twice amended, once in 1924 and
again in 1929. In the -meantime, I understand,
there bas heen a great expansion of the company's insurance business and millions of
dollars of group insurance is now in force. As
a consequence the organization finds it difficult
to operate under its present systema of fraternal
iodgesl. Hence this bill to consolidate an
amend the legislation.
The main purpose of the bill is set out in
section 4:
The compamy is hereby invested with alI the
rights and powers of a mutual if e insurance
company, and is divested of the rights and
powers of a fraternal beniefit society, except te

the extent that they are included in the rights
and powers of a mutual if e insurance compamy.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

amendment to my motion that the Standing
Commîittee on Finance be authorized to ex&mine expenditures proposed by the estimates

laid before Parliamen.t.
While, personally, I had some dou'bt as to
,the wisdom of the amendmnent, nevertheless
I concurred in the suggestion that my honourable friend should proceed with ýit in
order to secure the judgmenit of the Sena-te
with respect to it. I have a great deal of
sympathy with -the motive whioh prompted
the honouraible senator to move his amendme-nt. His intention, as I understand it, ig
to facilitate the study in our committees of
resolutions or bills, in order ithat honourable
members m.ay have the fullest possible information about such measures before they
corne to the Senate for consideration.
While I arn in sympathy with the desire
to secure the full-est information concerning
any question that may corne before this
Hue, after listening to discussion by honourable senators I have grave doubfts as to
the wisdomi of the procedure whieh this
Briefly the amendamendinent proposes.
ment is that:
any Standing or Speeial Committee of the
Senate be authorized to examine aniy resolution
or propcesed bill laid before Parliament ini
advance of the resolution or bill reachimg the
Senate.
My objection is based on two grounds.
First, if the Senate were to adopt the amendment it would therehy abrogate to an extent
the power which it has -of deiding when and
under what circumastances any s3pecific question shahl be referred to, committee.

Hon. Mr.

SENATE
HUGESSEN:

And

to

what

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
And to what
committee.
Further and I say this with
some diffidence in the presence of honourable senators who are so much more experienced than I am-it appears to me that
parliamentary procedure frowns on anticipatory motions.
On the .other hand, it
must be borne in mind that in specific instances the principle bas been adopted; and
to some extent it is adopted in the motion
I am making, in order that we may have
an opportunity of considering the details of
the estimates before the Supply Bill actually
reaches us.
Honourable senators will recall that in'
anticipation of the receipt by this House of
a resolution seeking to ratify Canada's participation in the Food and Agriculture Organization, the Senate specifically agreed to refer the
report of the Interim Commission to the
Committee on Agriculture and Forestry. The
purpose of the reference was not that action
should be taken, but rather that representations might be made with respect to the
resolution before it was actually passed. Honourable senators will recall also that the same
procedure was followed in relation to the
United Nations Charter, which was referred
to committee before the consideration of the
resolution by this House. I think honourable
senators will agree that that procedure was
very beneficial. Nevertheless, the point in my
mind is that the Senate should not relinquish
its power to refer a matter to committee, or,
if it sees fit, to decline to do so. I think it is
desirable to retain that power. If honourable
senators were desirous of securing information
on a particular subject through reference to
a committee, it would always be open to them
to ask the Senate for the necessary authority,
and the Senate would then be the judge as
to the wisdom of such action.
I come now to the second point-the question of which committee shouild undertake the
consideration of a certain matter. On this
point there would always be some difference
of opinion. As honourable senators know,
the margin in such cases is narrow. For
instance, the Senate saw fit to send the report
of the Interim Commission on Food and
Agriculture to the Committee on Agriculture
and Forestry.
Very strong reasons could
have been advanced in support of a proposal
to send it to the Committee on External
Affairs. Indeed. in another place it was referred to the Committee on External Affairs.
Since there is always that question, it seems
to me desirable that honourable senators keep
in their own hands the right to say, first,
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

whether a matter should be referred, and,
second, to which committee it should be
referred. As far as my knowledge goes, the
references that heretofore have been made
in anticipation of legislation coming to this
House in specific cases have worked out reasonably well.
I am hopeful that something may be
worked out in regard to legislation generally.
Of course, we can only act with the concurrence and authority of the Senate; but it
seems to me that anything we can do in order
to secure additional information on matters
of importance before they come to us is, in
principle, right. At the moment I am not
able lo suggest the best method of obtaining
this result and at the same time retaining
authority within the hands of the Senate.
I would suggest therefore to the honourable senator who was courteous enough to
show me an advance copy of the proposed
amendment, that after having secured the
opinion of the Senate on the matter, he might
consider withdrawing his amendment to my
motion.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Honourable senators,
the amendment which I proposed came, as
the honourable leader of the Government has
said, after discussion and correspondence with
him. It arose out of a discussion as to how
bills originating in the House of Commons
could be handled by the Senate. I read the
honourable leader's motion, and it seemed to
me that the Senate had the power to deal
with any legislation the moment it was introduced in the Commons. In reply to the criticism that my amend;ment is too wide open,
I would say that any question as to what
committee should consider a particular matter
could be dealt with by the Senate at the
time.
I understand now that the honourable leader
of the Government proposes to work out
some method by which the Senate will have
ample opportunity to examine and review
important legislation from the other House
before being called upon to approve it. Whatever procedure is adopted, if that result is to
come about I tbink the purpose of my amendment has been achieved. After looking into
the rules I have no hesitation in saying that
if the Senate lacks time for the consideration
of Commons bills, it is simply because it has
not used its power to sec that bills, after
their introduction into the House of Communs, are brought before the Committee of
the Whole here or one of our standing or
special committees.
Measures other than
roney bills can be dea:it with in any way that
the Senate sees fit-amended up or down, or
rejected; and when a bill is rejected the

NOVEMBER 1, 1945

Senate can, if it wishes, initiate another
measure to replace it. It does seem. to me
that in the field of legisiation whieh we, must
face over the coming years, the Senate must
flot only adopt some such procedure for considering Commons bills, but must develop
fadifities for conference between both Huses
as part of their working machinery.
I arn very pleased to accede to the request
of the honourable leader of the Government,
and to withdraw the amendment.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I thank the
honourable gentleman.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I fear that a short-cut
is being taken. It seems to me there should
be a motion that the honourable senator be
granted, leave to withdraw bis amendment.
I-on. Mr. MrGEER: I will stand corrected
on a mere detail of that kind.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It is necessary
to have leave f or witbdrawal of an amendment. It is moved 'by Hon. Senator MeGeer,
seconded by Hýon. Senator Veniot, that leave
be granted for withdrawal of the amendment.

The Senate resumed from Tuesday, October
30, the adjou.rned debate on the notice of
Hon. Mr. McRae:
That hae will eall the attention of the Senate
to the developmnent of Our gold resources, and
what an active programme to increase our gold
production could mean to the general prosperity
of Canada, particularly in the empioyment of
labour, the establishment of new comfnunities
aad the importance of gold in taking care of
our foreîgn obligations.

a very excellent speech i.s one that deserves
the serious onsgideraMon of thi,- bonourable
47704-14

A few years ago a representative
House.
in Canada of une of the Central European
powers calied on me at my office in the
Langevin Block, where the Department of
Mines and Resources has its headquarters.
After some conversation hie asked me if
I would point out -to him on the 'map the
location of our radium -mines. I had a map
of the Dominion -on the wall. We went over
to it and I pointed eut the location of the
mine at the south-eastern corner of Great

Bear Lake, less than thirty miles from the
Arotie Circle. I told him some-thing of the
romance of the discovery of this mine and
of *its later development, with which I shaîl
not burden 'the House today.
Our talk led on to a discussion -of our
mineral resources, and I informed my friend
of the great pre-Cambrian shield which extends f ro-m Labrador in a great arc down
below Hudson's Bay, cubting into nortbern
Quehec and northern Ontario, dipping dewn
into Michigan and a corner of Minnesota,
then running northward again, and f rom
northern Manitoba and northern Saskatchewan
on through almat -to the Aretie Circle at
Great Bear Lake. That is a vast area, eaubracing a distance of almost 4,000 miles.
I informed himi that the knowledge we po&sessed berause ef explora:tions and development wooek already projected and carried ott
gave us a pretty clear iiýdication -that anywhere al.ong that vast arc we might expect to
find either precious or cemmercial metals.
From that we went on to talk about our
other resources. He inquired about timber.
I explained to bim -that we had -a greait belt
of coniferous trees, extending fromn the
Atlantic across Quebec and the northern
part of Ontario, Manitoba, Saska-tchewan,
Alberta and *on in-to British Columbia. Then
1 told him about our great inland and coastal
fisheries. This led to a discussion of another
important natural resource-our fur--bearing
animaIs. As hýonourable senators well know,
a few hundred years ago the expert of furs
was tbe principal trade of this country. Let
me say in passing that sound methods of
conservation will restore this great natural
resource to the position it eccupied in those
remote days.
We sat down, and my visitor cogitated fer
a few minutes. Then hie said to me: "Mr.
Crerar, you have a very, very rich country,
but-if you will pardon me for saying soyou are a very wasteful peuple." On refiection
I came to the conclusion that my friend was
right on buth counts. We have a country of
great natural resources, the products of whiuhi
are needed in our complex civilization. I arn
afraid that we are a wastefuil or-shaîl I say-

acVX&,D]MITION

184

SENATE

a careless people in the control, development
and management of these very valuable
natural resources. Evidence of this is found in
the fact that on an average the ravages of
insects and fires exact a higher annual toll of
our forest wealth than is taken by commercial
operations. That is a reproach to our management of this very important natural resource.
The direct icss of our forest wealth is serious
enough. but the collateral consequences may be
far-reaching if the depletion is not ebrcked.
As honourable members are aware, the east
slope of the Rocky Mountains is covered witb
a heavy growth of trees, mainly spruce. Even
before Alberta's natural resources were transferred to her, fire was making great inroads on
this foest wealth in that province. The fire
loss continues. The provincial authorities say
they have net got the financial means to maintain an adequate fire protection service; and
because of the lack of protection there are
beavy fire losses in that area almost every year.
If we project our minds into the future, it
is net difficult to realize what these annually
recurring losses will bring about. Once this
forest cover goes, the waters that come down
from the mountains into both branches of the
Saskatchewan river, the Red Deer river and
other streams, will in the spring become roaring
torrents, with soil e'osion and flood damage;
in the summer-time the flow will dwindle te
a triekle, and cities and towns that depend
o these rivers will lose their water supply.
Honourable members will recall that our fur
resources were for years ruthlessly exploited,
with no thought of conservation at all. In later
years it was realized, particularly in the Indian
Branch of the Department of Mines and
Resources, that over 40 per cent of our Indians
are located in the northern part of the Prairie
Provinces and that, since these Indians depend
on trapping for their livelihood, if the furbearing animais disappeared the Indians would
then become public charges. Bearing that in
mind, some seven or eiglt years ago the
drpartment instituted a programme for the
rehabilitation of this valuable natural resource.
The success of this work is now demonstrated
beyond any question of doubt. It is apparent
that if we devise sensible methods to conserve
our natural resources, these resources can
be maintained and increased.
I could give further illustrations of the
benefits which have already come from our
conservation policy. For instance, in the past
our great inland fisheries were ruthlessly
exploited; but now we have demonstrated
the effectiveness of methods for the conservation of tis
important natural resource.
I realize that the natural resources are in the
hands of the provinces and therefore our part
Hon. Mr. CRERA R.

can only be that of a partner, nevertheless
I believe some feasible plan of conservation
can be worked out for the protection and
development of our great natural wealth.
To corne more directly to the motion, as I
have already stated, I think the Senate is
indebted to the honourable member from
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae) for bringing
the matter of gold production to our attention. It is interesting to note that the production of gold in Canada has reached its
present development within virtually the last
fifty years. Prior to that time there were a
few mines in operation in the Maritime Provinces, there was some placer mining in British
Columbia. and there were one or two small
gold mining developments in the older parts
of Ontario. But the production was insignificant. Half a century ago the vast waste
of rock extending from Labrador to Great
Bear Lake was regarded as worthless. It
was granitic rock and it was the generally
accepted theory that it contained no mineral
wealth.
A very interesting event led to a
change of opinion. Upwards of forty years
ago the Ontario Government projected a
colonizing railway to Northern Ontario to
reach the clay belt. This belt later was trarailway.
by the Transcontinental
versed
Blasting operations in the Temiskaming area
revealed very definite traces of silver. and
led to the conviction that if those granitic
rocks contained silver they might also contain
other metals. Prospecting took place, with
results that are now familiar to all. That
discovery led te the belief that anywhere
throughout this great pre-Cambrian field we
might expect to find both precious and base
metals. Later developments have completely
revolutionized the theories which geologists
and mining men held fifty years ago. Outside this great field we have ricli possibilities
in British Columbia, the home province of
the honourable senator. British Columbia
has made substantial progress in both quartz
and alluvial goldi mining. Base metals. notably
lcad and zinc, have also been found in the
ores from tbis province when put through the
smelters at Trail.
What we are considering today relates more
directly to gold, and I should like to give the
House some information on the progress made
in this regard. When the Temiskaming and
Northern Ontario Railwav was built through
to Cochrane, we had one of the first gold
mining developments, in the Porcupine area.
Romance aise surrounded that discovery, and
today there are probably a score of operating
mines in that district, with a thriving city of
thirty thousand people. I refer to Timmins.
In this single area within a period of little

NOVEMBER 1, 1945
more than thirty years upwards of $750,000,000 worth of gold has been produced. No
area in Canada of similar dimensions has
produced that amount of wealth in that time.
In passing I shall merely mention Kirkland
Lake and Noranda and the great belt that
extends from Kirkland through to Senneterre
on the National Transcontinental Railway, but
a little later I may bave a word or two to say
about that area.
The production of gold in Canada steadily,
increased until a few years ago, when war
conditions led to its curtailment. It is interesting to note that in the so-called depression
years from 1930 to 1936 or 1937 our only
advance was in the gold-mining industry. It
showed an improvement every year throughout the depression. For instance, the production of gold in 1931 was 2,693,000 ounces, with
a value, based on the old price of gold, in
excess of $58,000,000. In 1941, our banner
year, production had grown to 5,345,000
ounces with a value of $205,000,000. In 1944
there was a substantial decline, the reasons
for which I will mention in a minute or two.
In that year our gold production was 2,922,000
ounces, representing a value of $112,000,000
odd. In other words, within a period of three
years the value of our gold production dropped
by almost 50 per cent.
The reasons for that drop in production are
not far to seek. After the outbreak of war we
gave encouragement to our gold mining companies to increase their production, because
it was one of the most useful means
the Finance Department had by which to get
the exchange necessary to purchase the large
amount of supplies we were then buying in the
United States. After the Hyde Park declaration, and the understanding embodied in it,
the economies of the two countries were, for
the purposes of war, largely integrated. A
situation developed in which the United
States, mistakenly, I think, to a large extent
closed down on its gold production. In other
words, the board that had to do with the
matter of supplies declined to furnish the
mines with necessary machinery, because iron
and steel and other raw materials were needed
for war purposes. In Canada we had much
the same situation. We could not very -well
ask the United States to supply us with iron
and steel in order to maintain our gold mining
industry when the United States was fol-lowing
the policy I have mentioned with regard to its
own industry. There were some other reasons
too, which I shall mention presently.
47704-14J

185

It may be of interest to honourable senators
to know that South Africa followed a different
policy. In the production of gold South Africa
leads the world, the United States is next, and
so far as the known production is concerned,
Canada is third. It may be that Canada's
production is exceeded by that of Russia; but
we have no statistics on that country. This
indicates the important place that Canada occupies in the production of gold.
In 1938 Canada's production of gold was
4,725,000 ounces; in 1944 it dropped to 2,922,000
ounces. In South Africa in 1938 the production was 12,161,000 ounces; in 1944 it was 12,277,000 ounces, an increase of over 100,000
ounces. The problems in South Africa, however, may have been different from ours, so
far as the prosecution of the war was concerned. That comparison is interesting. I stili
think that probably the shrewdest minds so
far as international trade and commercial
development are concerned are to be found in
Great Britain. Whatever the reason may have
been for it, the mines in South Africa were
kept in production.
I do not wish to discuss today, honourable
senators, the relation of gold to monetary
theories. That is a field where angels almost
fear to tread. It may be said, however, that
in the last fifteen years there has developed
a school of thought which holds that in some
mysterious fashion international currencies, in
their relation to each other, can be managed
without recourse to gold. The chief value of
gold in the good old days before the war of
1914-18, was to hold in balance international
payments. . The value of the currencies of all
the leading countries of the world had a definite relationship to gold. The result was
that a person in Canada wishing to sell wheat,
timber or bacon could get bidéa from abroad
and instantly translate them into terms of
Canadian dollars, and thereby; in establishing
his profit, avoid the risk of fluctuation in
currencies. This procedure provided an easy
method of doing international business. For
the time being that has all gone; and what
may happen in the future is as yet largely
closed to our vision.
While I do not wish to discuss gold in relation to monetary theories, I should like to
give the House some information about its
value in the internal economy of our country,
in the matter of producing wealth and providing employment. I doubt if there is any
other Canadian business activity that is so
fruitful in providing employment and in fertilizing public revenues, as is mining, especially of gold. For instance, in 1937, the ex-

SENATE

186

pend-itures of Canada's gold mines for consumable stores, equipment, electrical power,
fuel, freight and insurance amounted to over
$40,000,000.
Those commod.ities, as broken
down by the Bureau of Statistics, include
about forty items. In the base metal mines
a similar condition prevailed. Their total expendýitures for the items I mention was over
$59,000,000. The combined purchases, of the
base metal mines and the gold mines total
practically $100,000,000, and this is exclusive
of wages and salaries paid.
I have here some information on the International Nickel Company that might be of
interest to the House. The management of
that company will have no objection, I amx
sure, as the information was received not
in confidence, but was sent to me at my
request. In the year 1936 the total wages
paid by · he International Nickel Company
t
were a few thousand dollars short of
$15,000,000, and' the total expenditures for
commodities required for their mining operafions were over $26,500,000. Now $26,000,000
is a very considerable expenditure by one
company for materials. In analyzing this, I
will touch only on items in excess of $1,000,000.
The amount expended on iron and steel bars,
sheets, plates and ail structural steel was
$2,382,384; and on coal, coke, charcoal and
wood, was $3,900,000. It should be interesting
for our Nova Scotia friends to note that
312,000 tons of this coal came from their
province. The item for lumber and timber of
all kinds is over $2,000,000. That figure included over $314,000 spent on fir and cedar
freni British Columbia. Electrical equipnent
cost more than $1,300,000; machinery and repair parts for smelters, $1,483,000; acids and
chemicals-and this shows the broad range of
materials required-took almost $1,400,000.
There is one other item which, though it is
less than $1,000,000. will be of seme interest,
particularly to senators fron Western Canada.
The smelter fluxes that are used to mix with
ore in the smelting process cost over $354,000.
Of these fluxes, 37,711 tons of sodium sulphate
came from a lake in the province of
Saskatchewan.
May J mention one or two more items?
The power purchased cost $1,200,000; and for
railway, freight and express-a problem that
does net bother us now but may in the future
-there was an expenditure of $4,500,000.
I apologize to
burdening them-

honourable

Hon. Mr. QUINN: Go on.
lon. Mi. CRER AR.

senators

for

Hon. Mr. CRERAR: -with these details.
These figures show the extent of the operations
of such an enterprise. I could name a property
in the province of Manitoba where a great
copper and zinc mine has been developeil
that employs almost 2,000 people, pays wages
of around $3,000,000 a year and supports a
community of between 8,000 and 9,000 people.
It is interesting to reflect that the distribution of this purchasing power benefits everyone in Canada, including the agriculturist and
the railway man. The purchase in one year
in British Columbia by the International
Nickel Company of $350,000 worth of lumber,
and timber in other forms, gave employment
to a large number of railway men. And it is
the same all down the line. I think there is
substantial basis for my statement that this
industry is fruitful in providing employment
and fertilizes our public revenue in a healthy
fashion.
I should like to say a word or two about
taxation. In discussing this question one
realizes that ho is perhaps treading on somewhat delicate ground, but I have always
believed, and I aver my belief today, that the
tax levied upon the business of corporations
is in its essence an unwise tax. That applies
particularly, I think, to the mining industry,
because of the very nature of that industry.
The value of the ore in a mine might be
indicated by a line from A to X. At A the
ore may be worth only $1.50 a ton, not justifying development for commercial purposes.
At X it may be worth $15 a ton, far more
than the minimum price necessary to make
the ore a commercial proposition. Somewhere
between A and X is found the breaking point,
where the ore is valuable enough to enable the
mine to pay operating expenses, look after
depreciation and yield a reasonable return on
the money invested in it. Now, the result of
taxation, and particularly of oppressive taxation, is to move that point farther up the line.
If by paying no tax you can mine $6 per ton
ore profitably, and the imposition of a tax
makes it impossible to mine any ore below the
value of $7, then because of the tax the body
of ore ranging in value between 86 and $7 is
converted into waste rock, the life of the mine
is shortened, the volume of employment of
miners is lessened and the total value of
wealth produced over a period of years is
decreased.
Mines are a wasting asset. In that respect
mining differs from almost any other industry
in Canada. The gold mines that are at present producing will some day reach the end
of tlîeir deposits. If wise policies of reforesta-

NOVEMBER 1, 1945
tien can be maintained, the soul and the
natural conditions that produced trees in the
last fifty years will produce trees in the next
fifty years. Similarly in farming, if good
methods are used the soil will, gen'erally
speaking. continue to produce good crops.
But, as 1 say, mines are a wasting asset. That
fact should. be taken more inte account wben
taxation is being considered. There seems ta
be a feeling that mining cempanies make a
great deal of meney, and that a widespread
public outcry wou]d arise against any government that dared te tax themn at sensible
rates. I do net hoid that view, honourabie
senaters. I arn confident that if a probiem
is theroughly exp]ained te the people at large
they wili in the end reach a cemmen-sense
decisien as te its solution.
There are just one or two other points 1
should like te mention. We are ahl concerned
with the financial situation in which the country finds itself as a result of aur participation
in the war. 1 believe it is safe te say that
when this war business is cleaned up aur
federal debt may be of the order of 17 billion
dollars, or very close ta that figure; and
sirnpiy by taking paper and peneil and totalling our obligations we can see that in erder
te meet our commitments it wiil be necessary
ta raise by taxation one and three-quarter or
two billion dollars a year. I arn net geing te
say today tbat that is beyond tbe capacity of
the Canadian people. I have my d-oubts
&bout that, but that is net my argument
today. My argument is that there is need,
first, for rigid economy wberever possible in
public expenditures, and, secondly, for sound
and wise policies in relation te aur wbele
national development.
I do think that our minîng industry is one
of the greatest patential assets in this country,
and I should like just briefly te run over
the known possibilities of the great shield.
Up in the Quebec -Labrador area there
has been discovered in recent monthis a
very rich and very large body of iran ore.
Ores of other metals have also, been found
there. Coming on down througb Quebec we
find the regien from. Kirkland Lake te Senneterre, where tbere are several producing
mines, inciuding the large Noranda mine.
Tben in Ontario there is the International
Nickel Company's mine. Canada is today
the chief source of the worid's nickel suppiy.
Ia the Michipicoten section north of Lake
Superier there are iron mines and some goid
mines. Farther west we run into the Central
Patricia area, the Red Lake Area and the
Steep Rock area. And se it gees, throukh te
the Great Slave Lake region, where within
the iast few years we have uncevered a poten-

187

tiai gold production equai, perhaps, te that of
any other area in Canada ta date. Then there
are the rich metals of British Columbia.
Now, I submit that, having regard te this
ceuntry's financial situation and need for buge
revenues, it is only sensible tbat we should
intelligently study bow best te deveiop* these
resources, which previde employment and
create wealtb. Then we must frankiy see bow
best we can exchange the wealth we preduce
for things that can be ebtained oniy from
ether countries. This cornes pretty close ta
a question that I do net wish ta discuss here
taday, but I de say that a solution ef aur
financial difficulties can come about only
through a tremendeus expansion of Canada's
international trade.
Mines are net our oniy reseurces with great
potentialities. There are aur forests, aur
furs, our fisb, eur rich agricultural lands.
But 1 shall net discuss these today. I sheuId
like, however, te make -wbat I think is a
practicai suggestion, whicb is that at the
beginning of next session we migbt weli
consider setting up a committee of this
hýonourable Huse te examine into these
resources and make recommendations for
their wise deveiopment. While we may net

Since my ýarrivai here I have observed that
the Senate looks at things a iittle more
abjectiveiy than the other buse does, that
we are a littie furtber remnoved from that

inquiry into tbe ebaracter af our resources
and the best methods of conserving and

Canadian people would be of real value ta us

could make a useful contribution ta the

GOLD PRODUCTION IN CANADA
DISCUSSION

The Senate resumed from Thursday, Novemnber 1, the adjourned d'ebate on the notice of
Hon. Mr. McRae:
That hie will cali the attention of the Senate
ta the development of our gold resources, and
what an active programme to increase our gold
production could mean ta the general pTosperity
of Canada, particularly in the employmrenft of
labour. the establishment of new communities
and the importance of gold in taking care of
our foreign obligaitions.
Hon. GERALD G. MeGEER: Honouralile
members, the subject-matter of this notice by
the honourable senator fromn Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. McRae) raises some very important
features of our post-war programme. The
pertinent issue immediately under discussion
is the part that increased production of Canadian gold. will play in: (a) Canadian general
prosperity; (b) employment of labour; (c)
establishment of new communities; (d) the
meeting of our foreign obligations.
But, by i mplication, there is something even
more important with regard to our gold production than is raised, specifically in those
issues, and that is the part that our gold will
play in stabilizing Canadian buying power and
the unit of Canada's medium of exchange, in
foreign .markets.
Before any sound judgmen.t can be offered
with regard to any of these questions, the
value of gold in our national economy and
the part 'that it can fulfil in our national
affairs should be determined. No one knows
better than I the great diversity of opinion
that exista in the minds of people in all walks
of life with regard to that strange and alluring metal which we caîl gold. Other than for
decorative purposes, as a metal it hasn't much
value. The monetary value that àt possesses
has heen given to it either by law or hy
custom. It is rare, but not by any means the
scarcest of our metals. Nor is it by any
meaüs the most durable. It is easily workable and doesn't discolour or deterioratequal.ities which make it suitable for use ini

the decorative arts. But its use even in this
domain has been steadily declining. Gold
plates for the dinner table, gold for false
teeth, and even gold for jewellery no longer
has the vogue that it possessed in what some
are pleased to call "the good old days of gold
fobs and watch chains". In the sign-painters
craft, however, it does still hold a place of
importance.
In the field of monetary service gold bas
suffered a similar decline in popularity. It
bas ceased to circulate as coins, and is no
longer considered essential as a security for
the value of paper currency, bank deposits or
Notwithstanding all these and
contracts.
other facts which prove that it is one of the
most useless and the least used of all the
metals of the earth, it is still a metal to be
reckoned with.
While Shakespeare's statement that "gold is
the strength, the sinews of the world" is no
longer truc, the fact that gold is the only
safe and secure form of universal wealth cannot be denied. The votaries of gold are everywhere, of every race and colour, and there
is' no corner of the earth where gold will not
buy anything that is for sale.
Gold still
retains the amazing grip that it bas had on
the imagination of the peoples of all generations. It still holds a place of commanding
authority in the grim realities of the ceonomic
progress of civilization.
The classics reveal the inythical Golden
Fleece of the Argonauts, and gold takes the
leading role in Shakespeare's human tragedy
of the pound of flesh, where the exaction of
blood for interest was denied. The worship
of the Golden Calf was proclaimed the unforgivable sin; but strangely enough the worship of gold grew apace, until finally gold
itself became the veritable ruling power in
the march of human progress.
The lure of gold brought the Spaniards to
Mexico and to South America, and wrote into
our history the stories of the fabled wealth
of the Incas and the bloody and blazing conflicts of the Spanish Main. It took the fortune hunters to California, to the land of the
Cariboo in British Columbia, to the veldts
of South Africa, to the deserts of Australia
and Colorado, to the high north of the
Klondike and, Alaska, and to the wild and
vast reaches of Canada's pre-Cambrian shield.
The gold-seeker bas blazed the trail in many
lands, where others have followed to settle
and wrest from Mother Earth far greater
riches than all the gold that was ever found.
The part that the lure of gold bas played
in the spread of civilization is no less important than the tremendous influence it bas
exercised in the march of human progress.
Hon. Mr. McGEER.

In 1816 the gold standard was established by
English law as the single basis of the monetary power of the British race. By 1873 it
became the monetary standard of all the
nations of Christendom. Upon the gold standard was built the great financial strength of
the City of London, and that was the power
which played one of the most important
parts in the creation of the modern might of
the vast world empire of the British Crownstill the mightiest empire ever known in the
history of mankind, and the greatest single
force for the betterment of individual and
international relations in all this troubled
world.
The course of human progress under the
rule of the gold standard, while tremendous
in its sweep and force, was never smooth and
easy. It was characterized by wars and revolutions, booms and depressions, the building
of great fortunes and all the disasters that
follow in the wake of bankruptey and repudiation.
Stability for world commerce was
never part of the alleged security which was
always put forth as the great and enduring
virtue of the gold standard. It was always
used hy those who actually controlled its
operation, the great international bankers, to
produce conditions of trade to suit themselves.
During the last 175 years there have been
43 periods of progressive prosperity of varying length of time and intensity, and in the
same period there have been 43 periods of
countervailing depression. Depression periods
followed boom periods with the consistent
regularity of the rising and the setting of the
sun.
I am going to put on the record here a
statement of booms and depressions and the
years in which they occur. It is as follows:

SENATE

in the British House of Commons, and I quote
from the British Hansard of April 28, 1925,
the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Winston
Spencer Churchill said:
A return to an effective gold standard has
long been the settled and declared policy of
this country. Every expert conference since
the war-Brussels, Genoa-every expert committee in this country, has urged the principle
of a return to the gold standard. No responsible
authority has advocated any other policy.
After stating that all of the overseas
dominions were taking similar action, Mr.
Churchill went on to say:
During the late administration, the late
Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Snowden)
appointed a committee of experts and high
authorities . . . presided over by my right
hon. friend who is now Secretary of State for
Foreign Affairs (Mr. A. Chamberlain) . . .
This Committee heard evidence from a great
number of witnesses representing every kind of
interest; financial and trading interest. manufacturing interest, the Fedieration cf British
Industries and others, were heard. It has presented a unanimous report in which it expresses
a decided opinion upon the question of the gold
standard, and it sets forth its recommendations
as to the manner in which a return to that
standard

should be effected

. .

. which His

Majesty's Government are intending to follow
in every respect.
This course was followed and nothing but a
miracle saved England and the British Empire
from destruction. There was a general strike,
a threatened. mutiny in the Navy, a curtailment of wages, and unemployment and poverty
struck all over England where it was promised
that the prosperity of the good old days of
gold would bloom again.
The economic structure of England collapsed, and in 1931 the gold standard, was
jettisoned from the British ship of state as
the only means of saving it from crashing on
the rocks of utter ruin and despair. Churchill
was blamed for his party's defeat and his
country's ruin. A National -Government was
formed. A system of managed currency independent of gold was undertaken to retrieve
the Empire's place in world affairs, and as the
only means of escape from the disaster which
the gold standard had imposed on Britain's
patriotic and hard-working masses.
On April 22, 1932, the British Hansard at
page 1661 records the apology of the same
Mr. Churchill for the debacle he had created.
In his own clear and expressive words he told
the tale and fixed the blame. Here is what he
had to say seven years after he had returned
England to gold and nearly to ruination:
Out of all the tangles and clouds of argument
we can sec quite plainly this knobbly point projecting: the artificial enhancement in the price
of gold and the ceonsequent fall in the price of
everything that is measured by it

. . . but I

regret and gýrieve that gold is a measure which
has played the traiter.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER.

When I was moved by many arguments and
forces in 1925 to return to the gold standard J
was assured by the highest experts-and our
experts are men of great ability and of indisputable integri-ty and sincerity-that we were
anchoring ourselves to reality and stability:
and I accepted their advice. I take for myself
and my colleagues of ther days whatever degree
of blame and burden there may be for having
accepted their advice. But what has happened?
We have no realdty, and no stability.
With the abandonment of gold in 1931,
England started to rebuild all that had been
lost and brighter days began to reappear. On
April 23, 1936 the British Hansard at pages
327 and 329 records the same irrepressible Mr.
Churchill declaring the new order and the
better days produced by the abandonment of
the gold standard. Here is what he said:
Look at the changes since 1929.
We have shaken ourselves entirely free from
the old Gladstonian structure of tradition of
finance.
Pracitices hitherto condemned have
been adopted by general consent. Vast new
sources of revenue have been opened and expedients have been successfully adop-ted for regulatI was the last orthodox

The gold standard is not only dead but it has
been relegated for a long period to purgatory.
The gold standard of blessed memory is goneunwept, unhonoured and unsung.
But let us look at the causes which forced these
Unemployment doubled;

foreign trade halved; the carrying trade, shipping and shipbuilding woefully reduced; Lancashire broken; the cotton trade to India fallen
to one-quarter of what it was. A dark cloud
of economie privation enveloped the once
brilliant North.
This were the people of England sacrificed upon the altar of gold. Thus were
warnings of men like Kitson, Bryan and a
host of others heeded, long after they should
have been acted on.
In the same speech Mr. Churchill sounded
a brighter note. He said:
We meet now in circumstances in which the
problems arising out of the gold standard have
been surmounted by its abandonment.
He pointed out that: the Budget was balanced; the Chancelior had realized a surplus;
credit was never higher; the rent of monïey
had fallen to leveis rivalling the palmy days of
Queen Victoria; the cost of living was relatively low to wages and banks were gorged
with unprecedented accumulations. Thus did
Churchill proclaim England's charter of freedom from the gold standard.
The people of the United States of America
suffered from the manipulations of the gold
standard no less severely than did their
kindred races across the seas. And the great
lesson that we in our generation must learn
is that the manipulation of money in any of
its ferms can never be anything but a super-

charge upon the creation, the production and
the distribution of real wealth.
The gold standard administration of Andrew
Mellon, who was often declared the greatest
Secretary of the Trcasury since Alexander
Hamnilton, brought the Republican Party cf
Herbert Hoover and tlie economic structure of
the UJnited States into a state of complete collapse. Roosevelt wàtli lis New Demil propower and took charge of
gramme came
a nabion facing ruin and revolution. Legisi-ation was at once passed repudiaiting ail gold
obligations. Thus did the propliesy of Arthur
Kitson in 1894 come ýtrue in the United, States
by an Act of that great nation's Congreas.
Yes, the gold obligations in every form were
repudiated by laýw. But Roosevelt on January
31, 1934, ra.ise-d the price of gold from $20.67 to
$35 an ounce, and aIt this price proceeded -to
build up the most valuabdle golid reserves ever
accumulated.
The plight of our English-speaking world,
weltering in unemployment and .pLtiable defensedlessness, due entirely to our false conviction that we could not create our own money
for our own ýpurposes, enoouraged the Germans
in their smouldering hope for revenge. Under
the guidance of Scliacht, who had planned andi
maînaged the repudiation of Gerinan delits in
1923, German brade and finance was relbuilt,
while the German army staff feverislily proceeded to prepare for their blîbzkreig rwar cf
world conquest.
As we look back and take stock of our
present position witli a view to securing the
future, we sliould keep clearly in mind, par-.
ticuiarly when we are dealing with gold, that
it was the, same higli priests of orthodox finance who led us to economic disaster under
the gold standard, and wlio during the workless
thirties kept us in such a state of planned
poverty that Germany, undýer Hitler and bis
financial wizard, Schacht, was eimboldened to
apenly prepare for war against us with a
blatsincy that was only less conspicuous than
lier scorn and contempt for lier former conquerors, whom she was planning to attack and
destroy.
In dealjing with war criminals we should not
forget the sorry part .played in tliat sickening
tragedy by our own same finaincial rulers who,
forced to abandon their worslsip at the alirine
of gold, now offer a no leas dangerous devotion
before the altar of public débt, taxation, and
regimentation by unbricHled bureaucracy. In
their ritual the threat of inflation as the inevitable result of the use of national currency
now takes the place of their no les false -but
now discredited dogmna tliat gold was the base
oêf our securiby and the sheet anclior of our
credit.

ail know came not from gold but froma the
misuse and abuse of gold hy those wlio arnployed its magie power as the hypnotic
influence in the trickery and legerdemain of
manipulating debts under the golci standard,
to deceive and corrupt a guileless and unsuspecting people, and as the cloaking facade for
the kind of treachery which to, mankind was
forever symbolized in the selfish "kiss of
Judas".
After his bitter experience as Chancellor
of the Exchequer-a position in which lis
father had met bis Waterloo-Churchill gave
this ominous warning to the people of the
British Empire:
Are we really going to accept the position
that the whole future development of science,
our organization, our increasing co-operation,
and the fruitful era of peace and good will
among men and nations, are ail to be arhitrarily barred 'by -the price of gold?
Is the progress of the human race in -this
age of almost terrifying expansion to be arbitrarily barred and regulated by fortuitous discoveries of gold mines here and there, or by
the extent to which we can persuade the existing cornerers and hoarders of gold to put their
hoards again into common stock?
Are we -to be told that human civilization
and society would have been impossible if gold
had not happened to lie an element in the
composition of the globe?
These are absurdities; but they are .becoming
dangerous and deadly absurdities.
These are not my words, but those of one
of the most experienced statesmen in the
British Empire today.
They have only te be asserted long enough,
they have only to lie lef t.ungrappled with long
enough, to endanger -that capitalist -and credit
system upon which the liberties and enjoyments and prosperity, in xny helief, of the vast
masses depend.
1, therefore, point to this evil and te the
search for the methods of remedying it, as the
first, the second and the third of ail the problems which should command and rivet our
thoughts.
These are issues raîsed by the resolution of
the honourable senator from Vancouver. The
"evil" Churchill refers to was not gold, but
the monetary systeco in which gold bad been
misused and the power of gold terribly abused.
Our problem is te correct the abuses in the
use of gold, and to, place il in its proper
position with ail fis power and miglit in our
economîc structure.
If gold is no longer necessary to secure the
value of the money now employed undtr
our established systern of managed currency,
wliat value lias it in the monetary field? Its

international relations.
Unfortunately the
volume of international trade and debt, like
all internal trade and debt, has swollen to
such vast proportions that there is not a
sufficient volume of gold in circulation, in
the possession of or available to the individual
debtor and debtor nations, to effect a balance
in the d-isequilibrium which now exists.
Deliberate management of international trade,
commerce and exchanges has already superseded the old practices of settling unfavourable balances by shipment of gold. In the
future, international trade will more and more
depend upon management, designed to keep
exchanges of goods, services and investments
in balance; and no nation or group of nations
can hope in the future to secure favourable
balances of trade under the practices of the
good old days when the false economy of
selling more and buying less was so relentlessly pursued. As an aid to keeping international relations in balance, gold has now
found the place given to it in the report of
the British MacMillan Committee, published
a few months after England was forced off
gold in 1931 by French and American gold
hoarders. The importance of that report may
not be as yet fully appreciated, but we in
Canada, as far as gold is concerned, have
moved ýpretty well along the course indicated
in the following sections:
I am not going to cite the sections referred
to and reaid them in detail, but I am going to
put Sections 323, 324, 325, 327 and 340 on
the record.
323. In present day conditions when the
active circulation of notes is mainly required
for the purpose of meeting wage payments
and small transactions usually settled in cash,
an expansion in the active note issue is likely
to be a result of active trade ensuing with
an appreciable interval after an expansion in
the bank's deposits. Thus it is the latter
which is now the factor of dominating importance, and the somewhat anomalous position
arises that while the bank is not regulated
by law in respect of its deposits it remains
-so regulated in respect of the note issue
which was a hundred years ago the initiating
cause of inflation but today is the factor
which is the latest to be affected by the
forces of expansion or contraction.
324. The criticism to which the present
system is open is rather that the principle of
the fixed fiducia-ry issue is wrong in that it
associates the amount of the gold which the
Bank of England should ho-Id immobilized and
unavailable for export with the amount of the
active note circulation.
325. We cannot regard as satisfactory a
system under which so high a proportion of
the gold stock is locked up in such a way as
not to be available for export if the Central
Bank should so desire.
Hon. Mr. McGEER.

327. As regards the right principles for
regulating gold reserves in the changed circumstances of today, we may, without entering
into a long argument, summarise our views
very briefly as follows:
(i) If it is thought unnecessary to fetter
the discretion of the Bank of England in
regard to the volume of its deposits, which
in a modern system is the significant and
operative factor, there can be ne good reason
for fettering very narrowly its power to issue
notes.
(ii) There are great advantages in a higb
(iree of mobili-ty for the gold reserves of
Central Banks. For the task of reconciling
international exchange stability w ith domestic
credit stability will be made casier if the
Central Bank is free on occasion to allow
wider fluctuations in the proportion of its
total assets which -is made up of gold and
comparable items. It is also desirable that
the publie should become accustomed net to
attach undue importance to fluctuations which
the Bank bas deliberately permitted.
(iii) In present circumstances it is highly
desirable that throughout the world the disadvantages of the immobility of gold, and
of laws whereby a very high proportion of
the world's total stock of gold is rendered
sterile, should be modified, and we should not
maintain any legislation which confliets with
this aim.
(iv) Nevertheless, it is not unreasonable to
regard some part of a country's gold ,reserve
as not belonging to the Central Bank's masse
de manœuvre for normal daily use, but as
an ultimate reserve, not to ba brought into
consideration in ordinary cases, but kept as a
last resort for use only on grave national
occasions and after special deliberation between
the Government and the Bank.
ýSuch a
reservation can be justified both by its effect
on confidence and in itself.
(v) The proper amount of this ultimate
reserve cannot be reached as a fixed proportion
of the note circulation (which is the usual
principle abroad) or as the excess of the note
circulation over a fixed figure (which is the
principle of the British fiduciary issue). For
it depends on quite different factors from
those which determine the note issue.
A
change, for example, in the habits of the public
in paying by note or by cheque respectively
caninot affect the appropriate amount of the
gold which we hold against emergencies.
(vi) Just as the amount of gold heltd by
the Bank should be settled independently of
the volume of the note issue, se any precautionary limits which it may be thought
advisable to set to the Bank's power of note
issue should be settled independently of the
amount of gold which it is required to hold.
The best form of limitation on the discretion
of the BanL of England in regard to the
volume of its note issue, is, we think, the
system which prevailed in France for many
years before the War, nameily, an absolute
maximum subject to modification from time
to time by law or by Treasury Minute.
340. Not only is this the best system for
this country. We ýalso attach great importance
to it as a first step towards dissociating in
the world at large the question of the right
level of a country's gold reserve from the
question of regulating the note issue.

NOVEMBER 12, 1945
ilere in Canada we have followed this
course. We have completely disassociated
gold from our Bank of Canada currency and
from the currency and deposits of our chartered banks. We employ any gold we use
for monetary purposes exclusively in,. the
realm of international activities. Gold has
passed out of use as a circulating medium. It
is now employed exclusively in the settiement
of international balances, as a common
denominator of international money values,
and in the stabilization of the value of our
own money in foreign exehanges. In the disturbed conditions of international commerce
during the years of depression and in the
crises of two world wars, we have lcarned
great lessons in the proper place and use of
gold. We have also learned even greater
lessons with regard to the need and the inestimable value of adequate gold reserves
against international emergencies. The experiences whi.ch have corne to -us in depression
and war surely prove that today, and in the
d*ays to corne, whether they be days of peace
or war, gold is not and will nlot be less but
more valuablýe than it has ever been in the
past.
We must realize that gold is no ordinary
commodity to be shipped out of the country
like pulpwood and wheat or potatnes and fish.
Goid we know is the only kind. of established
money value that satisfies ail people in ail
places at ail times. It is the only kind of
money value that survives in depression and
war. No international or internai disruption
has ever destroyed its value as buying power.
The fixed price of gold lias been steadily
increasing, and neyer once in ail the history
of gold has that price fallen.
The Bank of Canada currency bill is
undnubtedly the cheapest money we have ever
been able to secure. Each bill costs something less than a cent for paper, ink, engraving
and print-ing. A $50,000 bill costs us the
same as a one dollar bill. Owning the Bank
of Canada, we are now issuing our own paper
for money. It is undoubtedly the best kind
of money we have yet used, and its supply
ia Canada for use in Canada is costless and
unlimited. Canada's high position as a produeing nation makes the Bank of Canada bill
good money today almost everywhere; but
un times of emergency gold is the only kind
of money we can use successfully to maintain
the value of the Canadien dollar in foreiga
exebanges. Obviously we shou'ld maintain a
large reserve for that purpose. No other
reason than that need be offered to prove
conclusively that the restoration of the prosperity of our gold mining industry and the

195

developmnent and expansion of our gold production ranks among the very first of our
many immediate Canadian post-war problems.
Canada as one nf the leading nations in
world trade, as one of the powerful nations
of the British Commonwealth, as a full partner of the United States in the administration
of the wealth, progress and security of the
North American continent, and as one of the
United Nations standing against aggression
within andi witbnut, whether it comnes from
the lef t or the right, can use to great advantage ail the resources in gold that can possibly be developed from lier known mines and
deposits yet to be discovered.
The value and the importance of the place
11
that gold wi have in the future of the British
Empire, and possibly the part it will play la
sustaining progress and peace throughout the
world, gives it a power in foreign commerce
and relations no less potent than the power
which the atomic bomb possesses as a weapon
of war.
The great President of the United States
wag not acting blindly when he started to
build into, the security of bis country as a
world 'power, the invaluable reserves of gold
which tbat great nation possesses today. One
of the moet carefully guarded secrets in the
Soviet Union of Russia is its production
accumulation and use of gold.
With us andi with the whole of the British
Empire gold reserves are among the list of
our h eavy war casualties. Our reserves have
been depleted almost to the point of exhaustion; our production has been balved,; the
ore reserves in our developed mines have been
greatly reduced. The post-war period is well
under way, yet gold and other mining activities are being seriously retarded by the continuance of war eniergency me-asures no
longer eitber advisable or necessary. And yet
with these problems before this nation today,
the Senate takes time out for adjouriament.
As long ago, as February 22, 1944, The
Canadian In-stitute of Mining and Metallurgy,
un anticipation of the post-war problemse of
Canadas minierai industry, suhmitted a brief
to the President and the Council, the Minister
of Finance and the Minister of Mines.
(See Appendiz A, ot end of to-do y's report.)

Investment of United States Capital in Canadian Mining with Notes Concerning Various
Wartime Authorities, Orders and Regulations,
May 1945, prepaired under the direction of
Charles Camsell, C.M.G., LL.D., Deputy Minister of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Canada.
Under the heading Dominion Taxes the taxation statutes summarized are enumerated as
follows:
(1) The Income War Tax Act
(2) The Excess Profits Tax Act
(3) The War Exchange Conservation Act
(4) The Special War Revenue Act
(5) The Unemployment Insurance Act
(6) The Companies Act
(7) The Customs Tariff
Now for anyone involved in or interes.ted
in the future of Canadian Mines ort the
Canadian Minerai industry and its future, this
summary is a document so well and comprehensively prepared that it cannot but be of
inestimable value. I shal not take the time
to read it into the record, although I an satisfied that such a course, were it necessary,
would be more than justified, but with the
leave of the Senate, I ask that it be inclu-ded
as a part of these remarks.
(See Appendix B, at end of
noday's
rcport.)
This summary exposes to view the amazing
confusion of laws, regulations, orders in council, departments, boards, controllers and unknown and discretionary powers through which
the mining industry lias to prospect, tunnel
and burrow as ilt works to find and prod.uce
our mineral wealth. That document in itself
shows that the ýtime has come when we need a
great deal of work not only in clarification but
in the simpllifying of the laws in order that
they may be of assistance to our mining indusries and not restrictive as they are today.
The honourable the mover of thi resolution (Hon. Mr. McRae) and the honourable
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar),
until quite recently Canada's war Minister of
Mines have both drawn attention to the drop
in our gold production, the depreciation in ore
reserves and the need for renewing the inentive for greater activity in ou mining indutry.
In support of all tiat they have o ably said.
may I draw your attention to the relative position of the British Empire and our own country in the known gold reserves of the world.
The reserves of the Soviet Union are not
made public. That is one of the things that
their governrment holds secret and does not
share with its allies.
The statisties I offer are taken from a review
published by our Statistics Branch, Department of Trade and Commerce, of the Gold
Hon. Mr. McGEER.

Mining Industry of Canada, 1944. Any changes
that have taken place this year have made the
situation worse instead of better. They show
that out of a total of gold reserves held by
governments, banks and others amounting to
$29,086,657,000, Canada held $7,251,000 and the
total heild by all British Empire countries is
only $711.522,000.
Hecre are the figures in detail:

Now I know that there are some gold
reserves held by our Foreign Exchange Control
Board. But all these countries. likewise, have
gold reserves. The point is that the amount
of the gold reserves held today in Canada
and in the British Empire is wholly inadequate
to meet the innumerable emergencies that
loom as probabilities and realities on the
horizon of the future. The Federal Reserve
Bulletin shows that Britain's reserve for stabilization purposes fell from $1,732,000.000, in 1939,
to $151,000,000, in 1941.
These figures disclose the British Empire
and Canada to be in a condition of obvious
disadvantage in any attack that may be
organized against the value of either British
Empire or Canadian buying power abroad.
We are not in a very healthy position to resist
any attack that may be made on the value of
our units of exchange. The policy we have
been following, of treating gold as a commodity
like wheat or pulpwood, is thoroughly unsound.

NOVEMBER 12, 1945
0ur unfortunate situation exista despite the
fact that in 1941, the year of the world's
greatest gold production, British Empire countries produced S813,645,000, out of a total of
$1,288,94,5,000, or about three-quarters of the
world production. Yet England, the head of
our great Empire, is begging for financial aid
to-day. That ought to give us of the British
Empire something to. smile about, to sec the
head of this great Empire begging for fnancial
aid. The plight of the head of the Empire
whieh controls 43 per cent of the werld's
land and 50 per cent of the known material
resources is reflected in no small degree in
the sorry position of the Empire's gold resources to-day. These statistics and the
present situation do flot pay a very high
tribute to the capacity of our Empirc's leaders
te manage successfully the great wealth of
our Empire, which we hold in trust flot merely
for the 500,000,000 people ewing allegiance
to the British Crown, but for the werld of
Vo-day and to-m orrow.
Surely the situation demands action without delay. We in Canada should take the
hobbies and the fetters off our gold mining
And one of the jobs that this

N'ýow., bonourable senators, there may be
some among you who are surprised te hear

gold.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. MeGEER: The honourable gentleman probably did not get ail I said. He
probably read only a few newspaper beadlines. The views 1 have expressed tonight
involve no change in the attitude that 1 bave
always held as to the place and value of
gold in the economy of Canada and of our
trading world in times of peace. In January
of 1935 1 publisbed my views in a book,
whicb I wrote in 1933 and 1934, entitled
"The Conquest of Poverty". I, like many
others, saw the need for reforms, and the
danger of war and revolution if those reforms
were not effe'cted. Well, the reforms advocated did net corne to pass, but the, war
arrived, and with it a new lot of wartime
millionaires. Some great men, wbo, speak
with the autbority of vast experience and
intimate knowledge, are not certain that our
victory and our peace are yet secure. Be
that as it may. Let me read to yen what I

Responsible government must abandon the

destroy responsible government and the civîl'ization that breugbt it into being.
Money must be restored teo its proper fonction. It must be issued and circulated primarily
as a tool of trade serving as the mnediume

of the wealth essential te the need, conveaience
and existence ef humani-ty. It must cease te

primarily for the purpose of impeunding the
wealth ot the nation to, the service of levers
et wealth and money power.
I wrote that on the 5-th day of January,
1935, the day I celebrated my 47th birthday,
and new, ten years later, 1 look back on
my bantlicg with ne sense of regret, but rather
with a feeling et satisfaction that I saw the
need and had the courage te express my views.
At pages 298 and 299 et the samne velume,
dealing with the place and value of gold
and silver, I wrote this imaginary conversation between President Roosevelt and Abraham
Lincoln:
Mr. Roosevelt: Would the aim of' inter-national trade and eredit management be to
maintain an exact balance et trade between
our nation and ail other nations witb whoma we
would trade?
Mr. Lincoln: Yes, that would be the aim,
bot et course ne matter how closely or how
effieiently that department performed its duties,
overlapping balances would be bound te appear,
because in international trade there are conditi-ons that are bound to develop which ne one
can foretell and ne one can foresee. Drought,
changes in modes of living, inventions and a
host of other f actors can bring about changes
that are bound te result in t'he most carefully
made calcul.ations being eut ot line; consequenty, adverse balances should bcecxpected
from time te time.
Mr. Roosevelt: What then would be used
te settie and adjust these balances se that trade
would net be unnecessarily interrupted?
Mr. Lincoln. Gold and silver should be used
fer that purpese. lu the new era that is
possible, humanity's nceds must be served by
vast incereases et domestie and international
buying power. Gold and silver should be used
as the means ef settling international trade
and eredit balances. No gold whatever and un
appreciable amouet ef silver should be used as
domestie or the basis for domestie durrency.
Both sheuld be recognized as the means et
advancing international trade for it should be
recognized that they are established by custem
as the effective means et settling overlapping
balances between nations.
And I went on te say:
As international trade increases. the need fer
gold and silver fer that purpose will beceme
increasingly expanded. That need will grew
Mor rapîdy than will the production of those
metals. Gold and silver should be revalued at
once; gold should be raised te $50 an ounce and
its graduaI increase te $100 an ounce should
ha recognized as a possible necessityv. Silver
should be raised on a parity with gold. that is
te $3.35 an ounce.' and its increase te $6.70 an
ounce sheuld aIse be accepted as a possible requirement et the net tee distant future.

198

SENATE

Now I appreciate that to the conservative
mind this proposed revaluation of gold and
silver may appear to be extravagant, but they
should not forget that the inerease in the value
of gold from $20 to $40 an ounce bas failed
lamentably to bring about the increases in
international trade and debt settlements that
were anticipated, nor should it be forgotten
that the increase in the price of silver from
26e to 50e an ounce had little or no effect as
a factor in increasing world tra.de.
It should also be remembered that the New
Deal includes an honest and sincere desire to
improve the lot of the people of Europe, Russia
and the millions that are barely existing in
China, Manchuria, J'apan, India and Africa.
Gold and silver should be treated as the international currency that will permit the trading
nations of the world to lend assistance to establish world peace by aiding in the conquest of
world poverty.
Viewed in that light the volume of inter.
national currency, which gold valued at $100 an
ounce and silver valued at $6.70 an ounce would
make available, does not seem out of place.
The possible requirement for international
currency that could be developed once the
world opportunities for real trade were under
effective exploitation are such that no one can
possibly estimate the international money needs
of the future.
Yes, that was written in 1935. We did not
see what was coming; but if the men who were
advocating that programme had been listened
to instead of sneered at and jeered at, and if
when those men spoke in legislative assemblies
responsible legislators had not been sitting
there giggling and laughing, that programme
might have been carried out and as a result
many a boy now dead might have been alive
and at home. The reforms that we advocated
did not come about. And let me say to this
Senate: the tragedy that has already been disclosed in fulfilment of the prophecy of Arthur
Kitson in 1924, and the tragedy that has come
from our blind indifference to the wisdem of
Lincoln as expressed in his message to Congress, are not yet complete. There are other
days to be fulfilled.
Let me repeat, I am convinced that the vital
importance of gold and silver in the future of
the world's peace and progress warrants an inorease in the monetary value of both metals,
and demands of us in Canada the widest
development and production of both gold and
silver that we are capable of carrying out.
In the Empire we should organize our vast
resources of gold and silver as the basis net
merely of a rebirth of the Empire's trade and
commerce but as the safe foundation for the
continuance of our empire service in the cause
of freedom, prosperity and security for "all
men in all places and at all times." Whatever
the future may disclose, we of the British
Empire who know what it is to stand alone
against overwhelming odds, with nothing as
security but our abiding faith that the cause
of freedom never can be destroyed, must
Hon. Mr. MeGEER.

face the future guided and strengthened by the
mistakes we have made and the lessons we
have paîd so dearly to learn.
We have been blessed with great resources.
We cannot escape the responsibility of administering those resources in the service of
mankind. We must not shrink from the consequences of that trust, no matter what the
danger may be. We must rebuild our gold
reserves. We must develop stock piles of alil
strategie minerals. We must maintain the
enormous strength required to protect our Empire in ail its parts. On land, on sea and in
the air we must build and work as we never
built and worked before. In the cause of
freedon, whether the threat comes from left
or right, we must continue to give that sane
leadership which was given when we stood
alone but united with England; that fearless
leadership offered when London was blazing
behind the threatened barricades on England's
shores, which were defended by the finest of
Canadian manhood of British and French
descent, standing shoulder to shoulder with the
men of the British Isles, who together were
prepared to hazard death, but determined
never to surrender the cause of freedom while
liife remained.
This is not the time, and let us hope the
time will never come, when we in the Parliament of Canada will surrender the authority
of government to bureaucracy, or permit
money-minded tax gatherers to nullify the
bravely won victory by impeding or destroying
the industries that are essential to the security
of our nation's integrity or to the power and
strength of our mighty and powerful empire.
That is the issue you are facing today. That
is one of the problems I believe this Senate
should have been grappling with since the
sixth of September. There bas been work to
do-more than we could have done if we had
not adjourned for a single day this session.
Before closing my remarks, I should like to
refer to the statement made by the honourable senator from Vancouver. It will be found.
at page 172 of the Senate Debates of October
30, 1945.
United States reserves of gold were se depleted that last January legislation was passed
by Congress reducing the coverage from 40 per
cent to 25 per cent in anticipation of that
country not laving gold enough to maintain
the official coverage of 40 per cent.
You may well ask, where has this gold gone?
During the war the United States bought much
more from South America and other countries
than it sold to them, and these countries invariably took payment of their balance of trade
in gold. Some of the gold was exported to the
respective countries and some of it remained
earmarked as their property in the vaults of
the United States. For instance, gold valued
at one and a half billion dollars now stored in

there.
I arn toid by well informed finaneial men
that if we took the balance sheet of the United
States today and deducted from it their commitments and other obligations Pa: yable in goid,
they would 'have littie or no gio1d lef t. 0f
course, that will nlot occur, because these obligations do not ail mature at one tiime. But certainiy the Americans are willing t o buy ail the
gold we can produce at $3M an ou fiee.
Now I do nlot know who the ",vreil informed
financial. men" are, but their in iformation is
flatly contradicted by the statist ics puhlished
-in the Federal Reserve Bulletin fo ir September,
1945. That is the officiai monetar y publication
of the Government of the Unite: d States, and
is accepted as such by the Ban: kof Canada
and by the statistical services in our Department of Trade and Commerce. As against

In the same périod, ont shortage of gold in
the British Empire was indicated when
$695,093,000 was sent to the United Kingdom.
On page 918 is the statement showing that
at August, 1945:
Gold held under earmark at the Federal
Reserve banks amounted to $4,267,000,000, ail of
which was earmarked directly for foreign
account, exeept $102,800,000, whiich was earmarked in the name of a domestit bank as
secur.ity for a foreign boan.
While I am not certain, I do not think gold

earmarked for foreign account would be
reported as included in the gold reseýrves of
the United Staites Government and United
States banks. I have writtcn to flnd out. That
practice, as you know, got the Bank of
England into trouble. But even if it is the
practice, the UJnited States would stili have
nearly $16,000,000,000 to provide the required
reserve of $6,20,000,000, or much more than
200 per cent coverage which the senator from
Vancouver was informed hasi disappeared.
The plain fact is that the situation is very
far indeed from being one of haappy security
which a certain unlimited market woul assure.
We have no such security, and the sooner we
realize -the fact the safer we shahl be. We
have no guarantee whatever that the United

States will continue to heap up the tremendous
gold reserves that it is now hoarding. We
in Canada should not eapect thaýt markeft to
continue indefinitely. We should, however,
recognize ùhat our gold securities are so
de.eply impregnated in our whole oredit structure that if anything should happen to close
the American market for gold. or if there
should be a drop in the price flxed hb' the
United States, we in Canada under our present
gold policy would suifer the most disastrous
depression we have ever experienced. We have
an enormous production of gold in Canada that
is moving on the bare edge of production at
$35 an ounce.
This policy shou*ld be changed.
We
should be prepared to guarantet the stability
*of gold values with our owrn money aG the
preýsent price plus the American excihange rate,
and on that basis our Canadian goid reserves
should he rehuilt. We should join forces
with the United Kingdom and ail other
Empire countries in accuinulating gold reserves
in sufficient volume to guarantee the Empire's
ahil'ity to sustain a stabilized value of Empire
units of exchange, no matter what may
happen.
The"t figures do not disclose any necessity
on the part cf the United States te continue
to purchase "aisl tihe gold we can produce in
Canada at $35 an ounce."
The policy I have indicated would guarantee
a stable and secure mark-et for ail Empire gold

production, no matter what may be done or
what takes place in the United States. And
that is as it should be. We in the British
Empire can stand on our own feet if we stand
together. Under the Union Jack we have got
more wealth and power throughout the world
than the Soviet Union or the United States.
The time has come for us to marshal our gold
reserves for our own services.
Honourable senators may lift their eyebrows
when I tell them that under the present system the purchase of goeld costs Canada
nothing. This is what happens. Gold is purchased with Bank of Canada bills. We use
pieces of our own paiper to buy gold. These
pieces of pa)per are no longer secured by gold
reserves and convertible into gold, as they
once were in the bad old days when the Bank
of England included other peoples' gold in its
gold reserves. Now that we own the Bank of
Canada the accumulation of gold reserves
costs Canada nothing. Here is what happens.
A miner produces $50,000 in gold; he has t
deliver it to the Mint, and all he gets for it
is a $50,000 bill from the Bank of Canada.
Now a $50,000 bill costs less than one Canadian cent, but that is all the miner gets. Under
the law he cannot keep his gold, and once lie
hands it over lie cannot exchange his Bank of
Canada bill for gold. Once he gives up his
gold and takes the Bank's paper money the
transaction is closed. He cannot convert a
single dime of that paper money into gold
agan.
But we are told that we must use our gold
t pay our foreign debts. Well there is a much
better way of paying foreign debts than using
gold which we should hold in reserve for
emergencies. That way is in the inicrease of
our production and in the effective management of our foreign trade.
If we are going to compete in the world
markets successfully, we need more and better
ships; our ports and railway terminals must
be vastly improved; our cold storage facilities
msit e vastly increased. Our railways and
railway equipment are obsolete. The Peace
river country clamors in vain for rail connection with the Pacifie coast and for highways
to open up its vast areas for settleimnt. The
liard surfacing of the Alaska Higliway
languishes. What are we doing? Well, just
what we did during the days of depression:
we are neglecting our tourist trade and throwing our gold away.
What we need in Canada is less taxation and
more and more production; less regulation by
government and more help from government.
We need full co-operation within the Empire.
Canada and Australia can feed England and a
large part of the population of India. CoHo,

Mr.

IcGEER.

operation within the Empire and with all the
United Nations offers the only way to a real
peace.
Co-operation is what the mining, and other
industries in Canada need. More than a year
and a half ago the mining industry of Canada
placed before the Government these recommendat-ions:
(1) That depletion allowance of 50 per cent
of the net earnings of metal and industrial
mineral mines be allowed, and extended to
dividends paid by such mines.
(2) That taxes paid annually ta Provincial
Governments and to municipalities be allowed
as a deduction from earnings of al] mining
companies before assessment for Dominion
Income and/or Excess Profits Tax purposes.
(3) That all annual expenditures made by
mining companies on outside exploration in
any part of Canada, excepting cost of options
or purchase of property, be allowed as a
deduction from earnings before assessment for
Dominion Income and/or Excess Profits Tax.
(4) That, during the first five years of taxpaying life, mining companies be allowed to
deduct from earnings, bef.ore .assessment for
taxes, depreciation up to a maximum of 25 per
cent in any one year.
(5)
That the Dominion bullion handling
charge of 35 cents an ounce be reduced to actual
marketing coats ta the Government.
(6) That as a means of bringing in marginal
ores that would otherwise remain unmined, the
Dominion Sales Tax be removed from all products sold to or imported by metal mines.
Nothing yet has been done. What we need
in Canada is action, immediate action, action
that the Budget fails to provide. We are
moving into peace-time production far too
cautiously and far too slowly. We must get
our people to work. They must go to work
with the same will and the same grand faith
and enthusiasm that they demonstrated in
winning the war. The winning of peace and
prosperity are net to be accomplished by
manipulation of money, debts and victory loans.
but only by a policy that avill push production
onwards and not obstruct it with repressive
taxation. The winning of peace and prosperity
is just as important as winning the war, and
it will take real work to reach that objective.
We must free private enterprise in mining
from the burdens that restrict expansion. We
must free the mine workers' wages from taxes.
We must encourage -full production and full
employment and. if possible, full employment
with overtime until we make our losses good.
Why does the Senate adj ourn when these problems are calling for solution? Is that something ta laugh and snicker about? There is
no laughing and snickering at Windsor tonight.
There are a great many men throughout this
country-not here-who are facing realistic
problems. These are matters that require full
discussion, and after discussion, action.

say "hear, hear' to that. The responsibiiity

We should offer the mining indýustry a full
and proper hearing. We of the Senate have
the right to inte-rest ourseives in matters of
this kind and, after proper investigation, to
inform. the Government of what this House

that the resolution of the honourable member

Some Hon. SENATORS:

The Hon. the SPEAKER:
Honourabie
senators, I think 1 should cali your attention
to Order No. 34, under which. this debate
has taken place. The honourable the senior
member fromn Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae)
some days ago gave notice-mn the form of
an inquiry-that hie would eall attention to
gold production in Canada. An inquiry, unlike
a motion, is flot capable of amendment and
cannot pro-ceed beyond the stage of being
debated. When the debate is coneluded the
Order is diseharged fromn the Order Paper.
I wouid suggest, therefore, that if the -honourabie member fromn Vancouver-Burrard (Hon.
Mr. McGeer) wishes to proceed as"indieated
by his amendment, it would ba better for
him to give notice of motion stating what
he bas in mi, and bring the matter before
the House in that f orm.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: I shall be glad to do
that. sir.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Hayden, the debate

SENATE

for the Ontario Mining Association, under date
of March 1, 1943, and of the Brief on Taxation,
Metal and Asbestos Mining Industries, Province
of Quebec, prepared by the saine writer for the
Western Quebec Mining Association and the
Quebec Asbestos Producers' Association, under
date of July 1, 1943.
Copies of each of the above mentioned presentations, with their attendant schedules, accompany this birief and are to be considered as
comprising a part of same. They are frequently
referred to in the text.
Sources of taxation and other data used in
this and the accompanying briefs are almost
wholly Dominion and Provincial Government
records and official reports of mining companies. Where estimates have been necessary
they are based upon available. authentie information.
We believe that the data presented in the schedule of the -accompanying
briefs are as correct as practical conditions
will permit and are not open to question.
Conclusions reached and opinions expressed
are personal and may net necessarily represent those of alil concerned.
Deductions made and conclusions reached,
of necessity, have. been confined to results of
detailed surveys made of conditions in the
Provinces of Ontario -and Quebec. We believe
that they may be accepted, generally, as
representing a cross-section
of conditions
applying to the whole Canadian mining industry.

The contribution of Canadian base-metal
mining companies to the war effort is deserving
of wider acknowledgment. Products are delivered to the British Ministry of Supply at
prices well below those in world markets. At
the request of the Government, production has
been greatly increased during the four-year
period 1939-1942, as shown by the :following
data released by the Wartime Information
Board:

The Dominion is now producing 95 per cent
of the total nickel output of the United Nations,
20 per cent of zinc ou'tput, 12 per cent of copper,
15 per cent of lead, 75 per cent of asbestos, and
20 per cent of mercury output.
A broad conception of the importance of the
mining industry in the national and international economic life of Canada was demonstrated by the Honourable T. A. Crerar, Dominion Minister of Mines and' Resources, in a
series of radio addresses delivered in 1936,
excerpts from which are found in the accompanying Ontario Brief of Taxation (pp. 4-6
muc.).

NOVEMBER 12, 1945
The Honourable James L. Ilsiçy, Dominion
Minister of Finance, in the Budget; Addreas,
December, 1940, indicated simi-lar comprehension of the importance of the Canadian
mining inidustry, with particular reference to
gold mining. (Ref., Ont. Brief, p. 6).
The part whieh mining in Canada- piays in
the opening up of new areas and in the establishment of new eommunities, and the benefits
derived by other industries from the mining
industry, are set out in the accompanying
brief s and need not be enlarged upon have.
(Ref., Ont. Brief, pp. 3-4; Que. Brief, pp. 3-4).
The national economie benefits derived from
the maintained and increased production of
the Can-adian, gold mining industry, during the
late depression years, have been publicly -and
repeatedly acknowledged by goveraments.
Future of Canadian Mining In&ustry
Jeopardized
Preventable conditions have developed which
seriousiy jeopardize the future of this great
'basic industry and, in the acoorpanying briefs,
an effort is made to demonstrate that the
greatest of these contributory and unfavourable factors is -the imposition of a tax burden
that is beyond the capaci-ty of the industry to
endure and survive.
Cessation of Prospecting
Prospecting for new mineraI deposits in
Canada lias ail but ceased and, if the miniing
industry is to continue on any worthwhile
basis, this unfortunate situation muet be corrected immediateiy. Emphasizing the necessity
for quick action is the fact that under wartime demande for maximum metal production,
coupied with a labour shortage, deveiopment
work at producing mines bas been necessarily
and drastically curtaiied, and ore reserves are
being dissipated at -an acceierated pace.
The incentive for continued prospecting, witb
its inherent physical and financial risks, lies in
the prize which rewards success, i.e., a valuabie
deposit of minerai. No minerai prospect can
justify the risks attendant upon development
unless the attainable prize, in the form of comnmensurate profit, is available to one who succeeds. This prize bas been so reduced in value
by progressive increases in taxation that it
no longer bolds sufficient attraction for those
who would venture. Private enterprise in the
exploration and development of minerai deposits
laid the foondations for the production success
attained by the Canadian mining industry. The
deeline in prospecting activity is clearly illusVrated in the accompanying briefs. (Ref., Ont.
Brief, p. 10, and Scbedule No. 1; also Comnments and Conclusions, p. 1; and Que. Brief, p
10, and Schedule 1).
In the Province of Ontario, the decline in
prospecting activity began in 1929, with the
downward trend obscured somewhat during the
period 1933-1936 f ol1oççing the increase in the
price of gold. In the Province of Quebec,
experience bas been similar. IV was plainly
evident long before the emergency of the
present war.
During 1943 a limited measure of assistance
was given by the Dominion Government, f ollowing strong representation by the indusry,
in connection with the encouragement of prospecting for base and strategic mineraIs, by

203

the enactment of Bill No. 72, 1943, as an
Amendment t-o the Dominion Income War
Tax Act. (Ref., Ont. Brief Addenda, p. 5). This
Bill, and other similar measures (Raf., Que.
Brief, pp. 80-81), recognize the urgency for
revival of prospecting but fail to do other than
afforci Vemporary relief. Real and lasting relief
can only be derived f rom measures which, in
addition, give consideration to the incidence of
taxation after a producing mine bas been establisbed. There can be no lasting benefit from
policies designed
to promote prospecting
aetivity oniy.
Thara are some who hold the opinion that
the cessation of prospecting can be attributed
Vo the lack of unexplored areas f avourable to
the occurrence of mineral deposits. To those it
can be stated that, of the total area of Canada,
some 85 per cent is considered to be potentially
minerai bearing, and that, of this great area,
perhaps lass than 10 per cent bas been intensively prospected. The partial development of
this comparativaly smali portion of the total
area lies resulted in estabiishing Canada in an
enviable position among the mineral producing
countries of the world. What of the as yet to
bie expiored, f ar greater, area? (Ref., Ont.
]3rief, p. 28).
Rapid Depletion of Known Ore Reserves
The raw material essential. to the mining
industry is devaioped or know-n ore reserves.
These are definitely exhaustible and are being
depleted at a hitherto unbelievable rate, with
little or nothing being done, under normal
conditions, Vo counteract guch exhaustion througb
the discovery and development of new resources.
(The prospecting and deveiopment
activity engendered by war-time necessity for
base and strategic minerais is not considered
to be a normal condition, nor are the tempor.
ary restrictions in respect to labour, etc.). The
Canadian mining industry is now in a precarious position in respect to continued supply of
developed ore reserves. In reality, operations
are on a salvage basis, with this condition
directly attributable to the fact that development of new reserves bas long since lost its
former attraction.
Not only are known ore reserves being
rapidly dapleted, but, under the stress of wartime conditions and restrictions, potentiai ore
areas are being abandoned and, in many sucb
cases, tbay will be permanently lost. This constitutes uttar and absoiute waste and must be
rellected, flot only in the financial position of
the varions companies involved but in a serions decrease in empinyment that couid otherwisa ha made available. (Ref., Que. Brief,
pp. 56-58 mec.; aiso Ont. Brief, pp. 49-50 imc.,
and Comments and Conclusions, pp. 5-7).
Current Canadian Metal Production Largely
From Early Discoveries.
No clearer illutration of the effeet of cessation of prospecting and development on the
position of the Canadian mining industry can,
in our opinion, be presanted than that which
results f rom a study of tbe sources of metal
production in 1942, and the time of discovery of
sncb resources. From this, the following conclusions have basa reached:

2(14

(Note: In 1933, a special tax of 5 per cent
was levied on dividends paid by all mining
companies to non-residents in Canada. In 1941,
this tax was increased to 15 per cent. No allowance for depletion is perritted on such divi(Ref., Ont. Brief pp. 45-47).
dends).
In 1934, the depletion alowance for all mining companies was made uniform at 33J per
cent. The depletion allowance on dividends
paid to residents of Canada was reduced to a
uniform rate of 20 per cent. These rates are
still in effect.
This unexplainable reduction in depletion
allowance has been one of the most serious
factors contributing to the decline in prospecting and new mine development.
The Federal tax is applicable to income and
not to capital return. The present 33,' per
cent depletion allowance is presumed to lie
the proportion of annual earnings earmarked
for this return. But. when actual distribution
of this capital is made in the form of dividends,
the Federal taxing authorities rule that only
20 per cent of such capital return shall lie tax
free. Surely this is at least illogical. It should
be noted that the increased revenue derived
by the Government, through this reduction in
depletion allowance, was not for war purposes.
The change became effective five years prior
to the outbreak of the present war.
Analysis of the application of the present
depletion allowance of 33, per cent of company earnings, and 20 per cent for dividend,
clearly demonstrates that, while the intention
may have been to make provision for 331 per
cent of earnings as tax free capital return, the
actual return to shareholders falls far short
of that proportion.

300Were the former depletion allowance of 50 per
cent restored and extended to dividends, the
shareholders would derive a net allowance of
40 per cent of earnings as tax f ree return of
capital, or only 6§ per cent above the intent of
the present allowance of 33J per cent.
(c) No deduction is allowed from earnings,
before assessment for Dominion Tax purposes,
for expenditures incurred in outside exploration, excepting for that on ground contiguous
to a company's main property. The incentive
for outside exploration by mining companies
across Canada has been partially destroyed.
Such exploration is a vital part of mining
operations, and ordinary expenditures incurred
in this manner should be deductible from earnings as an operating cost.
(d) No provision is made under the Dominion
Income War Tax Act, or the Excess Profits Tax
Aot, for the inclusion in operating costs of
and Municipal
taxes paid to Provincial
authorities.

205

(e) Present maximum depreciation allowance,
of 15 per cent per annum, is not sufficient to
ensure the setting up of full depreciation reserve
during the average tax-paying life of the average
precious-metal mine. (Ref., Ont. Brief, p. 15,
Sched. 11 and 12). Maximum capital expenditurcs for plant and equipment are generally
made in the third, fourth, or fifth year after
production has started. Many mines have a
tax-paying life considerably less than the average for all and, with these, the present depreciation allowance falls far short of meeting minimum requirements.
(f) While the mining industry endorses a
war-time excess profits tax as applied to real
profits, it is held that such a tax should not be
applied under the existing method, which gives
no consideration to normal profit per unit of
production. In the determination of profits, no
provision is made for reduced costs to necessary
war-time curtailment of normal development,
with the result that fictitious profits are
recorded.
In this connection, it has been suggested by
the British Columbia and Manitoba mine
operators that the Dominion Income War Tax
Act and the Excess Profits Tax Act lie amended
to permit mining companies to set up reserves during the war period for necessarily deferred
development, and that the sums so reserved
should be treated as a current deductible
expense.
Results o!,Increasing Tax Levies on Unit Costs
of the Mining Indu.stry
In the accompanying Ontario and Quebec
Briefs on Taxation, a series of schedules are
presented, setting out the aggregate annual tax
revenue derived from the mining industry in
those Provinces. (Ref., Ont. Brief, Sched. 12-19
inc.; Que. Brief, Sched. 12-24 inc. and Sched.

31-34 inc.).
The acompanying briefs also present estimates
of taxes paid to the Dominion Government on
dividends distributed by all Canadian metal
and asbestos mining companies. (Ref., Ont.
Brief, Sched. 20-20(f) ine.; Que. Brief, Sched.
16(a) 19, 34).
The schedules referred to above also show
annual aggregate tax cost per unit of production for the gold, base-metal, and asbestos
mining industries, with further classification to
illustrate the effect of exemption, under Section 89 of the Dominion Income War Tax Act,
for gold and base-metal mines whidh started
production on or subsequent to May 1, 1936.
(Ref., Ont. Brief, p. 34, and Sched. 15-19 inc.;
Que. Brief, pp. 41-42, and Sched. 15-23 inc.).
Some of the more important features to be
noted in these schedules are as follows:
1.-Ontario Brief on Taxation
(a) In the period 1915 to 1941, inclusive,
total Dominion taxes levied directly on earnings
of the gold mining industry in Ontario increased
from $130,692 in 1915 to $11,324,057 in 1941.
Total tax cost per ton of ore milled increased
from 24 cents in 1915 to $1.15 in 1941. The
cost per ounce of gold produced increased from
$0.56 to $4.51. Total taxes increased from 2.71
per cent of annual production value in 1915 to
11.66 per cent in 1941. Portion of total taxes

206

SENATE

accruing to the Dominion Government inereased
from 57.02 per cent to 89.8 per cent. (Ref.
Ont. Brief, Sched. 18).
(b) Records of taxes paid by a representative group of eleven gold mining companies,
whose earnings were subject to both Dominion
and Provincial tax in the 10-year period 19321941 inclusive, show that total Dominion taxes
levied increased from $1,674,824 in 1932 to
$7,583,726 in 1941.
Total tax cost per ton of ore milled increased
from $0.58 to $1.60. Total tax cost per ounce
of gold produced increased from $1.36 to $5.72.
Total taxes shown as percentage of annual production value increased from 6.06 per cent to
14.84 per cent. Portion of total taxes accruing
to the Dominion Government increased from
63.5 per cent in 1932 to 91 per cent in 1941.
(Note: Total taxes include Ontario Tax on
Mine Profits, Ontario Corporation Taxes,
Dominion Income and Excess Profits Tax, estimated Dominion Sales Tax, and excese charge
(Ref., Ont. Brief.
for handling bullion).
Sched. 15).
(c) Total taxes on operations of the Ontario
gold mining industry, plus estimated Dominion
Income Tax on dividends, increased from the
equivalent of 9.4 per cent of dividends paid in
1917 to 48-5 per cent in 1941. In other words,
the people of Canada, without having assumed
any part of the risk involved, took by way of
taxes in 1941, 48½ cents for every $1 repaid to
shareholders to cover return of capital invested
and their proportion of company earnings.
(Ref., Ont. Brief, Sched. 19).
(d) It is estimated that, in 1941, taxing
authorities took 52-02 per cent of assessable
profits of gold mining companies in Ontario
which were not exempt under Sec. 89 of the
Dominion War Tax Act. This compares with
18-5 per cent in 1928, a year of intensive mining
activity. (Ref., Ont. Brief, pp. 47-49 inc.).
Preliminary estimates for 1942 indicate that this
proportion increased to approximately 58 per
cent.
(e) Dominion taxes on base-metal mines
increased from $1,477,863 in the year 1933 to
$14,990,057 in 1941. Total taxes increased from
$1.722,907 to $16,363,032.
(Ref., Ont. Brief,
Sched. 16).
Total tax cost per ton of ore milled in the
same period increased from $1.09 to $1.64.
Total taxes shown as a percentage of annual
sales value increased from 3-81 per cent to
9.27 per cent. Portion of total taxes accruing
to the Dominion Government in 1941 was 85.5
per cent. (Ref., Ont. Brief, Sched. 16).
2.-Quebec Brief on Mine Taxation
(a) In the 10-year period 1932 to 1941. inclusive, total Dominion -taxes levied directly on
earnings of the gold mining industry in the
Province of Quebec increased from $61,215 in
1932 to $2.199.579 in 1941. Dominion taxes
levied on earnings of base-metal mines in the
same period increased
from $405,184 to
$4,219,116.
(Ref., Que. Brief, Sched. 24).
Dominion taxes on earnings of Quebec asbestos
mines increased from $8,373 in 1932 to
$2,771,656 in 1941. (Ref., Que. Brief, Sched.
32).
Hon. Mr. MeGEER.

(b) Total tax cost per ounce of gold produced by all Quebec gold mines increased from
$1.43 in 1932 to $3.87 in 1941. Total taxes
shown as an equivalent of annual production
value increased from 5-8 per cent to 9.9 per
cent. Portion of total taxes accruing to the
Dominion Government increased from 70-6 per
cent to 82-2 per cent. (Note: This includes
gold mines exempt from Dominion Income Tax
under Sec. 89 of the Dominion Income War
Tax Act).
(Ref., Que. Brief, Sched. 18).
(c) In the Province of Quebec during 19361941, inclusive, 14 producing gold mining companies, out of a total of 21, or 66-6 per cent
were at some time exempt from Dominion Income Tax under Sec. 89. A comparison of total
tax cost per unit of production between these
two classifications, i.e., those exempt and those
not exempt under Section 89, for the year 1938,
indicates the effect of the exemption, as follows. (Ref., Que. Brief, Sched. 14, 16).

Commencing January 1, 1943, the exemption
from Dominion Income Tax for new producing
gold mines for three years following start of
production was removed: earnings of gold
mines which started production subsequent to
December 31, 1942, were made subject to Dominion Income War Tax and Excess Profits Tax.
With the removal of this exemption, the incentive to private enterprise which may have
remained for the development of new gold mines
was further impoverished. (Ref., Ont. Brief,
p. 34; Que. Brief, pp. 41, 42).
(d) Total taxes on operation of the Quebec
gold mining industry, shown as an equivalent
of dividends paid. increased from 18.7 per
cent in 1932 to 62-8 per cent in 1941. Portion
of total taxes accruing to the Dominion Government increased from 76-9 per cent to 84-5
per cent. (Ref., Que. Brief, Sched. 17).
(e) In 'the Province of Quebec, Noranda
Mines was the only base-metal producer whose
earnings were subject to both Dominion and
Provincial taxes on profits during the full 10year period, 1932 to 1941, inclusive. The following briefly summarizes the effect of increasing taxation on this company's operations:

Unfair Distribution of Mining Tax Revenue
Between Taxing Bodies
Taxes on the mining industry are levied by
three main taxing authorities which, in order
of importance of revenue collected, are:
(1) The Dominion Government
(2) Provincial Governments
(3) Municipal Authorities.
This order in no way represents the relative
contributions of these authorities to the mining industry.
The Dominion Government does little to
promote, encourage, or maintain the mining
industry, in comparison with the contributions
made by Provincial Government; but, as demonstrated above, it collects the lion's share of
mine taxation revenue. (Ref., Ont. Brief, p.
51).
Municipal authorities and the facilities
which they provide are essential to the maintenance of many of the more important mining
operations and, for this reason, a more adequate proportion cf total mine tax revenue
should be earmarked for municipalities to ensure their proper and continued functioning.
In the following paragraphs the proportion
of total tax revenue collected by each of the
three taxing authorities is discussed.
(a) Dominion Government Tax Revenue
The Dominion Income War Tax Act was enacted in 1917 as an emergency measure dur.ing
the war of 1914-1918. It succeeded the Business Profits War Tax Act of 1916, under which
the Dominion first entered the field of taxation
on corporation income. It was intimated that,
following the conclusion of the first world war,
the necessity for such taxation would disappear and that the Act would be modified
in its application and eventually repealed.
Contrary to early expectations, the Act has
continued in force, .and rates of taxation under
the Act have greatly increased. (Ref., Ont.
Brief, pp. 23, 24). Other attendant Dominion
Government taxation measures have progressively increased the burden of Dominion tax
levies until the corporation and other tax revenue accruing annually to the Dominion authorities now accounts for over 90 per -cent of
total taxes levied on the Ontario metal mining
industry.
In the Province of Quebec, where Provincial
and Municipal tax levies differ somewhat from
those in Ontario, the proportion of total taxes
accruing to the Dominion Government from the
mining industry is in excess of 80 per cent.
Conditions similar to those in Ontario and
Quebec, in respect to Dominion Government
proportion of total taxes, are indicated in the
other Canadian mining provinces.
The Dominion Income War Tax Act was first
applicable to mine earnîngs in 1916. In that
year, taxes levied on the Ontario metal mining
industry which accrued to the Dominion Gov47704-15
gaE

ernment were $1,047,515, or 36.7 per cent of
total direct taxes. By 1941, this had increased
to $27,648,476, or 90-77 per cent of the total.
(Ref. Ont. Brief. pp. 51, 52, and Sched. 17).
In the Province of Quebec, taxable earnings
of metal mines were first recorded in 1928. In
that year, $121,360, or 38-4 per cent of total
direct taxes levied on the metal mining industry, was collected under Dominion Government
levies. In 1941, this had increased to $6,945,864, or 80-7 per cent. With Dominion tax
on dividends added, the proportion of total
taxes taken by the Dominion increased to nearly
85 per cent.
(Ref., Que. Brief, p. 58, and
Sched. 24).
(b) Provincial Government Tax Revenue
In the Province of Ontario, taxes were first
levied on mine earnings under the Ontario
Mining Tax Act, 1907. (Ref., Ont. Brief, p.
17). In 1931, first levies were made under the
Ontario Corporation Tax Act.
(Ref., Ont.
Brief, p. 37). In 1941, Ontario, along with all
other provinces, withdrew fiom the field of
taxation on Corporation income in favour of
the Dominion Government.
Under the provisions of the Ontario Mining
T-ax Act, a portion of the provincial tax onmine profits is payable to municipalities in
which such mines are located, in lieu of municipal tax on mine earnings. (Ref., Ont. Brief,
p. 18).
In 1916, the first year of the application of
the Dominion Income War Tax Act, the Ontario Government levied taxes on metal mine
profits totalling $1,755,151, or 61-6 per cent of
all direct taxes levied on the Ontario metal
mining industry. Of this amount, $124,453 was
paid to Ontario municipalities, leaving $1,630,698, or 57-2 per cent of total taxes ($2,848,957), accruing to the Ontario Government.
(Ref., Ont. Brief, Sched. 12, 17).
In 1940, prior to the withdrawal by the
Provinces from the Corporation Income Tax,
the Ontario Government tax levy on metal
mines totalled $6,601,978, or 22-6 per cent of
total taxes levied on the industry. Of this,
$611,705 was paid to municipalities, leaving
$5,990,273, or 20-5 per cent of total taxes
($29,241,187), to the Government. (Ref., Ont.
Brief, Sched. 12, 17).
In 1941, following the Ontario withdrawal
of Corporation tax on income, the Province
collected $2,669,258, or 8.76 per cent of total
taxes ($30,459,198) levied on the Ontario metal
mining industry. Of this, $412,748 was paid to
municipalities, leaving $2,256,510, or 7.4 per
cent of total taxes accruing to the Ontario
Government. (Ref.. Ont. Brief, Sched. 12, 17),
Summarization of the distribution of mining
tax revenue in the Province of Ontario for the
years 1916, 1940, 1941, is tabulated as follows:

In 1928, the first year of taxable metal mine

(c) Municipalities Proportion, Tax Revenue
from Ontario Gold Mines
During 1938, municipalities in Ontario gold
mining areas had an estimated tax revenue, including the portion accruing under provisions of
the Ontario Mining Tax Act, of $770,386, or
10-4 per cent of total principal taxes paid by
Ontario gold mining companies. In 1939, the tax
revenue was estimated at $823,446, or 8-06 per
cent of total direct taxes. In 1940, the tax
revenue had decreased to $807,241, or 5-49 per
cent of total taxes, and in 1941 there was a
further sharp decrease to $621,040,' or 4-41 per
cent of total taxes. (Ref., Ont. Brief, pp. 57, 58,
and Sched. 12 and 17).
From the above data on distribution of mininz tax revenue, the following conclusions are
obvious:
(1) That proportion of tax revenue accruing
to the three main taxing authorities is markedly disproportionate te the contributions made
te the mining ind-ustry by the individual tax
authority.
(2) With such a large proportion of the total
mining tax revenue accruing to the Dominion
Government, it would seem logical that relief
from the present unsupportable burden of taxation should be derived from that source.
Dominion Government Bullion Handling
Charge
In the Ontario Brief on Taxation (pp. 38 to
40, inc.), the Dominion Bullion Handling
Charge of 35 cents an ounce on all gold
delivered to the Minit is discussed. Reference is
made to the ruling that all gold produced in
Canada must be sold: te the Dominion Government, which pays for same in Canadian funds,
wi'th the prevailing U.S. exchange premium
adýded, after deduction of refining and marketing or handling charges.
It bas been calculated that the cost te Canadian gold producers of marketing bullion in
the United States should net exceed' 15 cents
an ounce. There is, therefore, an indicated
Dominion excesa charge of 20 cents an ounce on
all gold produced in Canada and delivered to the
Mint. This is, in our opinion, an unreasonable
levy and, indeed, a royalty on the value of
gross production. During the period of the
imposition of this Tax, i.e., from June 1, 1935,
te December 31, 19.41, it is estimated thait
Dominion Government revenue from this source
was $3,651,182.
Benefit te Dominion Government from Exchange
Premium on Gold
In addition te the above described unreasonable charge for marketing gold bullion, the
Hon. Mr. McGEER.

Dominion Government benefits materially from
the monopoly of sales of Canadian gold production in the United States.
As of September 16, 1939, exchange rates were
pegged by the Dominion Government at 10 per
cent on sales of U.S. funds, and Il per cent
on purchases. It is assumed that the Government sells all Canadian gold production in the
U.S., and that the U.S. funds received are cmployed for Government purposes. It follows,
therefore, that the Government bas an advantage
of approximately 1 per cent over the Canadian
gold producers in respect of value received in
Canadian funds. This, on an annual gold production of $205,789,392, as in 1941, means an
added annual Dominion ineome of over
$2,000,000, deriving from the Canadian gold
mining induatry, over and above that accruing
from direct and indirect taxation. This was
not included in the toital Dominion revenue from
the gold mining industry as shown in the
accompanying tax schedules. (Ref., Ont. Brief,
Addenda pp. 4-5.)
Application of Dominion Sales Tax Act te
M'ining Industry
The produot of Canadian gold mines is sold
at a fixed price which bears no direct relationship to the actual cost of production. Te a
lesser degree this is generally true of the
product of base-metal mines. In other industries, under normal, conditions, tax costs are
added to production cost to determine selling
price, and, in this manner, profits of such industries are not d.isturbed by the impost of such
ta-à.
With m'ining companies, the Sales Tax cannot
be passed along te the consumer. It must be
absorbed in cost of operations, with profit
margin reduced by such added cost. Here, again,
is a further tax factor in the determination of
grade of ore whieh can be profitably mined,
and in the destruction of developed ore resources. This phase of taxation is discussed at
greater length in the accompanying Briefs on
Taxation. (Ref., Ont. Brief, pp. 8 and 36; Que.
Brief, p. 44.)
It is estimated that during the period 1920
to 1941. inclusive, gold and base-metal mines
in the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec paid
Dominion Sales Tax aggregating over $12,000,000. (Ref., Ont. Brief, Sched. 15, 16, 17; Que.
Brief, Sched. 18, 21, 22, 23.)
This total can,
in our opinion, be considered as a tax cost
directly applicable te operations, and indirectly
as a tax on earnings.
Summary of Deductions from Surveys of
Taxation on Mining Industry
In the preparation of · his Brief, and, those
t
which accompany it, an effort has been made
to present, net only an authentie and reasonably
accurate history of taxation on the metal and
asbestos mining industries of the Provinces of
Ontario and Quebec, but te direct attention te
the destructive effect of present taxation pollicies
on the immediaite and future outlook for the
mining indýustry in Canada.
Among the dedýuctions that may be drawn
from the evýidence presented, are:
(1) That prospecting for and development of
new mineral deposits bas practically ceased, due
te the increasing burden of taxation.
(2) That mining in Canada is on a salvage
basis, with some 84 per cent of present production being obtained. from mineral areas discovered prier te 1920.

Iw

(3) That presently known ore resources are
being rapidly depleted, with little or nothing
being doue to develop new resources.
(4) That a robust, growing industry bas been
rapidly reduced to an anaemic condition. Temporary relief mray retard the downward progress, but, to effect a cure, the cause must be
removed. This will take time, and it must
further he kept in mind that' between discovery
and the period of production there is a time lag
of from four to six years.
(5) That taxing authorities do not appear to
have a proper appreciation of the hazards of
mining, nor of the critical present position of
the industry with respect to continued producr
tion. In order that the mining indsustry may dia
its full share in overcoming the difficulties of
post-war reconstruction, it is clear that incentive should be given by the Government through
tax adjustments.
Mining Taxation in the Commonwealth of
Australia
A few years ago, excessive taxation on the
Australian gold mining industry resulted in conditions similar to those which have been experienced in Canada. A crisis developed, as -it bas
in this country, which was temporarily relieved
by bonusing prospectors and the production of
gold. Further temporary relief was had through
the increased world price for gold. As in
Canada, how-ever, taxation overtook these temporary benefits and largely nullified them.
The Commonwealth Government then adopted
a policy of encouragement for the mining industry and, in 1942, inaugurated a method of
uniform taxation in which it became the sole
tax authority in the field of income taxation in
Austral.ia. Details of the Australian policy are
presented in the accompanying Ontario and
Quebec Briefs on Taxation. (Ref.. Ont. Brief,
pp. 53 to 57 inc.; Que. Brief, pp. 60 to 64 inc.).
The main features of the Australian mine taxation policy are as follows:
(1) Exemption of all gold mining income,
including dividends, for the duration of the
war and one year thereafter.
(2) Ample provision for return of invested
capital.
(3) Allowance as a deduction from earnings
of base-metal mines for expenditure made on
outside exploration.
(4) Only one Commonwealth tax on production of gold mines, i.e., a tax of one-half
the price of gold in excess of £9 per ounce.
(This approximates $2.50, in Canadian funds).
mines
of base-metal
(5) Encouragement
through provision for return of capital expended
in plant and development during the estimated
14fe of the mine as at date of expenditure.
Exemption from 20 per cent of taxable income,
with this exemption extended to dividends paid
wholly and exclusively out of profits represented
by the special allowance. Power is given to
a Board of Referees to increase this allowance
if considered by the mine owner to be inadequate to cover depreciation in mine value
through abnormal war-time production.
(6) The tax levied by the Commonwealth
under the Gold Tax Act, 1939, is recoverable
under the Gold Mining Encouragement Act of
1940, to the extent that mining coste exceed a
specified base figure.
(7) That tax exemption on income from gold
mines (including dividends disbursed) applies
47704-15J

also to mines producing gold and copper, provided the value of gold is not less than 40 per
cent of total value of mine outpat.
The above is presented solely for the purpose of demonstrating what one other country
has deemed necessary in correcting a condition
so clearly evident in our own country.
Recommendations
(1) That depletion allowance of 50 per cent
of the net earnings of metal and industrial
mineral mines be allowed, and extended to
dividends paid by such mines.
(2) That taxes paid annually to Provincial
Governments and to municipalities be allowed
as a deduction from earnings of all mining
companies before assessment for Dominion Income and/or Excess Profits Tax purposes.
(3) That all annual expenditures made by
mjning companies on outside exploration in any
part of Canada, excepting cost of options or
purchase of property, he allowed as a deduction
from earnings before assessment for Dominion
Income and/or Excess Profits Tax.
(4) That, during the first five years of taxpaying life, mining companies be allowed to
dceduet from earnings, before assessment for
taxes, depreciation up ta a maximum of 25
per cent in any one year.
(5) That the Dominion Bullion Handling
Charge of 35 cents an ounce be reduced to
actual marketing aosts to the Government.
(6) That as a means of bringing in marginal
ores that would otherwise remain unmined,
the Dominion Sales Tax be removed from all
products sold to or imported by metal mines.
Conclusion
During the emergency of the present war,
any discussion of mining taxation in Canada
may be considered as purely academic. There
can, however,,be no logical justification for the
sacrificing of a great national industry when
preventive measures can be taken without
constricting or in any way obstructing this
country's contribution to the struggle, which
must take precedence over all, other national
effort.
Unless relief from destructive taxation is
forthcoming at an early date, the Canadian
mining industry will continue, at an accelerated
pace, on the road to exhaustion.
Development of mines in the Provinces of
Ontario and Quebec, during the past thirtyfive years, has resulted .from the exploration
and of what
of comparatively accessible
many consider to be the most favourable 'and
productive portion of the great mineral-bearing
Precambrian Shield. Whether or not the latter
opinion is substantiated by future developments,
it is strongly indicated that the effort and xisks
involved in the development of new mines will,
of necessity, be substantially greater than those
of past years, and, that new valuable mineral
deposits will not be so readily discoverable.
This generally recognized condition intensifies
the need for the fullest encouragement of
private enterprise.
The immediate future of the Canadian
mining industry and its ability to assist in the
al'eviation of unemployment and rehabilitation
of other industries in the post-war years of
reconstruction rests largely in the bande of the
Dominion Government. The duty and respon-

Dominion Tax and Other Legislation Affecting
Canadian Mining Enterprises

in Canadian Mining
with
Concerning Various Wartime Authorities,
Notes
Orders and Regulations
May, 1945
Prepared under the direction of Charles Camsell, C.M.G., LL.D., Deputy Minister
of Mines and Resources, Ottawa,
Canada.
A. Dominion Taxes and other Legislation Affecting Canadian Mining Enterprises
Canadian mining companies are liable only
for those federal taxes that are paid by other
Canadian companies, but they are differentiated
from other companies under the Income War
Tax Act and Excess Profits Tax Act in that
producing mining companies, iûcluding coipanies operating oil and gas wells, are granted
special deductions from income or profits for
depletion,
This allowance is given in recognition of the fact that mine production
involves exhaustion of the natural resource.
In addition to the taxes applicable to coinpanies throughout the Dominion, the Dominion
Government, by virtue of having territorial
jurisdiction over the Yukon and Northwest
Territories, levies taxes on mining companies
operating in those areas. These taxes correspoiid to provincial taxes in other parts of
the Dominion. Because of their limited territorial applicability they do not form part of
the broad outline of federal taxation as
applicable throughout the Dominion and they
are omitted from this review.
lon. Mr. McGEER.

Dominion Taxes
The following summary deals with the more
important Dominion taxing statutes that affect
mining enterprises, as follows:
(1) The Income War Tax Act
(2) The Excess Profits Tax Act
(3) The War Exchange Conservation Act
(4) The Special War Revenue Act
(5). The Unemployment Insurance Act
(6) The Companies Act
(7) The Customs Tariff
1. The Income War Tax Act
Income or Corporation Tax
Under the Income War Tax Act taxes on
personal incomes are levied at rates varying
with the income and the sane act governs the
tax to be paid on corporate incomes. The
income tax and the excess profits tax are
the most important federal imposts affecting
corporations.
The tax is levied on "income", which may
be definied roughly as the net profit realized
from production plus net income from other
sources including dividends, interest, rentals, etc.
In the determination of net profit, depreciation
is allowed on buildings, plant and equipment
up to 15 per cent of cost per annum. An amendment in 1944 provides that the Minister, in his
discretion, may allow depreciation at not more
than double the rates normally allowed in respect of plant or equipment built or acquired in a
period to be fixed by the Governor in Council if
in the opinion of the Minister the taxpayer is
thereby making a new investnent. The Governor in Council has fixed this period as
commencing on November 10, 1944, and ending
either on December 31, 1946, or on the date
two years following cessation of hostilities with
Germany, whichever is earlier.
Depletion
is
allowed
for metalliferous
mines on the basis of 33-1/3 per cent of net
profits froin the production determined after
allowance of depreciation and all operating
expenses including allowance to cover the taxpayer's pre-production development expenses.
The depletion allowance continues as long as
the property is in production but no depletion
is allowed on income from sources such as
dividends, interest, etc.
The depletion allowance for oil wells is 33-1/3
of the net profits from production and for coal
mines 10 cents per ton of coal mined. For
other non-metallic mines depletion is allowed
at rates varying with the character of the
enterprise and the capital expended in acquiring
the mining property being depleted.
The pre-production development expenses
eligible for deduction are those of the taxpayer
and not the amounts which may have been
expended upon development by previous owners
of the mining property.
Although deductions for the pre-production
development expenses of a metalliferous mine
may be allowed in taxation periods following
the commencement of production, - the current
development work after production has started
must be charged as an expense in the year in
which the work was done.
Discount on sharee sold or issued in paymen of assets is not allowable as an expense
in any manner-directly or indirectly.
Cost incurred by any company in exploring
properties substantially removed from the property which is being operated and being obviously
in the nature of new exploratory effort is not
allowable as an expense to the exploring
company.

NOVEMBER 12, 1945
Deductian from incarne allowed to aIl comnpanies in determining the taxable incarne include:
(a) Charitable donations to houa fide charitable institutions in Canada not ta exceed 5
per cent of the net taxable incarne of the
taxation period. Provision is however made that
the excess of a carporation's charitable donations in the taxation year over its average
-annual donations in its last twa fiscal periode
prior ta July 1, 1942, shail be allowed ns a
deduction onlýy ta the extent that the sum
total of the incarne and excess profits taxes
payable by the carporation are thereby diminished by 40 per cent of such excess.
(b) Municipal taxes paid by a mining comnpany under subsectians 6, 9, and 11 of Section
39, of the Assessment Act (Ontario), R.S.O.
1937, Chapter 272, and in farce on Mardi 2,
1943, are now allowed as deductions, if the
Minister is satisfied that in assessing for such
municipal taxes the Dominion incarne and excess
profite taxes paid by the mining company are
not allowed as deductions.
(c) Amounts in respect of lasses sustained
in the 1943 and eubsequent taxation years by
a taxpayer carrying on a business such as mining may be deducted froin profits derived therefromn elther in tic year immediately preceding or
in the tirce years following the taxation year,
if in ascertaining the lasses no account is taken
of au autlay, lass, or replacement of capital,
any depreciat ion, depletion or obsolescence or
dishurseinents or expenses not wholly. and neceoearily laid out or expended for th purpose
of earning the profit, except snch amount for
depreciation and depletion. as the Minister may
alhow:
Pravided that nothing is deductible in re îspect of a loss unless the taxpayer carried on
tic saine business iu the taxation year as in
the year in whici the boss was sustained; tiat
no mare is deductible in respect of a boas than
the amaunt by wich sucli loss exceeds the sum
total of tie amounts of ithe lueis which have
been deducted in previaus years under the Act;
and that an amaunt is anly deductible in respect
of the loss in any year after deduction of
amounts in respect of the lasses of previons
years.
The following items of expenditure are not
allowed as costs ta be deducted fram. production

compan.y:
Expenditures nat paid ont for the purpose
of earning the incarne;
Capital outlays;
Annual value of property, real or personal,
except rent actually paîd for use of property used iu earning the incarne;

Special exemption of new metalliferous mines:
Section 89 provides for a three year exemption
from the foregoing corporation incarne tax for
new metalliferous mines coming inta production
between lst May, 1936, and Ist January, 1943.
ilecause of an allowance of six months as an

Tax on dividends, paid ta non resideuts of
Canada: A tax of 15 per cent is imposed and
collected at the source au ail dividende paid
ta non resident individuials or corporations,
with no aliawance for depletion or capital

per cent is imposed iu respect of rcntale from
real estate but certain expenses will ha allowed
upon a ret-uru being filed by the recipient when
thie appropriate tax is levied.
Prospector's gain nat liable for incarne tax:
The gains ta boua fide prospectors through disposal of dlaims, and likewise the gains ta syndieates or companies resulting fromn the backing

Employers' responsibilities re "tax deduction

obliged to withhold from the salary or wages
of each employee such amount of the income tax
payable by such employee as may be prescribed
by regulations made by the Governor in Council; and to remit the saine to the Receiver
General of Canada within one week of the day
when he becomes liable to pay such salary or

National Revenue may by regulation prescribe.
Special tax deductions designed to encourage
the search for base umetals, strategic minerals,
petroleuni and natural gas: Recent amendments
to Section 8, Income War Tax Act, and
in application te the end of 1945 by
Order in Council P.C. 1748 of March 13, 1945,
encourage prospecting for base metals, strategie
minerals, petroleum and natural gas by authorizing taxpayers contributing to organizations
carrying on such work or carrying on such w rc
themselves to deduct from the sulm total of
their Dominion income and excess profits taxes
certain percentages of their contributions or
expenditures in that connection, as follows:
(a) Any taxpayer contributing in 1945 ta an
association, syndicate or mining partnership
recognized under provincial law in Canada and
organized for the purpose of prospecting for
base matals and strategic minerals is authorized
to deduct from his total income and excess
profite tax 40 per cent of such contribution up
to $500 in any one such association, etc., and up
to a total of $5.000. Provided however that if
the contributor is a corporation whose income
for tax purpeses is depleted on a percentageof-net-profits basis the deduiction shall be reduced
by the same percentage (the deduction allowed

whose income is subject to a depletion allowance
of 33,1 per cent would thus he 26$ per cent).
Provided also that if an association, etc., expends
only a portion of its contributed funds upon
such prospecting in 1945, the dedu.ction for
eaci of its contributors shall he proportionately
reduced.
(b) A metalliferous
or strategie mineral
mining or mineral exploration company is
authorized to deduct from the total of its
Dominion income and excess profits taxes 264 per cent of all prospecting, exploration and
development expenses incurred in searching for
base metals and strategie minerals from January
1, 1943, to December 31, 1945, the deductions
te apply to the taxes in respect of the year or
fiscal period in which the expenses were actually
incurred.
(c) A corporation whose principal business
is the production, refining, or marketing of
petroleum or petroleum products is similarly
authorized to deduct from the sum total of
its Dominion income and excess profits taxes,
(i), 40 per cent of all of its drilling costs on
oil wells spudded-in from January 1, 1943, to
December 31, 1945, and abandoned within six
months after completion of such drilling; and
(ii), all exploration costs, including all general
geological and geophysical expenses incurred
by it.
Provided that if such sum total is net sfficient

may deduct the balance from the taxes of subsequent years; also that in the case of a
corporation whose income is subject to depletion
for ineome tax purposes the foregoing deduction shall he 26-1 per cent instead of 40 per
cent.
(d) Any corporation, association, syndicate,
or exploration partnership formed for the purpose of exploring and drilling for eil is similarly authorized to deduct from the sum total
of its Dominion income and excess profits taxes
26-2 per cent of exploration and drilling expenses incurred during the period from Janaury
1, 1943, to Decemuber 31, 1945; provided that
if this sun total in the year of expenditure

2. Excess Profits Tax Act
Excess Profits Tax
The Excess Profits tax levied under this
Act in respect of profits derived from mining
operations is a tax upon net taxable profits
for the taxation period as determined under the
provisions of the Income War Tax Act.
The "excess profits" of a mine operator is
the amount by which net taxable profits of the
taxation period exceeds "standard profits."
The standard profit of a mine operator (in
respect of revenues derived from mining operations) is his average annual profit over the
"standard period" comprieing the calendar years
1936 to 1939 inclusive, or suoh years or parts
thereof as he was in business, provision being
made to exclude 'any one year of the period
in which profits were less than 50 per cent
of the average 'annual profits of the remaining
three years, in which case the average annual
profits for the three remaining years would
be the standard profit. Provision is also made
for adjusting the standard profit to take care
of changes in capital employed, expansion of
business, businesses commencing during the
standard period, etc.; also for a Board of
Referees which shall, subject to the approval of
the Minister of National Revenue, ascertain
the standaýrd profits of new businesses, and,
,under certain conditions, of businesses which
were depressed during the standard period. In
no case is a taxpayer's standard profit deemeid
to be less than $5,000, except in the case of a
company which incorporates subsildiaries without
increasing the aggregate of capital employed
when an aggregate standard profit not exceeding
$5,000 is to be allocated to the subsidiaries as
the Minister may direct. The profits of taxpayers other than corporations and joint stock
companies are net taxable for excess profits
tax if such profits do not exceed $5,000 .in the
taxation period before payment therefrom to
proprietors or partners by way of salary,
interest, or otherwise.
Amount of Excess Profits Tax: The Excess
Profite Tax Schedule (Second Sehedule) comprises three parts as follows:
First Part-10 per cent of the net taxable
profits of corporations and joint stock companies, and 1.5 per cent of the net taxable
profits of all other taxpayers, before deduction
therefrom of corporation or income tax paid
thereon under the Income War Tax Act.
Second Part--00 per cent of Excess Profits,
afiter ded-uction therefrom of the tax levied
thereon under the Income War Tax Act and
unider the Third Part of the tax schedule of tie
Excess Profits Tax Act.
Third Part--12 rper cent of the net taxable
profits of corporations and joint stock comnpanies, before deduction therefrom of corporation or income tax levied under the Income War
Tax - Act.
The Excess Profits tax amounts
(a) In the case of corporations and joint
stock companies to the tax levied under the
Third Part of the Sohedule plus either the tax

levied under the First Part or that levied under
the Second Part of the Schedule, whichever is
Provision is however made in
the greater.
Section 7A of the Act that in the case of emall
where profits in the taxation year
corporations
do not exceed $5,000, such profits shall not be
liable for the tax levied either under the First
Part or the Second Part of the Schedule.
(b) In the case of all other taxpayers to
either the tax levied under the First- Part or
that levied under the Second Part of the
Schedule, whichever is the greater.
Provided that the tax levied under the First
Part of the Sehedule shall in no case operate
to reduce the profits of a taxpayer below the
amount of $5,000 before providing for any payments 'te proprietors, partners or shareholders
by way of salary, interest or otherwise.
Refundable portion of the excess profits tax:
Section 18 of the Excess Profits Tax Act. (an
amendment of 1942) provides that "there shall
be refunded te the taxpayer an amount equal
to 20 per .centum of the profits above the point
at which the tax calculated under the First
Part of the Second Schedule is equal te the tax
calculated under the Second Part of the Second
Schedule if such profits have been paid by way
of taxes under the Income War Tax Act and
this Act to the Receiver General of Canada."
Provision is made that the refundable portion
referable te the profits of the fiscal years ending
in 1942 shall be repaid to the taxpayer during
the second fiscal year of the Government et
Canada commencing after cessation of hostilities
between Canada and Germany, Italy and Japan,
and se on for successive fiscal periods; the date
of cessation of hostilities te be the date proclaimed by the Governor in Council that a state
of war no longer exists.
The tax calculated under the First Part of
the Schedule will be equai to that calculated
under the Second Part when the net taxable
income amounts to 116-667 per cent of the
standard profits in the case of corporations and
joint stock companies and te 117-647 per cent
Of the standard profits in the case of other taxpayers.
The refundable amount in the case of a corporation thus amounts to 20 per cent of the
amount by which the net taxable profits exceeds
116.667 per cent of its standard profits. In
the case of other taxpayers, such as a partnership, the refundable portion would amount te
20 per cent of the amount by which net taxable
profits after deduction for salaries to the partners exceeds 117-647 per cent of the standard
profits also after similar deduction for salaries.
New gold mines and oil wells: Section 5A of
the Act provides that in the case of taxpayers
operating gold mines or cil wells which came
into production after January 1, 1938, the
amount of the standard profits is ascertained
on the basis of a presumed volume of production
during the standard period equal to the volume
of production in the taxation year and a
presumed selling price during the standard
period equal to the average selling price of
the said product during the standard period.
In ýthe case of a new gold mine, the standard
profit is now computed by deducting from the
presumed revenue as ascertained under Section 5A a presumed cost during the standard
period computed by employing the Dominion
Adjusted Cost of Living Index te adjust the
operating costs of the taxation year to conditions
in August, 1939, for which month the Cost of
Living Index was virtually the average monthly

214

SENATE

Cost of Living Index over the standiard period.
The standard profit is thus computed as
follows:
Standard Profit = Presumed Revenue (a),
Less presumed Operating Cost
(b),
Less write-offs in the taxation year in respect of
depreciation and preproduction expense (c),
Less allowance for depletion
(amounting
for gold
mines to 33$ per cent of
(a)- (b)- (e).)
Presumed revenue (a) = ounces of gold produced in taxation year x $35.38, which was the
average price of gold in Canada during the
standard period.
Presumed operating cost (b) = 100 x operx
ating costs in the taxation year, 100 being the

Dominion Adjusted Cost of Living Index for
August, 1939, and x the average monthly
Dominion Adjusted Cost of Living Index over
the 12 monthe of the taxpayers' fiscal or taxation year. The Dominion Adjusted Cost of
Living Index is published each month and has
increased variably from 100.0 in Afgust, 1939,
to 103-0, 107.1, 114.9, 117.9 and 118.4 for the

month of December, respectively of 1939, 1940,
1941, 1942, and 1943; and to 117.7 in October,
1944. Revenues derived from silver and other
mine products are deducted from operating
costs, such products being considered as byproducts of gold mining.
Example:
A new gold mining company's tax returns for
its taxation year ending December 31, 1942,
showed revenue derived from production and
sale of 10,000 oz. of gold at $38.50 per oz. Its
operating costs amounted to $200,000, and its
write-offs for depreciation
(D), and preproduction expense (P.P.E.) totalled $25,000.

Base Metal Mines: Base matal mines are
dealt with on a capital-standard basis under
Section 4 (1) (b) of the Act in ascertaining
standard profits for a new or a depressed enterprise, and for adjusting standard profits in
cases where operations have been expanded
since the standard period.
Mixed Metal Mines: Generally speaking,
the standard profit of a mining enterprise which
produces gold and other metals is, in effect
ascertained in two parts, one relating te the
profits derived from gold production, in respect
of which profits the method applicable te gold
mines is employed; and the other relating to
the profits derived from the production of the
other metals, in respect of which profits the
base metal mines .is
method -applicable t
employed. For this purpose, the taxable profits
(before adjustmentts for alteration in capital)

of eavh calendar year of the standard period
are apportioned te gold and 'other metals"
in the ratio which the sales of each bear te
total sales. Adjustments te standard profits
as required to take care of expanded production
in the taxation year are made on a similar
basis.
Exemption of New Base Metal and Strategic
Mineral Mines: An amendment, Section 7 (g),
te the Act in 1942 provides that the profits cf
any corporation or joint stock company derived
froi the operation of any base matai or
strategic mineral mine which comes into production for the first time in the three years
commencing January 1, 1943, shall be exempt
from excess profits tax for the first three fiscal
years of twelve months each following such date
of commencement of production.

3. The War Exchange Conservation Act
Under Section 8 of the War Exchange Conservation Act, 1940, the Government has
authority to make special arrangements with
regard to taxation where the taxpayer eau
show that the tax situation prevents him from
ncreasing or maintaining exports. An amendment in 1941 extended the legislation to cover
oil producers with a view to removing tax
obstacles which miglt retard new d.rilling
operations. As amended, the legislation reads
as follows:
"8. (1) The Governor in Council in order
to increase or conserve Canada's supply of
foreign exchange may, on the recommendation
of the Minister of Finance, enter into agreements with individuals, partnerships or corporations to grant assistance by way of special
tax credits and/or special allowances for
depreciation or depletion under tho Income
War Tax and/or The Excess Profits Tax Act,
if, in the opinion of the Governor in Council,
such assistance is necessary in order that an
expansion of the exports of any individual,
partnership or corporation receiving such assistance nay take place or that the exports of
any such individual, partnership or corporation
may lie maintained at levels higher than would
otherwise obtain, or, in the case of any individual, partnership or corporation operating
an oil well or oil wells, if, in the opinion of
the Governor in Council, such assistance is
necessary in order that sufficient drilling of
new wells may take place to maintain or
extend the production of oil in Canada and
if the Minister of Mines and Resources certifies that such drilling is in oil-bearing areas
which give reasonable prospect of yielding

producing wells. The provisions of any such
agreements granting special tax credits and/or
special allowances for depreciation or depletion
shall be effective notwithstanding anything
contained in the Income War Tax Act or
the Excess Profits Tax Act."
"(2) Whenever an agreement lias been
entered into under the auth.ority
of this
section a copy thereof shall be laid before
Parliament by the Minister of Finance within
fifteen days, if Parliament is then sitting, or,
if Parliament is not sitting, within fifteen days
after the opening of the next session of
Parli ament."
This legislation is merely an enabling measure
and calls for the negotiation of special agreements. Certain tax concessions can be made
in exciange for an undertaking on the part
of a taxpayer to proceed with a project which
will provide additional foreign exchiange of
some aimount.
The benefits would lie conditional upon tho undertaking having been
fulfilled.
Altboughs the legislation was in general terms
and did not specify the directions in which
it was desired to expand exports, it had been
decided as a matter of policy to offer concessions only in cases where additional United
States dollar exchange rather than sterling will
lie realized.
It is emphasized that this legislation cannot
le used in ex post facto fashion to give relief
from taxation. It is forward-looking in its
operation. Any applicant must, of course, be
able to show conclusively that an adjustment
of taxes in his case is necessary in order to
enable him to expand his export business, to
maintain existing exports or to drill new oil
wells.

NOVEMBER 12, 1945
Any person who has a specific proposal te
place before the Government and can fulfil
the conditions outlined above may apply direct
te the Minister of Finance, East Block, Ottawa,
for an agreement, outlining the main details
of his plan. The Hyde Park Agreement made
other provision for the Canadian acquisition
of ample United States exchange, obviating the
need for granting tax concessions simply te
increase production for export.
4. The Special War Revenue Act
A number of taxes are levied under the
Special War Revenue Act that apply to al]
persons and companies in Canada. The most
important are the Sales Tax, Excise Taxes and
the War Exchange Tax.
The Consumption or Sales Tax applies to al]
goods, with certain specified exemptions, produced or manufactured in Canada or imported
into Canada. The tax amounts in the case
of Canadian-made goods te 8 per cent of the
producer'@ or manufacturer's sale price (except
that upon the dressing and/or dyeing of furs
in Canada there is a consumption or sales
tax of 12 per cent of the current market value
of the furs); and in the case of imported
goods to 8 per cent of the duty-paid value.
Among goods exempted fron sales tax are cars
and similar appliances for mining and quarrying; blasting and mining powder; machinery
and apparatus for washing or dry-cleaning coal
at coal mines or coke plants; dianond dust
or bort and black diamonds, for borers; pit
props and packwood for use exclusively in
mines.
A special excise tax of 3 per cent is imposed on the duty-paid value of all goods (w.ith
certain specified exceptions) imported into
Canada subject to entry under the General
Tariff.
The War Exchange Tax of 10 per cent on
the value for duty is imposed on all imports
(with certain specified exceptions), whether
free or dutiable, except that the tax does not
apply to goods entitled to entry under the
British Preferential Tariff or under trade agreements with British countries.
Excise taxes at varying specified rites are
imposed on certain specified goods whether
manufactured or produced in Canada or imported into Canada. The list of items includes
matches, automobiles, rubber tires, cameras,
phonographs, radios, electric or gas light fixtures
and lamps, certain household electrical or gas
appliances, various other electrical appliances,
sugar, gasoline, etc.
The Transportation Tax is imposed on tickets
or rights of transportation by railway, bus, or
aircraft, or by vessel between places in Canada
or fron a place in Canada and return thereto,
also on seats, berths or other sleeping accommodation, on railway trains. The tax is 15 per
cent on charges for transportation (exemption
where regular one-way charge is $0.75 or less),
fifteen cents on pullman or parlour car seats,
and 15 per cent on berths (minimum of 35
cents).
The Stamp Tax applying on cheques, bills of
exchange, promissory notes, bank receipts, money
orders and travellers cheques, requires payment of three cents where the amount of such
instrument is under $100 and 6 cents where
the amount exceeds $100. On postal notes there
is a tax of one cent where the amount is under
$1 and of three cents on larger amounts.
The Communications Tax applies on cable,
telegraph and telephone messages payable at
7 cents for each telegraphic or cable despatch;
47704-16J
-

217

and at 15 per cent of the charges for long
distance telephone calls costing more than 15
cents, with a maximum tax of 75 cents per call.
The Stock Transfer Tax is imposed, with
certain exemption, on each change of ownership
of stocks and bonds as follows:
(a) Three cents for every one hundred dollars, or fraction thereof of the par value of a
bond.
(b) On shares sold or valued, per share at
Over $150 - 4 cents plus 1/10 of 1 per cent of
value in excess of $150 per share. .
From over $75 te $150-4 cents per share
From over 50 to
75-3 cents per share
From over 25 to
50-2 cents per share
From over
5 te
25-1 cent per share
From $1 te 5
-- j cent per share
Less than $1
- 1/10 of 1 per cent of value.
A tax of 10 per cent on insurance premiums
is imposed on premiums for insurance of property situated in Canada against risks other than
marine risks where the insurance is with a
British or foreign company or exchange not
authorized under laws of Canada to transact
insurance business.
5. The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1940.
A plan of unemployment insurance extending
throughout Canada has been brought into operatien as from July 1,- 1941, by the Dominion
Government pursuant te provisions of the
Unemployment Insurance Act, 1940. As mining
is not one of the excepted classes of employment the operators in the mining industry will
contribute te the insurance fund in respect to
each employee earning less than $38.50 per
week or under $2,000 per year. For employees
earning less than $0.90 per day or under 16
years of age there is ho assessment against the
employed person but the employer contributes
27 cents per week. Over that minimum class
a part of the total contribution is paid by a
deduction fron the worker's wages or salary,
che employer being responsible for the payments made by purchasing and affixing unemployment insurance stamps in the employee's
insurance book or alternatively by stamped
impressions in the book by means of a licensed
metering device obtained through the Post
Office. In respect te the several wage-groups
of employees earning from $5.40 to $38.49 per
week the employer's contribution is at rates
varying from 211cents te 27 cents for each full
week's work while the employee contributes
from 12 cents te 36 cents, the employee contribution being less than that of the employer
in the lower brackets but higher than the
employer contribution when the employee has
weekly earnings of $2000 or more. The payments are made into the Unemployment Insurance Fund created under the Act, and in
addition te the contribution by employers and
employees the Dominion Government makes a
grant of one-fifth of the aggregate contributions made by employers and employees and as
well defrays the entire costs of administration.
From the fund an insured workman who becomes unemployed is paid *a weekly benefit
ameunting for a person without dependents ta
34 times the employee's average weekly contribution made within the previous two years and
for a person with certain classes of dependents
te 40 times such contribution. Provided statutory conditions relating te his eligibility for
benefit are fulfilled the unemployed workman
may draw one benefit payment for every five
contributions made in the previous five years,
less one payment for every three benefit payments received, in the previous three years.

218

SENATE

First of the statutory conditions is that the
worker must have had contributions paid in
respect of him while employed in insurable
employment for net less than 180 days during
the two years immediately preceding the date
on which a claim for benefit is made.
The
Unemployment Insurance Act is under the administration of the Unemployment Insurance
Commission with headquarters at Ottawa and
in addition to providing unemployment insurance the Act provides that the Commission
shall maintain a National Employment Service
with
regional
divisions
and
local offices.
National, regional and local committees, representative of workers and employees, are to
assist the Commission on employment problems
and a free employment service will extend to
uninsured as well as insured industries.
6. The Companies Act
The incorporation of a mining company in
Canada may be by Provincial or Dominion
charter, under procedure relating to the forAs distinct
mation of companies generally.
from a Provincial charter, which authorizes
the carrying on of business in only one province,
though the company may obtain licences from
other provinces to carry on business therein, a
Dominion charter allows the transaction of
business throughout Canada. In some instances
the Dominion charter is a special Act of ParThe Comliament granting special powers.
panies Act, however, provides for the incorporation of Dominion companies generally, exception being made of railway, telephone, telegraph, banking, trust, loan. and insurance comIncorporation under the Act is by
panies.
Letters Patent issued by the Secretary of
State and the Act at present in force is the
Companies Act, 1934, to ivhiclh there were certain amendments in 1935.
This Dominion
statute made radical changes in the existing
law, mainly imiposing obligations on directors
and others responsible for admnistering the
affairs of Dominion companies, suci changes
being designed to prevent fraud and other
objectionalle practices and to ensure publicity
and full disclosure of msaterial and relevant
facts in financial statements of companies and
in company prosp.ectts.s, which would be.available to shareholders, investors and creditors.
The Act is ccmîprised of over 200 sections and
is in seven parts, Part I being the part that
deals with the inrorporation of limited liability
companies with share capital.
The shsares of
capital stock may have a par value or they
may be without nominal or par value, or shares
of both classes nay he issued, and there nay

initiated by the Attorney General of Canada.
A company which does not go into bona fide
operation within three years of incorporation
or does not tise its corporate powers for three
consecutive years shall have its charter forfeited. Shares of capital stock baving a nominal or par value shall not be issued as fully
paid except for cash te the total nominal
amount or for a consideration in property or
services determined to be the fair equivalent
of cash to the total nominal amount.
The
issue of prospectuses is controlled, the Act providing that prospectuses must be filed with the
Secretary of State, also setting out specific
requirenents as to information to be contained
iu prospectuses and that certain specified information must be published under the heading
"Statutory Information".
The Act prevents
door-to-door or telephone canvassing for subseriptions to shares and sets out that no application for securities offered to the public may
be accepted unless the applicant has been furnishsed with a prospectus.
It provides for an
anuial returna of specified information to the
Secretary of State that there shall lie a properly audited financial statement presented at
annual meetings and sent to shareholders and
to the Secretary of State; that any mortgage
or charge shall Se registered with the Secretary
of State; thsat commissions shall not be paid
on sales of shares except as authorized by the
Letters
Patent
or
Supplementary
Letters
Patent and disclosed in the prospectus in the
case of an offering of shares to the public;
that directors must not speculate in shares or
other securities of companies of which they
are directors; that directors are to be held
responsible for untrue statements in prospectuses; and that the Secretary of State may
appoint one or More competent inspectors to
investigate the affairs of a company. A particular exception for mining companies whose
principal objects are exploration, developmsent
or operation of nining properties, is made in
regard to the requirement that dirertors of a
public company shall not authorize the issue
of fully paid shares having a nominal or par
value except for cash to the total nominal
amount or its fair equivalent.
Part IV of the Act relates to British and
Foreign miinig companies. It states that any
joint stock company or corporation duly incorporated uînder the laws of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
or under the laws of any foreign country for
the purpose of carr ying on mining operations
nay, on receiving a licence from the Secretary
of State, carry on mining operations in the
Northwest Territories and ¯the Yukon Territory
(territories wliere the mining operations are
under Dominion control), ani shall be entitled
to the privileges of a free miner, subject to the
laws and regulations governing and affecting
free miners.
The fees payable for incorporation under the
Companies Act, 1934, vary with the proposed
capital.
Upon Letters Patent and Supplementary Letters Patent the following are the
charges:
Fee
$100.
$100 plus $1 for each $1,000 (and fraction) in
excess of $50,000.
$250 plus 50 cents for each $1,000 (and fraction) in excess of $200,000.
$400 plus 20 cents for each $1,000 (and fraction) in excess of $500,000.

When -shares are sold at an amount fixed by the
Letters Patent the fee is calculated at the
above tariff on the aggregate of capital at the
amount so fixed. Supplementary Letters Patent
increasing the capital are charged at the abov
tariff on the increase only, that is the fee to
be the same as for incorporation of a company
with a capital equal to the increase. '[he
annual filing fee is $5.00 for a company of
$200,000 capitalization or less; $10.00 over
$200,000 to $500,000 capital; $25.00 over $500,000 to $1,000,000 capital; and $25.00 plus $1
on each $1,000,000 above the first $1,000,000
capital, the total fee not to exceed $50.00.
7. The Customs Tariff
Al
persons and corporations, including
mining companies, are required to pay customs
duties as imposed on goods imported into
Canada under the items of a lengthy tariff
schedule. The Act setting the duties of customs
is known as the Customs Tariff Act and the rates
of duties collected are in general according to
(1) British Preferential Tariff, applying to
goods the produce or manufacture of specified
British countries entering Canada without
transhipment from a country enjoying the benefits of the British Preferential Tariff. (2) Intermediate Tariff, applying to direct imports of
goods the produce or manufacture of any British
or foreign country to which the benefits of the
Intermediate Tariff are extended, (3) General
Tariff, applying to all goods not entitled to
admission under the Intermediate Tariff or
British Preferential Tariff. There are also
special rates under Trade Agreements with
certain countries.
Many articles of mining machinery and equipment enter Canada free from customs duty
under each of the tariffs, the free entry in
some cases, however, being only for articles of a
class or. kind not made in Canada. In other
cases free entry is restricted to the British
Preferential Tariff. A large number of articles having to do with metallic mining and
metallurgical operations, coal mining, oil-well
and gas-well drilling, and other mining operations are included in the various parts of
Tariff Item No. 410, an item which singles out
many articles of mining machinery and equipment for either free entry or the imposition
of moderate tariff rates. Under this item admittance free from duty under all tariffs includes such articles as: car loading machines
for loading coal into box cars; mac'hinery and
apparatus for producing unrefined oil from
shales, not including motive power, of a class
or kind not made in Canada; machinery and
apparatus for operating oil sande by mining
operations and for extracting ail from the
sands so mined' well-drilling machinery and
apparatus for drilling for water, natural gas or
oil, or in prospecting for minerals, not including
motive power; machinery and appliances of
iron or steel, of a class or kind not made in
Canada, and elevators, and machinery of floating dredges, for use exclusively in alluvial gold
mining; machinery and apparatus, of a class or
kind not made in Canada, for handling are
and other materials charged to the blast furnace
at a smelting works; diamond drilla and core
drills, net including motive power, and electrically operated rotary coal drills, of a clas or
kind not made in Canada for use exclusively
in mining operations; coal heading machines
and electric or magnetie machines for concentrating or separating iron ores and automatie
seales for use with conveyors, all for mining or

21à

metall'urgical operations; furnaces for the smelting of ores, converting apparatus for metallurgical processes in metals, machinery for the
extraction of precious metals by cihlorination
or cyanide processes, not including pumps,
vacuum pumps or compressors, and blat furnace blowing engines for production of pig iron,
all for use in mining and metallurgical eperations; amalgam safes, automatic ore samplers,
automatic feeders, retorts, mercury pumps, nonmetallic heating elements, pyrometers, bullion
furnaces and amalgam eleaners, all for use in
mining and metallurgical operations; blowers
of iron or steel, of a class or kind not made in
Canada, for smelting ores or reduction, separation or refining or metals, ores or minerals,
also rotary kilns, revolving roasters and furnaces of metal, of a class or kind not made in
Canada, designed for roasting ore, mineral rock
or clay, and furnace slag trucks and slag pots
of a class or kind not made in Canada; buddles,
vanners, slime or concentrating tables for mining and metallurgical operations; machinery,
furnaces and appliances, of a clas or kind not
made in Canada, for refining of metals and for
the production of anodes, cathodes, blocks,
slabs, pigs or ingots, in such refining processes;
also certain miner's rescue appliances, combustible and other gas indicators, detectors, inhalators and respirators, miners' acetylene and
safety lamps, etc.
In addition to the above mining machinery
and equipment given free entry into Canada
under Tariff Item No. 410 there are other items
in the tariff schedule providing free entry under
each tariff of articles or materials used in
mining, including diamond dust or bort and
black diamonds, for borers; coke of a kind not
produced in Canada or coke which, owing to
transportation osts, is not ava.ilable commereially at point of use, when imported for manufacturing calcium carbide or rock wool or
for metallurgical operations; safety helmets,
xanthates and sulphothio-phosphor-ic (dithiophosphorie) compounds for processes of concentrating ores, metal or minerals; machinery
and apparatus, including machinery and apparatus for carbonizing lignite coal, but not ineluding motive power, when imported for manufacture of fuel briquettes; oil for concentration
of ores of metal; platinum crucibles; platinum
retorts, pans, condensers, tubing and pipe, and
preparations of platinum used for the manufacture or concentration of sulphuric acid.
Free entry under the British Preferential
Tariff and low rates of d.uty (up to 12J per
cent) under other tariffs are accorded to such
mining machinery items as heavy duty mine
hoists of size and capaeity not made in Canada;
certain face loading machines and trough conveyor equipment for mining, of a class or kind
not made in Canada; machinery and apparatus
for washing or dry cleaning coal at coal mines
or coke plants; machinery and apparatus for
sintering iron ore and machinery and apparatus
for construction, equipment and repair of blast
furnaces for smelting iron ore.
The Customs Tariff also allows a drawback
of 99 per cent of the customs duty on bituminone
coaI imported and used by proprietors of coke
ovens for conversion into coke for use in the
smelting of metals from ores and in the
melting of metals, also on charcoal when used
for the sneting of metals from ores, and ou
bituminous eoal when used in melting, evaporating and preparing salt produced in Canada.
A 50 per cent drawback applies to lapwelded

Other Dominion Legislation
Although control over natural resources is
ordinarily in Canada a matter of Provincial
jurisdiction and the mining acts in force in
the varions provinces are enactments of Provincial legislatures, nevertheless several Dominion statutes have a direct connection with
mining enterprise. Also for those of other
countries desirous of entering Canada in connection with mining enterprises the Immigration
Act is of interest. Hereunder are included brief
summaries of:
(11) The Gold Export Act
(2) The Electricity and Fluid Exportation
Act
(3) An Act respecting Bounty on Canadian
Coadl used in the manufacture of Iron or Steel
(4) The Immigration Act
(1) The Gold Export Act
There has been no change recently in the
control over the exportation of gold from
Canada.
The control is exercised by the
Minister of Finance under regulations pursuant
to the Gold Exýport Att, enacted in 1932, a brief
Act which provided that the Governor in
Council might prohibit from time to time the
export of gold from Canada. The regulations
set out that the expert of gold, whether in the
form of coin or bullion, from the Dominion of
Canada is prohibited except under licences
-issued by the Minister of Finance, which licences
may be issued only te a Canadian chartered
bank or the Bank of Canada. (Bank of Canada
added in a 1935 amendment to the Act.)
By Order in Council the term "Bullion" is
deemed to include all gold in the form of ore.
concentrates or base 'bullion. The Departm1ent
of Finance issues gold expert licences to chartered banks on beha.f of mining companies
whose concentrates or ore cannot be economically treated in Canada. The procedure, therefore, for the mining operator desiring te
export ore or concentrates is to make application through a branch of a Canadian chartered
bank to the Minister of Finance for ,an expert
licence, stating full particulars of the shipment
or shipments intended.
(Note: The disposal of the gold bullion production of Canadian mines is by shi.pm.ent to
the Royal Canadian Mint where settlement is
made at the market price. Placer gold shipments are received at the Dominion of Canada
Assay Office, Vancouver, operated in conjunction
with the Royal Canadian Mint.)
(2) Electricity and Fluid Exportation Act
The Electricity and Fluid Exportation Act
has a connection with the mining industry in
its control over the exportation by means of
pipe lines or like contrivances of petroleum
and natural gas produced in Canada.
The
Act, enacted in 1907, in addition to regulating
the exportation of electrical power also provides for regulation of "fluid" experts. The
term "fluid" is defined as meaning "petroleum,
natural gas, water or other fluid, whether
liquid or gaseous, capable of being exported
by means of pipe lines or other like contrivances,
and produced in Canada." The Act requires
that there shall not be export of any power or
fluid without a licence nor to an amount in
excess of the quantity permitted by licence
Hon. Mr. McGEEI.

nor otherwise than as permitted by licence,
and the construction of transmission lines
for expert of power and of pipe lines or like
contrivances for the export of fluid is prohibited exýcept under licence. The Act is administered by the Electricity and Gas Inspection
Service of the Department of Trade and Commerce,

and under the Act licences

either

for

exportation of power or of fluid or for construetien of transmission or pipe lines may be granted
by the Governor in Council subjeot to any
regulations approved by the same authority.
Any licence for exportation may provide that
the quantity of power or fluid te be exported
shall be limited to the surplus, after the
licencee has supplied for distribution te eustomers for use in Canada power or fluid to
the extent defined by such licence, at prices
and in accordance with conditions, rules and
regulations preseribed. The Act provides that
expert duties may be imposed on the power
or fluid exported from Canada. These duties
are net to exceed $10 per horse power per annum
in respect to power exported or ten cents per
thousand cubie feet on fluid exported, and
exemption from the 'payment of such duties
may be made when there is compliance with
directions of the Governor in Council with regard to the quantity of power or fluid te be
supplied for distribution te customers for use
mn Canada.
In virtue of provisions of the Act various
regulations have been passed by Order in Council for the governance of the exportation o
electrical power and of petroleum, natural gas,
water or other fluid capable of being exported
through pipe lines or other like contrivances.
Annual licence fees are prescribed as follows:
(a) In the case of an electrical plant generating not more than 10,000 H.P.-$25.00.
(b) In the case of an electrical plant generating over 10,000 H.P.-$50.00.

(c) In the case of a natural gas plant$50.00.
Licences may be revoked for refusal te coinply with conditions imposed and upon reasonabe notice if the eleetrical energy, gas or fluid
is required for the use of purchasers in Canada.
In the case of a supply of electrical energy,
gas or fluid provided for export and home consunption, the price charged to any person or
company in Canada shall not exceed the price
et which the product is sold for expert in like
quantities under similar circumstances.
(3) Bounty on Canadian coal used in manufacture of iron or steel
An Act to place Canadian coal used in the
manufacture of iron or steel on a basis of
equality with imported coal was assented to
in May, 1930. The Act authorizes payment by
the Government of Canada to manufacturers
of iron or steel of 49½ cents per ton of bituminous coal mined in Canada and converted
into coke by proprietors of coke ovens at their
coke ovens in Canada and used by such manufacturers in the smelting in Canada of iron
from ore or in the manufacture in Canada of
steel ingots or steel castings. The Act provides
that the bounty shall only be payable so long as
the provisions of tariff item No. 1019 in Schedule B to the Customs Tariff remain in full
effect.
(This tariff item is one which provides for a drawback of 99 per cent of customs
duty on imported bituminous coal when imported by proprietors of coke ovens and con-

NOVEMBER 12, 1945
verted at their coke ovens into coke for use
in the gmeliting of metals from ores and in the
melting of metals). The Act provides also that
no person or corporation shall receive payment of the bounty if there is not compliance
with such laws enacted by the Province, in
which the industry concerned operates, for the
purpose of maintaining in the operation of
such industry hours of labour and rates of
wages consistent with the provisions of any
international convention adopted by a labour
conference held under the Treaty of Versailles.
(4) The Immigration Act
Canada does net impose restriotions, except
for the purpose of excluding undesirables, upon
persons seeking to enter the Dominion for a
temporary stay in connection with business
enterprises. Unless entering with the intention
of acquiring Canadian domicile, the person
coming to Canada in connection with the
ownership in or acquiring interests in the mining
industry, or in other industries, is not considered as an "immigrant" under the provisions
of the Immigration Act. No passport is required
in regard to British subjects entering Canada
directly or indirectly from Great Britain or
Northern Ireland, the Irish Free State, Newfoundland, New Zealand, Australia, the Union
of South Africa or the United States of
America (British subject here meaning born
or naturalized in Canada or in one of the
British countries mentioned) nor are passports
required from United States citizens. Persons
seeking to enter fromn other countries must be in
possession of an unexpired passport issued by
the country of which the person is a subject
and carrying the visé of an appropriate officer
representing Canada in that country. A
restriction in force under the War Measures
Act excludes the entry into Canada of enemy
In general "immigrants", or those
aliens.
seeking domicile in Canada, must be possessed
of sufficient means to maintain themselves until
employment is secured and the current Immigration Regulations prohibit, except in regard to
British subjects from the countries above
specified and citizens of the United States, the
landing in Canada of immigrants of all classes
and occupations other than of agriculturists
with means to farm and of certain persons
entering as dependants of persons already in
Canada. The entry into Canada of any immigrant with an advance agreement or contract,
express or implied, in regard to his employment
in Canada is also prohibited except that the
Minister of Mines and Resources, who is
responsible for administration of the Immigration Act, may admit any contract labourer if
satisfied that his labour or service is required
in Canada. Under the Act and notwithstanding
any other provisions or regulations, the
Minister of Mines and Resources may issue a
special written permit authorizing any person
to enter Canada, or having entered or landed
in Canada, to remain therein without being
subjeet to the provisions of the Act.

imposed to the sending of United States dollars
into Canada for investment in Canadian mining
enterprises, the American investor naturally
desires to know about the withdrawal of his

·

221

capital and concerning the payment to him of
interest, dividende and current profits. Hereunder is the policy (*) being administered by
the control organization which is known as
the Foreign Exchange Control Board (for a
statement on the establishment, functions and
regulations of the Board see under Section C):
1. New Investments
When an American investor, who has sent
United States dollars to Canada for an investment subsequent to the outbreak of war in a
new capital development, disposes of his interest in the development. United States funds
are provided by the Board at the official rate of
exchange up to the amount of the original sum
brought to Canada. The "new capital development" may be the establishment or extension of
an industrial plant or the development of
mining or oil properties (including prospecting
and exploratory work); the sale of United
States dollars to a Canadian bank and details
of the investment must be recorded at the
time with the Board. If upon liquidation of
the investment a larger sum is realized than
that originally invested, the resulting capital
gain accrues to the investor in Canadian
dollars.
If the investment were made with Qanadian
dollars obtained otherwise than through the
sale of United States dollars to a Canadian
bank, the proceeds of the investment will likewise be received in Canadian dollars.
2. Interest, dividends and current profits
American investors continue to receive
dividends, interest and profits, and may obtain
United States funds at the official rate of exchange for such payments.
Dividends, etc.
are freely transferred in this manner for all
current earnings on the enterprise, whether the
investment was made before the outbreak of
war or snce.
3. Repayment of debts
A Canadian debtor who owes Uni.ted States
dollars to an American creditor under a debt
created before the outbreak of war, or created
with the approval of the Foreign Exchange
Control Board subsequent to the outbreak of
wa,, may obtain United States dollars from a
Canadian bank to pay principal and interest as
they become due.
Similarly, if such a debt is expressed in
Canadian dollars, the Canadian debtor may
make payment in Canadian dollars in accordance with the terms of the obligation. (Interest,
however, received by the American creditor,
may be converted into United States dollars at
the official rate of exchange).
4. Trading in Canadian securities
An American holder of Canadian securities
can freely sell them to another American,
whether in Canada or outside Canada. He
may also sell them to a Canadian provided lie
reinvests the proceeds of sale in other Canadian
securities purchased in Canada. Canadian
securities cannot be sold to a , Canadian for
cash, however, except in the case of new investments in Canadian secmrities made through a
Canadian investment dealer since the outbreak
of war. In such a case the investor who has
registered his purchase of securities with the
Board may resell the securities for cash at any
time.

Exchange Control Board under date of February 11,

5. Disposal of Canadian dollars
An American who holds Canadian dollars
in a Canadian bank or receives Canadian dollars in circumstances in which the Board is not
prepared to provide United States dollars at
the official rate of exchange may, nevertheless,
dispose of his Canadian dollars to another
American (e.g. a United States bank) 'at
whatever rate of exchange rnay prevail outside Canada.
C. Notes Concerning Various Wartime Authorities, Orders And Regulations
Under the emergencies of war the Dominion
Government has established controllers, boards
and branches clothed with powers to exercise
control over development of natural resources,
industry, commerce, etc. Inasmuch as some of
these organizations exercise or iay exercise
powers having a more or less direct connection
with the Canadian mining industry there is
included hereunder notes or summaries concerning:
1. Metals Controller
2. Oil Controller
3. Construction Control
4. Export Permit Branch
5. Foreign Exchange Control Board
(1) Metals Controller
Under the authority of the Department of
Munitions and Supply Act, an Order in Council,
No. 3187 of July 15, 1940, appointed a Metals
Controller with wide powers "to conserve, coordinate and regulate the metal resources and
industry of Canada in order to fulfil the present
and potential needs of Canada and her allies",
metals being defined as all minerals, ores, metallic products, metals and alloys thereof, save
and excepting coal and other solid fuels, oil,
steel and iron. The Metals Controller has power
among other things to buy or take possession
of mines and to mine, process, refde and dispose of metals and deal in metals generally; te
take possession of any land, plant, factory, mill,
refinery, etc., for the purpose of mining, refining,
storing and transporting metals, and to take
possession of means of transportation; to take
possession of metals wherever found; te fix
prices and limit quantities of metals distriuted to any person or firm, subject in these
powers to the approval of the Minister of Munitions and Supply; to issue permits and licences
in connection with buying, selling, drilling for,
mining, processing, refining, storing, transporting, importing, exporting, or in any way dealing
in metals and to prohibit any person or firm
from engaging in such businesses or from constructing or changing any plant, factory or
refinery, etc.; to construct. or make any structural changes in plants, factories, mills, or
refineries used in connection with drilling for,
mining, processing, refining or storing of metals;
to regulate the types or grades of metals te be
produced or processed, exported or imported,
etc.; and to require any person, firm or corporation having ownership or possession of prortics to drill for, mine, process, refino, store,
transport, sel or otherwise deal as directed
with the metals contro.iled, subject to compensation being paid to the owners. The Metals
Controller, with the approval of the Governor
in Council, may also advance moneys for drilling
for, mining, processing, refining, storing, or
transporting metals for the purpose of assisting such businesses.
Before undertaking the development of a
mineral property a permit must be obtained
from the Metals Controller.
Hon. Mr. McGEER.

(2) Oil ControlIer
Under the authority of the Department of
Munitions and Supply Act, an Order in Council,
No. 2818 of June 28, 1940, appointed an Oil Controller and in regulations gave him wide powers
not only in regard to price regulation and control of distribution of oil but powers to deal
in, acquire possession

of, and control oil and

oil lands and to take over, as he might deem
necessary, operations such as drilling, refining,
transportation, and distribution. The original
regulations have been superseded by new regulations approved by Order in Council No. 1105
of February 19, 1941. These new regulations
do not lessen but rather extend the powers of
the Oil Controller. He is given wide latitude
to acquire or control any or all operations
in any branch or division of the petroleum
industry from drilling to refining and distribution of products as related to Canadian oil
resources or to imported oil and chemical,
mineral or other materials or substances required for production, manufacture, processing
or refining of oil. Also benzol, and any substitute product for developing power in internal
combustion engines, and anti-freeze solutions,
are within the scope of his operations. As
affecting oil wells or oil-bearing lands, the Oil
Controller, among other things, may take over
any land, plant, refinery, etc., for the purpose
of operating the same and may issue or reissue
licences to any person or class of persons dealing in or with oil. He may prohibit or regulate
any construction of buildings or plant conected
with the oil industry, prohibit the acquiring by
purchase, lease, option or other agreement of
any property, may construet or change any
plant or require any person to provide any
plant or equipment or require a person having
oil property to mine, drill or otherwise develop
the same. He may take over drilling or other
development operations or with the approval of
the Governor in Council may advance moneys
for mining, drilling, producing, manufacturing,
processing or transporting oil.
(3) Construction control
Under the authority of the Department of
Munitions and Supply Act. an Order in Council,
No. 660, of January 30, 1942 (replacing Order
in Council No. 3.481, of May 16, 1941, and
amendments thereto), gives wide powers to the
Controller of Construction in regard to controlling new construction, repairs to buildings,
expansion of existing facilities, and replacement
of equ.ipment. The new regulations in regard
to the licensing of construction remove the previous exemption relating to the mining industry
and require that no person except the holder
of an unceancelled licence from the Controller
shall (a) install in any plant any equ'ipment
at a total cost exceeding $5,000 for all equipment so installed in each project; (b) construct
any plant or make repairs, additions or alterations to any plant at a total cost exceeding
$5,000 for each project; (c) construct, or make
repairs or alterations or additions to, any
building other than a plant and/or install
therein any equipment, at a total cost exceeding $5,000 for all of such construction, repairs,
alterations, additions and .installations included
in one project.
(4) Export permit branch
Under wartime restrictions, the export of
numerous commodities and products of Canadian industry is prohibited except under permit. Replacing previous control through the
Department of National Revenue and by certain
specified boards, administrators or controllere,
the Canadian Governcent in April, 1941, moved

Comments:
In none of resolutions Nos. 16, 17, 18 and 20
is any further consideration or benefit provided
than now exists. The object of the resolutions
is to extend these benefits through the calendar
year 1946.
The benefits in the previously existing item
-were restricted to mnetalliferous or strategic
mineral mining and exploration companies.
Resolution No. 19 broadens the scope to include
all mining and exploration companies.
The benefits in the previously existing item
were confined to prospecting, exploration and
developinent expenses incurred in searching for
base inetals and strategie minerals. Resolution
No. 19 extends this benefit to the search for
all minerals.
2, Resolution to amend the Excess Profits
Tax Act
"6. That the exemption of the profits of
corporations derived fron the operation of any
base metal or strategie mineral mines be
extended to the profits of corporations derived
from the operation of gold mines and industrial
mineral mines, and that such exemption be
extended to the profits of such mines whici
come into production after January 1, 1946."
Comnients:
'he effect of this resolution is to extend
beyond Decemuber 31, 1945, to corporations
operating base metal or strategie mineral mines
the benefits they presently enjoy.
It also
provides for the same benefits to be applied to
corporations also operating gold mines and
industrial mineral mines.
3. Resolutions
to amend the Special War
Revenue Act
"1. That the consumption or sales tax shall
not apply to machinery and apparatus and
complete parts thereof which, in the opinion of
the Minister of National Revenue, are to be

used directly in the process of manufacture or
production of goods; provided that this exemption shall not apply to office equipment or motor
vehicles;
3. That the 10 per cent war exchange tax
be rescinded."
Comments:
It would appear that the dropping of the
consunption
or
sales
tax
on
machinery,
apparatus and tools used in the process of
manufacture or production of goods would be
of benefit to many mining and metallurgical
companies.
The rescinding of the 10 per cent War
Exchange Tax will undoubtedly be of benefit to
the minning and metallurgical industries because
of the amount of equipmnent they ordinarily
import.
General Comment
The entire benefit of the resolutions listed
above and, possibly, of some others will not be
apparent until border-line cases have been
considered and practice established upon which
decisions mnay be made.

He said: There are eigbt amendments to
the bill, ail of a drafting character. One
clause that we considered unnecessary bas
been struck out. The other amendments are
for the purpose of tightening up the wording
of the bill wîthout in any way affecting its
general purport.
Hon. ANTOINE J. LEGER: Honourable
senators, in the commîttee this morning some
observations were made with reference to
section 13, now section 12, of tbe draft bill.
No definite action was taken. I have since
had occasion to consult some of the members
of the committee, and I have also conferred
with the Law Clerk. Tbey"ail agree that it
would be desirable to have the bill sent back
for furtber consideration. I therefore move
that the bill be not now placed on the Order
Paper for third reading, but that it be
referred. back to the committee for further
consideration.
Hon. S. A. HAYDEN: I second the motion.
I may say by way of explanation that there
is no desire to impede the passage of the
bill. It was felt this morning that there was
a much better way of dealing witb a certain
provision in the bill in accordance witb
Senate practice, but the information required
was not tben available.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I think there is a

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
On the Orders of tbe Day:
Hon. WILSHART McL. ROBERTS ON:
Honoiirable senators, before the Orders of the
Day are called 1 desire to suggest to bionourable seustors that the volume~ of legislation
wbicb we may reasonabhy expect to come to
us in the next few days would seemn to make it
probable that we shail be sitting every week
for some time to come. For the convýenience
of honourable senators wbo bave to arrange
reservations for travel, I would add that so
far as I can tell at present there will àe no
business requiring our attention on Friday of
this week, so that on Tbursday we could
adjourn until next Mondiay eveýning.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I umlderstand the Prime
Minister of Great Bnîtain is expected to
address the members of both Houses on Monday afternoon. We certainly want to hear
him, and I would suggest that in order to
have as large a number of senators as possible
present for bis address we sbould resume here
on Monday afternoon.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Tbat is an excellent suggestion. 1 was simply making an
announcement for the convenience of honounable senators who h-ave to secure reservations.
.Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Can the honourable leader krive any indication of what
measures are likely to reach us within the
next few days? So far as I cau observe. there
are none.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: On our Order

reach us today or tomorrow. It is probable
that other measures will be coming over for
our consideration from time to time.

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I enquire from the
honourable chairman of the Standing Committee on Immigration and Labour (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) when the committee is likely to
sit to consider the matter referred to it last
night. I want to be present.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I am sorry that I
was not present at the latter part of last
night's sitting. Was a bill referred to the
committee?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: A resolution.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The resolution
approving the convention adopted by the
International Labour Organization in 1932?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I spoke to my
leader and understood that a reference to the
committee on this matter would be superfluous and would not be made.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That is quite so.
When the honourable gentlemen spoke to me
I said I was under the impression that there
would not be a reference to the committee;
but last evening, after the honourable gentleman had left the Chamber, the honourable
senator from Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr. Paterson) suggested that the resolution be referred
to a committee in order that further information might be obtained. That suggestion was
adopted, and it is to be hoped that appropriate officials will be asked to come, at the
convenience of the Committee, and give
whatever information is necessary.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Considering that

the resolution has been delayed this long, I

presume a little further delay will not matter.
I have to be out of town the rest of this week.
A meeting of the committee can probably be
arranged for some time next week.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I thank the honourable
gentleman. I simply wanted to make sure to
be present at the committee's meeting.
TRANS-CANADA AIR LINES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill 21, an Act to amend the TransCanada Air Lines Act, 1937.
He said: Honourable senators, I would ask
the honourable gentleman from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Campbell) to explain this bill.
Hon. G. P. CAMPBELL: Honourable
senators, this bill passed the other House after
some discussion by honourable members on
both sides. The chief purpose of the bill is·
to increase the authorized capital of TransCanada Air Lines to enable it to proceed
with its programme of development in the
post-war period', and also to empower the
Governor-in-Council to create new companies
to engage in the air transport business as
subsidiaries of Trans-Canada Air Lines.
The present law pertaining to transportation by air is fairly clearly defined in one or
two statutes. The Government bas established
a policy by which air transportation on main
lines in the Dominion of Canada and on all
international lines shall be under the control
of a Government-owned corporation. That
policy was laid down under the provisions of
the Aeronautics Act. The Trans-Canada Air
Lines Act does not establish any such policy,
but simply authorizes the formation of a company to engage in air transportation services.
The Aeronautics Act, which was amended last
session, clearly establishes as a matter of
Government policy that the main lines of air
transportation shall be earried on by a
Government-owned company. It therefore
becomes necessary in the post-war period to
increase the capital of the company charged
with this responsibility, so as to provide the
citizens of this country with adequate means
of air transportation.
The main purpose of the bill is to place the
Trans-Canada Air Lines in a position to carry
out the objects for which the corporation was
formed. The first of these is the extension and
development of its domestic services. Since
the formation of the corporation in 1937 there
has been established one main line serving
Canada from coast to coast. Subsequent to
1937 the Canadian Pacific Railway Company
acquired a number of branch lines with a view
to establishing a competitive service over some
air routes. When war broke out the Government-owned corporation, although it had been
in operation only two years, had established
a record for air-line development.

NOVEMBER 13, 1945
Nothing in this bill in any way relates to
the policy of the Government as laid clown
last session, when amendments were made to
the Aeronautics Act, although in the other
place there was considerable discussion on the
point. I mention this simply because 1 intend.
to confine my remarks to the subject-matter
of this amending biEi.
The establishment ocf new air lines is now
necessary as new equipment bacomas available. It is the policy of the corporation to
acquire faster and botter planes so as 'to provide more frequent service. New four-motor
airoraf t will be in operation as soon as they
becoma available.
Formei,y the corporation's operations were
confined t0 the norbhern route, but as -a result
cf the convention which was agreed to at the
Chicago conference, Trans-Canada planes are
now able to use a shorter route over the
United States, with liberty ýto land for purposes of refuelling and servicing. This reduces the fiying time by several hours and
provides facilities for an alternative route.
Aiiother service has been established from
Winnipeg to SaskEvtoon and Edimonton. Agreements have also been entered into with the
Governmnent of the United States to provide
additionaii services from Halifax to Boston,
from Toronto to Clevelland, from Toronto to
Chicago, frorn the lakehaad to Duluth, from
Victoria, to Seattle, and from Whitehorse ta
Fairbanks.
I arn sure honourable senators will realize
that ilf transportation by air is to be deve!.
oped ini Canada to provide a service comparable wit-h that provided by other countries,
the corporation responsible for the service
must ho adequateay capitalýizad. For the immediate purposes of furnishing thesa 'added
facilities, and some other international facilitias which I will dewl wit:h later, the Government asks that the capital of the company be
increased from $5,000,000 to $25,O0O,000.
The international air services which are to ha
established have already hren annoirnced by
the Minister of Transport. The first will be
via the North Atlantic route to the United
Kingdom, and it is hoped that within a short
time a rogular service will be in operation.
The second air service will be from Eastern
Canadja ta the West Indies, the Caribbean
area -and Latin America. The third will ho to
the Pacific, in co-operation with other Comnmnonwealth air services. It is hoped that these
-other services will be operating within two
or three years, when machines and facilitias
are available.
It may interest honourable senators to know
that at the Chicago conference our represantativas, 'who took a leading part, suoceeded in

227

establishing what is known as the "two freedoms of the air." These freedoms or privileges
are extremely important in connection with
the development of international airways, for
they enable countries eng.aging in international
air transportation to route thoir aircraft over
other countrios. In addition, aircraf t fiying
betweon pointe in Canada have the priviloge
of flying across another country. The second
froedom is for aircraft to land in a f oreign
country for repairs or re-fualling. It was hoped
that a third freedom might have beau arranged
-the freýedom to carry traffie from the plane's
country of origin to another country; but the
representatives of the various goveruments
wore unable to agree on a multilateral agreement respocting thoso rights. It was agreed,
however, that countries could make bilateral
agreements. For instance, Canada and the
United States miglit agree that Canada could
fly passengers to the United States and bring
back passengers from the United States. But,
as I have said, no agreement was reaebed that
such an arrangement should apply generally.
Further attempte will be, macle to agree upon
the freedorna to ha granted companies estahlishing flying services to other countries.
In connection with our international air
developments, particularly from Canada to
the United Kingdnm, we are going to be suhject to competition froin the United, States.
Already it bas beau, announced that three
private cumpanias now oparating in that
country will have the right to fly te Great
Britain or the continent. So if we are to retain
the position we occupy today, it is important
that we have facilities under the provisions of
the Trans-Canadja Air Linos Act to finance our
companies which will- engage in international
transportation.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I ask my honourable friend if those are not publicly owned
companies?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: In the Uni ted
S tates?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, in Canada.
Hon.. Mr. CAMPBELL: The honourable
mamber for Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) may
have misunclerstood me. The competition
would be with thie. hues of private companies
operating batween the United States and
Europe or Great Britain. For instance, there
are, if I arn not mistaken, the Pan-American,
TWA and Amarican Export Lines.
The point I wish to make is that sine the
Government has aclopted- a policy whereby
governent-owned- càrporations will provide
international transportation. services hy air,
it is important that those services be estab-

228

SENATE

lished at the earliest possible date, so that we
may compete with the American lines from
New York, Boston and- other places in the
United States to the continent and the United
Kingdom. Therefore it was thought necessary
that operating companies should beo set up;
that is to say, that the Governor in Council
should have power to formn companies to
operate these international air lines. It has
not yet been decided whether one company
or more will be formed to operate these lines.
ILt was agreed at the conference in Chicago,
and also, I think, at the conference recently
held in Montreal, that all companies engaging in international air transport should
file with the international organization records
showing full particulars and details of the
services providied, the ost of those services,
and other information which may be required
to prevent cut-thiroat competition and instability in the industry, both from a financial and
an operating point of view. Therefore it was
again considered essential that new companies
be set up to carry on operations.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I suppose these
new companies wili be Crown companies.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL:
It is intended
that they should be wholly-owned subsidiaries
of Trans-Canada, and the amendment to the
bill provides for that.
Hon. Mr. Haig:
bill?

It

is provided

in the

Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Undýer clause 10
of the bill a new section 20 is added to the
act. This section makes full provision for the
setting up of these new corporations.
It should be pointed out that under section
10 there is no obligation imposed upon, TransCanada Air Lines to retain all the stock in
the companies that may be formed, though
that is the acknowledged intention. It is
provided that Trans-Canada Air Lines cannot divest themselves of more than' 49 per
cent of the stock; in that way they will always
be in control; but section 3 of the bill authorizes the corporation to deal with shares in
the new companies, with powerto purchase, hold 'and, subject to the provisions
of this Act, sell and dispose of shares je any
company incorporated under section 20.
The main purpose of that section is to
enable Trans-Canada Air Lines to make
agreements
with feeder
lines in other
countries, andi it was thought necessary to
authorize the acquisition of shares in those
companies, if it would help ini developing
business.
The other provisions of the bill deal with
mail contracts to be entered into between the
Postmaster General and the corporation.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL.

Formerly the procedure was to make a tenyear contract for the carrying of mail, and
rates were fixed from time to time depending
upon the frequency of service and so forth.
When the original Act was passed the company
was largely dependent for its operation upon
revenue received from the carriage of mail.
There 'was not then the volume of passenger
traffic available that there is today, and the
payments made by the Postmaster General
were more or less regarded as a subsidy. But
many changes have taken place, and now the
services to be rendered by these air transport
lines will be for the convenience of passengers.
The air lines will also carry mail ýat rates to
be agreed upon fron time to time, under
contracts to be settled between the Postmaster
General and the company, and approved by
the Governor in Council.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I ask what provision
there is under the existing law to enable
Parliament to go over the operations of this
company or these new companies to be formed?
What control has Parliament?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Parliament has no
more control over them than it has over any
corporation that is engaged in any field of
operation. For instance, when the bill was
originally passed Trans-Canada Air Lines were
set up as a company with authority to engage
in transportation by air. The amendments do
not enlarge that authority at all, except to
facilitate the formation of companies, controlled or wholly owned by Trans-Canada,
which also engage in air service. It would
appear that the protection of the public in a
matter of this kind is that nothing can be
done without the approval of the Governor in
Council. The reports of Trans-Canada are
placed before this House and the other House,
where questions can be asked and the whole
story made the subject of discussion and review
in Parliament at any time.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Is not the honourable
senator of the opinion that it is not a question
of control, as suggested by the honourable
senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig), but
a question of expediency? Parliament's control
over Government-owned corporations cannot,
I believe, be questioned'. Parliament can
al'ways bring 'Government-owned corporations
to order; it can compel them to appear before
committees and can always enact such legislation as will put the u'ltimate control of
Government-owned corporations in the hands
of Parliament.
Hon. Mr. 'CAMPBELL: I think the best
comparison I can give is to say that the new
corporations which are engaged in the busi-

NOVEMBER 13, 1945
nees of transportation by air are i the same
position as the Canadàan National Railways.
Hon. Mr. VIEN.: Even in that case wouid
flot the honourabie sanator agree that Parliament has a direct control? In the wisdoin of
Pariament it is exercised wîth care, and it is
expadient that there shouid ha. no political
interference with. the management of the
Canadian National Railways? If Parliament
fait that thare was something wrong in the
management of the Canadian National Railways it could summon the officiais of the railway ta appear before Parliament andi couid
remedy the situation by lagisiation.
lion. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I arn sorry ta
intarrupt. No doubt my honourable, friand
has read, the bull and knows that it is a most
extraorddnary ana. Everythifig is in the hands
of the Governor in 'Council and the Minister.
The Mimister and Govarnor in Councii can do
this and that. How is Parlia-ment going ta
know in datait what the Governor in Council
is doing, and how is it going to know what the
Minister is doing? I cao. summarize my
ramarks by saying that tihe trend in Canada,
unlike that in the United States, is towards
putting the whale air service into the hands
of the Oovernment and eiiminating aul private
competitian.
Han. Mr. CAMPBELL: With great respect,
I cannot quite agree with that statemant.
Very little power is given ta the Minister by
this bill. The Gavernar-in"Council, has -power
ta farm the carporatians, which po-wer wiii
haeexarcisad upan the adwvice af the Ministar.
Bon. Mr. HAIG: Was the Governmen-t not
given the power in last year's bill, which
placed the authority mostiy in the bands of
tha Ministar?
lion. Mr. CAMPBELL: Yes.
Han. Mr. HAIG: It is the combination of
the tWo that is bad.
Han. Mr. CAMPBELL: With great respect,
I wouki. paint out that thera are many
diflerences betwaen the Aaronautics Bill and
the presenit ana. I can fincd oniy ane pawer
vested by this bill in the Minister, and that,
provided by Section 3(f), is:
ta ]end money ta any corporation incorparated
undar section- twenty of this Act on such security
as the Minister may detarmine.
Hlon. Mr. HAIG:- That is quite important.
iHon. THOMAS- VIEN: Did I understand
the hanourable senator ta suggest that because
Trans-Canada Air Lines is incorporated as a
corapany the Ministar responsible for the
administratian of the Act is deprived of proper
ministerial direction over tha company's acti-

229

vitias and would hava no contrai aven if those
activities were contrary ta Govarnxnent policy?
If that wera so, I shouid, ha against this bill.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Na, that is not so0
at ail. Trans-Canada Air Lines is a Governmcnt-owned corporation farmed for the
purpose of angaging in tha business of air
transportatian. Like the Canadian National
Railways, it is operatad' by a haard of direators and its pawer ta create subsidiary corporatians is subjact ta, the approval of the
Govarnor in Council, a safeguard that is
niecassary.
Hon. Mr. EUILER: Is this bill merely ta
anabie the company ta extend its operatians
into tihe international field, wheraas s0 far thay
have been only in the hame field?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: The company is
in exactly the saine position as thel Canadian
Natianalt Railways or any governmant-owned
corporation that finds it necessary to, extend
its operatians either domestically or internationaiiy, and it has been decided that the
best way ta make extensions is through whallyowned subsidiary corporations.
Hon. Mr. BALIANTYNE: Why is that
policy not followed by the United States,
then?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I cannot answer
that. But in this country that policy has
been laid down and approvad by Parliament
in the Aeronautics Act, and the bill makes
no change whatever in it. Tha bill simply
places Trans-Canada Air Lines in a position
ta continue its oparations in accordance with
that established policy of the Government
and ta provide essantial air transportation
services, through its own operations or those
of whoily-ownad or controlled subsidiaries.
I do not know that there is any further
explanation 1 can give. I would suggest that
aîter second reading the bill ha referrad to
the Committeae on Railways, Telegraphs and
Harbours.
Hon. Mr. EULER- Under the Aeronautics
Act wouid it ha possible for the company, if
it had the neessary means, to engage in international air traffie?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Oh, yes. The
Trans-Canada Air Lines, under the Act of
incorporation which was passed in 1937, may
engage in international operations or extand
their domestic operations, but unless this bill
were passed they couid not do so through
subsidiary companies, nor could they obtain
th-e necassary capital. The main purpose of
the bull is ta provide capital and other
facilities by which the corporation may extend
its aperations through subsidiary companies.

230

SENATE

Hon. Mr. QUINN: Does this bill not provide exclusive rights to air transportation in
Canada and prevent all competition?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: No, it does not.
There is nothing whatever in the bill that
provides exclusive rights. If competition is
prohibited over the main routes of TransCanada Air Lines, that is done under the
Aeronautics Act.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Did I understand the
honourable gentleman to suggest that the
establishment of monopolies was condemned
under the international conventions agreed to
at Chicago?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I made no such
reference. What I did say was that the conferences agreed that the companies which
engage in international air operations should
file a detailed statement as to their operations,
and Trans-Canada Air Lines therefore considered it advisable to have their international
operations carried on through a subsidiary
company.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Honourable senators, I
think there is abroad a wrong impression
concerning the powers of ministers of the
Crown over government-owned corporations.
The honourable senator from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Campbell) bas compared the Trans-Canada Air Lines te the Canadian National Railways. It is wel1 that there should be as
little interference as possible with the management of such corporations. Their directors
are men of experience who possess the confidence of the public; they should be left
free to exercise their managerial discretion
in the best interests of their respective companies.
It is an error, however, to suggest
that the Government is or should be completely divorced from these corporations,
which, after all, are the property of Canada.
Their directors and managers are servants of
the Canadian people. Their policies should
be determined by responsible ministers of
the Crown, the ministers to whom these
companies must respectively report.
I repeat that it is desirable and expedient
to protect these corporations against political
interference. That is a fundamental principle
of government ownership.
But Parliament
cannot and should not delegate its supreme
control to anyone, either to a governmentowned corporation or to a board or commission, as has been done so frequently in
recent years. Reference was made to the
Board of Transport Commissioners, formerly
the Board of Railway Commissioners, which
is an administrative and judicial body completely remote from politicat influence.
I
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL.

was a member of that Board for five years.
During my tenure of office it never came to
my knowledge that the Government, directly
or indirectly, attempted at any time to
exercise its influence over the Board in any
way. But section 52 of the Railway Act
provides for an appeal to the Governor in
Council from decisions of the Board on
questions of jurisdiction, of law and, indeed,
of fact. That is in keeping with sound principles of responsible government. The Government, responsible to Parliament, cannot
and should not relinquish its final control
over the conduct of public affairs.
I shall study this bill carefully. If it is in
keeping with the principles embodied in the
Canadian National Railway Act, I am all for
it. But I want to go on record as objecting
to the suggestion that once a corporation of
this kind is created and its management
appointed, the minister te whom it must
report is no longer responsible for the administration of its affairs. No minister should
exercise any political influence in the administration of a government-owned company,
but he cannot divest himself of his responsibility to the elected representatives of the
people. I am in faveur of government ownership of certain public utilities, but I am
opposed to Parliament or the Government
delegating its responsibility to an irresponsible
party.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honjourable senators, I do not think I need reply to my
honourable friend who bas just taken his
seat. In dealing with this bill we are not
concerned with the Railway Act or the Board
Last session
of Transport Commissioners.
we passed an Act giving power to the Minister
to take over all air lines in Canada, and that
is what this bill is intended to do by providing the necessary capital.
There are one or two things that we should
recognize we are doing if we pass this bill.
First of all, *wie are forming a governmentowned air-line system. That is apparently the
policy of the Government, and there should be
no misunderstanding about it. This bill is
simply for the purpose of giving the Government money to carry out that policy. If we
do not pass the bill the Government will not
be able to give effect to that policy, simply
because there will be no money to finance it.
I do net think you will find much difference
of opinion among the peuple of Canda over
the question of international arrangements for
air services being made by the Government.
What, in my judgment, our people are perturbed about is the -fact that this bill is not
only for the purpose of starting new lines, but

NOVEMBER 13, 1945
will also enable the Government to take over
lines now operated by private corporations.
There ils a feeling thro'ughout the country that
that is flot a proper policy.
Let me ask honeurable members te recaîl
w&iat happened somre years ago when people
began transporting goods by motor trucks.
.The owners of those trucks organized autometive transportation cempanies, and after those
comipaflies got going it was said that the railway companies should have been first in the
field and macle highway transportation part of
their business. There was 'bitter criticism, cd
both the Canadian Pacifie and the Canadian
National because they had not foreseen that
development. When air transportation 'became fleasible the Government established
Trans-Canada Air Lines and put the corpora.tion under the Canadian National Railways
for operating purposes. The Canadian Pacifie
Railiway Comupany bought out branch air lines
as feeders to their main lines of rail.way. With
tha't policy I agree entirely. It bas met the
condition in air transportation thut the railway comfpanies should have met in highw-ay
But now the Government
transportation.
cornes along with legislation for the puxipose
of providing tihe neceesary cald'tal to take over
alil private air-line comýpanies. I object to
th-at policy. Il do not think it is fair. It is
catering positively to socialism; it is socialistic
legisiation od the rankest kind. Socialists could
do ne better in that kind of legislation if they
were in control of Parliament tomerrow. They
would not have a "t" to cross or an "V"to dot
legisiation for the
i. cepying. this socil
purpose of controlling all air transportation in
this country. Last June the electorate did net
vote for socialism; they voted for anything
but that.
As to government ownership, it diid not
make much difference in the ioperation cf the
post office, it did not 3nake much difference
to street railway transportation in some of our .
cities and towns; but now government ownerdiip lis a big question. Take the HydroElectrie Power Commission of Ontario, what
taxes does it pay? Take the Hydro-Electric
Commission of Manitoba, what taxe@ does
it pay?
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: It ils al.l wro ng.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: What taxes does the
Montreal Liglit, Hleat and Power Company
pay? I do not know the exact figure, but I
understand it is about $9,000,000. We are
night on the samne line here again. My hionourable friend a few minutes ago saidl that
the directors of the Canadian National
Railways were not subject to political control.
I am not suggesting they are, but I am suggesting that every time the Government of

231

Canada steps in and makes a corporation a
goveinment institution, it thereby cuts off
taxes fromn that source and leaves that much
greater load on other people.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Is there flot the samne
chance of their making profits to compensate
for that? As a matter of fact they do make
profits.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Our experience has not
been encouraging along that line. I have a
good memory, and 1 can recaîl those uxihappy
years when the Canadian National Railways
showed terrific operating losses. I remember
when in 1936, under legisiation passed that
session, the present Prime Minister changed
the management of the Canadian National
Railways and put in directors, ail of whom
were supporters of his Government: flot a
single member of any opposition party was
allowed on the board. -and 1 do not think
there bas been one since.
I fear the loss of taxation and the unfair
competition which this bill involves. Take
MY own City of Winnipeg. The Winnipeg
Street llailwav Company owns power sites
on the Winnipeg river. The city of Winnipeg
also owns power sites on the Winnipeg river.
The street 'railwav company has to pay taxes
on its sites, but the Winnipeg Hydro-Electrie
does nat 'pay a cent. True, the commission
this year made a net, profit of about $750,000,
and the commissioners paid part of those profits over to the city to help relieve taxation.
In that way the hydro-electric undertaking
paid taxes. But the C.C.F. in our city are
objecting most strenuously to that policy.
They say the Hydiro-Electric Commission ils a
government institution, so why should it pay
taxes. You have the thin edge of the, wedge
in this bill.
A similar discrimination prevails against
private companies engaged in the operation
of the grain trade in our western country. We
have co-operatives handling grain, and they
pay no taxes; but the elevator alongside of
them owned hy a private company pays taxes.
That is the situation. It may be politically
wise net te tax co-orperatives and government
institutions, but economicallly it is unwise and
unf air. The citv of Winnipeg cannot tax any
Dominion Government building. The Dominion Government bas increased its holdings in
Winnipeg, and everyone of them ils non-taxable. That is what confronts us in this country, and I believe this House should face up
to that situation. Our political opinions
should not prevent us from doing what is best
for the general. interest of Canada. If -government institutions paid the saine taxes as
do private institutions. my argument would
fail, but unfortunately they do flot.

232

SENATE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Do not taxes
come from the people anyway, either in the
cost of goods and services or directly? A
company does not pay its own money, it only
pays the money it gets from the cost of its
goods and services.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is a good question.
Suppose I put my money in so many shares
of stock of the C.P.R., and you put your
money in Dominion bonds. I pay taxes on
my stock, and then I pay income tax on my
dividends.
You pay income tax on your
interest. I am taxed twice; you only once.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Is the honourable senator
in favour of the public ownership of public
utilities?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I will answer the question. If you will tax publie utilities owned
by the Government the same as you tax
private utilities, then I do not care who owns
thern.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: If there is competition, so as to make it fair between the
two.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes. Where the Crown
corporation operates an air line, a railway or
a motor transport company, you are subsidizing competition at our expense. If I owned
stock in the C.P.R. I would resent most bitterly the fact that the people of Canada as
a whole were subsidizing competition by the
Canadian National Railways. If we tax the
Crown corporation the same as the C.P.R.,
I have nothing to say on that branch of the
case.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL:
Assuming the
C.P.R. Air Lines and the Trans-Canada Air
Lines both operate at a profit, we get 100
per cent of the profits from the Trans-Canada
Air Lines and only a percentage of the profits
from the C.P.R. Air Lines. Are not the
people of Canada better off than if both
(ompanies were privately owned and operated?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The only trouble is that
that has net been our experience. Experience
is a good teacher.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: The Trans-Canada
Air Linos showed a profit last year.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, during the war. But
take the years from 1930 to 1939 and see how
much we paid out to the C.N.R. and how
much the C.P.R. paid in. That is how to
get at it.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: If the privately-owned
competitor does not make any profit it does
not pay any taxes. It pays taxes only on its
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

profits. If the government-owned corporation
makes profits it turns them into the treasury
or expands its services.
Hon. Mr. EULER:
taxes to pay.

It

has its municipal

Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, they do not pay any.
The only trouble is this: when the C.P.R. or
any private company makes a loss the shareholders take the rap; but wien the C.N.R. or
the Trans-Canada Air Lines make a loss we
take the rap. If you recall the history of
the road for the last twenty-five years you
will ba surprised at the extent to which the
people of Canada have taken the rap.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: The people of Canada
are the shareholders, and they take the rap as
shareholders in privately owned corporations
do.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No. That false argument
has been used right along. Because the people
of Canada put in so much money, that is not
a fair criterion. The people of Canada as a
whole do not put in so much money, it is only
the taxpayers; the other peoplie do not put
in a nickel; and unfortunately many of the
taxpayers are in competition with their own
money. You are taking money from the taxpayer to put up competition against him, and
if there is a loss he takes the whole rap as
owner and the whole rap as taxpayer; 'he takes
it both coming and going. The theory is all
right if we bave profits for transportation
services such as we have had for the past five
years. Under such conditions the Canadian
National Railways can make a profit.
I do not wish to be a pessimist, but the war
is o-er and I want my honourable friends
on the other side of the House who believe
in this policy-I do not think all do-to watch
their dividends, even those they get from the
C.P.R., for the next five years. My judgment
is there will be no dividends, and we shall ba
back to the old loss systcm again, because our
railways have to face motor transport competit,ion, which they cannot meet. Then we
are goiag to spend millions on the St.
Lawrence waterway, which will provide more
competition for our railways; and so with air
lines. I do not believe the railway transportation companies will be able to show any
operating profits at all. We are building up
one of the very things that competes with
them. That is what I object to.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Would my honourable friend be prepared to see another TransCanada Air Lino operating in competition
with Trans-Canada Air Lines in view of
established Government policy?

NOVEMBER 13, 1945
Hon. Mr. HAIG: If they want to risk their
money, yes, let thern go to it. I have no
objection. That is good competition. If the
Governrnent line is ruii bettar it will get the
business; if the private line is rua better it
w11' get the business. Let them. hop to it.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Is it y.our contention that
govcrnmcnt-owned corporations should pay
taxes, as privately-owaed corporations do?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Absolutely, municipal,
provincial andL Dominion taxes.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Inoorne tax?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Regular corporation taxes.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That is on incorne. Would there be any profit?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: If I was sure these Government institutions would show a profit I
would say, "Fine." But the trouble is that
the records for the last twenity-five years are
not so rosy as that. I should like rny honourable friend to tell me how much we have
paid but for the C.N.IR. sinca 1921. It is
such au immense sum that the Goveraneut
had to pass legisiation to write it off.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Could you not say thaýt
the Hydro-owned property in Ontario lias
been of great benefit to the people of Ontario?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The Hydiro-owued property ia Manitoba pays no taxes.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Even in spite of that
has it not been, of great benefslt to the people?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is not shown. I do
know about the Montreal Light, Heat and
Power Company. Why should the people
of Canada subsidize the province of Quebec
to the extent of 59,000,000 through the provrncial Hydro taking over the Moutreal Light,
Heat and Power Company? I am, persuaded
that the people of Quebec have for ye-ars
heen subsidiizing the province of Ontario because its HycLro system paid no taxes.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: That question w*as neyer
raised outside of Quebec, wheu the Quebec
Hydro was in private hands and paid, taxes.
The shoe is now on the other foot.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That question lias been
raised by a good rnany of us. I arn oaa who
is always raising it. I have no objection to
goveranent-operated businesses, provided thty
are subjeet to the same taxation as private
enterprises.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: How can you take taxes
out of a corporation that is going behind

231ý

850,000,000 a year? There may he some systemi
by which it eau be done, but I do flot know
of it.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: It would mean
arnending the British North Arnerica Act.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, you would have to
showHon. Mr. FOSTER: 1 do not wish to interrupt the honourable gentleman, but on the
question of taxation I would like to ask him
if hie is in favour of the same priaciple of
taxing the co-operatives?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I wilýl answer that question,
because, if 1 do say sa myseif, we have some
very large ones in two or three of our prairie
provinces and 1 kuow a good deal about them.
The situation is this, the spread is so many
cents a bushel betweeu what is paid and
what the farmer gets by law. For instance, if
I arn a farmer and bring my wheat iu at
such and such a price the Goverument allows
me to take so much off for putting it through
the elevator, and sa much for other things.
However, the operator does not have ta charge
any set arnount; hie may even put it through
for nothing, and make no profit. In that
case there is nothing to tax. That is the
answer. But I say that argument has no
application. In England corporations of ail
kinds are taxed, co-operative and otherwise.
To illustrate the difficulty in taxing cooperatives, if a persan brings a load of wheat
to the elevator at Marquette the company
eau charge, we will say, two cents a bushel;
at the same time the pool elevator alongside
of it does not need to charge aaything at alI,
because the pool already has taken enough
out of the farmer to pay for the elevator.
However, that does not enter into the subI ect
at al.
I arn objecting to the establishment of
goverament, institutions that do not pay
municipal, provincial or Dominion taxes. That
is a wrong principle. If that practice persists
we will drif t into a socialisrn, the affect of
which would ha to do away with competition.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: That is not only true
from a co-operative point of view. If a
government-ownýed corporatin is taxable, and
has a deficit, the resuit is an increased burden
on the taxpayer of the country.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I know that. Let us get
to my frieud's owu city, and deal with the
Montreal Light, Heat and Power Compaay,
which has $9,000,000 of taxes.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: About that.

234

SENATE

Hon. Mr. HAIG: We will say $9,000,000.
The people of Montreal would have to pay
more for their light, heat and power, and the
people of Canada generally would get
$9,000,000 that they do not now get. The
same thing applies to Ontario, and the people
of Quebec have always complained about it.
It is a criticism with which I agree.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Would the honourable
senator please answer a question?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I seem to be getting a
lot of questions from the other side; I must
be touching somebody's heart.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I should like the
honourable senator to clear up some doubts
in my mind. I have always been under the
impression that the Canadian National Railway did pay taxes at the municipal level.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: My assumption would
be that the Trans-Canada Air Lines would
do the same thing.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I do not think the Canadian National pays taxes.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Municipal taxes.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Very, very little.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Not in Halifax.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Did my honourable
friend say that taxes should be paid on all
municipal property?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Then the church should
be included.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I did not say the church.
I would say that that is not a criterion.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: They pay on the
ground.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Everything of a
commercial nature.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Government buildings
and railways do not pay taxes.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: As I was trying to
say, my impression was that Crown-owned
companies, such as the Canadian National
and, I assume, T.C.A., do pay taxes in the
province of Ontario at the municipal level.
Property in municipalities in the province of
Ontario, which is owned directly in the right
of the Crown, is not assessed and consequently does not pay taxes at municipal or
any other level.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is all governed by
provincial legislation. I do not think in the
province of Manitoba the Crown pays any
taxes at aIl.
Hon. Mr. VIEN.

Hon. Mr. BENCH: I think it is fundamental under the British North America Act.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No municipal taxes are
levied by provincial government legislation
by reason ofHon. Mr. VIEN: Federal taxation is covered in Section 125 of the B.N.A. Act, which
reads as follows:
No lands or property belonging to Canada or
any province shall be liable to taxation.
That is the B.N.A. Act.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: They are not liable to
taxation. As a matter of fact, that is only
a red herring in this issue.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh!
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The issue is that Government institutions do not pay taxes. If I
were a socialist I would holler my head off
for this bill. But I am not a socialist, and
I do not believe in socialism. I believe in
free enterprise and fair competition. That is
why I ask that Government institutions pay
the same taxes, municipal, provincial and
federal as do private corporations.
Now I have something else to say, but I
am not sure whether I should bring it up
now.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: You might as weIl.
This is committee of the whole,
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I read in a newspaper
report the other day that Mr. Symington had
made the remark that R.C.A.F. personnel who
flew the big bombers overseas were not qualiflied to fly T.C.A. planes. That is the bunk!
He knows it is the bunki Those flyers went
through an ordeal that no other men have
ever gone through.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Is my honourable
friend aware of the fact that there are many
R.C.A.F. pilots flying Trans-Canada planes
today?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, but I am referring
to what this gentleman said-a pal of your
friend Mr. Howe; they are like two peas in
a pod. Mr. Symington cannot get away with
that statement. He has plenty of friends in
this House who can answer for him. He
had no right to say any such thing about
R.C.A.F. men, especially the men who flew
big bombers and made twenty, thirty and
forty trips over Berlin, Dresden and Cologne,
dropping six tons of bombs. Are we to be
told that those men do not know what they
are doing and cannot handle their machines?
Make no mistake about it, that is the bunkl
This is a much more serious matter than anything else I have said today.

tNOVEMBER 13, 1945
Hon. Mr. VIEN: My honourable friendHon. Mr. HAIG: I arn going Vo finish ie
now, so please don't interrupt me. 1 do not
want, any official like Symington making such
a statement. If Mr. Howe wants Vo make
a statemenV like that, he enu do eo, but a
man drawing a salary from, the people of
Canada has no right to make euch an attack
on our young men who wenV through a

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: What wae the

Hon. Mr. HAIG: IV was something Mr.
Symington said that appoared in the pros.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: Would my honourable friend say that a man who piloted a
bomber ehould operate a passengor plane
without being testeýd?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I will answer that question
too. Firet lot us Vake a typical young man:
hie joins up at eighteen, je rained Vo be a

fact is that they -are.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: He &id not say that, and
that ie what I arn oibjecting Vo.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: May 1 mako an
interjection that I t}ïink wfl lead to something more conclusive than this hypothetical
discussion on the qualification of pilots. Officers
ci Trans-Canada Air Linos could aýppoar before
the Committeo on Railways, Telegraphs and
Harbours, where 1 should hope that the hionoureable gentleman would have an opportunity
to get a full oxplanation as to what was or was

Hon. Mr. HARDY: Whiat has that Vo do

Hon. Mr. HAIG: It has a good deal Vo

Now, Jet me go on. My honourable fqiond

1 uncLerstoo>d him, that hie was opposed Vo
Governiment interference in the management

these ventures on which the people's money is

spent should be subject to eur approval. The
procedure that is proposed' here was not followed prior to the war. I agree with the
charge that was made in the other House,
that the Goïernment believes it should continue to govern by Order in Council. This
bill is another instance of that bad practice
of depriving Parliament of control and placing it in the hands of a minister or the
Governor in Couneil.
Hon. Mr. LEGER:
evading its obligations.

And Parliament is

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Correct. I know that
officers of the company can be called before
a committee and asked questions, and I also
know that if another party came into power
this whole legislation might be changed. But
that is no answer to my point that these
expenditures should be laid before Parliament
for our approval. It was not possible for
Parliament to examine the gigantic expenditurcs that had to be made during the war,
but the war is now over.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Would my honourable friend suggest that Parliament ought
to decide how many planes should be built
and; put into operation? Would he suggest
thati Parliament manage, this governmentowned corporation?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I think we should have
estimiates covering the company's proposed
operations.
I wonder what is making honourable members opposite so uneasy today. Is it an
uneasy conscience?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I should like to ask
the honourable gentleman a question.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Go ahead and ask it.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL:
The honourable
gentleman bas not answered me yet.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Would be suggest
that if the Government is to stay in the air
transportation business the operations should
be carried on through a department of Government-just as the Post Office, for instance,
is carried on; through a department of Government-in order that Parliament might review
the estimates and thereby exercise a more
direct control than is possible when the. operations are carried on by a Crown company?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No. The Post Office
Department estimates are laid before Parliament, and through them we are informed what
the department intends to do during the year.
The Department of National Defence brings
down its estimates-and it bas had a difficult
time getting some of them through. Alil other
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

departments likewise submit their estimates
for approval. I want the estimates of this
corporation, so that we may have some control
over it. The eompany may spend $5,000,000
on a certain project and suffer a loss of
$100,000. Perhaps it could make good the loss
by charging high fees for postal transportation. We ought to know how it is being run
and what progress, if any, was made in the
past year. That is the kind of information
given in the business world. If I am the
managing direetor of a company I give the
directors a report on what the company did
during the preceding year and what it proposes
to do next year.
Hon. Mr. EULER: The Canadian National
Railways, for instance, make a report to
Parliament every year.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, they make a report,
but Parliament bas no control over their
expenditures. They put up a beautiful
building in the city of Winnipeg, at a cost of
how much I do not know. Our money was
being spent, but we had no control over it.
Of course, the Canadian National is now an
established institution, and there may be some
justification for continuing the practice that
las grown up with respect to it. But these
air lines are a new venture, and their estimates
should be laidi before us every year for
approval.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: My honourable
friend bas the privilege of questioning the
offleers as to how the $25,000,000 will be spent.
I have no doubt they will be able to explain
why that sum is required.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, we have a right to
question the officers, but I want more than
that. Suppose that after they have told us of
their plans for next year I think a certain thing
should net be done, what control have I got
over that?
Hon. Mr. EULER: You can vote against it.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It will not come beifore us.
Hon. Mr. EULER: It is before us now.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Once we pass the bill we
have no control over the expenditure of
$25,000,000, and the company will not make a
further application .to Parliament until that
money runs out. Then they will be back asking
for more, saying that they lost half a million
on British traffic, half a million on United
States traffic, that a million was lost on a
route te some other country, and so on. It
wilil be too late then to do anything about it.
I object to this kind of legislation, which
deprives Parliament of control over the
expenditure of public money.

NOVEMBER 13, 1945
I seem to have aroused more interest on
the Government side than on this side of the
House. Honourable members over here must
have been satisfied with what I said. I do
not recail a question having been asked even
from the left-hand corner over here.
Hon. Mr. HOWDEN: I understood the
honourable gentleman to say that the Government had no control over the expenditure
of money by the Canadian National Railways. My recollection is that every year
the Government brings in a money bill to
meet requirements of those lines.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Not in the last twó years.
Hon. Mr. HOWDEN: I do not know about
that, but I was chairman of a committee in
another place when appropriation bills for the
Canadian National Railways were passed
annualiy.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: That was when the company was losing $50,000,000 a year, but lately
it bas been making a profit and has not
needed financial assistance. The honourable
gentleman is a young man yet and will live
long enough te see such bills before Parliament again. If I am here at the time I
shall call his attention to them.
The biH before us is a radical piece of
legislation, and I am sorry the Government
has pressed it. I admit it is in line with Government policy, but I think the policy is
wrong. The Governrnent is giving way to
an urge that is not justified under present
conditions in our country. We have been on
a spending spree for five or six years. I am
not objecting to what we did during'the war.
If we faced the same conditions again I
should probably keep my criticism to myself, just as I did in recent sessions. But,
believe me, this will not be such a happy
House two years from now, or three years
at the latest. There will be no voting of
$25,000,000 in one bill then. I may not be
here at that time, but if I am I certainly shall
call the attention of my honourable friends
to the fact that we are no longer approving
of the expenditure of $25,000,000 in a single
vote. There will be troubles ahead te keep
us occupied, and we shall not be going into
a venture of this kind.
We cannot do everything that can be done
by the great United States, the wealthiest
country in the world. Great Britain is there
now looking for money, and Russia will be
there for a similar purpose in a few weeks.
In making expenditures on the same scale as
the United States we are simply riding
towards disaster. We ought to think about
that before we go too far. We members of
the Senate do not have to go to the people

for election, so we can say what we think
is in the best interests of our country. I
have no objection te the general policy of
having Trans-Canada Air Lines operate over
the main routes, but I do object to these
speculative routes which are at best only
feeders. If private enterprise wants te run
lines into northern territories, let it do so.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: There is nothing
in this bill to force any line to sell to TransCanada.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: But my honourable friend
knows the Government can take over any
line.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: No, except any
that is under railway operation.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Those are the only ones
now -worth anything. No man could start a
new air line today, for he could not finance it.
If two or three young airmen back from overses wanted to operate an air line into the
northern parts of Quebec or Alberta or British
Columbia they coulid not get the necessary
capital. Under present conditions nobody in
his senses would lend them a nickel, so in fact
there is an end to ail competition.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: I would inform
the honourable gentleman that the board now
has applications from small companies that
wish to operate from British Columbia into
Alberta.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: May I ask a
question of the sponsor of this bill (Hon. Mr.
Campbedl)? The Canadian Pacifie Railway
always operates everything under its management with great efficiency. Supposing it desired to go into the air transportation business
on a much larger scale than at present, could
it get a licence?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: The Aeronautics
Act requires any company controlled by a
railway to divest itself of its airways interests
within six months after the cessation of hostilities, but the shareholders could take over those
interests by acquiring the shares.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: But the C.P.R.
could not.
Hon. Mr. CA'MPBELL: Any company
engaged in railway transportation cannot control or own the shares of a company engaged
in transportation by air.

That

sounds

Hon. T. A. CRERAR: Honourable senators, I am under the impression that a good
deal of the discussion of my honourable friend
who has the honour of leading on the other
side (Hon. Mr. Haig) was entirely unrelated
to the purpose of this bill.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, no.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I have not made a
very close study of the bill, but I am quite
sure that its purpose is not related to the
acquisition of competing lines in Canada at all.
In fact the Minister in the other place who
had charge of piloting the measure through its
initial stages expressly stated that it was not
the intention to use any of its powers for the
purpose of acquiring Canadian Pacific Air
Lines.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The Act passed last year,
coupled with this bill, gives that power. That
is the answer.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: No.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Sure it is.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: The Minister having
made that declaration from his place in
Parliament, it should be accepted. The sole
purpose of this bill is to make provision for
the development of international air lines
under Canadian control.
Is there no relation
Hon. Mr. QUINN:
between this bill and the Act of last year?
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: The capital of the
company is to be increased from $5,000,000 to
$25,000,000, and power is granted to create
subsidiary companies-for example, a conpany for the purpose of operating an air route
from Canada to Great Britain; another, for
the development of an air route to the West
Indies and South America. As I understand
it, the purpose of the bill is to enable subsidiary corporations to be set up to carry on
these particular operations. That, presumably,
is necessary because a corporation operating
an air service from Montreal, say, to Buenos
Aires might have to enter into arrangements
with several foreign governments. It is neither
necessary nor advisable that Trans-Canada Air
Lines should do this, and consequently it is
sought, through the creation of subsidiary conpanies, to get the requisite powers te extend
Canada's international air services. There may
be a question as to the wisdorn of our venturing into these fields at the present time, but
in all the criticism of the proposal that I have
heard or read, there appears to be general
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL.

agreement that Canadia should take this course.
That being so, it seerms to me that this is a
sound measure to achieve that purpose.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Who would control the
decision as to the advisability of establishing
those international air lines? Would it be
government officials?
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: The operating company would require approval of the Government before it started an international air
line.
Hon. Mr. DUFF:
ment officials?
Hon. Mr. HAIG:

Does that mean governNo, the Minister.

Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I think I am correct
in saying that it would require approval by
Order in Council. There is the additional safeguard, that whatever is done by the operating
company must be reported to Parliament, must
be scrutinized by a committee of Parliament,
and the necessary money for operating purposes must be ifurnished by Parliament.
Is that provided in the

Hon. Mr. CRERAR: The safeguards are
ample. The wisdom of the expansion may be
debatable, but if we are agreed that Canada's
position in the world is such that she should
develop ber international air services in keeping with similar developments of other
nations, then it seems to me this is a reasonable way of doing it. To come back again
to the question of acquiring independent
lines in Canada, I am sure that is not contemplated under this legislation. In fact there
was an express statement to that effect by the
Minister during the discussion in the other
House. There may be a question as to the
wisdom of the divesting orders that were
passed last year. But that is another matter
altogether so far as this bill is concerned.
This legislation has nothing whatever to do
with divesting orders, and if that were the
subject under consideration I might find myself a little more in agreement with the

NOVEMBER 13, 1945
honourabie leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig).
In rny opinion this measure is in the public
interest and provides ail the safeguards necessary to protect the public fundle; and if
through its administration there is developed
only a substantial degree cf the success th-at
has attended the developrnent of TransCanada Air Lines, then Canada wiIl have every
reason to be proud of the development. I
take some pride in the successful development
of Trans-Canada Air Lines. I venture to say
there is no competing air service anywhere
on the North American continent superior to
that provided by Trans-Canada Air Lines,
andSome hion. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: -as a patriotic Canadian I confess to feeling a good deal of pride
in the development cf this very successful air
service.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Question!
Hon. J. J. BENCH: Honourable senators,
on the point raised by the honouýratble leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) regarding the element of control by Parliament in a situation
of this kind, I rise to observe very briefly that
I entertain soine concern ýabout the growing
tendency to administer Government aif airs
through the -agency of Crn corporations. It
seems to me that the dangers which may be
inherent in this practice are coneiderably aggravated when you find a new growth of it in
developing subsidiaries of Crown coriporations.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: What I have to say is
not particularly related to criticismn of this
bill. I arn dealing with the general principles
involved. It lias been suggested that Parliament does retain soine elernent of control
over annual appropriations for carrying on
operations of this kind. However. as regards
providing capital for a Crown corporation it
does seem to me that once Parliament has
passed the measure and has made the money
available for its administration, there is no
effective subsequent control of the expenditure of that monev.
I suggest that this practice of governingshall I say?-through Crown companies is one
which saine day might well occupy the attention of the Senate in an attempt to work out
somne meanis by which Parliainent may exercise more direct control over not only the disposition of the capital provided but also the
company's operations.
I rose, perhaps improperly, during the
remarks of the honourable leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Haig) to draw his attention ta the
circumstance that the Goverument doe
47704-17

239

operate a very large business through the
Post Office Departrnent, for which the Postmaster General is the responsible Minister,
and that ail postal operations are from day
to day subi ect to review by the representatives of the people in this and the other place.
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators. I should not like to endorse
this bill without expressing in a general way
my views on the principles involved. It seems
to me that the virtue of the forms of government in vogue in Canada varies in proportion
to their closeness to the public. I believe that
our best form of izovernment is to be found
in our municipal councils, the members of
whie)h are elected annuallv to conduot their
business within view of those who eleet them.
Perhaps the next best forai of goverument is
in the provincial field, which cornes somewhat
dloser to the people than the federal field.
Last in order I would place the Dominion
government. But I would say quite definitely
that the very worst kind of government we
have is that carried on by sornewhat irresponsible boards and commissions and by Crown
companies accountable apparently to nobody.
To that extent I heartily agree with the statements made by the honourable leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Haig) in regard to this bill.
As the honourable gentleman from Lincoln
(Hon. Mr. Bench) has stated, the time wilI
corne when the Senate must examine very
carefully this growing tendency to erect
screens and barriers between responsible ministers of the Crown and the public business
which. has to be carried on. At the presen-t
moment there may be reasons why this bull
should pass, and I arn only stating rny objection to the general principles involved, principles which I do not like. I would far rather
sec these enterprises controlled by a department of government, as is the Post Office,
th-an leave thern in thec hands of mere
appointees whosc detail management is
beyond the control aud -outside of the observation of the elected representatives of the
people.
I do not think I shall vote against the bill,
for I can see somne special reasons why this
particular business rnight better be organized
in this way; but if I do support the bill, it
wil'l 16e with this reservation, that I do not
like the principles involved, and that rny
action on it may not be urged as a precedent
for my support of other bills of a similar
character. No doubt in committee argument
will be presented to justify this method of
proceeding.
Because of the debate that has taken place
with iegard to the payrnent of taxes by
Crowu enterprises, I should like to make a

ENviBm Enmox

SENATE
further observation. The Ontario HydroElectrie was used as an illustration. It is
some years since I have had anything to do
with the management of the Ontario HydroElectric enterprise, but at one time I was very
familiar with its operations. My knowledge
of Hydro in the province of Ontario is that
it does pay municipal taxes-not on the same
basis as everyone else, but on land values.
That is an important reservation.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I ask the honourable gentleman if that kind of taxation is not
governed by the province?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Oh, yes. The
liability of Ontario Hydro to pay municipal
taxes is governed by provincial legislation.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is what I mean.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Furthermore, Ontario
Hydro does make grants to municipalities in
lieu of taxation. Whether the municipalities
actually assess the structures erected by Hydro
I am not very clear. It would not make
much difference, because the value of those
structures is a matter of public record.
Let us consider what would happen if Hydro
in Ontario was made subject to taxation in the
same way as small business enterprises. First,
observe that Hydro pays no taxes. It collects
money and pays it over as taxes; but the
real taxpayers are those who use the hydro
service and pay for it. The province of
Ontario has built a power plant at Niagara
Falls costing many many millions of dollars.
The proposition that Hydro pays taxes
amounts to this: it may collect money from
a big consumer like the city of Toronto and
hand it over to tire municipality of Niagara
Falls in proportion to the value of properties
erected by Hydro in that municipality. If
Hydro was subject to the regular assessment
and paid taxes to the municipality of Stamford,-which is the township in which the
plant is located-the property owners of the
township of Stamford would pay no taxes.
They could have a bonus from their council
every year. Obviously, to have the regular
assessment is impractical.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
Does the Hydro of
Ontario pay taxes to the Dominion Government?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: No.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Private corporations do?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Private corporations
do, yes. There is this difference. The private
corporations are in business for the purpose
of making money for themselves; Hydro
operates for the purpose of giving service to
the people who pay taxes to the Dominion
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK.

Government. The people from whom the
Dominion Government gets the money are
the same people who enjoy the services of
Hydro.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No. In ManitobaHon. Mr. ROEBUCK: You are saying
that the people in Manitoba who contribute
to the Dominion Government do not enjoy
the services of Hydro in Ontario?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: But the people of
Manitoba can organize a hydro commission
whenever they so wish, and put themselves
in the sane position as the people in the
province of Ontario.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: And in the province
of Quebec.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: The city of Winnipeg has one of the finest publie service
power-generating establishments in the world.
However that city does not supply power in
the same general way as we do in Ontario.
We supply electricity to farmers all over the
province, and I hope the time wil1 come when
we will supply more and more farmers with
power. The power that goes to Winnipeg is
used almost entirely in Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No. I am very sorry,
but you are wrong. We have a very extensive hydro system in the province of Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK:: It is not anything
like as extensive as the Ontario Hydro.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: In proportion to population, yes.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK:
I am, speaking
only of my personal knowledge. The general
principle is that the people in Ontario who
contribute to the Government of Canada are
the people who enjoy the Hydro benefits; and
if you tax the Commission you merely increase
the rate to the consumers. It is an advantage to leave these great public concerns
untaxed, and free to give such excellent
service as the Ontario Hydro-El'ectric Power
Commission provides.
The suggestion that Hydro pays no taxes
should not go unanswered. Hydro does pay
taxes. So far as public ownership is concerned, it seems to me that the dividing line
is this. If a concern can do business withrout
special privleges, without a franchise that al]
cannot enjoy, and without the use of public
property, then it is private enterprise and
should not be taken over by the government but should be left to compete in the
open market. On the other hand, if an
institution comes to the government and re-

NOVEMBER 13, 1945
quires specia.l privileges that ali do flot enjoy,
and the use of public propertyý, then, it is a
public business and, should be run by the
government. I -arn in favour of the public
operation of railways, because-to run a railway
requires special privileges. That is the reason
I arn not in favour of the government manufacture of bcots and shoes, exeepb as an
emjergency measure, and arn in favour of
making air lines publicly owned and pu'blicly
eontrolled. For then competition, is impossible. For ail practical purposes only so
many planes can land at one, time. It woul
be unwise for every littie company that owns
two or three planes to have its own landing
field. I order to give the service that will
be required, it is necessary that air lines be
operated by the public. I arn in favour of
public ownership of these air transport lines
because, in the very nature of things, air
transport is as much a monopoly as is the
Post Office.. For these reasons, honourable
senators, I arn in favour of this bill.

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. J. BENCH moved the second reading of Bull B4, an Act to incorporate Canadian
National Slovak Benefit Society.
sorne
He said: Honourable senators,
explanation as to the purpose of this bill may
be desirable. The bill is to incorporate under
federal authority a fraternal. beniefit, association to be known as Canadian National
Slovak Benefit Society. Under ,ection 4 of
the bil it is proposed that the society have
power to establish, maintain and administer
accident and death. benefit funds, and that it
be authorized to carry on certain educational
and cultural activities among its members.
The rest of the bill, as I recall it, has to do
with the governing of the organization and
the control of expenditure of its funds, provisions whieh are common to legîslation of
this nature.
It is proposed that the new society, if
incorporated pursuant to this bull, shail take
over the existing Ontario organization, known
as National Slovak Mutual Benefit Society.
I arn advised that the new society wiil have
federal scope, so that it can do business in
any province in Canada, and will corne under
the proviions of the Canadian and British
47704-17J

Insurance Companies Act. I arn informed
also, though I cannot so certify, that the bill
has passed the scrutiny of the Superintendent
of Insurance, and is in order in other respects.
That is perhaps sufficient explanation,
except that I deern it my duty to inform. the
Senate that I have been advised by the
Assistant Deputy Minister of Transport that
one of His Maj esty's Crown cornpanies, the
Canadian National Railways, objects to the
title Canadian National Slovak Benefit
Society. I arn not quarrelling with that objection. I thîmk if I operated the Canadian
National Railways I should also object.
However, that is a feature that cau be dealt
with by the committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second tîme.

APPROPRIATION BILL No. 5
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 93, an Act for granting
to His Majesty certain sums of money for
the public service of the financial year ending
the 31st March, 1946.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall the
bill be read a second time?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: With leave of
the Senate, I would move second reading
now.
As I have explained to honourable senators
before, there are two appropriations. The
war appropriation, amounting to approximately two months supply, was asked for and
granted about a month ago, and I am advised
that no further action will be necessary under
that head until about the end of the month.
The bill before us provides for interim supply
of S29,769,000, which is one-twelfth of the
main estimates.
This sum is required to
meet obligations which will arise about the
middle of this month and to carry us through
to the middle of December. As I pointed
out before, $29,769,000 is not mathematically
one-twelfth of the total, which is something
over one billion dollars, but represents a balance, and is the same amount that was asked
for previously.
I move the second reading of the bill.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I am sure it is not the desire of this
Chamber to d-elay the passage of this bill;
but, speaking for myself and other honourable
members, I wish to give the Minister fair
notice that when the main estimates reach
this House we will require much more detailed
information than we were able to secure in
the war period. During that period the Minister frequently emphasized the fact that for
security reasons he could not give the information required, and naturally, because we did
not want to interfere with the war effort, we
could not press for it. But now, fortunately,
the war is over, and even though the War

NOVEMBER 14, 1945
Measures Act is still in existence I hope that
when the main estimates reach this Hanse the
Minister will nlot say that security reasons
prevent him fromn giving us the information
we seek.
I have in mind particularly what the honourable seinator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) said yesterday as to Crown companies. Parliament bas neyer had, any information to speak of regarding such companies.
I know that if the Minister were replying to
me now hie would say that a systematie
general accounting had been carried on-and
that may be so; but information regarding
these companies bas nlot reached Parliament.
Honourable senators will agree, I think, that
when the main estimates reacb this House
we should ask for a most searcbing investigation. We have passed a good many interim
supply bills recently. The first Budget to be
brought down has been partialy demolished.
I hope it will not be long before the real
Budget and the main estimates reach this
Huse, and I trust that then the leader of
the Government will give this Chamaber al
the information it desires.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I think the stand
taken by the bonourable senator fromn Aima
(Hon. Mr. Ballantyýne) is nlot at ail an
unreasonable one.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourabie
senators, when *shall this bill be read the
third time?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: With leave of
the Senate, I would move the third reading

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.
THE ROYAL ASSENT
The Honourable the Speaker informed the
Senate that hie had received a communication
from the Assistant Secretary to the Governor
General, acquainting bim that the Honourable
Patrick Kerwin, acting as Deputy Admimstrator, would proceed to the Senate Cbamber
at 5.50 p.m. this day for the purpose of giving

VISIT TO CANADA

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are called -I
should like to ask the bonourable leader of
the Government if he bas any information

about tbe visit to Canada of Prime Minister
Attlee of Great Britain, and especially about
the time be is e'xpected ta address Parliament.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
senators, I have no speciflo information. It
bas been in.timated that Mr. Attlee will likely
arrive in Ottawa during the week-end and
will probably address a joint session of both
Houses on Monday next. I am unable to
state the hour of the address. In the circumstances, it seems to me desirable that our
week-end adjournment sbouhd be until Monday afternoon at three a'clock.
WAR MEASURES ACT
ORDERS IN COUNCIL TABLED

Honourable
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
senators, I desire to 1.ay on the table copies
of Orders in Council passed under the War
Measures Act during the months of September
and October, 1945. Because of delays in
translation, the Frencb copies are not yet
available. It may be desirable, therefore, that
1 quote what was said about this in another
place by the Minister of Finance. I quote:
As I mentioned on November 2 when tabling
the Orders passed in July and August, the deiay
in this matter is due to the desire of the Government to table in botb languages simultaneonisly. However, due to heavy pressure of work
in the Bureau for Translations theire will be
somne further delay stili before a translation of
the present Orders will be available. Copies
in French will be tabled as soon as possible.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: If I am in order
I should like to ask tbe honourable leader
wbether be tan inform the House wben, the
Government will oease functioning under tbe
War Miessures Act; that is, wbeni may we
expeet the state of emergency to be declared

That, cf course, is p-ast history. I should like
to get a littie enligbtenmenit on what we may

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I bave no information that will enable me to, answer my
bon-ourable friend's inquiry. I will endeavour

SENATE

HONOURABLE SENATORS
AND GREEN
BIRTHDAY

DONNELLY

FELICITATIONS

On. the Orders of the Day:
Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
Before the Orders of the Day are called,
honourable senators, I should like to take the
cpportunity on behalf of not only honourable
members on this side of the House but, I am
sure, those on the other side, to extend felicitations to the honourable senator from South
Bruce (Hon. Mr. Donnielly) on this, his
seventy-ninth birthday. Were it not for the
official records, I think he would have considerable difficulty in convincing us that he is
about to enter upon his eightieth year. The increasing years weigh on him very lightly, and
I am sure that all honourable members,
irrespective of former political associations,
have nothing but the pleasantest recollection
of his kindly personality, and the greatest
admiration for the proud position which he
holds in the esteem of his colleagues. We
wish him long-continued prosperity and happiness, and hope that in the future, as in the
past, each year will find him younger in spirits
and appearance, if not in age.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I wish to join with the leader on the
other side (Hon. Mr. Robertson) in expressing
similar wisbes to my honourable friend from
Sou.th Bruce (Hon. Mr. Donnelly). We members who are younger in point of service,
especially those on this side, recognize him as
one of the fathers of the Senate. I think he
is now sccond in seniority on the list of members of this Chamber. He has been a great
credit to his calling as a farmer, he has been
a great credit to his own province of Ontario,
and he has been a grea.t credit to the Senate of
Canada.
Coming here from the House of
Commons, he has given freely of his wisdom
for the benefit of our country.
Hon. J. J. IiONNELLY: Honourable members, I fear that you will be getting weary of
the mention of my anniversaries, and will be
inclined to say, "Oh, another anniversary."
This is ,my birthday, and I am now starting on
my eightieth year. I am one of those who
consider that old age is to some extent a state
of mind, and I do not think it well to dwell
too much on the passing of the years. I have
tried to continue a sufficient number of business activities to keep my mind busy and
iprevent me from worrying too much about my
age. Considering that I have for thirty-two
years endured all the hardships that, as you
know, go with the life of a senator, I think my
physical condition is fairly good.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. DONNELLY:
I do not feel
competent to express an opinion on my mental
condition; I would leave that to my fellow
senators.
I heartily thank the gentlemen who made
the altogether too flattering remarks about my
efforts as a member of the Senate, and I thank
you all for your kindness on this occasion.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, I do not think we should
let the opportunity pass without recording the
fact that a similar honour falls to one other
very esteemed member of this House, the
honourable member from Kootenay (Hon. Mr.
Green).
Hon. Mr. HARDY:

The heaveniy twins.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Today he celebrates his eighty-fourth anniversary. Having
paid our respects to one younger member, we
will now extend our felicitations to anotherthere is a mere matter of four years between
them. On behalf of this side of the House I
would express our heartiest congratulations to
the honourable
senator from Kootenay,
coupled with the hope that he may retain
his youthful appearance and youthful spirit.
We wish him every happiness for the future.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, I want to thank a certain gentleman for
drawing my attention to the fact that another
of our members is today celebrating his birthday. The Canadian people are happy in having a good many Bob Greens in this country,
one of the very best of whom represents
the province of British Columbia in this
Chamber.
Personally I feel very kindly
towards the honourable senator, for during
nine years of my life in this Chamber I
have had the very great pleasure of having
him as room-mate-and when you have a
man as room-mate you get to know him
pretty well. He has been a father confesser
to me, and I want to take this opportunity
of again thanking him for the many great
kindnesses he did me as a young member in
this Chamber.
Hon. R. F. GREEN: Honourable members
of the Senate, I am deeply grateful for your
very kind references to myself and your hearty
felicitations on this, my birthday. I would
ask your indulgence for this very brief
acknowledgment, but my voice is unequal to
the strain of a more adequate reply. Again I
thank you.

The Honourable
Patrick
Kerwin, the
Deputy Administrator, having come and being seated at the foot of the Throne, and
the House of Commons having been summoned and being corne with their Speaker,

An Act ,respecting the appointment of Auditore
for National Railways.
An Act to amend the Department of National
Health and Welfare Act.
An Act to amend the Canadian National Railways Capital Revision Act, 1937.

Hon. Mr. FOSTER: Honourable senators,
on behalf of the leader of the Government, I
move that the Senate do now adjourn.

adjourned until tomorrow at 3 p.m.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: With leave of the
Senate, I desire to move that the name of the
Honourable Senator Howden be added to the
list of members composing the Standing
Committee on Divorce.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Honourable senators, I am very pleased with this motion,
because the appointment will give the Divorce
Committee enough members to divide into
two sections when necessary. When the
Committee sits on Mondays and Fridays
during recesses of the Senate it is almost
impossible to get an attendance of more than
a bare quorum. There are ten cases on the
Committee's docket for tomorrow. and unless
the Committee can divide into two sections
it will be almost impossible to finish this
work without sitting fron morning until
late in the evening. I therefore shall be very
glad to have the honourable senator frorn

additional member of the Committee.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes.
CANADA PRIZE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. WISHART MeL. ROBERTSON moved
the second reading of Bill 10, an Act to provide for a Prize Court and prize law in
Canada.

NOVEMBER 15, 1945
He said: Honourable members, I will ask
the honourable senator from Lincoln (Hon.
Mr. Bench) to explain this measure.
Hon. J. J. BENCH: Honourable senators,
the purpose of 'this bill is to establish a prize
court and to make applicable in Canada the
prize law in force in the United Kingdom as
of September 10, 1939. It would also give to
Canadian prize law as enunciated in certain
Orders in Council-passed, I understand, in
September 1939--the form of a statutory enactment which would replace those Orders in
Council.
As a member of the legal profession I may
observe that prize law is probably one of the
most ancient branches of our law, one of the
most difficult to understandHon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: -and probably even
more complex than our income tax legislation.
I have been able to make only a very inadequate study of tie subject, but I have made
myself familiar with the history of Canadian
jurisdiction, a statement of which might be
useful. Prior to 1934 the Exchequer Court
of Canada on its Admiralty side enjoyed
jurisdiction in matters of prize under Imperial
The Imperial statutes which
legislation.
governed were: first, the Colonial Courts of
Admiralty Act of 1890, which provided for
the creation of Colonial Courts of Admiralty
by the Dominion and certain Crown Colonies;
and, second, the Colonial Courts of Admiralty
Prize Act, 1894, which vested the Colonial
Courts of Admiralty with prize jurisdiction.
Under the authority of these two Imperial
statutes the Canadian Parliament in 1891
passed the Admiralty Act, whereby our Exchequer Court was constituted a Colonial
Court of Admiralty, and consequently acquired
jurisdiction in prize under the Imperial Statute
of 1894. That was the situation during the
war of 1914-18--our Exchequer Court exercised
jurisdiction in prize; but it dealt, I understand,
with only one or two cases. As a matter of
academic interest I may say that in the
appendix to a text by Meyers on the subject
of Admiralty Law and Practice in Canada,
published in 1916, there is a verbatim transcript of the proceedings in one of these cases.
I am told that transcript contains a concise
statement of the history of prize jurisdiction
in Canada as then constituted.
In 1931, as a result of the passage of the
Statute of Westminster, Canada achieved full
legislative authority in this and other matters,
and subsequently there was placed on our
statute books the* Admiralty Act of 1934.
Honourable senators who were then members
of this Chamber will recall that legislation.
47704-18

I understand that the Senate did the great
bulk of the work in connection with it, since
it was part of the programme arising out of
the revision of the Canada Shipping Act of
that year.
By the Admiralty Act of 1934 the Dominion
Act of 1891 whirh had constituted the Exchequer Court a Colonial Court of Admiralty
was repealed, and the Exchequer Court was
clothed with Admiralty jurisdiction solely
under Canadian law. But no provision was
made to confer on it jurisdiction in prize.
In the result, the Colonial Courts of Admiralty
Prize Act, 1894, ceased to be applicable in the
Canadian jurisdiction. Consequently, after
1934 Canada had an Admiralty Court but no
tribunal empowered to function in cases of
prize.
That situation was not considered important
until the outbreak of the Second World War
in 1939. Then, in the absence of legislation
conferring prize jurisdiction on the Exchequer
Court on its Admiralty side, the Government
found itself under the necessity of resorting to
orders in council to constitute the Exchequer
Court a prize court. I understand that pursuant to those orders in council, passed under
the provisions of the War Measures Act, the
Exchequer Court during the war just completed exercised prisze jurisdiction in some
twelve cases. None of these, I believe has been
disposed of finally. I think that is as accurate
and concise a statement as I can make of the
history of this legislation.
The present bill is generally intended to
incorporate into the statute law the temporary provisions made by Order in Council,
and to declare that the prize law of Canada
shall be that which obtained in the United
Kingdom on September 10, 1939.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Was it not so before?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I understand that it
was. As I have said, the only difference is
that between 1934 and 1939 we had no court
with jurisdiction in prize matters. To answer
the honourable senator more directly, I should
say that the purpose of the section in the
bill is simply to make more certain that the
prize law which obtained in the United Kingdom on September 10, 1939, shall be applicable
in Canada.
I am advised that prize law, as to which I
confess great ignorance, is international in its
character, but that there have been certain
statutory enactments by the Parliament of
Great Britain. The purpose of this bill, therefore, is to provide that the law applicable in
Canada shall be the law of the United Kingdom as of September 10, 1939.

248

SENATE

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Has that law been
codified?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I was about to say that
consideration was given to the question of
attempting by this bill to codify the prize
law which shoud be applicable to Canada.
However, because of the very ancient nature
of the law, its international character. and
the archaic language in which it is expressed,
it was feared that a codification would be
not only very difficult but might prejudicially affect the rights of persons under the
Common Law. It was thought that until
some occasion arose which would better
justify an attempt to put the law of prize
in Canada in statutory form, it would be
better to leave it to the Exchequer Court on
its Admiralty side to apply the old Mercantile Law as administered by the British Prize
Courts.
I have explained as best I can the purposes
and the underlying principle of this bill. I
may add that in the other House the bill
was read the second time, considered in Committee of the Whole and passed in one evening, after a comparatively short discussion.

surance exclusively; and second, that it will be
the only Canadian company writing that kind
of insurance exclusively. There are in Canada
two other companies doing this class of business exclusively, but both are branches of
American concerns.
I might say in passing that this class of
business has grown very large in the United
States. 'In [hat country the annual premium
income of purely accident insurance companies
is approximately half a billion dollars, whereas
in Canada it is only about eight and a half
million dollars. So there is a wide field for
development here.
I know the promoters of the bill. They are
people from the district in which I live, and
I have every confidence in them. Another
reason why I am particularly pleased to
sponsor the bill is that if it is accepted by
Parliament it will add one more to that
galaxy of insurance companies located in the
town of Waterloo-companies such as the
Mutual Life, the Dominion Life, the Equitable
Life and many others-which have made
Waterloo really the insurance capital of
Canada.

The motion was agreed to and the Bill
was read the second time.

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE:

THIRD READING

When shall this

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: With leave of
the Senate, I would move the third reading
now.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill. was
read the third time, and passed.

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. W. D. EULER moved the second reading of Bill F6, an Act to incorporate Canada
Health and Accident Assurance Corporation.
He said: Honourable senators, in contrast
to the bill just explained by my honourable
friend fro'm Lincoln (Hon. Mr. Bench), the
one which I hope to have read the second time
is simple indeed. Its whole purpose is explained in the title itself: an Act to incorporate Canada Health and Accident Assurance
Corporation.
The bill consists of eight short clauses covering a single page. While there are other companies in Canada which write health and accident insurance, they do so along with other
lines of insurance, such as life, etc. The company that seeks incorporation under the bill
before us is unique in two respects: first, that
it proposes to write health and accident inHon. Mr. BENCH.

Why are they all

Hon. Mr. EULER: Because it is a good
town.
I understand that the ordinary legal requirements have been complied with and that
the bill has the approval of the Superintendent
of Insurance.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I was going to ask the
honourable senator how much capital had to
be subscribed before the company could commence operations, but in view of his last
remark it is hardly worth while.
Hon. Mr. EULER: The authorized capital
is $500,000, and the amount that has to be
paid in before the company can do business
is $100,000.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Honourable Mr. Euler, the
Bill was referred to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. P. HOWDEN moved the second
reading of Bill G6, an Act to incorporate
Canadian Conference of the Mennonite Brethren Church of North America.

NOVEMBER 15, 1945
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose of this bill is to incorporate Henry S.
Voth, of the town of Winkler, Manitoba,
clergyman, and others, under the namne of
Ganadian Conference of the Mennonite Brethren Church of North America. The bill
providies that the head office of the corporation shell be at the city of Winnipeg, or at
such other place i Canada as may be decided
upon by the Corporation.
The other clauses of the bill follow the
provisions of ChapteT 57 of the S4atutes of
Canada, 1944-45, incorporating the Executive
Board of the Canada Conference of The
Evangelical Lutheran Augustana Synod of
North America.
If the bull is read a second, time I shaîl
move that it be referred to the Standing
Committee on Miscellanieous Private Bills,
before which the promoteris of the bill will
appear ta furnish any additional information
that may be required.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion Of Hon. MT. Howden, the Bill
was referred- to the Standing Commîttee on
Miscellaneous Private Bills.
GOLD PRODUCTION IN CANADA
DISCUSSION

The Senate resumed fromn Monday, November 12, the adjourned debate on the notice
of Hon. Mr. McRae:
That hie will eall the attention of the Senate
to the development of our gold resources, and
what an active programme to increase our gold
production could mean to the general prosperity
of Canada, particularly in the employment of
labour, the establishment of new communities
and the importance of gold in tak,ýilg care of
our fooeeign obligations.
Hon. SALTER A. HAYDEN: Honourabie
senators, I desire to speak for a few minutes
on tire subi eot of the gold mining industry in
Canada, and my remarks wili be strongly in
support of what was said by the bonourable
senator f rom Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae)
who brought this matter to the attention of
the Senate. He stated ciearly and vigorously
the importance of the gold mining industry to
this country and the problems confronting that
industry. At the risk of repetition I want to
mention somne of those probiems, and I do s0
because for at ieast ten years I bave had saine
lite experience with the industry and have
become aware of somne of its problems and
difficulties. Anyone acquainted with the history
of goid mining in Canada knows that usually
before a mine becomes a profitable producer
47704-18J

24U

it has to surmount many serious obstacles.
Most of our successful gold mines went througb
an eariy period that brought their promoters
disappointment, financiai loss and, in somie
instances, tragedy.
It has been said that goid is where you find
it. The probiem is to find it in a large area
with a smaîl instrument, a diamond drill.
Generally speaking the search is carried- on
by people Who know a good deal about
geology, and, when an ore de-posit is lacated it.s
value can be tested only through the proceas
of trial andi error. Large sums of money often
have to be spent before the promoters can
ascertain whether the quantity and quality of
ore wili justify the further expenditures neces,sary to reach a oommerciaily profitable
production stage. lI the course of doing that
the company usually expends ail its capital,
and may Eind it necessary to borrow money
when' deveiopment reaches a stage to require
the installation of a mill preparatory to the
mine going into production. That is the
picture of a new company. In most cases
when the mine is ready to corne into production the company lias exhausted its capital
and lias had to borrow moniey to finance
the last stage. That borrowed money constitutes a flrst charge upon the assets.
The industry it.self lias, I think, made a
great contribution to Canada. lI peacetime
the development of our northern country has
been to a great extent furthered by the
progress and development of our gold mining
industry, and undoubtedly the communities
estabiished as a result of gold mining operations and the search for gold. have contributed largely to the support and maintenance of farming and other developments,
ail leading to a general opening up of our
northern territory.
During the war the gold mining industry,
like many others, suffered severe restrictions.
Looking back, I think more wisdom might
have been exerci-sed in this respect in view of
the importance of the industry, and because
its contribution, I venture to say, even on the
restricted wartime basis, was one of the main
factors in preserving the financial and economic
stability of this country.
The short--sigbted policy,--I believe I arn
justified in sa terming it-was, flrst, the restriction on the bringing into production of
new mines; and, secondly, the restriction on
the use of available manpower, to the extent
that production in existing mines was curtailed.
According to well authenticated figures, gold
production in this country today is probably
onily 50 per cent of what it was at the
beginning of the war.

250

SENATE

As to the importance and value of the
industry to our national economy, I think it is
sufficient to say that there is general recognition of the fact that gold and the gold
mining industry are important to Canada.
Gold, because it provides us with a medium
for adjusting international balances, may be
described as a sort of ace in the hole which
has at all times put us on good dealing terrns
with other countries of the world. Gold also
is one of a number of our commodities that
requires no salesmanship; we can sell as much
of it as we can produce.
The policy of the Government with respect
to the disposition of gold is something on
which I do not intend to make any statement
today. All I care to say is that the contribution which the gold mining industry
made to Canada during the war could best
be estimated if we had available the figures
of the amount of gold which was transferred
and came annually into the hands of the
Foreign Exchange Control Board, and enabled
that board to deal with and adjust so favourably our financial relationship in foreign
exchange.
But dealing more with the taxwise situation of gold mining, I may point out that
until 1943 we had a provision in the Income
Tax Act under which new mines coming into
production might, for a period of three years
from the commencement of operations down
to 1943, operate without being subject to
income tax. That exemption periodi usually
amounted to three years and six months,
because the Income Tax Department permiitted a tuning-up time of six months. But,
he that giveth may also take away. and the
administration of that provision in relation to
depreciation and the charging of pre-development costs was such that the companies did
not get the full benefit that they might otherwise have gained by such provision. So far
as depreciation is concerned, the Income Tax
Department took the view that you might
charge what rate of depreciation you pleased
during this running-in period, but whatever
that rate was you had to charge the same rate
afterwards. Ultimately a rate of 15 per cent
on depreciation was agreed upon. If the
company also charged that rate of 15 per cent
on pre-development costs in the three years'
operations during which it was not subject
to income tax, it might charge off 524 per
cent fior pre-development costs. But the difficulty was that whether the company earned
enough money during those three years to
take care of the charge-off or write-off of the
depreciation and pre-development costs, it
had in any event to write them off to that
extent so far as income tax was concerned.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN.

That led to a number of results. One was
that these mining companies robbed their
stock piles of the richest ore they had se as
to try to run through and gain as much goId
as they could, diuring this period. It was not
the best way of dealing with the situation
from the point of view of continuity of operation, because at some stage the poorer grades
of ore had to be mined, and consequently the
companies had nothing with which to
"sweeten" up the poorer grades and maintain
constant mil-i-heads and annuai production.
In addition to the charging off of predevelopment costs, the Income Tax Department insisted, that the current development
costs during that three year period should be
charged, to expenses of the year. Honourable
members will see that what at first had
appeared a great advantage was in most cases
to a considerable extent whittled down by
these charges that in any event had to be
carried by the operations of the three years.
The other problem of these mining companies is depletion, because gold mining-and
I suppose there is a similar situation in othier
operations-is a one-crop operation.
You
get your gold out once, and it is gone forever.
So the question arises, what is a reasonable
charge for depletion allowance. I think the
depletion allowance which is permitted at the
present time is about 30 per cent for the conpany and- 20 per cent for the shareholder.
That is the percentage he may take off his
dividends. The Mining Institute and others
experienced in mining affairs, after a careful
study of this problem, have come to the
conclusion that the only fair and equitable
allowance for depletion, and, one which would
give some guarantee to investors ini gold
mines when they reached the stage of production, would be 50 per cent to the company
and 50 per cent to the shareholders. Even
on that basis it would take a considerable
period of time-the estimate is at least
twenty-five years-to enable the company to
return its original capital out of what would
be left of the depletion allowance, and also
permit the shareholder to get back his money.
What is the situation in respect to gold
mining today? During the war years those
who were interested in searching out and
developing
gold mining properties were
restricted in their efforts to bring those properties into production because they could not
obtain the machinery and equipment necessary for such purposes, and because the
required manpower was not available. As a
result we are finding that many properties
are only now at the point where they are
ready for the shaft sinking and the other
operations leading to the stage of production.

NOVEMBER 15, 1945
Today we have no statutory provision by
which gold mining companies may save their
profits from income tax, and write off predevelopment costs, depreciation and other
items of expense. In other words, gold mining companies today are subject. to the general income tax law the samne as any other
commercial concern.
I have read in the press that if certain
things happen in the near future it is expected
that mines coming into production after
January 1, 1M4, wilI be granted an exemption fromn excess profits tax. That may sound
like generous assistance to gold mining. But
let us for a moment analyze such an exemption and see what it means. I think we may
fairly assume that a new mine coming into
production in 1946 would earn flot more than
what miglit be regarded as a standard profit.
In any event, being a new mine, it might
be subj ect to more than the standard rate
of taxation in its first year of operation.
This means that a new mine would. be exempt
from the Excess Profits tax portion in our
standard incarme tax rate of 40 per cent,
otherwise 22 per cent. That might appear
to be a real concession, but we hope that
the Excess Profits tax as such is on its way
out, and that 1947 may see the end of that
taxing statute.
I thinc it can safely be assumed, in the light
of our finances in Canada and the require.
mentis of our national econoiny, th-at if and
when that 22 per cent so-called Exceas
Profits tax feature of our standard corporation
tax in our income tax rate of 40 per cent
disappears, the remaining 18 per cent will
certainly be stepped up te somne h.igher figure
so as to take up the slack in revenues produced
by the dropping -of the Excess Profits Tax
Act. In those circumstances the benefits confeoered by any propoeal of exemption unde-r the
Excess Profits Tax Act may not be very reai
and may not last very long. This industry,
partioularly the new mines at the stage of
coming into production, has exhausted iteîf.
Ne4w mines have worked themselves out in
their efforts to reach the stage of .producing.
They must now be allowed saime reasonable
opportunity to accumiulate working capital,
and to attain a position which wiil justify the
specul&tive-.minded public to continue their
participation and co-operation in the dievelopment of such mines in Canada. It is a kind
of venture ta which you. cannot alttract much
in the w.ay of what is called investment m-oney;
you must attract the speculative element that
is so inherent in humnan. nature. If ithat is to
be done the public must be given saime kind
of a run for its money. It is very well to talk

251

about the run for their money that people
get who dabble in the stock markets fromn day
te day; but that is just one phase of the
development of this whole question, and is
not at ail the most important one. I think
t.hat in the long run most people who play
at the business of mining in that way end
up .where they began. It is the sort of thing
that has a lure ab-out it, keeps leading one on,
and brings him. back again and again until he
finde himself without means.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Does my h7onourahle
friend speak fromn experience?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN:- From experience in
the broad sense of the word, yes; and as well
from observing the experiences of others. I
can sasure my honourable friend there are no
personal experiences.
Those who, are interested in the real development of the gold mining industry ini Canadaand I think we ail are-should take a longrange policy view which will lead to the
greateet possible development of the indsustry.
We ehould assist i every remedial way poesible, ta the end thât rwe can bring gola
production in Canada te as hîgh a plane as
possible. At ail times, in peace, and in wax,
ini good tiines and badt times, it is cee of the
most stable operationis that we have had and
that we can expect te have i Canada. It is
an industry that involves a very high percentage of labour employxnent. On the basis
of empicyment it makes great contributions
te the economic life and structure cf Canada.
I have read in the newspapers and have
heard rumours in the corridors that shortly
there will be a proposai te allow mining coinpanies ta write off a percentage, of their
expenditures in each year. I think the
amounit to be written off for exploration and
development is twentyrsix and two-thirds per
cent. That may sound like a great concession
ta the gold mining industry. But again Jet me
say that if it is administered in the way in
which the Income Tax Department has interpreted such allowances in the past, those
expenditures for exploration and development
will be confined to exploration and development work done by the companyr in relation
to the main operation which it is carrying on.
The only way in which you can, successfully
develop new mines and pick up the slack
which resuits from the depletion of existing
mines is by having a centinuous effort in the
field of prospecting, exploring and developing
new properties. Every company engaged in
the production of gold should have, shall we
cali it, an extra curricular activity, in the
sense that it carnies on exploration, prospecting and development upon properties beyond

252

SENATE

which it is immediately engaged in the production of gold. Unless the attitude of the
department changes, it may well be that the
costs of doing that particular work will not
be allowable as an item of expense in the
operations of the company in relation to its
production of gold.
This is a very large question, and I do not
think the gold mining industry is asking for
special favours. Rather, I think, the Canadian people in their own best interests should
see to it that the difficulties which are inherent in the bringing of mines into production
are recognized, and that assistance is given
to those new properties which will assure the
coming into production of the greatest number possible. In that way the results will
be to the benefit of the people of Canada.
I think that the inquiry on the order paper
is timely; I think the time the Senate has
spent in discussing this inquiry has been time
well spent. The question is of such importance that it might well justify our effort
towards the making of a special study and
survey of the gold mining industry, and
evolving certain definite resolutions aimed
at assisting and developing our mines.

some other instances, bonds were issued at a
very considerable discount and the money was
borrowed. The bonds were issued for a term
of five years, at the end of which the company had to pay off the bonds out of operation. Then, of course, the shareholders began
to receive dividends.
It is well to ask where the money comes
from. The money will only come from the
people who have faith in the gold mining
industry and who understand the business, or
from those who are speculatively inclined and
willing to take a chance on anything in the
hope that its value will go up and they will
make a little capital.
In the case I have cited the money came
from people who were prepared, on the basis
of what was blocked out, to gamble that it
could be transformed into productive operations from which they could realize the money
they had put up. Where financial assistance
comes from in every case I cannot tell you.
I would say that very often properties are
lost or abandoned because of failure to raise
funds, or because a reorganization takes place
and new groups come in with new ideas-and
with money.

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon Mr. LACASSE: Wili my honourable
friend allow me to ask one question? The
honourable senator bas said that when a
company bas exhausted its original capital
it goes on borrowing. May I ask where, or
from whom it borrows?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I have in mind a
situation in which one of the largest companies in Canada, I think, made an intensive
study of a property as far back as 1920. At
that time, in the light of their then knowledge
of gold recurrences, the property was turned
down. There were however some people who
had faith in it, and continued to pay the
taxes. I think there was a series of capital
reorganizations, and successively certain people who had lest the money they had put in it
disappeared. Finally, in the light of additional information, a new programme of
diamond drilling was worked out, and new
moneys were put into the company. Those
moneys were spent by the company, and the
property was brought to the stage where,
because of the ore that was blocked out, the
construction of a mill was considered justified.
At that stage the company did net have in
its treasury shares which it could issue and out
of which it might finance the construction of
a mill. The question then was whether it
should increase its capital and dilute the shareholdings of those who originally contributed
the moneys. In this particular case, and in

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I thank the honourable senator for having at last used the word
"gamble."

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN.

Hon. N. McL. PATERSON: Honourable
senators, I desire to associate myself with what
has been said in connection with the motion
by the honourable senator from Vancouver
(Hon. Mr. McRae). If you will bear with me
I should like to make a few remarks.
I am informed by a responsible official of
the Department of Mines that the returned
men formerly employed in surface work in
mining have returned to their jobs in the
normal way, but apparently those who had
worked underground are net returning until
they have exhausted every effort to find employment elsewhere. Those underground men
were the young, hardy and strong type, and
are difficult to replace. If we are to regain
our former position in gold production it may
be necessary to import foreign labour to fill
these vacancies.
Our highest output of gold was in 1941,
when we produced five and one-auarter million ounces, at a value of $206,000,000.
Last year our production dropped to less
than three million ounces, at a value of
$112,000.000. The figures 'are net yet available
for 1945, but they will likely show little
improvement. Increased production of gold
is very desirable: it takes the place of an

NOVEMBER 15, 1945
export; it adds purchasing power to the
nation; it makes for prosperity and acts as
a bulwark against depression.
I was interested to hear the leader opposite
utter a strone- warning against a possible
depression in the next few years. If honourable senators will have patience, I shall try
and express a few thoughts on that subject.
It has often been said that we have just
finished the most costly and destructive war in
history, a war that leaves Europe in chaos
and with the lowest standard of living ever
known, with millions of its population satisfied to have a chance to earn bread. There
is no thought there of beautification of cities.
The paramount thought is to get the rubble
cleared away and the waterworks operatingso that even the crudest sanitary arrangements may be made in order to avoid terrible
epidemics-and to get enough to est to keep
alive.
Let us compare the conditions in Europe
today with those of our own country. We
have the' highest standard of living in the
whole world, a statement which can be proven
by pointing to the per capita use or consumption of various things, such as bathroom
fittings, kilowatt hours of electricity, steel,
telephones and telephone calls, radios, automobiles, electric refrigerators, butter, beef,
wheat and sugar, and many other comforts
and conveniences. Past experience and common sense tell us that a low standard of
living in any country is dangerous and undesirable, and will eventually lead ta further
trouble. One change that must come about
is a moderate decline in our standards of
living and an improvement in the lot of
those less fortunate. Our taxes will gradually
lower our standards of living by taking
our luxury money away from us, but strikes
and work stoppages will lower them much
more quickly. High standards can be kept
up and improved only by high production.
In Canada it is important to keep in mind
two facts. Up to the time war broke out we
were considered mainly an agricultural country
with an over-production of field crops and
with surplus carry-overs. Wartime emergencies turned us into a manufacturing country,
and the percentage of our population of both
sexes who were steadily employed became
larger than ever before.
To attempt to keep both agriculture and
industry busy, we must export. To export,
we must find buyers with cash or credit.
Some countries have very little cash, and in
those credit can be established only through
goods or services produced by prospective
buyers.

253

Now I am getting close to the problem. If
the people in Europe get to work and become
properly organized, they can produce things
such as automobiles, electric refrigerators, and
radios cheaper than we can, because the cost
of labour is ninety-five per cent of all costs.
The other cost, which is the rental of money,
is the only one that is lower here now than it
was before the war. If the people of Europe
do manufacture goods and ship them here,
we dare not bar them out, for we must sell
our surplus agricultural products. Were we
to lose our foreign markets for wheat, our
position would be desperate.
Even if we can make synthetic rubber that
is as cheap and as good as raw rubber, we
have to import raw rubber, because we must
sell flour to Java. If Japan makes matches
for one cent per thousand and electrie light
globes for five cents each, we have to buy
them, because we must sell thern pulp and
paper. Our best customer for pulp and paper
at present is the United States,: but that
country will have to buy pulp from Norway
and Sweden almost right away so that the
Scandinavian countries can. pay their debts
and buy manufactured goods.
These are things for serious thought. We
are not in a new world, nor is this world very
much changed. Do not let anyone, tell you
we have a new era. We have the same
ambitions, the same selfishnesses, the same
narrow views and problems that there were
ten or twenty years ago. All you have to do
is to compare to-day's newspaper with one of
ten years ago to see that burglaries, auto
accidents, divorces and murders account for
about the same proportion of news now as
then.
All that I have said leads me to the point
I wish to make, and that is a solemn warning to labour leaders and others that theirs
is the responsibility to make room for
returned men, to maintain employment, and
to keep people in their jobs, which are their
best friends. With taxes as they are at present,
no one is going to get rich. A house that
costs $6,800 now could have been built before
the war for $4,800, but despite his larger
outlay the contractor of today makes less
profit.
We are approaching times of historic
moment, and no one can escape his responsibility to do his bit towards maintaining
industrial peace and high production. We
must pay our taxes with good will and be
prepared to accept a lower standard of living.
Or, rather, let us put it this way: we may
never have to go hungry or without clothing

254

SENATE

or educational facilities, but we may find it
necessary to forego some luxuries that we can
do without.
One of our greatest achievements was to
interest every class of citizen in bonds. Twothirds of Canada's population are today
capitalists in that they are part owners of
our great natural resources. In case of necessity they will be able to rely upon the savings
that they have put into bonds. This very
fact will keep our country upon an even keel,
for it will assure democratic government and
the development of natural resources. Thereby
the value behind our bonds will be maintained, and no small part of that value is in
our mineral resources.
On motion of Honourable Mr. Lacasse, the
debate was adjourned.

AIR MAIL SERVICE
INQUIRY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon, W. M. ASELTINE: Honourable
senators, I should like to draw the attention
of the Goverament ta the very unsatisfactory
air mail service that we are getting ini this
country. A good many members Of this

Chamber are two thousand or more miles
away from their offices, and it is nece.ssary ta
carry on correspondence with those offices by
air mail. Some of us believe that carrespondence whish is stamped- "Air Mail" and
paid for at the air mail rate is sent by the
ordinary routes. I will give you an example
of what takes place. A week ago Saturday
a report was forwarded ta me from Rosetown,
Saskatchewan, in an envelope marked "Air
Mail" and bearing the air mail postage, but
it did not arrive here in Ottawa unitil Wedneaday of the following week. A train leaving
Rosetown on Sunday morning connecta with
the air mail service, so the letter should have
arrived here on the Monday morning.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: May I ask the honourable senator if it was not reported bast week
that a number of planes were grounded?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: This condition is
not new; it bas existed for two years. I had
the same kind of experience last year. I arn
sending by air mail today an important letiter,
which I arn having properby stamped by the
postmaster downstairs. That better should be
ini my office in Rosetown by six o'clock
tamorrow evening; but it will not be there
until the next day, or possibly even the day
after that. Something is seriously wrong, and
I think the Government should investigate
ta find out just what it is. Does correspondence that is stamped for air mail go by railroad in the ordinary way, or by plane? Are
the planes overloaded and, unable ta carry alb
the mail? Just what is wrong? I have
spoken ta m'any people who have experienced simibar delays, and I am hoping that
something can be dione ta speed up the
service.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I shal endeavour
ta obtain some information in reply ta the
honourable gentbeman's inquiry.
WAR CHARITIES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. WISHART MeL. ROBERTSON
moved the second, reading of Bili 13, an Act
ta amend the War Charities Act, 1939.
He said: Honourable senators, the abject
of the War Charities Act passed, in 1939 wag
ta regubate campaignis for the collection of
funds for purposes econnected directby or
indirectly with the war. Since then any
group desirous of launcliing such a campaigna municipabity, a. club, the Legion or any
o'ther body-hais been required ta submit ta
the Department an application in writing
signed by at least three members of the
organization, whose signatures had been

256

SENATE

witnessed, setting out such details as the
organization's name, the number of its
branches, if any, the bank into which the
money was to be credited, the amount of
money expected to be collected, the manner
in which such moneys were to be collected,
the object for which they were to be spent,
and the estimated cost of collection. As a
further means of protecting the public, every
registered fund has been required to submit
annually an audited statement as of December 31, showing the fund's total receipts and
disbursements
during the calendar year
immediately preceding, accompanied by a
certificate from a professional practising
accountant.
Since 1939 some four thousand applications
have been made and registered under the Act.
As of September, 1945, the number of actual
registrations was 3,611. During the war years
there has been careful custodianship of
public contributions, averaging $30,000,000 for
charitable purposes.
I might also point out that when making
their income tax returns donors have been
entitled to deduet from taxable income the
amounts contributed to organizations registered with the Department under the Act.
This bill makes three amendiments to the
Act. In the first place it provides that the
term "War Charity Fund" shall include:
a fund having for its object, or among .its
objects, the erection, construction, acquisition,
development or maintenance of a war memorial.
Then it defines just what is meant by a "war
memorial." Thirdly, it extends the regulatory
power of the Minister to war memorials.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: Honourable senators,
this Act has been administered by the Department of National War Services, which will
soon cease to exist. Can the honourable
leader of the Government .inform us who will
then administer the Act?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I am not certain,
but I think it will continue to be administered by the Minister of National Revenue,
who was formerly Minister of National War
Services. If I am wrong about that I shall
make a correction.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators, inay I ask a question of the honourable
leader of the Government? Possibly the question could be answered by reference to the
terms of the Act itself, which I have not before
me at the moment. This proposed amendment says that a war charity fund for the erection of a war memorial shall be governed by
the Act. What is a war charity? Is there any
provision that the Act does not apply to
private funds? If the family of a deceased
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

soldier desire to erect a memorial, must they
ask the Minister of the Department of
National War Services for permission to do
so? If not, where is the dividing line between
public funds, which are governed by the Act,
and private funds?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I am not sure
if there is such a dividing line. My understanding is that if any group of individuals,
or a municipality, club, branch of the Legion,
or other organization desires to conduct a
campaign to raise public funds for any war
charity, it must apply for registration under
this Act and furnish the detailed information
that I mentioned a few moments ago. As far
as individuals are concerned, it is my personal
opinion that they would not be covered by
the Act.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Honourable senators,
I agree entirely with the honourable member
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck)
that some confusion may be experienced. I
think the honourable leader should refer the
bill to a committee for examination.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If the House
will agree to the second reading of the bill,
I shall be glad to move that it be referred
to the Standing Com.mittee on Banking and
Commerce.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: May I ask, first,
if the War Chariýties Act ceases to be operative on the declaration of peace, and secondly,
when the Government is likely to declare
peace?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: In reply to the
first question, I would say that since funds
continue in existence and certain organizations contemplate activities with respect to
war memorials, the War Charities Act would
not cease with the formal declaration of peace.
On the second question, which is one that
the honourable senator from Alma (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne) also asked me, all I can say at
the presenit time is that the matter is under
consideration and in due course a decision
will be announced.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators, I
am glad that those questions have been asked,
and that the suggestion has been made to
refer the bill to a committee.
The War Charities Act worked extremely
well during the war. Prior to its enactment
considerable difficulty was experienced in the
city which I have the honour to represent in
this House; organizations were formed for
laudable purposes, but there was no possible
way to check what they did with the money.

NOVEMBER 19, 1945
Since the passage of the Act there has not
been a single eomplaint frorn any cjty in
Manitoba with newspaper coverage.
W-hile I arn in entire -accord with the observations of honourable gentlemen to my
lef t, I believe the general underlying principle.of çLhe measure is good. It is my personal opinion týhat the whole world is flot yet
honeet, and without some regulatian of this
kind some people will be organizing ta raise
funds for purposes which may be laudable
enough, but there will be no check as ta
where the moneys go.
In a criminal case before the Assize Court
in Manitoba -the issue was what had become
of certain funds. It was impossible ta prove
that the men charged got the money, so they
were let go. If this bill is sent ta a comrnittee the details can be taken carp of at
that time. It is in circumstances like these
that this House can give the greatest public
service; measures can be followed through,
,and it can be seen that they function as they
were intended ta do.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: When does the control cease?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The contrai would flot
cease. When there was no more necessity
for it, it just would not be exercised.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: What authority has
Parliament over municipaliýties?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Parliarnent lias no power
over municipalities. It would flot be municipalities that would be charged; it would be
organizations which go out asking for contributions ta set up a monument. They would
corne under this act.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Honourable senators, I
do noýt ýthink that is quite correct. I think
the real purpose of the act is ta determine
whether certain charitable contributions can
properly be deducted from incarne tax.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD:

That is secondary.

Hon. Mr. McRAE: There is nothing ta
prevent individuals from going ta certain
citîzens for the purpose of raising rnoney,
and if any one wishes ta make a contribution the Government should flot attempt ta
control it. The Governrnent does say, however, what contributions rnay be deducted
frorn incarne tax. I think that is the basis of
the Act.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Honaurable senatars,
that is so, af course, only if the Minister
agrees with the purpose, as put before the
people, ta which the funds are ta be applied.

257

May I ask whether this bill refera ta the
collection of rnaney for war mernorials? I do
nat see any mention of it in this bill.
Han. Mr. HAIG: Yes, it does.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
The amendment contemplates brmngmg war memorials
within the scope of the War Charities Act.
On the question raised by the honourable
senator frorn Vancouver (Han. Mr. McRae)
I arn advised that because registration is
made under the War Charities Act it daes
flot automatically follow that deductions will
be recognized by the Income Tax Department, although in actual practice such is the
case.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: That is why the
department asked for it.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: As the honourable leader opposite has suggested, the regularizing of funds that are designed for charitable purposes is ta give a sort of official
recognition ta the variaus individuals who
apply for and secure registration. Also it
provides a very careful check an the ratio of
expenses ta collections. As far as possible no
registration is permitted when the estimated
cost of collection appears te be in excess of
25 per cent of the total ta be collected.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Honourable senators, it
seems ta me that we are going far afield. If
there is fia question of deductions frorn incamne tax, I think we are going out of oilr way
ta try ta limait charities. Individuals who live
in municipalities and who know the situation
have the right and privilege of rnaking whatever contributions they wish. The only effeat
this would have would be that when a licence
was applied for and issued, the contributions
would be deductable frosu incarne tax.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Hanourable senators,
if this matter goes before a committee, inquiry should be made into at least one phase
of the question, namely. where the Dominion
Government gets its authority ta interfere
at alI in affairs of this kind. I presumne this
Act was passed under the authority given ta
Parliament ta deal with certain matters in
war-time. The time is going ta camne when
that authority will cease. If this is ta be a
continuing law, from where does the Government derive the power ta deal with wbat
would appear ta be a civil matter? For instance, a small tawn in Quebec or Ontario
might wish ta raise a memorial for some
purpase, and the Federal Government would
assume the right ta say that the municipality
must comply with certain conditions. I arn

the question before the bill goes to committee.

APPENDIX
THE PRIME MINISTER 0F UNITED KINGDOM
ADDRESS 0F THE RIGHT HONOURABLE CLEMENT B. ATTLEE, C.H., M.P., TO MEMBERS

0F

THE SENATE ANDI 0F THE HOUSE 0F COMMONS, IN THE HOUSE 0F COMMONS CHAMBER,

OTTAWA, NOVEMBER 19,

1945.

(Mr. Attlee was welcomed by the Right Honourable W. L. Mackenzie King, Prime Minister
of Canada, and thanlced by the Honourable James H. King, P.C., Speaker of the Senate, and
the Honourable Gaspard Fauteux, Speaker of the House of Commons.)

Right Hon. W. L. MACKENZIE KINOG:
Canada is much honoured by thse presence in
aur capital today of the Prime Minister of the
United Kingdom, the Right Honourable Clement R. Attlee. When, in the course of my
recent visit ta England, I learned from Mr.
Attlee that he had acccpted the invitation of
the President of the United States, Mr. Truman, ta visit him at Washington, I expressed
ta Mr. Attlee the hope that he might alsa find
it possible, before his return ta Britain, ta pay
a visit ta Ottawa. I was delighted ta receive
an immediate acceptance of this invitation.
I mentioned ta Mr. Attlee aur hope thýat,
while in Ottawa, he wauld be willing ta address
the members of bath Houses of Parliament.
This suggestion he assured me he would also
be pleased ta meet. Mr. Attlee is with us
this afternoon in fulfilment of his promise.
His address is ta be broadcast ta ail parts of
Canada, and averseas.
1 have already, on behaîf of the Canadian
people, extended ta Mr. Attlee, as Prime
Minister of the United Kingdomn, a very warm
welcome ta Canada. I should now like, on
behaîf of the Parliament of Canada, ta express
ta hlm thse great pleasure it affards thse members of both Houses ta have the honaur of
meeting him and of being addressed by him
this afternoon.
Perhaps, before I call on Mr. Attlee ta speak,
he 'will permit me ta say how pleased I amn
ta be agaîin with my fellaw members of Parliament after an absence of seven weeks, and
especially after the mem-orable visite I have
just made to England and ta the United
States.
I should like immediately ta express ta thse
Prime Minister of the United Kingdom my
warmn appreciation of thse many courtesies

extended ta me by him and by other members

of the British Government during my sajourn
in London.. The exceptional opportunities afforded of conference with Mr. Attlee and his
colle agues, as well as with members of the
,Opposition and wjth others, enabled me ta
gain a much wider knowledge of existing conditions in the United Kingdorn and other parts
of Europe, and of today's world problems.
For Britain and for the people of Britain my
visit has given me a greater admiration than
ever. The courage and determination they displayed throughout the long years of war have
neyer been. surpassed. Their fartitude and
endurance in seeldng today to overcome the
privations caused by the devastation of war,
and to meet situations resulting from its
borrors. are equally heroic and evoke feelings
of the deepest sympathy and respect.
I should like also ta say ta the Prime Min-ister of the United Kingdom how much it
meant to me, as Prime Minister of Canada, ta
share with hlm in the conferences with the
President of the United States on atomîc
energy and problems which this discovery has
presented ta the world.
It is too soon ta say more than a word of the
agreement reached at Washington. I believe
the initiative taken by the representatives cf
the three countries which possess the knowledge essential ta the use of atomic energy, ta
see that the new discovery shail be used for
the benefit of mankind, and not as a means
of destruction, should go f ar towardls creating
conditions cf mutual trust which alone can
rid the world of its warst fears, and secure
for nations an enduning peace. I arn more
than ever convinced that in the continued
close co-operation between nations of the
British Commonwealth and the United States,

260

SENATE

which meant so much to the preservation of
the world's freedom at a time of war, will
be found the surest guarantee of world security
in these post-war years.
I need not remind honourable members of
the many causes with which, over the years,
Mr. Attlee's life bas been identified, nor how
outstanding are the contributions he has made
to the public life of our day. He has always
been an earnest student of social and industrial
problems, imbued with an abiding determination to work increasingly for human welfare
and social progress. As a soldier in the first
Great War be had a fine record of military
service. He has been a member of the Labour
Party of Britain for nearly forty years, and
its leader for more than ten years. Though
still with the promise of many years before
him, he bas already lived to see fulfilment of
some of the great purposes of his life.
Few men have had a comparable political
career. Mr. Attlee has been a member of
the Parliament of the United Kingdom for
twenty-three years. During that time lie bas
held many high offices of state which lie
administered with rare ability and the utmost
fidelity. As Leader of the Opposition at the
greatest crisis of the war lie joined in forming
the Coalition. During the period of the
Coalition be held after 1942 the office of
Deputy Prime Minister. He combined this
difficult position with the continued leadership
of his party. He is today head of the administration and Prime Minister of the United
Kingdom.
This is a record of personal
achievement, political success and public service which will ever hold an exceptionally
high and honourable place in the history of
British statesmanship.
It has fallen to the lot of few statesmen,
if any. to be faced with greater problems
than those by which Mr. Attlee is faced
today. In the discharge of his grave responsibilities, I should like to assure the Prime
Minister of the United Kingdom of the understanding and co-operation of the, Government
of Canada. I am speaking, I know, for all
Canadians when I ask Mr. Attlee to take
back to the people of Britain the renewed
expression of our admiration and affection.
With this expression of admiration and affection. I ask him also to carry back the assurance that the people of Canada are united
in their resolve to do all they can to help
Britain in meeting the pressing needs of ber
people. We fully realize not only the magnitude of their sacrifice. but also our own
country's interest in the welfare and prosperity
of Britain, and indeed, of all nations.
I have much pleasure in calling upon the
Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, the
Right Honourable Clement Attlee.

Right Hon. CLEMENT R. ATTLEE: Mr.
Speaker, members of the Senate, and members
of the House of Commons:
I should like first of all to say how deeply
I am touched by the reception which you
have given me. I should like to thank you, Mr.
Prime Minister, for your kind words. I think
this is a tribute to the people of the United
Kingdom, whom I am representing today.
It is a great pleasure to me to be in Ottawa
again. It bas been my privilege to visit Canada
four times in the last five years. When I was
last here I was Deputy Prime Minister in
Mr. Churchill's Government, a post which I
held until a few months ago. Now by a process well understood by all parliamentarians,
there has been a change of administration, and
I come before you as Prime Minister. I say
that this is well understood by all of us; but
the methods that are natural to democracies
are not always understood in other parts of
the world.
You will remember that we had a general
election in Britain and I then accompanied
Mr. Churchill to Potsdam while the ballot
boxes remained locked up and the votes
from the men overseas were coming in. Some
of our friends were surprised that immediately
following a vigorous electoral contest Mr.
Churchill and I could co-operate; some were
even astonished that we showed no agitation
while our political destinies remained hidden
for three weeks. When we returned to London
and the result of the ballot caused me to
become Prime Minister, I went back to
Potsdam with preeisely the same civil servants
as had accompanied Mr. Churchill. It was a
striking example of how, in countries where
the rule of law obtains, we can effect change
peaceably. It was also an illustration of the
fact that political differences do not prevent
co-operation between opponents where the
interests of the country are at stake.
In London we have been delighted to
welcome in recent years representatives of all
your parties, ineluding my friend Mr. Bracken,
the leader of the Opposition. and Mr. Coldwell,
the leader of the Co-operative Commonwealth
Federation; and only a week or two ago we
bad the pleasure of receiving your Prime
Minister, Mr. Mackenzie King, on his third
visit since the war began. As the junior
Prime Minister in the Commonwealth, it has
been a pleasure to me to be with one who has
had such a long and distinguished tenure of
office.
He and I have come to you from the United
States of America, where we have been in
consultation with President Truman on a
subject of vital consequence, not only to the
people of our own countries but to the peoples
of the whole world. I shall not venture on

NOVEMBER 19, 1945
Mr. King's prerogatives by talking to you
this afternoon about the problems which the
d'iscovery of the release of atomie energy has
created. I have no doubt you will be debating
these high matters in due course, but I know
that the problem which has presented itself
to all three of us, as only one part of the
great question which confronts us all to-day,
is: How can we secure peace? How can we
prevent another devastating war from arising
again in a few years time, a war even worse
than those we have already experienced?
You will have seen that in considering this
question we stressed the paramount importance
of making the United Nations Organization an
effective instrument of world peace. You cannot deal with these matters by considering
such a question as that of the atom bomb by
itself. A very distinguished leader of my
party, Mr. Sidney Webb, now Lord Passfield,
once described the process of trying to deal
with the particular results of general causes
as hammering on the bulge. It was a simile
taken from dealing with pots and pans, for in
hammering on the bulge you merely caused
the metal to raise itself in another place.
The particular problem of certain armaments must be considered in the light of the
general question of securing world peace. It
is just here I believe, with all due humility,
that the British Commonwealth and Empire
offers the world an example which should be
noted and followed. The units which compose our British Commonwealth are equal.
They are sovereign and independent States,
owing allegiance to the same King, freely
co-operating for their mutual benefit, each one
of them living its own life, having its own distinctive characteristics and, while avoiding
slavish uniformity, being responsive to a
larger unity. The bonds which unite this
great company of nations are not material,
but spiritual. The strands which compose
them are the acceptance of the rule of law, a
belief in and the practice of the principles of
democracy and liberty, and the acknowledgment of a common standard of moral values.
In my view it is precisely these spiirtual ties
which must bind together all the nations of
the world if we are to make the United
Nations Organization a living" entity, if we
are to establish peace on sure foundations.
The work done at San Francisco was valuable, but the designing and perfecting of a
machine is of little value unless there is the
power to make it move. It is only an intense
belief in the great principles of the interdependence of nations and the brotherhood
of man that will provide the motive power to
this great machine which has been constructed.

261

I am certain that it was this unity in the
British Commonwealth, based on the common
conception of the right relationship between
human beings and between nations, that was
responsible for the remarkable spontaneity
with which at the threat to civilization the
members of the British Commonwealth of
nations sprang to arms.
I urge each individual man and woman of
every race, creed and language to understand
the moral crisis that confronts the world.
Je me rappelle en ce moment ce qu'a dit un
des grands esprits de la France, Rabelais:
Science sans conscience n'est que ruine de
l'âme.
Voilà le problème qui confronte l'humanitérapprocher la science et la moralité.
A mon avis, il est évident que si nous
n'apportons à ces problèmes un enthousiasme
moral aussi grand que celui qu'apportent les
savants à leurs recherches, la civilisation construite pendant des siècles sera détruite.
Speaking to you here today after the close
of this long struggle, I should like to pay my
tribute to what Canada and the Canadian
people have achieved. I recall so well the
dark days of 1940, when our forces had to
withdraw from Dunkirk and we were left with
very scanty equipment to defend ourselves
against invasion that then seemed imminent,
and how heartened we were by the presence
in ever-growing numbers of the Canadian
forces. I know too what a strain it was for
those gallant men to remain apparently
inactive for many weary months although
in fact their presence was vital to the whole
strategy of the war. In 1942 there took place
the Canadian action at Dieppe, which played
a vital part in the preparations for the later
It enabled us to perfect our
invasions.
amphibious technique; it taught us how to
conduct air battles in support of a landing,
and it made us realize the need for bringing
with us our own harbours. Thus the men of
Dieppe showed the way to North Africa, to
Sicily, to Italy and to Normandy.
When the time came for the Canadian
armed forces to cross the seas, in every theatre
of war they more than sustained the high
reputation which they had won in the first
World War on the fields of France and
Flanders. I recall how they were the spearhead of the attack on Sicily, and how they
fought their way north in 1944 and early
1945, along the Adriatic and across the
Apennines. It was my privilege then to visit
them in the front line. No less splendid were
their feats in the invasion of Europe. Some
of the hardest tasks were given to them-the
clearing of the channel ports, of the Dutch
coast, and the opening of the port of Antwerp.
And since the defeat of Germany, Canadian

262

SENATE

troops have been playing their part in the
vital task of disarming the Germans and
occupying their country. This task and similar tasks in Japan will make great demands
on the resources of the Commonwealth and
of the Allies, but it is one of the tasks which
must be done fully and well if we are net
to throw away the rewards of victory.
The whole world knows the achievements
of the Royal Canadian Air Force, whose
units played a d'istinguished part in every
phase of our warfare, in every command of
the United Kingdom and in every overseas
theatre. They were second to none in their
gallantry and in their skill. Perhaps their
biggest single achievement was the provision
of an entire group, the famous No. 6 Group
of Bomber Command. Let us remember that
behind the whole air effort of the British
Commonwealth lay that great Empire Air
Training Scheme under whioh roughly onethird of the British, Dominion and allied air
crews were trained in this country. Perhaps
it is not so generally known that the Dominion of Canada played a major part in the
development of Radar and provided ithe
R.A.F. with its main source of highly skilled
mechanics and teohnicians.
Finally, let me say that one of the most
notable achievements of the war was the development from small beginnings of a great
Canadian navy. In all the strain of the long
continued Battle of the Atlantic, Canadians
took their full share with their British and
American comrades.
Besides all this, just as in the Old Country,
the workers in the fields, in the factories and in
the shipyards, the scientists, the technicians
and researcli workers, are entitled to a full
share of credit for the successful outcome of
the war. I should like here to refer particularly
to the vast and generous financial contribution of Canada 'to the food supply sent across
the Atlantic and to the whole systern of
mutual aid. Canada has had not only firm
leadership of ber fighting forces, by sea. on
land and in the air, but also at home, by a
far-seeing and wise Parliament and Government, who understood just what was needed
for the common effort. Everyone who realizes
fully what Canada d'id throughout the war
must acknowledge that hers was a major contribution to the common cause.
You now, like ourselves, are facing the problems of peace. I, count it a happy event that
on the occasion of the first visit which I have
made overseas since the end of the Potsdam
Conference, I should have had the comradeship of your Prime Minister in visiting our
great friend and ally, the United States of
America. It seems to me to be a good augury

for the future, in which the problems of peace
will need that same co-operation which
brought us to final and complete victory.
I remember very well when I was over here
in 1941, discussing with members of your
Caibinet the problems of mobilizing manpower
and womanpower in both, our countries for
total war. We now are both engaged in the
equally difficult task of demobilization and of
the turning from war to peace of our whole
economie machine. I have no doubt that your
difficulties are very present to your minds,
but it might not be out of place for me to
tell you something of ours. I suppose that
in no country engaged in the war was a greater
degree of austerity imposed upon the people
than in the United Kingdom. I need not tell
you that our food situation is still very difficult and that our rations are on a scale only
barely sufficient to maintain health.
Coal
too is in short supply. But this is nfot all.
During the war we have been unable to replenish our ordinary stores of domestie requirements, sheets, blankets, curtains, pots and pans
and crockery. We have had as it were, in
every phase of our life, to make do and mend,
with the inevitable consequence that we find
ourselves today faced with every kind of
shortage. If you go around our shops you
will find that many of the ordinary wants of
the housewife are simply not there. We are
still rationed very tightly for clothing and
shoos. The men and women who come out
of the fighting services and want to marry
and set up a home will find the grcatest difliculty in furnishing it. For example, we are
endeavouring to provide utility furniture; but
it takes a long time to get the industrial
machine under way. And let me add that
those who want to marry and settle down have
an anxiety even more pressing than that of
how to furnish a home-that of findýing a home
to live in. It is perhaps not generally realized
that three and a half million houses were to
a greater or lesser extent damaged in the
blitz, and that of these a great number were
entirely destroyed. My own constituency of
Limehouse in East London was formerly a
dense mass of working-class houses with hardly
any open space at all. 'But at the recent Genoral election my constituents walked through
the fields to vote for me-fields strewn with
rubble, beginning to be covered by weeds
that had, grown up in the spaces created by
German bombs. It will take years to catch
up with the housing shortage; it will take a
long time to get our industries ful.ly at work;
and even then we shall not be able to devote
all our energies to our domestic need-s.
We
have the problem of paying for our food
and raw materials. For that purpose it is

NOVEMBER 19, 1945
essential that as soon as possible we should
build up our export trade. We shail no-t have
in the future those invisible exporta on which
we used -to depend before the war. Those
resources built up by past prosperity were
used up in the grirn time when the British
Commonwealth and Empire stood alone in
the field against -the batbarians, and in the
years which followed.
You may think I arn painting you a somewhat dark picture. 1 do flot minimize to
you or to our own people our difficulties,
but I should like you to know also the spirit
in which we are tackling them. I was talking
the other day to. a distinguished American
editor who had been visiting Britain, and he
said to me that the thing that struck him
most was the spirit of energy in our country.
It recalls to me what Emerson said a hundred
years ago about Britain:
So . .. I feel in regard to this aged England
. pressed upon by transitions of trade and
. competing populations,-I eee her flot d-isflot dark but well-remembering that
piri ted, seen weak, daya before; indeed, with a
she has
kjnd of instinet that she sees a littie better in
a cloudy day, and that, in storm of battis and
calamity, she has> a secret vigour and a pulse
like a caninon.
,I believe that that is true today. We have
a new Parliament, very largely made up of
young men and women, a big proportion of
whom are drawn from the fighting forces. I
believe that this Parliament with its youthful
energy, drive and idealism, and its readiness
to embark on new experiments, fitly represents the spirit of our old country. At the
general election the electors returned to power
a party which believes in a planned economy,
which believes in developing to the full the
resources of our country in the interests oTf
ail the people, which believes that every
individual in the community should be given
a fair share of the gooci things of this world
in return for a fair contribution of effort.
We are therefore embarking on new policies.
We are putting forward complete schemes
for social security designed to remove from
the homes of our petple the fear of want;
but we know well that our ability to provide
this economnie security will depend on the
degree to which we are able to apply the
skill of our workers, our scientistes and
managers to our natural resources. That is
why we are seeking to reorganize our basic
industries, such as coal, as services owned and
controlled in the interests of the nation. We
cannot afford to waste our resources. We
cannot afford inefficiency. We are seeking to
direct capital into those channels where it
wilI fertilize trade and industry in the interest
of the whole community. We have an agricultural policv designed to see that the

263

workers on: the land get a fair return for
their efforts, and that the food of the people
shall be obtainable at a reasonable cost. We
shall of courge always have to import a large
amount of our food supplies from abroad, but
we believe that prosperous agriculture at home
is compatible with that exchange of food and
raw materials from overseas in return for our
manufact4red goods which has for so long
been the basis of our inter-Commonwealth
trade. Therefore, while we follow no exclusive policy, we believe that in the future as
in the past, the general well-being of the
countries of the Commonwealth will be
enhanced by their economies being complementary. In saying this I do flot lose sight
of the fact that Canada, perhaps to an even
greater extent than other countries in the
Commonwealth, has become during the war
an important manufacturing nation, and that
it will expeet to sce in post-war years an
increasing export of its own manufactured
products. But past experience has shown that
the greatest volume of trade has been built
up between highly industrialized countries,
and I see no reason therefore to think that
the development to which I have referred will
place any obstacle in the way of a steady
and increasing trade between our two
countries.
We of the Labour-Party helieve in an expansionist economy; we afflrm that if we ail
act wisely we shahl neyer again see, as we
did in 1931, the tragedy of starvation and want
in the midat of abundance. We hold that it
is of vital importance that there should be a
steadily increasing standard .of life for the
masses of the people throughout, the world.
In particular, we- believe it to be essential
that the producers of primary producta ail
the world over shahl be assured of a fair
reward for their labours and should not be
at the mercy of the vagaries of uncontrolled
prices.
We have emerged triumphant from the
greatest crisis that ever faced the free peoples
of the world. It is for us to see that that
victory is not nullified bv the failure to deal
effectively with the problems of the peace.
We owe it to the valiant dead that they
shahl not have died in vain. I know well
how in aIl our countries there is weariness
after these six years of war; but we must
flot let it overcome us. There may be here
and there some cynicism: we must meet it
by redoubling our faith and hope. I sometimes hear talk of new nations and old nations.
It has heen, suggested, that we in Europe are
old and effete. Do not believe it. Yqu are
the new ehoot from the old stem, but the old
stem is still alive and full of vigour. You in

Canada draw your spiritual resources from
two great nations. In the past, these nations
in tu-n have derived their sustenance from the
great heritage bequeathed by our ancestors,
and they will do so again in the future. I
can see that you here in Canada are pulsating
with life and vigour. You have a great part
to play in the world, and I am certain that
in peace as in war you will take .your full
share in bearing the burdens of the world.
Twice in my lifetime the aggressor bas presumed to think that Britain was feeble and
effete. Twice bas he learned his error. Despite
all our difficulties we face the future undismayed. We shall go forward into this new
world-a world, it is true, of danger, but a
world of great opportunity-strong in the
faith expressed so clearly by Robert Burns:
It's coming yet for a' that
That man to man, the world o'er,

I
Right Hon. MACKENZIE KING:
would ask the Honourable Dr. King, Speaker
of the Senate, and the Honourable Mr.
Fauteux, Speaker of the House of Commons,
to thank Mr. Attlee for the eloquent and
inspiring address he bas just delivered.
Hon. J. H. KING: Mr. Prime Minister,
honourable members of the Senate and of the
House of Commons: it is my privilege to
express, more particularly on behalf of the
Senate, a word of thanks to our distinguished
guest, Mr. Attlee, the Prime Minister of
Great Britain, is no stranger to Canada, and
as this is the first opportunity we have had to
offer our congratulations and good wishes since
he was chosen to fill the highest office in the
gift of the British people, this we do most
heartily.
We are grateful to him for finding time,
in the midst: of all the overwhelming problems with which bis Government is faced, to
visit our Capital, and to address the members of our Houses of Parliament.
We recognize what bis visit signifies in the
growing importance of the mutual relations
existing between Great Britain and Canada;
and we are proud, too, that Mr. Attlee's
first visit to the United States, as Prime
Minister of Great Britain, rshould bave been
in company with the Prime Minister of Canada. The Canadian people are unanimous in
their realization that the highest external
interest of our country is the maintenance and
strengthening of the common bonds between
the nations of our Commonwealth and the
United States of America.
We thank Mr. Attlee for bis generous and
understanding words today, and should like

to assure him that the Canadian people are
hopeful and desirous of continuing that spirit
of unity andi co-operation among the nations
of the Commonwealth, whieh exemplifies to
the world that such co-operation is possible,
and in it lies the road to peace and security.
Sir, we wish you godspeed and safe return
to Great Britain.
Hon. GASPARD FAUTEUX:
Mr. Attlee,
honourable members of the Senate and of
the House of Commons, it is indeed a great
honour and privilege to extend on behalf of
the House of Commons to the Right Honourable Mr. Attlee our most sincere thanks
for having accepted the invitation to address
the Parliament of Canada, and for speaking in
such generous terms of our country and its
people.
I would not dare, as it would be superfluous,
to utter any remarks in reply to the views
which have been expressed to this Parliament
by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom;
moreover, if this were a regular sitting of the
House, I should not have the right to do so,
since our Standing Order No. 10 says: "Mr.
Speaker shall not take part in any debate
before the House."
May I be permitted, however, to say to
the Right Honourable Prime Minister that it
will be indeed a great pleasure for the Speaker
when an honourable member of the House
moves, during our regular sitting, that the
address of the Right Honourable Clement R.
Attlee, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, delivered, before the members of the
Senate and of the House of Commons in the
ehamber of the House of Commons, on Monday, November 19, 1945, be included in the
House of Commons Debates and form part of
the permanent records of this Parliament. I
must assure you sir that, the honourable
member who will move the motion will not
be called, to order by the Speaker and, after
the motion has been put, I shall indeed be
very happy, acting as the voice of the House
of Commons, to say, without hesitation,
Carried; adopté.
Mionsieur Attlee, s'il y a des obligations et
des devoirs très lourds imposés à l'Orateur de
la Chambre des communes, il existe aussi des
privilèges, comme c'est le cas cet après-midi.
qui sont des plus agréables, et c'est avec beaucoup d'empressement que je vous souhaite en
ma langue maternelle, au nom de l'élément
canadien-français, la plus cordiale bienvenue,
et que je vous offre nos remerciements les plus
sincères pour avoir bien voulu accepter l'invitation du premier ministre d'adresser la parole
à une réunion conjointe des deux Chambres
du Parlement du Canada.

265

NOVEMBER 19, 1945
Veuillez croire que mes compatriotes canadiens-français se réjouissent de votre visite,
car ils n'ont pas oublié l'attitude héroïque
de votre pays durant la guerre qui vient à
peine de se terminer et ils sont reconnaissants
à la Grande-Bretagne et à sa population, à
qui nous devons pour une large part la victoire des Nations Unies. Ils se souviennent
aussi du rôle prépondérant que vous avez
joué durant ces années difficiles, avec l'ancien
premier ministre de la Grande-Bretagne, le
très honorable Winston Churchill, dans l'administration de votre pays.
Me permettriez-vous d'ajouter que si, au
Canada, nous avons toujours eu confiance
dans le courage et la 'valeur du peuple anglais
durant les jours les plus sombres, nous avons
également confiance en votre grand pays pour
conserver cette unité, cette collaboration
parmi les Nations Unies, qui nous ont donné
la victoire, afin de nous assurer dans l'avenir
une paix durable qui nous garantira un
monde meilleur.
The proceedings were closed by the singing
of God Save the King.

COMMITTEESSENATE STANDING
THEIR CONSTITUTION AND
FUNCTIONS
MOTION

Hon.

WISHART

McL.

ROBERTSON

moved:
1. That a special committee of the Senate be
appointed to review the constitution and funetions of the Standing Gommittees of the Senate
and to make such recommendations to facilitate
the business of the Senate as it may deem necessary or expedient.
2. That the said committee be composed of
the Honourable Senators Buchanan, Foster,
Haig, Hayden, Horner, Howard, Lambert, Leger,
McRae, Robertson, 'Sinclair, and Vien.
He said: Honourable senators, since the
beginning of this session various constructive
suggestions have been made to me by honourable members from both sides of the House
with regard to various aspects of our standing
committees. These suggestions have come
from senior senators and recently appointed
members. I believe that many of the suggestions are well worthy of consideratiori, and
rather than attempt to deal with them in
piecemeal fashion, I have decided to move
this mnotion, so that, if it is concurred in,
honourable members who have ideas on the
constitution and functions of our standing
committees may set them forth for the special
committee, which could then examine them
and bring in a report for consideration by the
Senate. In that way, if the committee's report
were adopted, we would begin to derive benefit
from it at the start of the next session.
I should like honourable senators to regard
the proposed special committee as part of
what, I hope, may be a programme to increase
the already great usefulness of this Chamber.
I am sure it is the desire of every honourable
member that the Senate, which is one of the
Houses of Parliament, should in future render
service, in ever-increasing degree, to the people
of this country. There are some things which
we can do only in co-operation with the
Government or the other House, but it seems
to me that the logic of events and the continuously growing volume of parliamèntary
business makes it desirable that there should
be a better division of the legislative responsibilities of both Houses of Parliament. However, that is a matter which, if possible, will
have to be worked out between this House and
other parties.
I have two things in mind. One is the proposal made in this motion. The other, that
in my official capacity as leader of the Government here, with a view to enhancing the repu-

266

SENATE

tation and effectiveness of this House of
Parliament I should like to ask honourable
members to refrain from saying anything of a
derogatory
nature
respecting
honourable
senators either individually or collectively.
As a junior member of this House, I can say
that if I ever had any preconceived ideas
with respect to the matter, my rather brief
experience here has convinced me that no men
in any group, irrespective of age or other
factors, are more desirous of giving of their
very best talent for the general good of their
country. I think that we should on every
occasion refrain from saying anything which
would have the effect of belittling the reputation of this Chamber, or which would convey
to the people of this country that there is
anything but a universal willingness on the
part of members of this House to render the
greatest service possible.
I should like to draw to the attention of
honourable senators some of the suggestions
that have been made respecting the constitution and functions of committees. Undoubteddy some honourable senators will have
further suggestions to make.
It has been suggested that we have too
many committees. Rule 78 of the Senate of
Canada makes provision for 17 standing committees. Some of these are small, consisting
of nine senators or less. Several such committees do not meet or transact business
during the session. It is proposed that some
of them be aboished, or as an alternative
that they be given something to do.
Further, it has been suggested on several
occasions by honourable senators that the
Standing Commitee on Banking and Commerce and that on Railways, Telegraphs and
flarbours are too large. These committees
are composed of 42 and 50 members respectively.
Certain honourable senators are on too
many committees. Some are members of all
the important committees. This condition
makes it difficult to arrange sittings of more
than one committee on the same day; also
on days when more than one committee is
sitting it makes it difficult to secure a
quorum.
A recent survey shows that two
senators are members of every committee;
six are members of seven committees; six
of six; sixteen of five; nineteen of four; fifteen
of three; fourteen of two, and seventeen of
only one committee.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

Some honourable senators complain that
they cannot get on committees to which the
types of bills in which they are interested are
referred. As all honourable senators know,
the members of standing committees are
nominated by a Committee of Selection
appointed in accordance with Rule 77, which
reads:
77. At the commencement of eaeh session a
Committee of Selection, consisting of nine senators named by the Senate, shall be appointed,
whose duty it shall be to nominate the senators
to serve on the several standing committees.
So far as I know this procedure has been
followed: but it might be better to give the
Committee of Selection more time in which
to determine the individual qualifications and
desires of honourable senators with respect
to serving on the different committees.
The suggestion has been made that more
business should be transacted in the Committee of the Whole House, and that fewer
bills should be sent to standing committees.
The effect of having the Com.mittee of the
Whole do work now being done by standing committees would be to give more publicity to the business of the Senate, and to
afford opportunity for the expression of individual points of view. On the other hand,
the sending of bills to a standing committee
provides an opportunity for the hearing of
witnesses and the receiving of representations
from the public.
The following changes were proposed in
the names of standing committees:
(a) That the word Fisheries should be added
to the name of the Committee on Agriculture
and Forestry, or a change ef name should 'be
contemplated that would refer to the primary
ýindustries generally.
(b) That the name of the Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours should be
changed in some way to include reference to
aviation.
Question Las been raised as te whether or
not new committees should be constituted.
Inasmuch as one of the original purposes for
which the Senate was created was that it
should be particularly concerned with the
rights of provincial minorities, it was suggested that this honourable body should seriously consider the constitution of a standing
committee to consider Dominion-Provincial
relations.
I am interested in hearing the views of
honourable senators as to -the desirability of
referring matters of national importance te
various committees in anticipation of forthcoming legislation, so that honourable senators

NOVEMBER 20, 1945
may familiarize themselves with the subject
matter before specific legisiation is introduced. This procedure bas been adopted in
two instances during the present session. In
addition to referring the Estimates to the
Standing Commnittee on Finance before the
intraduction af the Supply Bill, there have
been tabled in this flouse reports of very
great national interest, nameiy:
The 'Report af the United Nations Monetary
and Financiai Conferenoe.
The final Act of the International Civil Aviation Conference.
The proposais af -the Government of Canada
before the Dominion-Provincial Conference on
Reconstruction.
In two instances, tbe Bretton Woods Conference and the International Civil Aviation
Conference, there is indication already that
certain legislation wili corne before us whicb
As to the
wiil require our consideration.
white paper on Emplýoyrnent and Income, the
Government bas announced the desirability
of the export trade of Canada in the postwar years reaching a figure of flot less than
one and three-quarter billion dollars -annually
at current prices for merchandise and nonmonetary goid. In dollar value this wouid
represent an increase of about 60 per cent
over the pre-war level, and about 15 per
cent in the amount of goods exported. This
is a question of great importance, one with
which the Senate mnust concern itself directly
or indirectly, and I for one should like to
know the views of some honourable senators
on having it referred to the Committee on
Trade and Commerce for investigation and
study.
There is a further question as to how far
we should go i 'the matter of inquiries by
special committess, sirnilar ini princîpie and
purpose to the special cornmittee now conducting an inquiry into the workings of the
Income War Tax Act. If honourabie senators
think favourably of the proposai, I would suggest that a speciai commîttee be set up for
the purpose of revîewing the constitution and
functions of the standing committees of the
Senate. I should like honourabie senýators,
particulariy those who have had long experience i this flouse, to give the comnmittee the benefit of their views on the suggestions I have outiined. Ini this way the
Senate wiil better avail itself of the great
abilities of ail its members, especiaily of the
newcomers.
flon. JOHiN T. HlAIG: flonourable senators,
I do not intend to speak at any great ienigth.
It is my intention to move adjournment of
the debate to ailow as much tîme as possible
for the discussion of another important
subject.

Zt01

1 do wish to say, however, that this
honourable flouse will neyer occupy -the place
the Fathers of Confederation întended it ta
take until we have a greater number of the
members of the Goverument of the day sitting
in this Chamber. One man representing the
Government in this flouse is not sufficient,
especially when that man does flot occupy a
cabinet post as a minister of a department.
There is no doubt that ail bis dealing witb
money or taxation should normally arise ini
the flouse of Commons, the members of which
are elected; but there is an increasmng amount
of legisiation coming ini from time to time
which bas notbing to do with money matters,
and on which men of mature judgment sbould
have an opportunity to express thernselves.
In my short experience of a littie more than
ten years as a member of this flouse I have
always feit that the Senate lacked the necessary ministerial respansibility ta enable it to
play the important part intended for it in the
scheme of Confederation. Furthermore, the
idea of the Fathers of Confederation was that
the Senate should be a reviewing chamber,
functioning so, as to give the people a chance
for second thought i matters of legisiation.
Once you have more than two parties ini an
elected bouse you are bound to have long
debates. I speak with some authority on
that. For many years I had the pleasure of
being a member of an elected house, and for
fifteen of those years no fewer than five
parties were represented in that bouse. Na
matter what careful arrangements you made
in an attem.pt to have a debate concluded
in one or two days, just when you tbought
it was finisbed you would find a representative
of one of the parties which had not yet made
its views known getting up and starting the
discussion ail over agaîn. That is what is
going on in thé flouse of Commons now, and
I arn persuaded that it is a condition which
miay iast for some time. While it lasts there
will be long-drawn-out discussion on every
subi ect that cames before the flouse, and I
defy anyriody to prevent it. For the lsst
five years there has been a coalition goverument ini Manitoba, with only two parties in
the legislature. As a resuit, the length of the
sessions has been cut down forty per cent.
I am sure that if Manitoba bas a three or four
ar five party system again, the sessions af its
legislature will stretch out considerabiy. Exactly the saine thing is true of British Columbia
and Saskatchewan.
The flouse of Representatives ini the United
States had to adopt a system týhat -i reality
amounted to closure. I mean they set a

268

SENATE

limit to the length of time for the discussion
of a bill. There is a similar system in effect
in Great Britain.
It is a good thing for the Senate to have a
discussion on the income tax, as we have
had for some time in one of our committees.
I notice that a periodical published in Toronto
is advocating that the Senate discuss the
labour problem. Well, I am not clear as to
whether that would be a good thing or not,
but I do know there is one subjeot we should
discuss here, and that is divorce. Those of
us who have been on the Divorce Committee
for many years realize that we are doing a
hard and disagreeable job. But I do not see
how we can get out of it. We cannot say to
the Province of Quebec: "You must establish
a divorce court. If you do not, we will force
it on you."
We cannot say that, because
eighty per cent of the people of that province are opposed to divorce. Some people
say that the Quebec divorce cases should be
turned over to the Exchequer Court. The
problem is one that this House should try to
solve. We are trying to solve the income
tax problem; why not the divorce problem?
The divorce laws of Canada are out of date.
An old country like Great Britain was able
five or six years ago to bring in a divorce Act
that has worked well.
The question of how to deal with divorce
applications from Quebec is a live one in this
country. As a member of the Senate Divorce
Committee I want to thank honourable members of another place-especially the honourable gentleman from Hull, who is a minister
of the Government, and the honourable
gentleman from West Calgary-for what they
said about the work of our Committee. They
were very kind. However, as the Minister of
Finance said in 'another place when honourable members were objecting to the present
,system of dealing with Quebec divorces,
there is no use in simply making criticism;
the thing to do is to suggest a better method
of dealing with the problem. Divorce in this
country, as elsewhere, is one of the features of
modern civilization, and it is a feature that
is here to stay.
Now I come to the motion of the honourable leade.r of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Robertson). I welcome it.
His suggestion
is that the whole question of the constitution
and functions of our standing committees be
referred to a special committee, which should
report back to the House. That is in accordance with the practice in the House of Commons and in our provincial legislatures. A bill
is given first and second readings, then sent
to a committee and reported back, and finally
it reaches the third reading stage. If you are
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

desirous of saving time, the bill can be referred to the Committee of the Whole rather
than to a standing committee.
The only place where a minister who has a
seat in the House of Commons can explain a
bill to the Senate is in one of our committees.
Then, groups and institutions who wish to
express 'their views on anv proposed matter
before Parliament are facilitated in being
able to send delegations to our committees.
The first year that I became a member of
the Senate I was appointed to the Committee
of Selection. The then Government leader, the
late Senator Dandurand, made a suggestion
that has ever since been carried out-it may
have been suggested before for all I knowthat when a vacancy occurred on a committee
the Government of the day would select a
successor. Senator Meighen, who was then
leading this side, agreed to the proposal, and
the practice bas worked extremely well ever
since. For many years I was a member of the
Committee of Selection in the Manitoba
Legislature, and I know that we used to have
an awful time, with rows about who should
be appointed to this or that committee. I
have never seen any rows here over that
question during the ten years of my membership in the Senate. However, as the honourable leader pointed out, the Committee of
Selection is often in doubt as to new senators;
they are not known; and there is question
as to which of them should be appointed to
which committee.
I heartily agree that the membership of the
committees should be checked over. To say
that a man is a member of six committees does
not necessarily mean much, if included among
them is the Tourist Traffic Committee, the
Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds,
and the Committee on Public Health. I do
not know whether the last mentioned committee has met lately, but for years it did not
meet at all. It would be a good thing to check
up on the memberships of ail committees with
a view to making a better division of the
work. I think the leader of the Government
and the leader on this side of the House should
be members of all committees, so t.hey may
be kept in touch with what is going on.
There are several other things about which
I should like to say a word or two, but in view
of the business to come before us this afternoon I will now move the adjournment of the
debate.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, before the motion for the adjournment of the debate is carried, I have a word
or two to say. I find myself generally in
sympathy with what the honourable leader
of the Government has stated. I wish to point

NOVEMBER 20, 1945
out, however, something that lie knows full
well. He himnself, being a menmber of the
Privy Council, holds the key Vo the situation.
When a new session opens and the legisiation
is forecast in the Speech from the 'Throne, my
honlourable friend, with his great prestige in
the Cabinet, might say Vo the Prime Minister
and his other colleagues: "Why cannot the
Senate handie this and that piece of legislation?" I know, from my experience as a
memýber of the other place and as a member
of the Government, that my honourable friend
will run up against the desire of ministers Vo
introduce their own bills; but I stili Vhink
the honourable leader could exercise a good
deal of influence Vo have legisiation initiated
in this Huse.
I do noV flnd myse4f altogether in agreement
with my good leader on Vhs side (Hon. Mr.
Haig) when he advocates that some minisVers sh-ould have seats ini Vhs Chamber.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: My honourable friend
misunderstands me. I adwocated that a number of senators should be appointedl Vo the
Government.
Hon. Mr. EULER: That is the same thing.
Hon. Mr. HAiIG: No, th-at is not what my
honourable friend has in mind.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: What I understood the leader on ýthis side Vo say was that
he is in favour of senaVors holding some
portfolios.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Correct.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNF,: Well, I am
sorry that I do not find myseif in accord with
that vie.w. There is a great aggregation of
ability in the other bouse and also in this
bouse. Those who have been members of this
Chaniber for a number of years will rememnber
a fact that I have pointed out before, that
during the regime of the Bennett Government
the most difficuit legislation that ever came
before Parliament was introduced in and deaît
with principally by the Senate. The Shipping
Act, on which we spent weeks and weeks, is one
instance that cornes Vo mi, and. there were
important insurance bis and railway bis.
In the Senate we have memnbers--some- of
them young and others advanced ini years-who possess the experience and ability required
Vo study bis with as mucb exactitude and
thoroughness as can lie applied Vo that Vask in
the other House.
The whoie matter bouls down Vo this question: Cen we prevail upon the Goverciment
Vo see that a certain number cf bills are
initiated here instead of in another place? We
can go as far as we like in reforming our

269

committees, but if the present system continues and Government and public bills are
initiated in the other bouse exclusively, I do
noV know that anything we do about our
committeýes Will be of much importance.
I have great faith in the honourable leader
of -the Senate (Hon. Mr. Robertson). H1e la
young, vigorous, and intelligent. I arn sure
that he will be able to persuade the Prime
Minister and bis other col-leagues to arrange
for the introduction in the Senate of various
bills which, if the present system, were Vo
continue, would be initiated in another place.
I will not take time Vo enumerate bis that
might quite properly and aven adi(vantageously
have been introduced bera this session. I will
close my remarks by sîmply stating that I amn
in sympathy with what the honourable leader
bas said ahout our committees, but I do hope
he will use bis influence along the lina I have
indicated.
bon. Mr. EULER: Honourable senators-The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, it is moved by Honourable Senator
Haig that the debate lie adjourned. Io it
your pleasure Vo adopt the motion?
bon. Mr. EULER: Io Vhis motion debatable?
An Hon. SENATOR:, No.
The motion of Honourable Mr. Haig was
agreed Vo, and the debate was adjourned.
SI'JTINGS 0F THE SENATE
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senaVers, Vo avoid any uncertainty as Vo the dates
of adjouming and reassembling, I migbt say
that it is my intention Vo move on Friday
afternaon that we adjourci until next Monday
evening.
CENTRAL MORTOAGE AND HOUSING
CORPORATION BILL
SECOND READING

bon. WISHART MoL. ROBERTSON
moved the second reading of Bill 23, an Act Vo,
incorporate the Central Mortgage and Housing
Corporation.
H1e said: bonourable senators, I would ask
the honourable gentleman from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roehuck) Vo explain this
bill.
bon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: bonourable senators, I thank the honourable leader
for the honour he bas il-one me in requesting
me Vo undertake the task of explaining Bill
No. 23. It is a task of considerable magnitude

270

SENATE

if the explanation is to equal the requirements.
It is natural for one to consider the task
which he undertakes a very important one.
In this instance may I say in extenuation that
I know of nothing likely to come before the
Senate this session which will involve as much
in the way of human relations, the building up
or tearing down of human fibre, as the subject
matter of this bill. There will be few acts
which we will be called upon to consider
involving larger sums of public and private
money than are involved in the legislation
effected by this bill.
The purpose of the bill is to set up the
operating machinery necessary for the proper
functioning of other bills now upon the statute
books. That being so, there is imported into
this discussion other legislation which will be
administered by the institution set up under
the bill before us, which covers the whole
problem of housing in its various relationships and historic aspects. Under these circumstances if I take a little longer than I
would otherwise do, I trust that honourable
senators will bear with me.
The shortage of housing is no new problem
in the Dominion of Canada. A place to live
is a primary need in a cold climate. The
first 'task of the pioneer settlers was the building of their log houses, and for many years
the progress of a community and the success
of its individual members has been judged by
the capacity and quality of its housing.
In the early days the struggle was against
nature and a genuine scarcity. Only in more
recent years has the problem become economic,
one manifestaition of poverty in the midst of
plenty. That, of course, is its character taday. The productive power of the Canadian
people, with -an army of a half million warriors withdrawn from production, bas been in
the neighbourhood of eight to ten billion per
annum. Taken at eight billion, this is sufficient
to erect 1,600,000 bouses worth $5,000 each, or
one for every seven people. That is to say,
were our full producing power, functioning at
the rate at which it has been functioning during the war, directed entirely towards housing, in a single year we could build a sufficient
number of $5,000 houses to accommodate our
entire population.
This statement, of course, is not a fair one,
for the entire producing power of a nation
can never be directed towards a single
objective.
The statement does, however,
illustrate the undoubted fact that in normal
times of peace a shortage of a few thousand
houses could certainly be met were the
economic difficulties removed. It is an insult
to this nation to say that the production of a
sufficient supply of houses is beyond our
capability.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK.

I am speaking of the continuing shortage of
houses, which runs on from year to year
through good times and bad, and which leaves
its debt of discomfort, disease, degradation
and human wreckage.
The immediate housing situation from which
we are suffering has an additional elementthat of crisis. House building has been virtually
suspended during the war, and now thousands
of men are coming home from overseas faster
than the house building industry can supply
their needs. The multiplication of families
is a subject for congratulation, and not a
matter of regret; we rejoice in each new hanging of the crane; the resultant housing emergency will be met. My own hope is that the
measure now taken to meet the emergency
will be such as to ompletely solve the
problem when the emergency is over.
It is important to estimate the magnitude
of the housing needs which actually exist.
Various estimates have been made. Making
no allowance for needs arising after 1946, the
Curtis Report of March 1944 estimates the
requirements for sub-standard and slum clearance, the elimination of overcrowding and the
meeting of building deficits up to 1946 as,
urban 320,000, non-farm rural 22,000, and
farm-rural 125,000-a total of 467,000 houses.
To this figure must be added the accumulating
requirements of 435,000 for the next ten years,
or a final objective over the coming years of
902,000 bouses. The present objective of the
Dominion authorities is 50,000 units this year,
and it is a reasonable prediction that that
number will have been constructed:, or at least
will be under construction, during the year
ending June 1946.
The Minister of Munitions and Supply gave
same interesting figures on war production
up to V-Day. Canadian war production as
measured in the purchases of his department
amounted to 83,600,000,000, a sum sufficient, if
applied to housing, to represent a building
programme of 1,000,000 houses at $3,600 each.
Should we build houses during the next ten
years at one-half the rate at which we produced munitions of war, we will have coped
with the present deficiency in housing and met
as well the accumulating requirements of the
forthcoming decade.
The three essentials of human existence are
food, clothing and shelter. There can be no
fair share of happiness enjoyed by those condemned to excessive overcrowding or slum
conditions. Sub-grade housing has a serious
effect upon the health of its victims. Mrs.
Gladys Strum, speaking in the House of
Commons recently, said:

271

NOVEMBER 20, 1945
Every time we examine crime we are farced
back to the source, and inevitably we corne back
to sluma conditions in the cities, towns, and
villages-those places where human lufe bas not
a chance to flouriali.
The speaker need flot have confined hier
remarks to urban life, for there are slums of
the cauntry as well as of the eity, and one
needt but read the newspapers to observe
the fruit of that unhealtby tree. Bad housing
has a most serjous eifect upon miorals, particularly of the risio-g generation.
The eff ect of house- building on business
conditions is not always recognized. When the
building trades are active ail ather trades and
industries tbrive. Yau *will neyer suifer
extremity of depression wben the sound of the
bammer is heard in the land. The actual
erection of bouses, is allied with. the making
of furniture and furnishings, and the three
togetber constitute a maijor portion of human
activity.
In view of the importance, both human and
economic, of housing, it is regrettable that
bouses are our most heavily taxed commodity.
Taxiffs and sales tax take their toli before the
bouse is assembled; tben it is subjeet to an
annual, recurring municipal tax of about 3 per
cent per annum. There is no other commadity
which in the course of consumaption is subjeet
to a beavy annual, recurring tax. This is only
one ai the reasons that bouses are scarce and
costly. It is a matter of regret tbat so
imuportant an industry as that of borne-building
sbould find it necessary ta walk witb the
crutcb of Government assistance.
The first public act in Canada designed to
promote the building of bhouses was passed in
the Province of Ontario in 1913, so a housing
shortage serious enougb to bring about Governmental interference is ai considerable age
and standing. That Act permitted municipalities to guarantee up to 85 per cent of the
bonds issued by bousing companies. The city
af Toronto was the only municipality ta take
advantage of its provisions, wben it guaranteed tbe bonds of the Toronto Housing Cornpany, as a result of which 330 houses were
built.
Then there intervened the flrst Great War,
tbat of 1914-18, wben, as in the war just clesed,
many af our pejople were overseas and alI
were mucli too busy te give attention te the
need for bousing. On the close ai the war the
housing shortage became acute for the same
reasons that it is acute now, -and in 1918 a
Royal Commission on IndustTial Relations,
under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice
Mathers, made a report in whidh the1se commenta appear:
Another cause of unrest which we met with
at practically every place we visited was the
scarcity of houses and the ipoor quality of th.ose
47704-19

whieh did exist. In nothing lias production sa
signally fallen off during the four years of war
as in the building of dwelling bouses. The existing condition oi the worker is affected not
only by the absence of sufficient housing accomnmodation, but also by the inadequacy of those
that are in existence. Poor sanitary conditions
and insuffiient rooms are the chief complaints.
The high price of building land and of building
material have made it impossible for the worker
ta provide himself with a home, and sorne means
should lie adopted, with as little delay' as possible, ta remedy this defeet.
A National Industrial Conference bad
previously asserted that current industrial
unrest and unsatisfactory social conditions
were, to a considerable degree, the consequence of "land speculation, poor and insufficient housing and bigb rents." Action by the
Dominion Governrent became necessary and
inevitable.
May I digress for a moment to say that the
provision of bouses is a two-fold problem,
involýving (a) tbe erection or construction of
the building and, (b) the securing oi the
land upon whicb it must stand. No attenipt
bas been made by any af the governments
concerned ta ameliorate wýhat Mr. Justice
M.atbers refers to as "the higb price ai building land," and what the National Industrial
Conference called "land speculation." Sucb,
apparently, is the influence of the landed
gentry tbat this important feature ai the
problem bas been rarely even discussed.
Wbat tbe Dominion Gavernment did was
ta advance rnoney te municipal governments
witbh which. ta 'buy eut the landiaolder and to
pay tbe bigb price ai construction. Loans
amounting ta 325,000,000 at 5 per cent interest and 25-year maturity were made under
autbority af the War Measures Act, and in
tbe course af four years 6,242 bouses were
built in 179 municipalities. This was the
Dominion Governrnent's first attempt to cape
witb the building problem, and unfortunately
the experience was net particularly happy.
According ta a 'Census monograpb

ai 1941,

witb but one or two exceptions the "records
sbowed inismanagement ai funds and inefficient 'administration oi the projects by the
municipal authorities."l
Tbe promotion ai hausing by means ai
grants or boans by Dominion ta province and

province te municipality proved a dismal
failure, the reasons being: (1). bigh prices ai
land, (2) bigh prices of materials, and

(3)

jerry-built bouses.
The Curtis repart points out:
No more unfavaurable periad could have been

chosen, because land values, building materials
and other costs were still at a greatly infla-ted
level induced by the war, and the subsequent
decline of prices lef t the properties carrying
excessive burdene ai fiixed charges.

272

SENATE

The average loan amounted to approximately $4,000 and the actual cost was in the
neighbourhood of $5,000 per unit. These
figures compare most unfavourably with the
average loan under the Housing Acts from
1935 to 1943 of $3,305. This attempt at
public housing has been described as a dismal
failure, and certainly it was a serious black
eye to all such attempts. The experience
gained should not be forgotten at the present
time, for conditions are very similar to those
prevailing at the close of the previous war.
The price of materials is high.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: The rapacity of the
landlords has net mitigated.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, that is net true.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: While the experience is valuable, it should be seen in its truc
perspective and assessed at its true value.
The shortage of houses was acute, as it is
today, and the enterprise did, as I have
said, provide over 6,000 houses. Then as now
people could not be left without shelter, or
in crowded slum conditions, waiting for prices
to come down or for the vacant lot holders
to loosen up, although something might have
been donc to deal with the landed gentry.
But I submit nothing was done.
The general result was that no further
parliamentary action took place until the
"hungry thirties," when the combined pressure of idle men and housing shortage again
compelled attention.
A special committee
of the House of Commons reported that there
was no apparent prospect of the low-rental
housing need being met through unaided
private enterprise building for profit.
Then in 1935 Parliament passed the Dominion Housing Act, under which the Government embarked upon the general policy of
housing assistance which it is following today.
The Government undertook te advance 20
per cent of the value of land and building
to an approved lending institution, which in
practice meant largely insurance, loan and
trust companies. The lending institution was
to advance 60 per cent, which made the total
advance 80 per cent of the value, a marked
contrast to the usual 60 per cent then obtainable on first mortgage. The lending institution paid 3 per cent te the Government and
charged 5 per cent on the whole loan, thus
naking a profit of 2 per cent on the Governnent's share of the advance. Moreover the
repayment of principal was amortized at 20
years, and the principal, interest and taxes
were collected by the lending institution on
a monthly basis. The inclusion of tax payHon. Mr. ROEBUCK.

ments in the amounts collected for amortizatien of the house was an innovation, and it
worked with remarkably good effect. The
taxes were collected by the financial institutions and paid over te the municipality,
so that very few houses erected with the
financial assistance of the 1935 Act have ever
had arrears of taxes charged against them.
Lending institutions and home builders were
somewhat slow in taking advantage of this
Act, and unemployment, which house building
might have relieved, grew to disastrous
proportions. In 1937, in consequence of the
publie situation the Dominion Government
passed the Home Improvement Loans Guarantee Act, permitting individuals to borrow
from banks and lending institutions amounts
up to $2,000 without collateral or note endorsement, for the rehabilitation of private
homes, the Government guaranteeing losses
to a maximum of 15 per cent of the aggregate
amounts loaned by each lending company.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
lend.

The banks too could

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK : Yes, the banks too
could lend, but I think that for the most part
the lending was done by institutions other
than banks. However, I am not clear about
that.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, the banks too lent
under this Act.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK:
The loans were
repayable in periods up to five years, and the
effective interest rate was about 6 per cent.
A total of $50,000,000 had been adlvanced
under this Act at the end of October, 1940,
when, due to the war and widespread employment, loans were discontinued.
Then followed that important Act known
as the Dominion Housing Act, 1938, under
which the amount adrvanceable in the case of
a single family dwelling constructed by an
owner for his own occupation, and costing
not more than $2,500, was increased to 90
per cent of the value of land and building.
The former interest rates of 3 per cent and
5 per cent were continued, and the Government guaranteed losses up to 25 per cent.
The 1935 Act was an experiment and loans
made under it totalled $4,400,000, as compared with more than $80,000,000 under the
Act of 1938.
It is te be noted that building took place
under the 1935 and 1938 Acts, when costs of
land, materials and labour were low, in
marked contrast to the conditions just prior
to and following the first Great War. Values
have been rising ever since the 1938 Act went
into effect, and as a result of these favourable

NOVEMBER 20, 1945
conditions the total losses upon advances of
over $85,000,000 made under the Acts of 1935
and 1938 have been less than $1,000. There
are very few cases where, payments have
not been kept Up. 0f course, there is much
stili outstanding, for the leans were for 20
year periods, andl we are not yet out of the
woods.
In 1939 the Dominion Government passed
the Central Mortgage Bank Act, constituting
a body politic and corporate, with a share
capital of 850,000,000 to be subscribed in ul
by the Dominion Government, and the à it
te issue debentures guaranteed by the Dominion to an amount of $200,000,000.
The function of the bank was to readjust
mortgages by the reduction of interest andthe lengtbening of terms of repayment. The
act was proclaimed, but due to the outbreak
of the war, did nlot go into effeet. Bill 23
now contains a section for its repeal.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Is that the only Act
that is to be repealed?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: That is the only
Act ,to be repealed.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: TJnder this present bill?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Yes. You see, the
Acts of 1935 and 1938 are no longer effective
so far as the making of loans is concerned.
However, the responsibility for the administratiop of those Acta stili exists because
business transacted under them will not be
concluded for a period of twenty years. They
remain in existence and are to be considered
at the present time because the obligations,
responsibilities, powers and immunities they
conferred upon the Minister are transferred
under Bill 23, along with the most recent Art,
to the corporation wbich is now being set up.
The Housing Act wbich is affected, and the
terms of which we are asked to deal with
specifically, is the National Housing Act of
1944. 1 have taken the liberty, honourable
gentlemen, of placing before you twenty-five
copies of the Adt.
The. Housing Act which is of greatest interest at the moment is the one recently
pass" and known as the National Housing
Act of 1944. It is the only Act under which
housing boans are now being made, though
there are responsibilities stili- outstanding
umder the former Acts. Under this Art encouragement to house ownership is stili more
generous than it was i.mder former acts, which
it consolidates and enlarges.
Part I is enititled "Housing for Home Owners." Agamn the amounts advaneeable are
increased. It will be noted, honourable gentle47704-191

273

men, that by Section 4 advances may be
made up to 95 per cent of the first $2,000 of
lending value of the house.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Does that include the
value of 'the lot?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Yes, it does.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: That is the cost?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Not exactly the
cost. The lending value is slightly different..
Under unusual circumstances the cost could
be less than the lending value; and certainlyone could imagine circumnstances in which the
lending value would be less than the cost,
Us'ually however the cost would be the lending value. Advances will be made up to 85
per cent of the next $2,000 of lending value,
and 70 per cent of the amount by which the
value exceeds $4,000.
The rate of interest payable by the borrower bas been lowered from 5 per cent to
4J per cent, though the rate payable to the
Government by the lending institution remains at 3 per cent. However, when the
lending institution's profit on 'the Government's share of the advance is added to the
returns obtained by the lending institution
on its own share of the advance, the resulting
rate to the lending institution on is own
share is about 5 per cent.
Repayment of the boans is amortized in
some cases for periods as long as tbirty years,
thougli the general terni is twenty years.
There is special encouragement to the making
of boans in remote districts, (a) by grants to
loaning institutions to compensate for the
extra exp ense of going into the country, and
(b) by larger guarantees on boans in the less
desirable districts as well as on lower-cost
bouses. Thus the guarantee increases as the
cost derreases, and with remoteness. This
effort to give service outside of tbe cities ànd
towns bas so far not been very successful, due
in part to restrictions on wartime staff.
Section 4, sub-section 3, is an effort te,
encourage co-operative housing projects by
providing loans for family units in joint
enterprises on termes similar to those extendied
to other house owners. The Act provides
under this home owners' part that the Minister mnay maske boans and pay bosses up to
$100,000,000 out of the Consolidated, Revenue
Fund.
Part II of the Act is an attempt to. encourage housing projeets for rentai purposes and
f or slum clearance. On ordinary commercial
rental-house projects the boan may be Up to
go per cent of the value, of which the Government advances 25 per cent. The interest
charged cannot exceed 44 per cent and the

274

SENATE

period for repaymcnt of principal is twenty
years, or with proper zoning it may be twentyfive years. The monthly instairnents include
taxes--a very beneficial provision, and one
which is quite satisfactory to the municipalitics. The Governrnent, stands gond for 15
per cent of the lending institution,'s aggregate losses. That does flot mean 15 per cent
of each individual loan. In some cases it
may mean the whole loan, but 15 per cent
of the aggregatc amount advanced hy the
Ioaning institution.
Section 9 provides that the Government
will advance to limited dividend corporations
as rnueh as 90 pceT cent of the value of lowrentai housing projects.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Section 9 of the proposcd bill?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: No, not of the bilil,
but >of the Act of 1944, copies of whieh I
distibuted.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: How many have built
under that provision?
Hon. Mc. ROEBUCK: 1 will givc the
figures on that in a few minutes. This question of limitcd dividend corporations bas
hardly become operative, yet.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:

It was in the 1944 Act.

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Yes, that is truc,
but as yet it bas scarcely becuine operative.
I will give sorne figures on it in a few
moments.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I do not wisb to interrupt rny honourable frienil, but undier the
National Housing Act of 1944, the loans were
made from different corporations, were thcy
not?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Not municipal
corporations.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I mean from the aending institutions.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: That is correct, t4he
lending institutions.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: And under the new act
the loans will corne from the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: No, boans will not
ho made by the Central Mortgagc and Housing Corporation, exccpt to the lending institutions which in turn will make boans te,
individuals.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: The 'Housing Corporation will lcnd the rnoney to, the lending inistitution, and the lcnding institution will lend
it to the individual?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK.

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Yes, that is correct. That was the principle of the operation
set up in 1935, continued in 1938 and followed
in 1944.
I arn now speaking of the special provision
in Section 9 of the 1944 Act with reference
to, lirnited dividcnd corporations. The Government will advance as much as 90 per cent of
the value of low-rental housing projccts to
lirnited dividend corporations, at 3 per cent,
and for terms as long as fifty years when the
houses are needed by reason of overcrowding
and congestion, or by reason of the substandard character of existing accommodation
in the arca where, the project is situate.
Dividcnds are limited te five per cent.
This is a most interesting atternpt at bringing about still lower rents, for the 5 per
cent dividend lirnit is upon the limited dividcnd corporatien's own advance of 10 per cent
of the coat of the projeet, while the Government advance of 90 per cent bears interest
at only 3 per cent.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
I amn sorry
to intcrrupt, but I suppose my honourable
friend knows that a large company in Montreal put up 10 per cent, got back part of its
money, but suffcred considerable losses?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: That bas not
deterred other companies from active participation at the present tirne. I suppose that
war conditions were the cause of the fizzling
eut of that projeet.
H-on. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
No.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: At ahl events we are
erncrging frorn war conditions to-day, and
I sec no insuperable obstacle in the way of
the company putting up 10 per cent while
the Cevernrent puts up 90 per cent on a
limitcd dividcnd set-up of 5 per cent.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: 1 arn sorry to interrupt
my honourable friend, but I am trying te
understand this proposition.
Under the
National Heusing Act the financial institutions
were lcnding the rneney and the Governmcnt
was guarantceing a certain amount.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: It was advancing a
certain ameunt and guaranteeing certain
losses if they occurred.
Hon. M.r. IEGER: Are those institutions
s0 short of funds today thaýt the Government
bas te lend them money?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Apparently they are
short for this purpese, because we have net
had the building activity whicoh the demand
requires. It seems te be the consensus of
opinion in the House today, and in the days

NOVEMBER 20, 1945
gone by, that the Government must offer
assistance if we are going te eupply adequate
honsing.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Do you expect individuals rather than companies to lend under
those circumgtances? No man would.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: They would flot lend
under the low rate of interest.
Hon. Mr. EULER: And the chance of loss,
with no security.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: And tying up capital
for long periods, wi.th the possibility of loss.
Hon. M.r. ROEBUCK: Qui te so. Fancy
putting up money, as I have just stated, on
a fifty-year basis. That is a man's life-time
-if hie is fortunate enough to live that long.
What about twen.ty-year advances under
mortgages? No private individuals will make
such a Joan as that at 5 per cent intere.qt.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Sure they will.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Not very màny Qi
tbem. Certainly they have not done so in
the past in amounts adequate to meet the
demands of the publie for housing.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Do you not think that
if the Govern.ment would lift the control over
the landIord there would be more housing
accommodation?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Well, at one time
landiords were not subject to any restrictions,
and the records prove conclusively that there
w-as a shortage of houses then.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Not to the degree that
there is at present.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK:
Perhaps flot,
although the deficiencies after the last war,
when there were no restrictions, were not
much less than those of today. 0f course, it
gocs without saying that if you allow rente
to rise, owners will be encouraged to build.
But the drastie features of the present shortage
are due not so much to the Jack of ineentîve
to build as to the fact that during recent
years we have d'evoted such a large part of
our energies to the war effort that materials
and labour for house building have been
unobtainable.
Now let me corne back to what I have
described as an interesting attempt to bring
clown renta by promoting building. As I
pointed out, the Government je prepared to
advance to these limited dividend corporations
90 per cent of the value of the building, at
3 per cent interest. and the dividends the
corporations may make are limited to 5 per
cent. So, once a sufficient amount has been

accumulated to satisfy the 5 per cent on the
cost of operation, the balance, must go into
reduced rents. That at least je the hope.
I may add that the purpose of this legislation is flot to enrich builders, or ownere of
sub-standard property, but rather to promote
satisfactory housing at low ratee of rent.
It should also be mentioned that no project
under the Act has been approved up to date.
That 1 think is the answer to the question
asked by the honourable gentleman from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig).
Hon.. Mr. HAIG: 1 knew that was the
answer.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I understand that
some projects are now ready for approval, or
at least, for consideration, but that none have
as yet been finalized.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: But the people
who did lend 10 per cent lost a considerable
part of their money.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I know that no
advances have been made under this section
of the Act. Somebody may have made an
abortive attempt to operate under the Act,
but no project bas so far been approved,.
If honourable senators wilI look at section il
they will see that a further effort ie made to
effeet rental savings by giving to insurance
companies under Dominion jurisdiction the
right to invest in housing projecte an amount
equivalent to 5 per cent of the companies'
assets in Canada, which would total roughly
$125,'000,a00 for ail if e companies combined.
It is hoped that the companies will make their
advances through limited dividend corporation
subsidiaries.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Can they go into
business without forming these subsidiary
companies?
Honý. Mr. ROEBUCK: I think they can,
but they do not get the 90 per cent advance
except through a limited dividend corporation.
Hon. Mr.
not face the
provisions of
is proper for

HAYIYEN: Would they etill
pro-blem of complying with the
the Insuran-ce Act as to what
investment by a life insuranoe

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Generally speaking,
yee; but the legislation. now contemplated
will rernove the difficulties arising out of the
Insurance Act to thie limited degree.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: That ie why these
eubsidiary companies are being formed, ie it
not?

276

SENATE

Hon. Mr., ROEBUCK: No. Even if subsidiary companies were formed it is very
doubtful if an insurance company could,
under the terms of its charter, advance money
to enable such a concern to make loans that
are not permitted under the Act.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: But an insurance
company can buy the debentures or bonds
secured by the real estate of such a subsidiary company.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUOK: ýHere, however,
direct permission is given to the insurance
companies to invest a small proportion of
their funds. As the moneys of insurance
companies are somewhat in the nature of
trust funds and every assurance is due to the
policyholders, the Government will guarantee
the full return of the investment, and 21 per
cent interest for the life of the project; that
is to say, up to fifty years.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: That is pretty good.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Indeed it is. That
means that loss is virtually impossible.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
taking the rap.

The Government is

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: This permits the
use of insurance trust funds to promote building projects. While the subject is now governed by section 11 of this Act, supplemented
by Order in Council, I undterstand that a
special Act is to be introduced shortly to
clarify and consolidate the law with respect
to insurance companies.
Furthermore, I
understand that the insurance companies are
actively co-operating. They have incorporated
a company under the name of Housing Enterprises, Limitedi, to be owned by all the insurance companies jointly. Projects will shortly
be submitted, but none are as yet approved.
Now I want to turn to slum clearance,
which I realize is a difficult and important
subject. Slum conditions are a disgrace to
modern civilization. In the congested districts of our cities they are a by-product of
land speculation, and at least in main part
the result of our municipal system of taxation.
In order to assist in the clearing of these
blighted or substandard areas, and without
inconvenience to the land speculators, the
Government under section 12 will make to
municipalities grants of 50 per cent of the net
cost of clearing such areas as are suitable
for low-cost rental projects. The municipality
is expected to acquire the land, clear it, and
then sell it to those who will use it for house
building purposes, whereupon the net loss will
be divided equally between the municipality
and the Government.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN.

Another subject dealt with in this bill and
one that is incidental to its main purposes is
home improvement. There are provisions
whereby loans made by banks and credit
agencies for home improvement or extension
may be guaranteed up to 5 per cent of the
aggrega'te of the loans, when the rate of
interest charged to the borrower is not more
than 5 per cent. But this part of the Act
has not yet been proclaimed.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: That would be 5 per
cent of the aggregate loans. That is, if one
loan was defaulted, a claim could be made on
5 per cent of the total.
Hon. Mr. ROEBTJCK: That is right. If it
were only 5 per cent of each individual loan
the guarantee would be of small value. The
guarantee is 5 per cent of all the loans which
any lending institution has made.
This legislation follows the Home Improvement Loans Guarantee Act of 1937. Under
that Act there have been made to date 125,000
loans, and the Government's loss rate is about
1 per cent. Should all of the now outstanding
loans fail, it is estimated that the Government's loss would not exceed 2 per cent of
the amounts advanced. The Act went out of
effect, and because of the present shortage of
materials and labour the corresponding sections of the 1944 Act have not yet been
proclaimed.
Part V of the 1944 Act gives the Minister
authority to investigate housing conditions,
gather information, prepare plans, and engage
in technical research. This i purely administrative, so I pass on.
Now I come to the measure itself which
deals with all these important matters that I
have described. That is Bill 23, which is now
before us. Up to the present time the Dominion Housing Acts from 1935 to 1944 inclusive
have been administered by the Department
of Finance. There are many things in these
Acts which the Minister is required to do
personally. Many important documents are
to be signed by him, and negotiations with
lending institutions, banks and insurance
companies frequently involve him personally.
There is very considerable correspondence.
The scope of the 1944 Act is considerably
greater than that of the former Acts. This
did not matter much during the war years,
as house building was not encouraged and
was at a minimum. But now the war is over,
and men's minds are turning to this important
subjent of providing adequate and satisfactory
shelter. Accordingly the work is growing and
the present staff is altogether inadequate.
Under wartime restrictions loans have been
made for the construction of single-family
dwellings only. Altogether 476 municipalities

NOVEMBER 20, 1945
have taken advantage of the Act of 1944 and
loans made under the Housing Acta and the
Home Improvement Act between 1933 and
the outbreak of the war aggregated about
$100,000,000. This is but a portion of the
capital so invested, for the owners made contributions on their own account. These figures
indicate a very- considerable business, and with
the close of the war they will increase rapidly.
The subjeet of housing is vastly important
from many points of view. The Govermment's
business in. this regard must be handled adequately, effectively and efficiently. Something must be doue about it. The question is
what. Obviously the housing question must
flot be left as a personal burden on an overworked Minister of Finance and an inadequate
departmental staff. It could, of course, be
referred to a Commissioner, as is immigration
in the Department of Mines and Resources.
That is the solution which 1 think 1 would
prefer. As I said recently, I do not like
governiment by irresponsible hoards, commissions and Crown companies. One wonders
when this practice will end, and where it is
leading. However, be it observed that in other
instances in which the Governiment deals in
money with the individual it delegates its
functions to a body politic and corporate,
whieh *may contract on its own accoti sue
and be sued, and act in ail respecte as an artificial person. The firat instance of this is to,
be found under Section .5 of the Bank of
Canada Act, 1938, which makes clear that
the bank is a body politic and corporate
dealing in Government money with individuals. The second is in the Industrial
Development Bank Act, recently passed by
this House, which set up a body politic and
corporate to make industrial boans. The third
instance appears in the Canadian Farm Loan
Act, by which a board is established a body
politic and corporate, and the Domninion is to,
subscribe $5,000,000 of its capital shares. The
Central Mortgage Bank Act of 1939 also sets
up a body politic and corporate, with power to,
issue $200,000,000 in Government guaranteed
diebentures, the purpose being to ameliorate,
by way of refunding, the rates and ternis of
mortgages. This Act was proclained, but
because the war broke out i-t did not go into
operation. Now it is toi be repealed by
Bill 23.
On the other hand, we have the Veterans'
Land Act, under which is transacted the
business of huying land and selling it to
veterans. This business is conducted by a
director. The problemi deait with here is a
personal one, the rehabilitation of the veteran,
and the land transactions are merely inci-

277

dental. The personal elements under that
Act could not, ini the nature of things, be
referred to a Crown company.
Under the measure. before us the Government is going into the money-lending business,
in conneotion with which personal. credita,
the value of property and the risk factor must
be appraised. Policy, as distinguished from
administration, is taken care of under this
measure. The National Housing Act of 1944
sets out specifically just what can be douethe terms and conditions under which a bean
can be mnade, rates of intereat, and the period
for repayment. The corporation is not given
carte blanche to boan money. Parliament
determines the policy and for a amaîl fee the
corporation administers the loaning functions,
within strict limits. That this is the wisest
policy is open to argument; but something
must be done, and this is the method selected.
The need for housing is &a great that I would
n-ot delay the makmng of boans a single day
by arguing over details of the meth-ods to be
employed. I therefore support the principie
involved in the bill.
The explanatory notes to Bill 23 are very
short. It will be noted that this is a bull to
establish, under the namne of Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation, an organization which will have three main functions:
(a) To set in place of the Minister in the
operation of the Housing Acts, except for the
payment ýof moneys out of the Consolidated
Revenue Fund, or the making of grants for
slumi clearance; (b) Vo provide discounting
facilities for lending institutions; (c) to conduet research into the business of lending
money on the security of mortgages.
The paid-up capital of the corporation is
to be $25,000,000, to come out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. For its housing
functions the corporation will have moneys
already appropriated under the Housing Acts.
For discounting purposes the corporation has
825,000.000 capital and a reserve fund of
$5,000,000.
There are to be ten directors, including a
President and a Vice-President, each appointed
for a seven year termi; three officials holding
office during pleasure, the Governor of the
Bank of Canada, the Deputy Minister of
Finance and the Deputy Minister of Reconstruction; and five other directors, rotating
in three year Versus. The pu.rpose, I understand, is Vto
have one director from each main
economic region of Canada-Ontario, Quebec,
the Maritimes, the Prairie Provinces and
British Columbia. Each region will be repre2ented by its own director.

278

SENATE

A directorship is apparently intended to be
no great plum, for the directors who are appointed by virtue of the offices they hold
receive no remuneration as directors; and the
fees receivable by all the other five directors
are limited to $10,000 per annum. For five
directors, that is an average of $2,000 each
per annum, apart of course, from expenses.
The management of the business of the corporation is to be in the hands of an Executive
Committee composed of four directors, the
President, the Vice-President, the Deputy
Minister of Finance, and one other te be
selected by the Board. Thus the directors
living at a distance need net be plagued with
too frequent meetings.
Section 14 provides that the officers and
employees of the corporation will net be servants of His Majesty. This means that the
corporation will be responsible for their acts
within the scope of their employment, and
that they may enjoy the luxury of being sued
and having their wages garnisbeed. The corporation may establish its own pension fund;
and if employees have rights under the Civil
Service Superannuation Act they are preserved.
By Section 17 the capital of the corporation
is to be $25,000,000, paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. There are to be no
shares, shareholders or shareholders' meetings,
and there will be no dividends.
All profits of the corporation after the
establishment of a reserve fund of S5,000,000
are payable to the Consolidated Revenue
Fund. It is intended that about $14,000,000
of the capital will be paid to the Crown immediately, to purchase the Crown's equity in
loans now held under the housing Acts. This
money is to be immediately returned to the
Corporation as an advance. Section 23, subsection 1, authorizes the Minister te advance
to the corporation the aggregate amount
owing under the housing Acts, which is the
amount te be paid to the Crown under Section 20. Section 23, subsection 1, paragraph
(b) enables the Minister to advance to the
corporation amounts equal to the total
moneys payable to His Majesty in respect of
loans made to date under the National Housing Act of 1944. This is a complicated way
of saying that the loaning activities of the
corporation shall be finanerd out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, and that the
$25,000,000 capital shall remain intact for
use in the discounting business of the corporation. There are a half dozen complicated
sentences that mean just what I have said
in a few words.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK.

By Section 24 the corporation is required
to repay · o the Crown any outstanding adt
vanrces in excess of the aggregate amounts
owing te the corporation.
Section 25 however provides that the Crown
stands liable for the losses of the corporation,
and the Minister shall reimburse the corporation for payments made and losses incurred in connection with loans made and
guarantees given, or te be made or given,
under the Housing Acts, the Home Improvement Act 1937 or any contract entered under
these Acts.
By section 26 the loans and guarantees of
the corporation are limited to the amounts
appropriated by Parliament and made available for such purposes. I call attention te
that section because it contains a very wise
precaution. The moneys must be appropriated by Parliament.
Under section 18 the rights, powers, duties,
liabilities and functions of the Minister of
Finance are transferred to the corporation
with two exceptions only. The Minister retains his authority to make payments out of
the Consolidated Revenue Fund, and the
corporation is te be financed by advances
made to it out of the fund by the Minister.
Grants for slum clearance under section 12
of the National Housing Act are in the
nature of gifts, and the authority to make
themn is therefore retained by the Minister.
Section 19 provides that contracts already
entered into under the Housing Acts are to
be performed by the corporation; and Section 21 authorizes the corporation to make
loans or payments which formerly were made
by the Minister under the Housing Acts. By
Section 22 amounts owing the Crown under
the Housing Acts are made payable to the
corporation.
Section 27 provides for a central organizatien te make research in relation te the
loaning of money on mortgage security. There
is little information of that kind in existence
today, and an organized study will be of
advantage to the publir, the mortgage companies and this new corporation. Provision
is made for an exchange of information between the new corporation and lending
institutions.
The discounting powers of the corporation
provided for in Section 29 are very important.
Conditional on the willingness of the lending
institution te exchange information with the
corporation, the corporation may purchase
mortgages from the lending institution; and,
if the lending institution is a trust or loan
company. the corporation may lend it money
on the security of an assignment of, or agreement to assign mortgages. If the lending

NOVEMBER 20, 1945
institution is a trust or loan company, the
corporation may buy the company's debentures or other evidences of indebtedness, or
its guaranteed investment receipts or guaranteed investment certificates. At the present
time loan and trust companies are in a highly
liquid position so that the capital of the corporation of $25,000,000 will likely be adequate
for the discounting business of the immediate
future; but the prospective housing programme will involve finanoing on an unprecedented scale, and further applications to
Parliament for additional funds are to be
expected from time to time.
The purpose of re-discount facilities may
be summarized as follows: first, to make
mortgages a more liquid and desirabje investment for lending institutions, thus tending to
reduce m-ortgage interest rates; second, to
provide additional funds to lending institutions, thereby enabling them to meet the
anticipated demand for long term mortgage
loans on real property; and third, to promote the provision of housing.
When reading an Act one likes to observe
not only what is in it, but what is not in it.
It is to be observed that no rate of interest
on advances to trust and loan companies has
been set, as this should be left to be determined from time to time in accordance with
the circumstances of each case.
Section 30 gives to the company ancilliary
powers, such as to foreclose, hold property,
pay taxes and so forth.
I now come to Section 31. Honourable members will note there is no provision that the
Minister shall make good, to the coriporation
the losses it may sustain in connection with
its discount business. For this reason it is
thought desirable to establish a reserve fund
of $5,000,000 maximum before the profits of
the corporation become payable to the
Receiver General.
The last provisions deal with the audit.
These are extremely important and I trust
honourable members will read them. The
audit provisions are said to be substantially
those found in the Bank of Canada Act and
the Central Mortgage Bank Act, but it seems
to me that they should be strengthened in
some particulars. I suggest that the auditors
should be chartered or public accountants, if
it is possible to frame a definition along that
line. I presume the reason why this is not
specified is that so far governments have
always appointed these men. But this has to
do with protection of Parliament and the
people, not protection of an executive to whom
the auditors' reports are made. In view of
ail the circumstances, the large amounts
involved, the complexity of the business to
47704-20

279

be transacted and the importance of housing
in general, I submit that the auditors should
be the best qualified men obtainable in Canada.
I further submit that they should be required
to repor.t to the Minister, and through him to
Parliament, periodically, not when somebody
wishes to call for an audit. They should make
audits every so often.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Annual audits.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Semi-annual audits
may be required, but certainly the audits
should be made at least once a year. That
would satisfy me, but they must be full audits.
A report by the corporation, certified by the
auditors, is not sufficient. The auditors should
make an independent report. Further, the form
of the report should not be left to be
prescribed by the corporation's by-laws, even
though these are approved by counsel. My
point is that these audits are for the protection of the public, not for the protection of
counsel.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: And there should not
be too many exceptions in the auditors'
certificate.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Let us have no
exceptions. It should be settled by the Act
that the report must include certain things
such as are usually set forth in a detailed
balance sheet of assets and liabilities and
operating account.
The fiscal year of the corporation is the
calendar year. The corporation is required
within ten weeks after its close to transmit to
the Minister a statement, in form prescribed
by its by-laws, of its accounts for the past
fiscal year. This the Minister publishes in
the Canada Gazette and lays before Parliament. A mere statement of the accounts of
the past fiscal year is entirely inadequate to
present the financial affairs of the corporation.
I presume that this measure will be referred
to a committee for thorough examination,
particularly as to the provisions for audit and
for continued control by Parliament over the
operations of this Crown company. I have
tried to make clear the general principles of
the measure and to describe its more important features as well as the general conditions
under which it will operate. Perhaps I have
given more detail than it is customary to give
when explaining a bill, and I wish to thank
honourable members for their great patience
in listening to me so long.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

REVISED EDITION

280

SENATE
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Honourable Mr. Robertson moved that the
Bill be referred to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
OTTAWA AGREEMENT BILL
MOTION

FOR

SECOND

READING

Hon. WISHART
McL.
ROBERTSON
moved the second reading of Bill 161, an Act
to authorize a certain Agreement between His
Majesty the King and the Corporation of
the City of Ottawa.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, it bas been my privilege to
speak on previous bills authorizing an agreement between the Dominion and the City of
Ottawa, and I should like to refer briefly to
this one. The measure consists of one short
clause, followed by a schedule in which the
new agreement is set out. It may be remembered that a little more than a year ago a
joint committee of the Senate and House of
Commons was appointed to investigate and
report upon the relations between the federal
Government and the municipal authorities of
Ottawa, and that that committee presented a
unanimous report to bath Houses. The report
was in two branches, one relating to the cost
involved in the services rendered by the municipality to the Dominion Government, and
the other relating to the operations and scope
of the Federal District Commission. I think
it would be well for honourable senators to
bear in mind that this bill has nothing whatever to do with the Federal District Commission area, or with the proposed Greber report,
or the plan for the beautification of the
capital and the development of Gatineau
Park and other areas outside of Ottawa. This
bill simply authorizes the Dominion Gov-

ernment to increase from $100,000 to $300,000

the annual grant to the municipality for
water, street maintenance, police and fire
protection and other services extended to
Dominion Government buildings.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Does the Government
not pay for the water?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Not all of it. Clause
2 of the agreement on page 3 of the bill
states that the annual payment of $300,000
shall he in full payment, satisfaction and discharge of ail claims and demands by or on the
part of the Corporation on the Government, in
respect of water supplied for street sprinkling,
for fire protection by the Corporation to any of
the buildings or premises owned or occupied by
the Government ...
lion. Mr. ROEBUCK.

Clause 9 of the agreement, on page 5 of the
bill, reads:
The Government agrees to pay the Corporation
for a supply of water from the water works of
the Corporation for use in and on all buildings
and parts of buildings, lands and premises in
the City of Ottawa now or hereafter owned and
occupied by the Government any time during the
period of years commencing the first day of
July, 1944
Hon. Mr. EULER: The Government does
pay extra for that water.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Yes, it pays a special
rate for that, 13 cents per 100 cubic feet.
The recommendation for the increased grant
is not the result of any strict accounting
between the city and the Government. The
sum of $300,000 has been arrived at largely
as a compromise between the amount that
has been paid for a number of years and the
amount elaimed by the city.
If honourable senators take the trouble to
read the very brief report reviewing the
evidence heard before the joint committee,
they will see that the city of Ottawa really
asked for $1,597,000.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Was not $300,000
recommended by the committee?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: The amount recommended by the joint committee after hearing
the evidence was $300,000. It was a compromise between the $100,000 formerly given
and the amount asked. Two members of the
committee from the other House moved that
the grant should be half a million dollars.
In the final analysis the committee unanimously decided upon $300,000.
I wish to point out that in addition to the
proposal to grant half a million dollars there
were two other recommendations. They are
not dealt with in this bill, but they represent very important factors in the relationship between the Covernment and the
municipality. One was for the construction
of a sewage disposal plant in this city, a
utility which is badly needed if the plans
for the future are to be carried out. The
other was that a union terminal company
should be formed to plan and manage the
entrance of railways into this city and to
eliminate many of the cross-town lines which
embarrass the handling of traffic in and out of
the city. These two suggestions were based
on the idea that there should be financial
co-operation between the municipality and
the Government, and I believe they were
factors in enabling the committee to reach a
unanimous conclusion regarding the $300,000
grant.
No doubt some other honourable senators
desire to speak on this bill. I would remind

NOVEMBER 20, 1945
honourable enators that bille based on this
agreement will corne before the Senate again
in the usual way, and we will be asked, to pass
themn as we have done in the past. In the
meantime I do flot think I need elaborate
further on this bill.
Hon. Mr. PATERS ON.- May I ask the
lionourable senator a question in regard to
this bill? When a property in the city is
sold to a legation it immediately goes off
the tax list. ks this bill int-ended to provide
payment to the city to reimburse it for the
hs of taxes?
Hou. Mr. LAMBERT: My understanding
is that this bill has nothing whatsoever to do
with the question the honourable senator
lias just asked. This bill simply provides
for an agreement on which future grants will
lie based. Since 1925 the grants have been
$100,000 each year. It was decided u'animously
in committee, as I explained, that the grant
should 110w be. 8300,000.
Hon. 'Mr. PATERSON: I understand that
ail riglit; but is it, a fact that properties purchased by legations go off the tax roll
immediately? Does the city lose the revenue
fromn those properties as a resuit,' and does
the Dominion Government assume responsibu]ity for the, loss?
Hon. Mz. EULER: Yes, but properties go
off tax rolls in other countries where we bave
legations.
H.on. Mr. LAMBERT: If I underatand the
lionourable senator's question correctly, when
a property holder in the city of Ottawa seils
to the Government hie is imme.diately relie-ved
of taxes on that property.
Hon. Mr. PATERS ON: Legation property
as well?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: The moment the
properties- are purchased hy the Dominion
or provincial governîmente they are free from
taxation. That is provided for in Section 125
of the B.N.A. Act.
Hon.. Mrs. WILSON: The legations are
exempt from taxation, but they are flot the
property of the Government.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: When a legation is
set up in this city a definite asseasment is
estabiahed. There is a fixed assessment, and
the Government of Canada pays taxes toth
city on the basis of that assessment. There is
a re-ciprocal arrangement between Canada and
the countries where our ambassadors are
residing.
47704-201

Hon. Mr. EULER: How is that fixed. asseassment arrived at?
By agreement
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT:
between the Public Works Department and
the City of Ottawa.
Hon. W. R. DAVIES: Honourable senators,
I should like ýto make a few commenta in
support of this bill. I feel that the joint
commit-tee of the Senate and House of Coinmons have arrived at a very reasonable compromise. It would, be ungracious of me to
oppose a bill brought in as the resuit of the
deliberations ýof a committee on which there
were five members of tliis House, and, of
which an honourable senator was cliairman. I
think, as tlie honourable senator froin Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) has said, the committee
did a very good job.
Tlie city of Ottawa asked for $1,597,000.
After the matter was considered over a period
of daya in .committee, the member of the
House of Commons for Ottawa moved that
the amount lie increased fromn 8100,00 to
$500,000. An amendment was offered, and
the figure of 8300,000 was arrived at. I read
-every word of the report, and I desire to
commend the honourable senator from, Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) and the other members
of the committtee who live in this city on
the fair approach they miade to the problem
which confronted them.
Now I wish to say a few words about the
city of Ottawa, and offer a few commenta
about other niunicipalities. There: is an old
saying that sometimes you eannot see the
forest for the trees. I arn of the opinion
that occasionally people of Ottawa cannot see
the forest of Canada for the trees of Ottawa.
They seem to be so circumscribed in thefr
viewpoint that ahI they think about is the
city of Ottawa and what it should receive
Under this bill
fromn the £ilovernment.
Ottawa is going to get 8300,000 a year by
way of a grant or, it is claimed, in payment for services. In addition, it will get
$132,357 a year for water. What the city
really wanted was 28 per cent of its rateable
assessment on property occupied by Federal
Government buildings and which, it was
claimed, amounted to $1,597,000.
The situation that obtains here obtains in
every municipality where there are Government buildings. There is no complaint to be'
made on that score. However, I cannot
altogether agree with the honourable, senator
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) when lie
says that the grant to the Federal District
Commission has nothing to do with the city
of Ottawa. The Commission gets about

282

SENATE

$350,000 a year from the Government, 71 per
cent of which is spent within the municipality. The citizens of this city benefit, at
least indirectly, frem the beautiful parks,
driveways and other projects which are set
up and maintained by the Federal District
Commission. It seems to me, therefore, that
when the city claims that it should be reimbursed by the people of Canada for services
to Dominion public buildings, there is a
failure to recognize that here in the city of
Ottawa the country maintains the greatest
industry in the whole of Canada, an industry
which many cities would gladly welcome.
There are 40,000 civil servants or more
residing in the city of Ottawa. Taking a
low average salary of $70 a month, which is
a little better than 36 cents an hour, the payroll is $2,800,000 a month, or $33,600,000 a
year. That money is paid te the people
who live here and is spent in the city. I do
not think the authorities of the city of Ottawa
or its citizens generally realize what great
benefit it is to them to have the seat of
the Government here. Alderman Coulter in
speaking before the committee pointed out
how very fair was the claim of $1,597,000.
He suggested that if everyone in Canada contributed three four-cent postage stamps a
year, it would meet that claim. Speaking for
myself, I can see no reason in the world why
the people of Canada should buy three fourcent stamps a year ,to help pay the taxes of
the city of Ottawa. In any event, the city
got one-fifth of what was asked for, so the
citizens of Canada are each of them going
to contribute a two-cent postage stamp to
provide this $300,000.
Now I wish to say a word or two about
the Ottawa Journal. I am a great admirer
of the Ottawa Journal; as a newspaper man
I think it is one of the brightest papers in
the Dominion. The cardinal sin of a newspaper is to become dull. The' Journal is
never dull; it is always edited well, and for
the information of this honourable body I
may say it is the most quoted newspaper in
Canada. I do net always agree with its
editorials-some I agree with and others I
do not-but I always enjoy them.
On Tuesday, August 14, 1945, the Ottawa
Journal published this editorial:
Sometimes we think that if more people understood more clearly that the Government has no
imoney of its own, that everything it spends for
harbours or post offices or social security services, must be paid for by the people themselves,
there would be less enthusiasm for expenditures
and services-and lower taxes. Unfortunately,
very many people don't reason that way. They
seldom think, if they think at all, about where
Government gets its money, or about where the
national income comes from, or about what
Hon. Mr. DAVIES.

might happen if that national income should
become mortgaged too heavily. Their idea seems
to be that the Government has some mysterious
money source of its own, that -it doesn't have to
eut its financial coat according to its financial
cloth; as a consequence all sorts of proposed
expenditures, just so long as they are advanced
in the name of ",progress" or of "reform, " are

hailed with acclaim-with con-sequent inevitable
growth of bureaucracy, and costly overhead, and
taxes.
Now we are going to contribute an additional $200,000 a year ýto the city of Ottawa.
I shall be interested to sec what the Ottawa
Journal will have to say about that.
Another way the Ottawa Journal treated
this matter was as if Parliament bad nothing
to do with it at all. During the last, week
or two there has been a lot of debate in
a.nother place about the supremacy of Parliament. I am in thorough agreement with
those who maintain tha.t Parliament is
supreme, but I do not think the Ottawa
Journal feels that way. In a front-page story
dealing with the joint committee's report,
the Ottawa Journal on the 2nd of August,
1914, referred to the committee's proposal for
increasing the grant to $300,000 as being "sure
of acceptance by both Houses."
But I do not think that is quite as bad as
the editorial of November 15. 1945.
It is
headed "That extra $200,000 a year," and is
about the most naive editorial that I have
read in many a long day. We were told last
year that the city of Ottawa was having a
very difficuilt time, that 28 per cent of its
rateable property was occupied by the federal
Government and exempt from taxes. The
Mayor and members of the Ottawa Board of
Control estimated that a grant of $1,597,000
was required to reimburse the city for its
services and enable it te get by. Incidentally,
I might point out that the Ottawa tax rate
was 32'. mills. Well, the rate in the city of
Kingston was 34j mills, and during the
depression years it wen-t up to 424 mil's.
But let me come to this editorial in the
Ottawa Journal of November 15:
The city of Ottawa lenceforth is to receive
$300,000 a year from the Dominion treasury instead of $100,000 as in the past.
Never mind what the House of Commons
might do, or the Senate; the Ottawa Journal
concludes that the city undoubtedily will
receive that money. The edito.rial goes on
at some length, but I think the best part of
it is this:
The Journal would like to sea Board of Control and Council give serious thought to making
a better use of this federal grant. Out of it
$100,000 properly could go into current revenue,
in accordance with the established practice.
But as to the remainder, the amount of the increase, why shouldn't it be set aside in a special
fund out of which to help meet the cost of civic
buildings and other permanent improvements?

NOVEMBER 20, 1945
Saving $200,000 a year, for example, and letting
it earn interest, in five years we could build a
million-dollar city hall without a cent of debtand without adding meanwhile to the burden of
the taxpayers.
Now, honourable senators, if that is not
naive I do not know the meaning of the
word. We were teld that the city needed
81,597,000 to reimburse it for the cost of
services supplied to Dominion Government
buildings. Now it is adrmitted that the tax
rate can be maintained at 324 mills and
$200,000 of the proposed new grant can be
set aside for the building of a new city ball.
When we see the new city hall being erected,
we shall know how the money was provided.
May I make a brief comparison between
Ottawa and one or two other municipalities?
Ottawa claims that 28 per cent of all the
assessed ,property in the city is occupied by
the Dominion Government. For the benefit
of honourable senators I might state that the
Dominion Government occupies a much larger
percentage of rateable property in the city
of Halifax, but that city receives no compensation whatever. The total rateable assessment in Halifax is $52,803,100, and the total
federal Government exemption is $32,591,348.
In other words, federal Government buildings
represent 61-72 per cent of the .city's total
assessment, but pay no taxes. I believe that
in making grants to the city of Ottawa for
services rendered the federal Government is
establishing a precedent that will have to be
followed in other municipalities.
If honourable senators will allow me I
should like to read a letter written to me
on the 5th of August, 1944 by the Deputy
Clerk Treasurer of the city of Kingston:
Dear Senator Davies, I have the honour to
forward you the following resolution which was
passed unanimously at a meeting of City Council held yesterday.
"That whereas the Senate of Canada is' at
present considering a request from the City of
Ottawa for a substantial increase -in the annual
grant made to that city in lieu of taxes, and
Whereas federal buildings and Crown operated companies require municipal services to the
same extent and in the same manner as privately-owned buildings and the statutory exemption of such federally-owned property therefore
constitutes an inequitable burden on privatelyowned real estate and business.
Be it therefore resolved that the Senate be
respectfully requested to consider the recommendation that all governmentally owned and
controlled property be made subject to municipal taxation and that copies of the resolution
be forwarded to the Honourable Senator W. R.
Davies and the Honourable Angus Macdonald.,
representative for this constituency."
The city of Kingston has a total rateable
assessment of $21,151,960. The assessment on
federal Government buildings is $1,338,835.
On the percentage basis put forward by Ottawa,

283

Kingston is entitled to $45,000 a year from
the Dominion Government. At Kingston's
present rate of 34 mills, if regularly assessed,
the Government would pay that city $46,189.81.
On the same basis that the $300,000 is granted
to Ottawa, Kingston would receive $10,000 a
year. This is not a large sum, but it would
be quite a help to a small city like Kingston.
Like a good many other municipalities, Kingston has had to furnish certain services to
buildings erected by the Government during
the war. For instance, hospitals, munition
plants and buildings for the housing of soldiers
have been constructed. We were glad to get
these buildings, and I never heard a single
complaint about them. But I will say this,
that in one section of the city we had to
instal a new pumping station and storm sewers
at a cost of $500,000, yet we got no assistance
on that account from the federal Government.
I do not agree with the honourable senator
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) that Ottawa
receives no benefit from the Federal District
Commission.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Will the honourable
senator allow me to point out that I made
no such statement? What I said was that this
bill had nothing to do with the Federal District Commission.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: I beg the honourable
gentleman's pardon. This bill has nothing to
do with the Federal District Commission, but
the fact is nevertheless that Ottawa dues
benefit a great deal from the grant which the
Government makes to that Commission. The
Commission suggests the creation of a Union
Terminal Company, and the elimination of
grade crossings and much trackage within the
city. Does it contemplate the erection of a
new Union Station? Well, if the present
beautiful station in Ottawa can be taken
down stone by stone and shipped to Kingston,
it would be very welcome there, because for
about fifteen years we have been trying to
get a building where the people of the city
and surrounding district could shelter from the
wintry weather when waiting to board a train.
But I do not suppose any such building will
be provided for our accommodation. Some
honourable senators may be surprised to know
that although chair cars are now running
between Toronto and Ottawa you cannot buy
a ticket for a chair anywhere along the route.
The tickets are sold in Toronto. If you are
in Kingston or Brockville or some place like
that and want to reserve a chair you can
wire to Toronto, but you will not have any
luck. You will find the Toronto senators and
others travelling in comfort in chairsHon. Mr. HAIG:

Hear, hear.

SENATE

284

Hon. Mr. DAVIES: We are glad to see
them. I do not mind that kind of thing a bit;
I am simply referring to one of the disadvantages experienced by people who live in
a small place.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE:

Outside Toronto.

Hon. Mr. DAVIES: When Vice-President
Pringle of the Canadian National Railways
was appearing before Kingston's Railway
Committee on one occasion he said, "You
must remember you are only a way station."
If I may be permitted, I wish to say something about Mr. Greber's scheme of beautification of Otttwa. Probably I am not in
order in referring to this. I feel that the
scheme should be postponed for a few years.
Much as Ottawa needs beautifying, I cannot
see that we should contemplate spending
several million dollars on that work just now,
when federal taxes are very high and, as we
have been told, people al! over the country
are cryi-ng for houses. The people of Kingston
are trying to buildi a memorial centre in
memory of those who lest their lives while
serving in the armed forces. No financial
assistance will be contributed by the Dominion Government towards the cost of this
memorial or of any other civic improvement
in

Kingston.

Before closing I wa.nt to say a word or two
about the little village of Portsmouth, which
has fewer than 1,000 people. Its total rateable assessment is $157,770, and the tax rate
is 62 mills. There is a penitentiary right
smack in the centre of the village. It employs 175 people, but only 30 of them reside
in the village. The penitentiary property
is worth, I suppose, $300,000, but no taxes are
paid on it. It does admittedly contribute
something in the way of street lighting, but
this probably amounts to only $500 or $1,000
a year. That small village, with a total tax
income of $17,388 and a tax rate of 62 mills,
asked the federal Government for a grant
of $2,000 to help pay for a fire hall that
cost $4,000, but no grant was made.
The proposed agreement between the Government and the city of Ottawa is to last for
five years. In due course this matter of a
grant to Ottawa will come up again, and I
feel that at that time, or even before then,
the whole question of reimbursing municipalities for tihe services they supply to
federal buildings should be considered by a
commission or a committee of both houses
of Parliament.

OTTAWA AGREEMENT BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion for the
second reading of Bill 161, an Act to authorize
a certain Agreement between His Majesty the
King and the Corporation of the City of
Ottawa.
Hon. CHARLES L. BISHOP: Honourable
senators-Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BISHOP: -as one who shares the
high honour of .representing the capital city
in this honourable House, I feel it my duty
to say a word about, and in support of, this
bill.
This is an Ottawa bill. It relates to a project with which I have long been familiar. I
was in the near neighbourhood of this honourable House when Parliament originally sanctioned the grant of $60,000. It stood at that
for a considerable period. Then, it was made
$75,000. Finally, it was increased to $100,000
and for a long time seemed hopelessly bogged
down at that figure. Now the growth of the
grant is more promising, and in time it will
fill out and be of a size that befits its age.
This bill implements a report of a committee of the two Houses which made a most
painstaking inquiry.
The city, I believe,
claimed $1,500,000 a year. By way of temporary compromise, the committee recommended an advance payment of the $300,000
provided for in the agreement, of which

sanction is now sought.
In my -opinion the grant is none too generous.
Government property in the city is valued
at about $65,000,000. It is al: exempt from
taxation, and always has been. Moreover,
this property is being added to steadily. In

war time the expropriation of new properties
was continuous; and properties once taken
over by the Crown become and remain Crown
properties. As such, they pay no taxes-and
never have. Nevertheless, the city of Ottawa
provides fire protection, and in many other
ways plays its full part in the upkeep of the

national Capital.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE.

The grant of $300,000, so far as it goes, is
acceptable as a payment on account, but it
does not call for a receipt in full. The city
will determine how the money should be
used. Personally, I hope some of it may be
spent on the erection of a new police station
to replace the present unsightly structure.
Part of it could well be used to make a contribution to the County of Carleton toward
the erection of a new Court House. The
present one, I believe, dates back to the days
of Colonel By and Bytown.
As my honourable colleague from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) pointed out, this measure has no relation to the larger plan for
the beautification of the Capital and sur>
It is simply a local
rounding district.
business transaction by which the Government pays, in part, for the value it receives.
I fear we will have to wait some years
before much money is spent on the more
comprehensive scheme of a Federal District;
it is so broad in vision that it calls for careful,
long-range planning. That, precisely, is what
is being prepared for now. It is all that is
being prepared for. What is planned
ultimately is the beautification of Ottawa
and surrounding districts, not as so many
municipalities, but as the Capital of Canaada. Every part of the country should take
pride in such an undertaking because the
Capital belongs to all just as much as it
belongs to Ottawa or the surrounding area.
There is no room for the petty jealousy of
which we detect the odd symptom.
The preparation of plans is not primarily
a job for an architect or for an artist or for
a poet. It is a job for an authority on town
planning, and, in Mr. Grebex I think we have
the most eminent of all such authorities. I
understand, however, that he invites, and will
be ready to receive suggestions from anybody
who is competent te submit constructive
ideas.
Meanwhile, the grant is acceptable as a substantial payment on account, and the city is
becomingly grateful for it, but it can hardly
be regarded as a complete discharge of the
Government's obligation to reimburse the city
for the sacrifices it bas made and the services
it bas rendered.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I will not deilay the House at length
in speaking to this motion. I am in favour
of the bill, for it is my conviction that the
people as a whole should assist in making
Ottawa a capital worthy of our nation.
In the years ahead there will be a great
migration of tourists into 'Canada from south
of the line, and many of them will want to

NOVEMBER 20, 194528
sec our national capital. Their desire to see
it will have beei4 strengthened beicause of
what has happened during the war. I heartil-y approve of the agreement that has followed upon. the in'vestigations macle, by the
lIn fact, to teki the honest
joint committee
truth, 1 arn surprised that the committee
was able to bring about such a good
arrangement.
The main point I wan't to make is that
this whole question of municipal taxation of
Government buildings will have ta be gone
into. PMease do not misunderstanb me. I
do not think municipal taxes should be
levied, on buildings used for parliamentary,
legislative or actual governmient purposes. In
my own home, city of Winnipeg we have the
Manitoba legisiative, buildings, and I do not
think they should be taxed. But the Province of Manitoba is engaged in the liquor
trade, and bas large liquor warehouses and
a number of retail stores in Winnipeg. A
very large profit is made out of the business
clone in these places, and although the province bas voluntarily agreed to pay a sum
estimated to be equal to a fair municipal
rate, 1 think these properties should hbe
taxed.
The Dominion Government is now in the
housing business, the mioney-lending business,
and ail sorts of business in addition ta what
is ordinarily understood as government business. Whenever the Government takes over
a building in which ta carry on any of these
operations it imrneciate'ly claims exemption
fromn municipal taxes. This is a very serious
matter. I Was delighted to hear the honourable senator from Kingston Clan. Mr.
Davies) refer ta the fact that 62 per cent
of the assessable property in the city of
Halifax is occupied by Dominion Government institutions, and flot subj ect to> taxation. If the Government of Canada is going
ta engage in business enterprises it ought ta
pay taxes just as any private enterprise does.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Provincial governments
also should pay taxes on their business institutions. There is no more reason for the
federal treasury to make a grant of money
ta Ottawa because Dominion Government
builings are located here, than there is for
it ta make a grant ta Winnipeg. I do not
want any misunderstanding. I am n ot suggesting that the agreement with Ottawa is
unf air. Speaking personally-and I can only
speak personally, for this has nothing ta do
with the leadership of a party-I arn heartily
in favour of making Ottawa a beautiful capital city. I say that quite candidly, although

I know a number of people do nat share my
view. But I submit that the Government
must face up ta this issue of paying taxes on
the business institutions it operates. In the
Banking. and Commerce Committee this
morning we dealt with a bill ta increase the
capital of Trans-Canada Air Lines from five
million to twenty-flve million dollars. That
coneern is carrying on a private mercantile
business, and it will have offices ail over
the country.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR- It is a public utility.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, and wherever it has
offices it reduces municipal tax receipts. I
think the Governme'nt and the Parliament of
Canacla, especially the House of Commons,
ought to face up ta this issue, which is a
very serious one for many municipalities.
Some of the provincial governments are in
the business of developing and supplying
hydro-electric power. lIn Winnipeg a whole
building is accupied by the Hydro-Electric
system. True, the system is owned by the
city and hancls over ta the city treasurer as
much money as would be paîd in taxes. But
this is clone voluntarily.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Does the system
pay income tax?
Bon. Mr. HAIG: Oh, no. There is no
rea.son why you or I or anybody else owning
a private house should have ta pay extra
taxes just because certain government buildings are located in the cities where we live.
If I were conducting a privat-e business of
supplyîng hydro-electrie power in the city of
Wininipeg I should have ta pay taxes. Why
should a government institution whîch is in
competition with private firms be exempt
from taxes? I have already mentioned the
provincial liquor business as a case in point.
The provincial government has large liquor
warehouses in Winnipeg, an which for years
there was no municipal tax paid, and the
people, of the whole province benefited financialiy because the services to these buildings were supplied by the city of Winnipeg.
At ane time the amount of the annual grant
by the Dominion te Ottawa was $60,000, and
for a good many- ye:ars, as we know, it was
$100,000. Now the proposai is ta increase the
grant ta $300,000. It was pointed out in the
debate here yesterday that the amaunt which
Ottawa claimed should be paid ta it annually
by the Dominion was $1,597,000. Well, when a
dlaim of that size is put farward seriously it is
time we woke up and considered this question
of Government-ownedi property in varîous
municîpalities alI across the country. I. was

288

SENATE

not a member of the joint committee, but
apparently it did not think the claim proposed by Ottawa was well founded.
I intend to rise here every time there is any
measure before us having to do with tax
exemptions on Government-owned property.
I am here to fight for private enterprise. The
majority of the people of this country believe
in it. They said so on the 5th of June. I am
not going to hamper private enterprise by
encouraging the practice of relieving public
utilities and other Government-owned businesses from municipal taxation.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, just before we adjourned last evening
I wanted to take four or five minutes to add
a few remarks at the end of the very fine
speech made by the honourable senator from
Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies). Kingston, a
former capital of Upper Canada, is a city that
for many years bas had military institutions
and a penitentiary in its midst, and the faet
that the Government bas made no grant to
compensate that municipality for non-payment
of taxes on those properties would possibly
give the honourable gentleman an opportunity
to talk against this bill. I am in the unfortunate position of not being able to vote on
the bill, according to Senate Rule 53, because
this $300,000 might make a difference of one
mill in the rate of taxes that I shall have to
pay. I do not know whether it wouldý.
Last night the honourable senator from
Kingston made several references to the
Ottawa Journal. In last Monday's issue of that
paper there was an editorial, which I was
'ioping he would mention. It indicates what
;his is all about and how much' it involves for
Ottawa. It seems to me that this information
should be on the record, for the benefit of all
concerned. The editorial is captioned "Propertics on the free list," and reads as follows:
Some members of Commons, discussing the
Ottawa bill, urged that the B.N.A. Act be
amended to make possible the taxing of all
Dominion Government property for municipal
purposes. In this connection, Mr. Boucher of
Carleton pointed out that if the Governmen't
paid taxes to Ottawa as private property-owners
pay, the city would receive $2,177,727 annually
from the federal treasury. That is a little more
than one-third of our tax revenue.
It is interesting to explore this subject a
little. Last year Ottawa's total assessment, taxable and exempt, was $273,676,550, but exemptions eut the taxable part of the total to
$165,711,463. Dominion Government properties
were assessed at $66,ß74,230-the total now will
be somewhat higher, because of properties acquired in 194,5 and thus removed from the tax
rolIs.
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

But the Dominion Government, while the leading beneficiary from tax exemptions, is by no
means the sole property-owner to benefit from
the present tax system. It is interesting to look
at some of the other exemptions:
Churches ........................
$ 4,241,730
Educational institutions .........
9,802,125
Property used for charitable and
welfare purposes ...............
1,706,925
Corporation of Ottawa ........... 11,755,197
H ospitals ........................
5,074,900
Federal District Commission .....
3,644,837
Ontario Government .............
348,100
Ottawa Hydro-Electric ...........
1,865,900
These and smaller items bring total tax exemptions in Ottawa to $107,965,087-as compared with the total assesment of $165,711,463
on which taxes are paid-about two-thirds of
the tax-free property being owned by the
Dominion. And what a nice easy tax rate we
could have if everybody paid!
I thought that article should go on the
record in connection with this bill.
Hon. THOMAS VIEN: Honourable senators, there are so many angles to the question
that has arisen in this debate that it is
difficult to follow the line of argument
developed by the honourable senator from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig). The question before the Chair is simply whether the $100,000
contribution which the Federal Government
bas paid to the city of Ottawa for a number
of years, in lieu of taxes or in compensation
for the public services rendered by the city,
shall be increased to $300,000 a year. The
services supplied include waterworks, sewage
disposal, police station, pavements on the
streets and many other municipal undertakings of which the Government is the beneficiary.
The suggestion has been made that the
Government should pay taxes. It probably
would be futile to develop that line of argument, unless we are prepared to suggest an
amendment to the British North America Act.
Section 125 of that Act reads as follows:
No lands or property belonging to Canada or
any province shall be liable to taxation.
This applies to Crown property whether
provincial or federal. Therefore, if it were
decided that Government property should be
taxable, the proper procedure would be to
move to eliminate Section 125 of the British
North America Act.
I think it behooves a nation to take care of
its capital. I don't believe there is a country
in the world which claims to be civilized and
progressive that is not proud of its capital,
and consequently fails to take care of its
beautification and development. Let us look,
for instance, at Paris, London, Buenos Aires,
Rio and Mexico City. For more than 120
years Washington has had beautification plans

NOVEMBER 21, 1945
sucli as are now proposed by Mr. Greber for
the city of Ottawa. The development and
beautification of the city of Washington has
continued for a century and a quarter, and
suxus larger in proportion than Canada bas
spent on Ottawa have been eapended for such
improvement. 1 amn therefore in favour of an
increased contribution Vo the city of Ottawa.
I believe municipal services rendered by
this city to the Dominion Goverument are
well worth M30,000 a year. It has been said
frequently over a long period of time, both
in the bouse of Commons and in this Chamber, that some definite solution of this problexu
will be reached. The most reasonable solution,
according to the concensus of public opinion,
is the creation of a federal district under direct
Governiment control, somewhat similar Vo tbe
District of Columbia in the United States. I
believe that sooner or later in the plan for
the development and beautîfication of the
capital of Canada, we shaîl corne, in one form
or another, to the creation of a federal district.
The honourable senator from Parkdale
(bon. Mr. Murdock) quoted from tbe Ottawa
Journal a recent article which madle reference
to taxes on sehools and churches. We are a
Christian community. It was Blackstone, I
think, wbo said that Christianity is part and
parcel of the Commonwealth of England.
Whether we be Anglican, Methodist, Roman
Catholie, Presbyterian or Baptist-I do noV
wish to omit anyone-we aIl go to church,
and we send our children to sehool. If churches
and sehools are taxed, we shaîl have Vo add
the amount of their taxes Vo our donations
and gif VsVo the church and our contributions
towards education. The school commission
does not grow money as we grow apples or
wheat; it has to go to the pockets of the
taxpayers Vo geV the funds requircd Vo meet
its expenditures. If.we increase the bills that
the school commission and the church wardens have to pay, we shaîl have Vo disgorge
more rnoney in gifts to the church and taxes
to the sehools Vo maîntain those institutions.
Theréfore, in setting up the value of nontaxable property, I do noV believe it is sound
to include sehools and churches.
As Vo public utilities, I do not believe the
subject-matter before the Chair lends itself
to a discussion on tbe qi4estion of public
ownership. If we ernbarked on. such a dis,cussion, it would probably continue for a -few
-weeks to corne.
During the debate on the proposal Vo in,crease the capital of Trans-Cahada Air Lines,
it was suggested that the construction of en
airport would remove certain taxable property
lfrom the Vax roll and would be disadvantageous to the municipality concerned. I

289

believe that a rnunicipality in which TransCanada Air Lines propose to construct an
airport should stop and consider well which is
better for it-to lose. a few dollars in taxes
or to get the be-nefit of an institution of
that kind within its limits. If consideration
were given to that question the decision
would be prompt, and it would be in favour of
forgoing the taxes and gettinig the benefit of
the Government institution. The construction of an airport would involve the employment of a number of people and the bringing
in of supplies which would be purcbased
locally. I think that a community would
derive more benefit from the establishment
of an airport in its territories than from the
taxes that would be paid on the farm land
to be occupied by such a public institution.
It is truc that the city of Ottawa has been
for a number of ycars claiming a greater
amount than it has rece-ivcd frorn the Federal
Government. Both the Senate and Huse
of Commons in considering the grant of
publie mýoncy to Ottawa frorn year Vo year
have always taken into account the benefits
that the city of Ottawa derives frorn the fact
that the seat of Government is in this city.
If you remove the seat of Governrnent frorn
Ottawa, you will rernove from the city's income
a sum much greater than the amount of
taxes týhat would be eollectable on the propertics that have been acquired by the Goverament. Therefore, there is a certain equilibrium to be maintained between the demands of the city of Ottawa and the f air
and reasonable contribution which the Government should pay for the public services that
are being rendered.
I repeat wbat I said in my opening rernarks,
that this is only a tcmporary measure. It
cannot be a permanent solution of the problcm. The Government cannot go on paying
$300,000, $500,000 or even a million dollars
to the city of Ottawa wîthout adjusting the
situation witb the city on a more reasonable
foundation. I think that a more reasonable
foundation would be to do what is now being
donc by the Government-call in a professional
landscape architect to make a general plan
of the capital of Canada, and establish a
systemn for the administration of a federal
district without causing the city of Ottawa
to bace its autonomy as the city of Washington
has donc. A definite system of a permanent
character would enable the Federal Government to exercise proper supervision over the
affairs of a fedieral drist-rict with respect Vo
beautification and enlargement as tirne gues
on, -and would prevent the city from having

'9U

SENATE

to come to Parlia-ment year after year to discuse the adlequacy of our contribution for
municipal services.
I arn all in favour of the bill now before
the House, and think that we should have
been paying $300,000 a year to the city of
Ottawa for a number of years. This bill is
long overdue.

I maintain that Halifax is as deserving of
consideration from this Government as is the
city of Ottawa.
If the contribution that
Halifax has made during the last six years
were generally known it would amaze the
ordinary citizens of this country. Some articles
have been written on the subject, but they
have not been widely published. In view of
the enormous value of federally-owned property in the city of Halifax-property which is,
of course, tax exempt-I submit that the
Government should consider extending to that
city treatment similar to that accorded to
Ottawa. I trust that the Government will
rot regard this suggestion as something to
come in at one ear and go out of the other,
but that steps will be taken to see that appropriate compensation is given to Halifax.

Hon. FEUX P. QUINN: Honourable senators I concur in the remarks of my honourable leader and the honourable gentleman who

Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. EULER: Perhaips those of us
who have been members of the Commons
bring with us from that House certain prejudices. Now I have one or two convictionswhether they be prejudices or not-about our
method of dealing with legislation, and I am
going to mention one in particular. In the
House of Commons a great deal of the legislation is considered in Committee of the
Whole, but I cannot remember the Senate
ever having gone into Committee of the
Whole during my five years of membership
here.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: It did once.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Well, I was not present
on that occasion. I think a very good purpose would be served by our considering
legislation in Committee of the Whole. I
will admit it is quite proper to refer a good
many bills to standing committees, but I am
convinced that there are also many bills
which could be more fittingly taken up in
Committee of the Whole. The press would
give more publicity to the Senate if the
whole Chamber went into committee on bills,
and thereby the people at large would learn
more of what we are doing. Another point
occurs to me, though perhaps it is not very
important. We occasionally hear it said that
the Senate is an obscure and unimportant
body, and some people actually base this
opinion upon the fact that the Senate Hansard is much smaller than that of the other
House. But, as we all know, a great deal of
discussion in the Commons takes place when
bills are in the committee stage, and these
discussions are reported by Hansard, whereas
the principal discussion of bills by senators
is done in standing committees, whose proceedings are not reported.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: May I ask the
honourable gentleman whether he would be
in favour of having a minister, deputy minister or other departmental official sitting on
the floor of the Senate and taking part in
the discussion when a Government measure
was being considered in Committee of the
Whole?
Hon. Mr. EULER: I thank my honourable friend. I was going to make a suggestion, which may perhaps be pretty revolutionary. I see no reason why, when an important Government measure is in Committee of the Whole here, the minister responsible for administration of the bill should
Hon. Mr. EULER.

net come into this Chamber, and take part
in the debate. It seems to me the public interest would be served if that were done.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: There is nothing objectionable about that.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Would the honourable
senator suggest that the permission, if that is
the proper word to use, be a standing permission rather than special, invitation on
occasion only?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Special invitation would
be all right.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I am not sure that I
have any definite opinion with regard to that
question. I think there should be a standing
invitation, because legislation that passes
through the House of Commons bas to come
to the Senate in any case, and no man should
be better informed, on the implications of that
legislation than the minister himself. If the
ministers and the members of the Government
were convinced that the senators could really
offer some valuable contributions on the legislation, I think that such ministers might well
come to the Senate in good faith and accept
the contributions offered to them. After all,
many honourable senators have been members
of the House of Commons. I propose to
make reference to what my honourable friend
the leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) said the
other day. Since I cannot quote his exact
words, would the honourable gentleman mind
telling me what it was he said?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Do you mean as to ministers?
Hon. Mr. EULER: Yes.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I suggested that there
sho.uld be more than one Cabinet minister of
the Government in this House. What I had
in mind, quite candidly, was that there should
be three members of the Government.
To be quite clear, I was not thinking so
much of a portfolio as of the need of members
of the Government to bring the Government
viewpoint to this House.
Hon. Mr. EULER: The reason I took a
special interest in what my honourable friend
said the other diay was that I made a speech
on the same subject in the House of Commons
in 1919.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: You should be wiser
by this time.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I will net burden the
House by reading everything I said at that
time. I have already read the resolution indicating that ministers of the Crown should
be members of the House of Commons.

NOVEMBER 21, 1945
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Do yýou contend that
that is constitutional?
Hon. Mr. EULER: At least it is reasonable
and natural, in my opinion.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: It would be reasonable,
but flot constitutional as f ar as we are concerned.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I amrn ot saying now
whether it is 1egal, or constitutional for
members of this House to be members of the
Cabinet, but I do flot think, it is democratic.
Dernocracy means the people have the privilege of expressing theïr desires through their
votes. While I do not wish to offend the
sensibilities of any honourable member of this
flouse, I feel that ministers shoulýd be elected.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE:
May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question? When that
motion was made in 1919 how many members
of this flouse were Cabinet members or
holding portfolios in the Government?
Hon. Mr. EULER: There were three. I arn
coming to that question. While I do not
desire in any way to be offensive, I should
like to read from what I said in 1919, the
fundamentals of which. I stili believe.
"Frankly, Mr. Speaker, the resolution which
I have offered bas for its object the debarring
from the Cabinet of members of the Senate, for
what 1 consider to be the sufficient reason, that
members of the Senate. not being eleeted, are
flot representative of, an.d flot responsi-ble to,
the people."
1 will omit those portions that may be
considered of an irrelevant nature.
The respons4bility and power of the niinistry
are very great. During t he past two years the
power of the Cabinet has been ýgreater even than.
the power of Parjiament itself. That wvas durigthe war. As a matter of f act, the War
Mýneasures Act is stili in force and the Government still retains that power.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: That is still true today.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Quite so, and I am not
defending it.
But even after the War Measures Act becomes nuIl and void the power and influence of
the Cabinet will still remain very great. Members of the Cabinet who are of sufficient cali-bre
to deserve a position as respon&ible as that,
wield. a tremendous power not only in the formulating of policies, b ut also in the administration of the departmnents over wbich they have
control.
The appointment of senators to the Dominion
Cabinet is entirely subversive of the principle
of responsible Government.
At t-hat time we had three members 6f bhis
flouse in the Cabinet. The three members
were, the leader of the Senate, the late Sir
James Lougheed, who was Minister of Sol-,
diers' Civil Re-Establishment; the late Gideon

Robiertson, who had been Minister of Labour;
and third, the flonourable P. E. Blondin, then
Post Master General. It seems to be subversive of responsible Govermment that men
who have been rejected by tbe people should
be put in the responsible position of a minister of the Govern.ment. In fact, there is one
illustration, and in citing i-t I do not wish to
be offensive in any way: the last mentioned
honourable gentleman was defeated at the
polis by some 6,000 votes out of 6,500 cast.
1 say what I do because members of this
flouse are not the elected representatives of
the people. I amn quite willing to admit that
they have functions to perform, but I do say
that they should not. be responsible ministers
in charge of portfolios. It seems to me that
that right is entirely reserved for the members
of the flouse of ýCommons.
While what I have to say may not be particularly welcomed by the members of this
flouse, it is my opinion that the men who are
administering portfolios, and who have control
over immense sums of money, should be
responsible elected members of the flouse of
Commýons. One suggestion I desire to make
is that ministers from the flouse of Commons
should with consent appear on the floor for
the Senate Chamber. They do appear occasionally before Standing Committees of this
honourable flouse. For instance, flonourable
Mr. Howe appeared this morning before one
of the committees of the Senate. These ministers should not be members of this C'hamber, in my opinion, but should on occasion
appear here, take, part in the debates, and get
the benefit of the views of honourable senators. But it remains that they are members
of the flouse of Commons and thus eleoted
representatives of the people.
Perhaps, honourable members, I have not
made myscîf too clear, but 1 do want to
emphasize the point that, believing in democratic representation, I cannot see how *memnbers of an appointed body can be truly representative. Fortunately during the last few
years there bas not been a Cabinet Minister
with portfolio a member of this honourable
flouse. 0f course we are more concerned
wi'th the practical service of public interest
than" in the observance of any hoary precedent. While it might be constitutional for
members of this House to occupy a number of
seats in the Cabinet, it would not be strictly
in eonformity with democratic practice.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, 'heur.
Hon. J. W. de B. FARRIS: flonourable
senators, it was nat my intention to take part
in this discussion, but one or two remarks of
the last speaker prompt me to make some
comment.

294

SENATE

In the first place, I think the idea of democratic representation is sometimes based on a
false premise. In my judgment there is a
fundamental difference between democracy and
mere majority rule. As I understand it, democracy in its essence is, as was said< by Abraham
Lincoln, government of the people, by the
people and for the people, not government by a
majority of the people for a majority of the
people. In the practical operation of parliamentary government it is necessary to accept
the majority principle as the best way of
giving representation; but I think it is recognized as complementary that the majority
give full representation to all the people.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: That is as it should, be.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I think my honourable
friend from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) has
confusedi responsible government with representative government. The practice of representative government as we have it, is to have
representatives from different constituencies.
Those constituencies enmbrace a very small
portion of the great population. My honourable friend mentioned late Honourable Mr.
Blondin, and the irony of him having a seat
in this House when he had been defeated at
the polls. Why, the Prime Minister of Canada
was defeated in the last election; but no one
thought that in any way disqualified him from
continuing as Prime Minister of this country.
Hon. Mr. EULER: He had to be re-elected.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: He had ta be re-elected
in order to speak in the House of Commons;
fundamentally, he was a representative of the
people whether he was elected in Prince
Albert or any other constituency.
Responsible government means that the
government is responsible to the House of
Commons, and can continue in office only as
long as it commands a majority in that House.
If the theory of my honourable friend were
to be carried to the extreme limit, it would
mean that all deputy ministers would be
members of the House of Commons as well,
because in many instances they have more to
do with the business of the Government than
have the ministers. So long as the ministers
continue to be ministers, and the Government
can command a majority in the House of
Commons, that constitutes responsible government.
I believe it would be a good thing to have
more ministers in this House. In my opinion
the Government
of Canada would bé
strengthened by the injection of a little more
of that independence which would come from
representation in a body of this kind. If that
change were made it would net in any way
Hon. Mr. FARRIS.

weaken our system of responsible government,
because no senator could, continue as a minister
if the government to which he belonged was
defeated in the other House.
Hon. THOMAS VIEN: Honourable senators, like the honourable gentleman who
has just taken his seat, I shall not detain the
House long.
I believe that we should not allow to go
unchallenged the statement that sound, principles of democratie and responsible government do not permit a minister holding a
portfolio to sit in this House. These principles would net in any way be violated if
the head of a government department were
a senator. As was clearly pointed out by
the honourable senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris), the government is
responsible to the representatives whom the
people elect to the House of Commons. If
a senator held a portfolio and a majority of
the members of the Commons did net like
the way he administered his department, they
could ask the government to dismiss him,
and if the government failed, t dio so it
could be voted out of office. Therefore, I
repeat, no fundamental principle of responsible government would be violated by giving
a ministerial portfolio to a senator.
The theory that a minister of the Crown
must hold the confidence of the electorate in
a constituency is, I believe, no longer valid.
Formerly when a member of the House of
Commons was appointed to the Cabinet he
had to go back to his constituency and seek
re-election as a minister of the Crown. This
was necessary, not in order to conform with
the principles of responsible government or
of demiocratic institutions, but because at
that time there was a rule that any member
of the Commons who accepted a position of
emolument under the Crown thereby vacated
his seat. That rule bas since been repealed,
and a member no longer has to seek reelection before his appointment as a minister
of the Crown can be confirmed.
I agree with the honourable gentleman
from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris)
that it would be in the interests of sound
government to have a numiber of Cabinet
portfolios given to members of the Senate.
If in practice it was found necessary that a
a minister who was a member of the Senate
should be present in the Commons when his
estimates were under consideration there, it
would be just as easy for that House to
extend te hin the privilege of explaining his
bill there as it is for the Senate to extend a
like privilege to ministers who have seats in
the Commons. Under our constitution there

NOVEMBER 21, 19452à

is no reason why a minister from the other

House sbould not have a seat on the floor of
this Chamber while bis estimates or other
depaxrtmental me-asures are being debated
here. The whole matter is one of procedure
only and couid he regulated by the rules of
bath Houses. In France a cabinet minister
may be a member of either the Senate or the
Chamber of Deputies, andl he has the privilege, of sitting in. either, bouse.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Is the Senate appointed or elected?
Hon. Mr. VIEN:- In France the Senate is
elected-not by the, electons at large but by
the municipal counctils; which are called the
conseils geineraux. Senators are electeal for
seven years, and tbey have the privilege- of
sitting in either House. They may speak in
the Chamiber of Deputys oenly when legislation coming under their respective departments is being considered.
Hon. Mr. EULER: My objection te senators
berng members of the Cabinet is based entirely on the fact that tbey are not electeal.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: My honourable friend's
point is, I understand, that a minister shoulal
be directly responsible to the people. With
aIl deference, I suggest that my honourable
frienal bas confuseal the principle of responsible
goverament with anotber principle. Responsible government does flot depenal upon
whether ministers hold seats in one bouse
or the other. The principle is that a geverfiment cannot continue in office unleas it
possesses the confidence of the elected representatives of the people. But tbere is nothing
in that principle to prevent a member of the
Cabinet from holding a seat in the Senate.
My honourable friend believes that Cabinet
members holding portfolios should be electeal
by the people. That is a viewpoint for whicb.
I bave the utmost respect, but there are other
aspects that may be considered. As was
pointed out by the honourable gentleman frem
Vancouver South, the Governmeut miight be
strengtbened by baving some of its portfolios
filled by members of the Senate, who are not
subject to the wbims of the electorate. That
is also my opinion.
The motion before the bouse is for the
appointruent of a committee to determine upon
more effective procedure for carrying on tile
work of the Senate. I think the motion is
most appropriate, andl I support it fully.
bon. ARTHUR W.' ROEBUCK: bonourable senators, as a neweomer I suppose I should
apologize for taking up the time of the
bouse on two successive days, but there is
a phase of this question of governmnent repre-

sentation in the Senate which I should like to
discuss briefly. The British system of cabinet
government has heen growing up over a long
period of years, and sometimes we in this
generation forget that it is stili growing. The
cabinet government of today wiil flot be the
cabinet government of thirty, forty or fifty
years from now,. andl certainly it is not the
cabinet government of 1867, when the framework of our constitution was laid down.
New, wbat light does the evolution of
cabinet government throw upon the question
we have been discussing here? If you will go
back to the early days, to the days before that
evolution began,-to the time, say, of Charles
II-you will- find a House, of Commons devoted entirely t-o the passing -of substantive law.
According to the politicai pbilosophy of those
days it was unsafe to have matters of administration and patronage deait witb by the
buse of Commons. Those matters were ieft
to the king. That situation continued until
cabinet government was pretty weil under way.
If you wiil look at the constitution Great
Britain had wben, say, she lest the American
Colonies, when the kingly George was on
the tbroneHon. Mr. DUFF: The time of the Boston
Tea Party..
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Yes-you will find
that at that time ail matters of patronage and
of administration were in the hands of the
king; ýail appointments to the civil service, te
the army, the navy and the church were made
by him. There was then ne thought of taking
administrative authority out of the king's
hands, because the political philosophy of those
days was that the function of administration
should be kept separate from the function
of law-making.
From that time until now the executive
bas been gradually stealing the powers of the
other brancbes of our system. For instance,
parliament first took over tbe right to name
the prime minister; and then, with the backing of Parliament, the prime minister acquireal
the right te choose the othier members of bis
cabinet. That cabinet then set about over
tbe years to rob tbe king of ail bis powers
until today, under the constitution, tbe king
reigne but does not govern. Ail patronage,
all administration has been taken out of his
hands and acquired by the cabinet.
If yo'u will watch what is goîng on at the
present menuent you wiil find that the
executive, having robbed the king of ail bis
functions, is now proceeding to rob parliament
of its functions.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK:

SENATE
It was stated here

this afternoon that were we to have representatives of the government sit in this Chamber, the government would thereby be
strengthened. That is undoubtedly true. But
the government would be strengthened at the
expense of this Chamber. If you will observe
what is going on today in parliament, both in
Great Britain and in Canada, you will see
that the executive is extending its influence
and power over one and then another, and
the circle of those who are bound to the
executive is gradually increasing. Here in
Canada we recently appointed a number of
parliamentary assistants, and in that way
added another balf dozen or dozen to the
number who are bound to the executive by
official position and emoluments. The percentage of the number of members of the
House of Commons who are tied to the
executive is gradual.ly increasing, and every
time the influence of the executive is increased
in this way the legislative independence of
parliament is decreased.
Honourable senators, I submit it is better
to perform well the functions that are ours
than to seek new functions that are perhaps
slightly beyond our control. If a number of
senators were appointed to the cabinet the
power of the government would undoubtedly
be increased, but the change wo.uld seriously
interfere with that independence which is
the pride of this Chamber. It would in:rease the influence of the executive over the
members of this House and create here a
new atmosphere of goverrmental control, the
absence of which makes the Senate strong and
independent. If you will observe the position
of the member of parliament in the House
of Commons, I think you will be struck with
the fact that the man who would remain altogether independent of the executive and
answerable only to his constituents must
put out of his mind the possibility of his
holding executive office. He must resign himself to the work of representing his constituency, and that work only, for just so soon as
the golden plium of executive office, power and
emoluments dangles before his eyes-well,
where a man's treasure is, there will his heart
be also.
It would be better for this honourable
Chamber to .retain the uninfluenced independence that it enjoys today than to permit
these men who hold power to have any privileges here. Let them be far distant from us.
Honourable senators can learn about proposed bills without having representatives
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

from the other House present in this Chamber; legislation can be analyzed much more
freely and independently in their absence.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Will the honourable senator permit a question? Does he not believe
that the Senate would have greater influence
if three of its members sat at the council
table?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I have just been
arguing, honourable gentlemen, that under
sucb circumstances the Senate would have
less influence.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: If you allow the
executive a place in this Chamber, the Senate
will exercise 'less influence in the public mind
than it now does, utterly independent and
free of the executive, in carrying out the
function which was given to it by the Fathers
of Confederation. The function of this honourable Senate is to exercise second thought,
to review legislation, unbounded and uinfluenced by executive power and emolument.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. A. C. HARDY: Honourable senators,
I think the debate has drifted far from the
tenor of the resolution. Unfortunately I was
not in the Chamber yesterday, and since
Hansard is not at hand I do not know just
what was said.
This resolution calls for the appointment of
a special committee to review the constitution
and funetions of the standing committees of
the Senate and to make certain recommendations. Honourable senators have been discussing the general status of the Senate as a
parlilamentary body, and the question of
whether the functions of the Senaite would
be improved by the presence of ministers.
I think it is important that the actual words
of the resolution should be considered; that
is, we should inquire into the advisability of
submitting our whole committee set-up to a
special committee appointed to examine the
workings of our standing committees and
bring in recommendations.
The whole debate this afternoon has been
on the question of the adkvisability of permitting .ministers of the government on the
floor of this House. The reason I am expressing
myself in the matter is that I have long been
o.f the opinion that this House has more or
less abdicated its real powers to standing committees, and has not, as the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) has said,
functioned as a Committee of the Whole.' I
have been a member of this honourable House
for twenty-two or twenty-three years, and I
can well remeniber the time when all bills

NOVEMBER 21, 1945
that dfid not require a very careful analysis,
or intepretation through wîtnesses or experts
from outside, were all debated in Cominittee
of the Whole. Honourable senators on the
other aide who are senior to me will confirm
what I say.
Recently, however, bille without number
have been passed through this Bouse without
a word of debate. Tbey simply go to the
various comrnittees, chiefly the Standing Committee on Bankîng and Commerce-a committee, by the way, which frequently considers
bil.ls that bave nothing wbatever to do witb
banldng or commerce, but acts as an executive
committee of this Bouse. 1 amn not finding
fault with the members of the committee;
they make a very thorough examination of the
subj ect before themn and, go into matters very
carefully. But when the report is brought in,
consisting, maybe, of a couple dozen words
merely reporting the bill without amendiment,
it goes through this honourable BEouse without
a word of debate.
I think that is why the Senate bas fallen into
a position of what I mîght caîl obscurity in the
last ten or twelve years. As the honourable
senator to my right bas said, we have not sat
in Committee of the Whole in the last four or
five years. I remember an instance prior to
1940 when we did, but speaking generally we
have considered next to nothîng in Committee of the Whole since 1935.
Under the leadership and, spirit of the late
Senator Dandurand, and the very able parliamentarian who was then leader opposite, much
of our proceediings consisted of general conversation between those two honourable
gentlemen.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Bon. Mr. HARIDY: 1 think five of the most
enjoyable years 1 have spent in this honourable Bouse were during the Bennett regime,
under the lead.ership of Honourable Mr.
Meighen. Many important bills were submitted to and thoroughly discussed by this
Bouse. In all matters where expert advice
was not required discussion took place in
Commîttee of the Whole.
I think the sooner we get back to that
systern the sooner we wull put the Senate in a
more respectable position in the eyes cf the
public. No matter what honourable senators
may say, the country at large has lost its
respect for the Senate.
Hon. Mr. HIAYDEN: 1 do flot think so.
Some hon. SENATORS: No, no.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: It is well known that
the press generally passes upon us in a very
gum.mary way. The Senate has been getting

297

a littie more publîcity during the present
session; but publicity, in the generai meaning
of the word, is flot what we shoui& seek. At
least something should appear in the press to
inform the publie of what goes on in this
Senate; but if everything is submitteà to' a
committee and discussed in the littie room
down the corridor, as time goes on people will
know leas and iess about what we are d.oing.
I propose to mntroduce this subject again
at a time when there is a bill before us that
does flot require figures or the advice of a
minister from the other place. There are
several bis of that nature before the House
of Commons at the present moment, and when
they reach this House I hope honourable
senators wifl think very seTiously about getting
back to the reýal function, of the Senate and
the desirability of discussing publie matters
in a public way.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Hear, hear.
Hon. J. J. BENCH: Honourable senators,
I desire to speak for a moment in support of
the suggestion, which first came from the
honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler), that more of the work of this Chamber should be done in Committee of the
Whole.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BENOH: May I be permitted
to give an illustration in support of my
statement? I believe that the public generally measure the value of the work done in
this Chamber by the relative thicknesses of the
Commons Hansard and the Bansard of this
Chamber. On a previous occasion I found it
necessary and desirable to make somhe statistical inquiry in that connection. 1 chose as
the best test the debates which took place
iii this Chamber and in the House of Commons on the War Appropriation Bill of 1944.
The resolution on which that bill was based
was introduced in the Bouse of Com-mons
early in February of that year; it received
third reading and left that Chamber about
the middle of June. Something more than
f our montbs elapsed during wbich that legislation was under discussion.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Not continuously.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Under consideration.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: 1 quite agree the discussion was not continuous. The report of
the debate filled something like 1,833 pages
in the Bouse of Commons Hansard. Honourable senators will recaîl that the bll left
the other Bouse without a single change in
any appropriation proposed by any department of the Government. It la fair to say,

298

SENATE

though I am not criticizing, that only a very
small portion of the debate in the other place
could be regarded as strictly relevant to the
bill itself. The bill was used as a springboard for discussion of every conceivable
subject which happened to enter into the
minds of members of the other House.
Honourable senators know that an average
volume of the House of Commons Hansard
consists of about a thousand pages. Think
of a five-foot shelf containing the House of
Commons Hansard, and visualize two volumes
made up of debate on the War Appropriation
Bill.
Now, what happened in this honourable
House when that bill came before us? It
was referred to the Standing Committee on
Finance. It was considered in the committee
room, and responsible ministers and officials
of various departments were called to explain
the purposes of the proposed appropriations.
The Finance Committee studied the bill for
several days; the debate in this Chamber
was relatively short, lasting only two or
three days. The consequence of this method
of dealing with the bill was that absolutely
no credit was given fer all the work done
in committee. The public feeling was that
all the consideration that bill received at the
hands of honourable senators was during the
two or three days when it was discussed in
formal session. I have taken the liberty of
instancing

this example

in

support

of

the

suggestion of the honcurable senator from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler).
I very much like the proposai of the honourable gentleman that ministers of the
Crown should at all times have access to this
Chamber; that they should come here not
only on special invitation, but whenever they
wish to participate in discussion of bills or
ather measures in which they are interested.
I think it is on-ly natural that a minister
should want to introduce and retain control
of his own legislation, and it seems to me
that as long as we keep the doors of the
Senate barred to ministers we cannot very
well complain if their bills are not initiated
here. I think the other House bas had before
it this session two or three measures that in
no way impose a charge on the public treasury,
and which might very properly have been
introduced in the Senate rather than in the
other House. The Canadian Citizensbip Bill
comes to my mind at the moment as one that
might have been handled in this way if it had
been possible for the Secretary of State, who
will be responsible for administering the legislation, to come here and explain it. I suggest
that if that practice were adopted the work
Hon. Mr. BENCH.

of Parliament as a whole would be materially
lightened and the 'length of the sessions might
be considerably shortened.
I desire to add only that I am entirely in
favour of this motion. I think the appointment of the proposed committee will afford
an excellent opportunity of considering our
procedural arrangements and revising them
in such a way as to facilitate the work of both
Houses of Parliament.
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN: Honourable
senators. when the honourable gentleman
from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) was speaking I asked him whether he was in faveur of
permitting a minister or deputy minister to
have a seat on the floor of the Senate and
take part in discussion in Committee of the
Whole, and I understood him to say that he
was. The disadvantage of the old system
of having a minister or official seated in front
of the Government leader, but net permitted
to reply to questions except through the
Government leader, is that too much work is
thereby thrown on the leader. Would it net
be wise to amend our procedure se that when
bills are under consideration in Committee of
the Wbole we could discuss their provisions
directly with the minister or his deputy?
Hon. Mr. COPP: When the late Senator
Dandurand was Government leader it was a
ceommon practice to have a departmental
official seated on the floor during discussion
by Committee of the Whole.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: I understand that,
but the official was net permitted to make a
direct reply to any question.
Hon. Mr. COPP: That is right.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: I think it would
be a good idea if the minister or his representative could take .part in our discussion of
a bill in Committee of the Wh-ole, just as in
one of our standing committees.
I should like to comment upon a situation
that perbaps is not strictly within the subjectmatter of the motion. It bas long been the
custom for important measures from the other
House to come to the Senate in the closing
days of the session, when, if we discuss them
at all, we have to do so in a hurry. I think
it is about time the Senate took a stand on
this matter and said that it would give thorough consideration to all bills, regardless of
when they were sent here, and would not
yield to any intimation that Parliament must
prorogue by a certain date. Every bill that
comes before us should be given thorough
consideration, either in Committee of the
Whole or in one of our standing committees.

299

NOVEMBER 21, 1945
Personally I should prefer to have bis discussed in Committee of the Whole flouse, if
we can arrange to question the minister or
his deputy as wc now do in our standing
committees, because in that way ail our mcmbers would be kcpt in toucli with what is
being donc. As a rule, wlicn a measure is
discussed- in a standing committee senators
who are not memnbers of that committee do
not attend its meetings. And, as was pointed
out, when a bill is reportcd back by a comnmittee it is flot our practîce to drscuss its
details on the floor of the Senate. So when
a bill is considered in committec those who
have not been present at the time have no
means of knowing just what explanation lias
been made by representatives of the department that will administer -the bill.
I feel that the special committee proposcd
by the honourable leader of the flouse eould
perforai a very useful service by reviewing
our present procedure ina the handlmng of legislation, and by making recommendations for
amnending that procedure so that a larger
part of our discussion of bis will take place
on the floor of the flouse. If that change
were made the people of the country as a
whole, many of whom are inclined to criticize,
would have a better opportunity of understanding the function of this Chamber.
Hon. T. A. CRERAR: Honourable senators, as was poîntcd out, a good deal of the
discussion lias been aside from the, motion
which ýwe are considering. I amrn ot criticizing that. It appears to me that on the
whole the debate lias been a very good one.
As yet I arn not very familiar with procedure in the Senate an'd tlie manner in which
business is handiled through various committees; but if I understood the leader of the
Goverrment correctly, lie said that the setup of committees today is practically the
same as it was a good many ycars ago.
Therefore it seems to me that some vcry
useful result iniglt come from the proposed
re.-examination of projedure by a special
cornmittec. I arn whohly in. favour of the
motion..
As to anoth-er aspect of the discussion, I
find myseîf largcly, if not cntircly, ina agreement witli what was saîd by tlie honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Rolebuck) and the lionourable gentleman from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler). It is necessary
that tlie leader of the Government sliould be
a member of the Cabinet and tlius act as a
liaison officer between the Goveranent and
this flouse; but the Senate, must ira every
way possible guard against surrenderîng any
of its independence, lest it slip away entirely.

Reference has been made to the feeling
that the Senate has iost popularity in the
country. I do flot agree with that view.
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN:
Neither do I.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: But I arn going to
say that I be-lieve the institution, of Parliament as a whole, is flot helcb in such high
esteem. throughout the country todiay as it
was twenty.-flve years ago, and certainly fifty
years ago. I thinik it is very important that
Parliament should searcli out the reasons why
that is so. I arn basing my statement on
commients made to me, flot by irresponsibl-e
people, but by good, thoughtful citizens who
take an interest ina their country's affairs. It
is unfortunate that some people should feel1
as they do about Parliament. There is a responsibility resting upon every member of
both Houses to conside.r this matter, because
ina a civilizect community no institution is
more important than the one by whicli the
community goveTne itself, whether it ha a
parliament, a legisiature or a municipal council.
I sometimes think that the three chief
institutions ina our country are: the goverrament, the church in ail its varied activitiesHon. Mr. DUIFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: -and the sehool.
If we keep the welfare of these three institutions clearly before our minds there is
flot much danger that we shall go far wrong.
As to the Senate-I speak as a new mcmber-it does seem to me that it has an important part to play in the government of the
country. It has been described as a chanaber
of sober second thýought. As such the Senate
fulfils a very useful andi important function,
and that, I understand, was the function conceived for this body by tlic Fathers of Confederation. I am not going to deny that
in some respects the Senate might be improved; but great care should be taken
to ensure that in the process of making
improvements there is no sacrifice of that
independence which this body must have in
order to carry on its work most effcctivcly.
In other words, with independent thinking
we will have a clearer judgment on matUers
that corne before us. We will not always be
right; sometimes we, may be wrong; but at
any rate, we will have the opportunity of reviewing proposed legisiation ina a soincwhat
calm atmosphere. That is why I arn bound
to say that I share the view 80 ably cxprcssed
by the honourable, senator fromi TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Rocbuck).
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

SENATE

300

Hon. Mr. HARDY: May I be permitted
to say one word in reply to my honourable
friend concerning the obscurity or unpopularity of the Senate? Only yesterday I was
asked if some time next month I would address a meeting in my home town on the topie
of the Senate. The one reason my friend gave
for asking me to speak on that subject was
that he had heard so much abuse of the Senate,
how useless it was and how senators did
nothing but draw their salaries. In my part
of the country there are many people with
radical views, who would like to abolish the
Senate. I have found that attitude all across
the country.
The motion was agreed to.
CANADA'S

NATIONAL

FLAG

MOTION

The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned debate on motion of Hon. Mr.
Robertson:
That in the opinion of the Senate it is expedient that Canada possess a distinctive
national flag. That the Senate do unite with
the House of Commons in the appointment
of a joint committee of both Houses to consider
and report upon a suitable design for such a
flag. That the honourable Senators David,
Davies, Gershaw, Gouin, Howden, Johnston,
Lambert, Léger, McRae, Quinn, Robinson and
White be appointed to act on behalf of the
Senate as members of the joint committee.
That the said committee have power to send
for persons, papers and records.
That a message be sent to the House of Commons to inform that House accordingly.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Before the debate is resumed by the honourable gentleman in whose
name this order stands (Hon. Mr. Lambert),
may I propose the substitution of the name
of Honourable Mr. Aseltine for that of Honaurable Mr. McRae? I have spoken about
this to the leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) and he has consented. With
leave, I would move this amendment.
The amendment was agreed to.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, this resolution makes two simple
recommendations: first, that Canada should
possess a distinctive national flag; and secondly,
that a joint committee of both Houses of
Parliament should be set up to report upon a
suitable design for such a flag. In the brief
remarks that I intend to make, it is not my
purpose to anticipate the work which I think
really belongs to the committee which will be
set up by this resolution.
Some Hon. SENATORS:
Hon. Mr. CRERAR.

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: If the words of the
resolution mean anyhting at all, they impiy
that Canada does not now possess a distinctive national flag.
While the resolution passed almost unanimously in the other place, I was struck by
the number of speakers who during the debate
spoke as if Canada already had a distinctive
flag, and said that with the addition of a few
details, such as the maple leaf, a beaver or
a shield in the fly, we might well adopt the
so-called red ensign, now at the masthead of
these buildings.
In September last an order in council was
passed permitting the red ensign with the
shield bearing the Canadian coat of arms in
the fly to be flown over all public buildings.
The question therefore arises, does Canada
possess a distinctive national flag? I do not
think she does. To that extent I am in agreement with the implication of the first part
of the resolution before the House.
I was intrigued by the use of the word
"expedient" in the resolution. Upon inquiry
I learned that those who drafted the resolution attached no special significance to the
word, and that it is a stock word commonly
used in the introduction of resolutions. However, it had impressed itself upon my mind
because the more natural word it seems to
me, would have been "desirable".
If that
word had been used, the resolution would
read: "It is desirable that Canada possess a
distinctive national flag." I for one had long
cherished the hope that Canada might have
a flag of her own, and I know that many of
my friends shared that hope.
Upon considering the matter further and
reading the speeches delivered on the subject
in the other House, I came to the conclusion
that "expedient" was the proper word to use.
"Expedient" is defined as "apt and suitable
to the end in view" and also as "characterized
by mere utility rather than principle." The
word is dierived fron the Latin "expedire",
which literally means "to free one caught by
the foot", to extricate, set free, relieve of
;mpediments or disentangle. If we say it is
"expedient" that Canada should possess a
national flag, the use of that word implies
that this country by adopting a national flag
would thereby be freeing itself from some
kind of enculmbrance, and presumably would
be relieved of impediments to future growth
and development. I leave it to honourable
senators to draw their own conclusions from
this course of reasoning; but I believe the
measure of expediency involved in this resolution is associated with the progress of the
Dominion toward a clearer realization of its

NOVEMeER 21, 1945
statue as a nation. How far that status may
be symýbolized in our national ensign remains
to be seen. In somne form or other that idea
wiIl have to, be represented. Again I do flot
now presume to instruet the proposed joint
com.mittee as to the detaiIs of the design it
should adopt.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: That is pre-eminently
a subject for serious thought and discussion
within the confines of the committee. I have
every confidence that the joint committee
will approach its work in a spirit of patriot..
ism, and that a sincere attempt will be made
to reflect the aspirations of the Canadian
people in the report which will finally corne
out of the committee.

The work to be done

xviii not be easy; there will be many différences
of opinion and many' sectional points of view.
Let us hope that in the end the committee
may present a unanimous, report, a report
characterized by a spirit of national unity and
harmony.
Over a year ago we hadj a most inte-resting
discussion in this Chamber on a resolution
submitted by the honourable senator from
Sorel (Hon. Mr. David), reeominending a
Canadian history textbook to be used in
common by ail the sehools of our nine provinces. At that time I took the liberty of
quoting a passage from a critical essay writtcn
by a briliant young Cýanadian, Dr. E. K.
Brown, as a means of indicating som'e of the
dificulties in the ýway of preparing such a
book. Because that passage is so appropriate
to the subjeet now before us, I quote it again:
Canada is flot an integrated whoie. The
Maritime Provinces recall the days, only sevsntyfive years in the past, when they were separate
colonies; Nova Scotia, for instance, has reestablished its colonial flag, dating from the
18th century, and fiying now from te Province
Blouse at Hlalifax; French Canada is a civilization apart; Ontario. uneonscious1y accepts itself
as the norm of Canadian life; the Prairie Provinces are steeped in their special vivid Western
past; and Brit4sh 'Columbia has a strong sense

of its pre-Confederation life and of its con-

tinuing separate identity. Geography confirma
this influence of bistory. Týhere le little doubt
that the Fathers of Confederation, or the
majority of the leaders among them, expeoted
and planned for a much mQre unifisd whole
than bas so f ar corne into being. lu time of
war the tendsncy to self-aggrandizement on the
part of the provinces is arrested, and even revsrssd; but there is ground for fearing that the
return to peace will etart it into, vigorous being
once more. Among most Canadiens there la

little eagerness to explore the varieties of Oanadian lifs.
With that vision of the founding fathers of
this country, to which Dr. Brown alludes,
most of us are familiar; and, like him., we
know that as yet it has not been fulfilled. We

remember that it was Macdonald who in -the
beginning of his work on Confederation envisaged a Kingdom of Canada; and thal
Cartier said:
Shall we be content to maintain a mers provincial existence, when by combining together
we could become a great nation?
D'Arcy McGee declared:
I hope te ses the day when there xviii bs no

other term for our patriotismn but Canadian,
without the ,prefix eitber French or Englieli.

Howe from Nova Scotia predicted that there
would arise:
A spirit that "may iead North Amer'lca to, cast

aside her colonial habiliments, te put on national
aspects.",
And Tupper was led to say:
Canada takes ber place side by aide with other
powers on equal terms.
Casting back to these words, perfect in

their patriotie sentiment,

one cannot

help

thinking bow unfortunate it was that those
great men while formulating a new federation
for the nortbern haîf of this continent did
not give us as weil a symbol of it ail in the
form of a Canadian fiag which would bave
been as definite as the nationhood of whicb

they spoke.
It is for this Parliament, almost eighty
years later, to take up this task in the spirit
in which the Dominion was given birth. It
seems to me that the demand whicb bas
arisen in Parliament at -this time for an individualistie fiag is traceable to two causes.
In the first place, I think it is due to the
part played by our armed forces abroad during the recent war. and particularly hy the

Army andi tbe Air Force. We ail know of the
eagerness of tho6e fo.rces to adopt a distinctive Canadian symbol in the field, and we

recaîl that permission was given -to Generai
McNaughton to adopt for the First Canadian

Division a fiag bearing the imprint of a green
maple leaf in the fiy.
I think the other impelliiig motive behind
the demand for a national fiag at this time
is the desire of the new Canadian embassies
abroad to fiy a distinctive fiag over their
official buildings.
In his later years Joseph Hlowe said this:
A wise nation gathers up its records, preserves
its monuments, and fosters national pride and
love of country by perpetual reference te, the

sacrifices and giories of the past.

It seems to me that at this time, as we
in common with the rest of the world enter
upon a new era of history, a Canadian fiag
should suggest these things increasingiy to
the mind of our people. It is this thought

INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Honourable senators,
in the 1944 session a Senate committee made
a report cn the, development of hydro power

in this House, I should like to ask why it has
not been presented here.
Hon. Mr. COPP: In the absence of the
honourable leader of the Government -(Hon.
Mr. Robertson) I am not able to answer
the inquiry. The report may be ready to be
laid on the table of the, Senate, but it is not

TRANS-CANADA AIR LINES BILL
REFERRED BACIC TO COMMITTEE
Hon. Mr. COPP moved third readîng of
Bill 21, an Act to amend The Trans-Canada
Air Lines Act, 1937.
Hon. S. A. HAYDEN: I desire te move that
this bill be not now read the third time, but
that it be amended as follows:
Page 1, line 19. Add to the bill as clause 3
the following, and renumber accordingly:
"3. Section thirteen of the said Act is repealed and the following substituted ýtherefor:
'13. The books of the Corporation shall at ahi
reasonable times be open to audit by an auditor
to be named ann.ually by Act of Parliament,

and such auditor shaîl report annually to Parliament in respect of such audit'."
Page 3, line 48. Add ýto clause 10, renumbered as clause 11, the f ollowing:

"28. Every order in council made under this
Act shail be laid before Parliament as soon as
may be after it is made.
29. The Board of Directors shall make a
report annualhy to Parliament settin f orth ini
a summary manner the results of their operatiens and such other information as appears te
them to be of publie interest or necessary for
the information of Parhliament with relation to
any situation existing at the time of snch report, or as may be required from time to time
by the Governor in 'Council.
30. The annuýal reports of the Board of
]Jirectors and the auditor, respectivehy, shall be
submitted to Parhiament through the Minîster."
Honourable senators, may I make Er brief
explanation of the purposes of the proposed
amendment? When this bill came before the
committee yesterday I raised the question of
making provision for an auditor and a report
to Parliament, becaàse the original Act simply
provided that the Minister might appoint an
auditor and that the auditor should report to
the Minister.

During the period that this statuts has been
in force the Air Lines have been operated
under the Canadian National Railway system.
By reason of the provisions of the Canadian
Nationail Railway Act, under which an auditor

ie appointed by Parliameiit, reports are moade
to Parliament by the Board of Directors and

by the auditor.
The bill now before us provides for en-

larging the capital of the Trasis-Cànada Air

RZY15fl IDMON

SENATE

Lines, and there was some question as to
whether the general provisions contained' in
the Canadian National Railway Act or some
particular provisions would govern. The
policy of the Government to divorce air line
operations from any other method of transportation has been announced. Therefore, in
my view, it becomes doubly important that
the right to scrutinize the operations and
accounts of the Trans-Canada Air Lines should
be one which the public enjoys, and which
should be in the hands of Parliament to
exercise as it secs fit; and that each year
reports should be received from the Board of
Directors and the auditor. When I raised
this question in committee yesterday there
was some discussion on it, but no formal
motion for an amendment was submitted. In
connection with the operations of Crown companies I think there should be the same right
of scrutiny by the public as exists in regard
to the functions and operations of a department of the Government. Therefore, I submit, the Senate should make provision by
statute that the public, through its representatives in Parliazment, can obtain these
reports on the operations of the company.
For that reason I would move this amendment.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, is it your pleasure to accept the
amendiment?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: When this matter
was before the committee there was some
suggestion that Section 13 of the TransCanada Air Lines Act should be amended.
May I draw the attention of honourable
senators to the wording of the proposed
amendment:
The books of the Corporation shall at all
reasonable times be open to audit by an auditor
to be named annually by At of Parliament.
Section 13 of the original Act, passed in
1937, provides that the auditor shal: be
appointed by the Minister. It seems to me
that we are departing from the practice if we
accept an amendment providing that the
auditor shall be named annually by an Act
of Parliament.
Hon-. Mr. HAIG: May I ask a question at
this time?
Are those words not incorporated in the Act relating to the Canadian
National Railways?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I cannot answer
that.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I think they are.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN.

Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I would point out
that if this amendment carries it will then
be necessary to enact legislation specificalily
naming an auditor for the Trans-Canada Air
Lines Limited'; whereas, in the case of the
Canadian National Railways, I have no doubt
that some such legislation is now on the statute
books.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No. The bill is passed
every year.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Every year.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: We have already passed
it this year.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: If the amendment
carries, Parliament will be obliged to pass an
Act specifically appointing the auditor for
Trans-Canada Air Lines.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators, I
have noted the words of the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell); but
the Minister said in committee that next
session an Act will have to be passed dealing
with the whole Trans-Canada Air Lines Act.
Every year since I have been a member of
this honourable House an Act has been passed
appointing an auditor for the Canadian
National Railways. There is no hardship in
that. What I an concerned about is the
underlying principle involved in providing
auditors for Crown or Government-owned
companies. It has the effect, if I may use
the term, of protecting Parliament. We have
no doubt at all, at least I have not, that any
government whatever that may be in power
would try to run an organization of this kind
honestly, fairly and properly in every respect.
But it is our duty to see that the public is
protected by having an audit of the business.
Something that happened when I was a member of the Manitoba legislature made a strong
impression on me. We had the right to
appoint auditors for the University of Manitoba, but we did not provide that the auditors'
report be tabled. The result was disastrous.
The auditors did not catch the crookedness
in the management of the university's affairs,
and the university lost all its trust funds,
more than $1,000,000.
It is our responsibility to see that there is
a proper audit of this organization. The new
business will not have started for some time
yet, so the bill does not have to be passed
this session. It could easily be put over to
the next session, which will open in February
or early March,, and the whole thing could
be discussed then.
Hýon. Mr. CAMPBELL: May I ask my
honourable friend whether he does not agree
that if this amendment is carried there will

NOVEMBER 22, 1945
be no auditor properly appointed to audit
the books of the Trans-Canada Air Lines,
unless an appointment is made by Act of
Parliament?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It would have to be done
by Act of Parliament.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Who would be the
auditor in the meantime?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: There will not be anything to audit in the meantime, because the
subsidiary companies will not be established.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Does my honourable friend not realize that this amendment
has nothing to do with the bill before the
House?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I know that.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: It is an amendment to the original Trans-Canada Air Lines
Act. I submit that if this amendment carries
there will be no auditor authorized to audit
the books of Trans-Canada Air Lines, which
company is now operating.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It is still under the Canadian National Railways; this bill does not
make any change in that regard. The bill
gives the Government power to do certain
things, but in committee the other day the
Minister virtually told us that these things
would not be done until the new bill was
passed next spring. If my honourable friend
has any doubt as to the auditing, I would
suggest that the bill be referred back to the
committee for further consideration.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I understood the
Minister to say in committee that this bill
was intended only to amend the TransCanada Air Lines Act, and that although the
bill contained no provision for an audit there
would be an audit such as is proposed in the
amendment of the honourable member from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden).
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I would move that the
bill be referred back to the Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphe and Harbours, together with the proposed amendments, for further consideration.
Hon. Mr. COPP: If the bill is to be referred
back, perhaps my honourable friend from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) wiM withdraw
his amendment.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, that is not necessary.
I am moving in amendment to the amendment, that the bill be referred back to the
committee, and that the amendments be
referred to the committee also.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: The honourable senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) hae moved
47704-21J

305

an amendment that the biH be not now read
a third time but that it be amended. Now
in amendment to the amendment it is proposed that the amendment be not concurred
in, but that thie bil be referred back to the
Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs
and Harbours.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: With the amendment.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: «I think that is in order.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It is moved by
Honourable Senator Haig, as an amendment
to the amendment of Honourable Senator
Hayden, that this bill be referred back to the
Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs
and Harbours, together with the proposed
amendments.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: For the benefit of
honourable senators who are not members
of the Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and
Harbours, I may be allowed to say a word
before we vote on this amendment to the
amendment. To me this bill seems very
simple. In brief, it provides for capital for
the new company that is to be organized, and
states that the Canadian National Railways
will finance the Trans-Canada Air Lines. I
do not know what the name of the new company will be, but let us call it Trans-Ocean
Air Lines. Whatever provisions there may be
for an audit of the Trans-Canada Air Linai
will remain in effect if this bill passes, and
any amendment that is made to the bill will,
I think, apply to Trans-Canada Air Lines. As
I see it, the bill does not create any new
corporation; it simply specifies ways and means
of providing $20,000,000 additional capital for
this trans-ocean air line business we are starting.
I want to make a brief reference to this
new business. I am in favour of the bill. I
had hoped that our railways, which have long
operated steamship services, would also be
interested in trans-ocean air services; but
we were told in committee that they are not.
So it is left for the Government to branch
out into this business. In so doing they will
be following the plan adopted in Great Britain.
In the United States the airways are privately
financed and operated.
It is very important that Canada should
not lose its opportunity to participate in the
trans-ocean air business. We do not know
how extensive its development will become.
I have a feeling, though, that we shall be
somewhat handicapped in competing with
private enterprise, for governments are naturally slower to take action. They must come
to Parliament for their money, and they have
not the benefit of advice from a board of

306

SENATE

directors sitting frequently to consider ways
of improving the service. I predict that the
American companies will probably provide the
best service in the world. Their aggressiveness, their easier access to capital required
for financing, and their more flexible'system
of operating under a board of directors, will
give them an advantage over any governmentcontrolled organization. However, the question
of government control versus private enterprise is not an issue here, because we have
no private company desirous of going into
the business. So in the circumstances the
Government must step in, and I am heartily in
favour of that.
We should not take the matter lightly.
True, by this bill we are providing $20,000,000,
but no one can predict the future of air
service, or say what competition will have to
be met as to rates or whether the business
will be profitable or otherwise. I do think we
should enlarge our vision in the matter,
because I am firmly of the opinion that at
some future date we shall be asked to appropriate more money. It will not be disappointing to me if one or two years hence we are
requested to increase the appropriation for
trans-oceanic services by a good many million
dollars. With our experience of progress and
development in the field of transportation, I
think we should anticipate that more capital
will be required. With all this in mind, I am
still in favour of the bill.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Honourable senators,
my understanding is not exactly that of the
honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. McRae). I thought it was a matter of
Government policy to take over all air services in Canada-I am not certain of the
trans-oceanic business-and also to refuse
railways that privilege.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: May I say in reply to
my honourable friend, that the Minister, I
think in answer to a question I put to him,
said the railways were not interested.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: They could not have
been.
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: Mr. Howe's statement in committee yesterday as I 'recal. it,
was that when Trans-Canada Air Lines
wante.d to give ocean service, the railways were
not willing or did not want to do so. That may
not be the situation at the present time. Mr.
Howe's statement applied to the commencement of overseas service.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is correct; that is
what he said.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, it has been moved by Hon. Mr.
Hon. Mr. MoREA

Haig that the bill be referred back ,to the
Standing Conmittee on Railways, Telegraphs
and Harbours, together with the proposed
amendment.
The motion was agreed to.

CANADA'S NATIONAL FLAG
MOTION

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on motion of Hon. Mr.
Robertson:
That in the opinion of the Senate it is expedient that Canada possess a distinctive
national flag. That the Senate do unite with
the House of Commons in the appointment of a
joint committee of both Houses to consider
and report upon a suitable design for such a
flag. That the honourable Sena-tors Aseltine,
David. Davies, Gershaw, Gouin, Howden,
Johnston, Lambert, Léger, Quinn, Robinson and
White be appointed to act on behalf of the
Senate as members of the joint committee.
That the said committee have power to send
for persons, papers and records.
That a message be sent to the House of Commons to inform that House accordingly.
Hon. WILLIAM DUFF: Honourable senatorsSome Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: -the motion before the
House is, in my opinion, unique in several
ways. For instance, it says, as does the resolution passed in the House of Gommons, "it
is expedient that Canada possess a distinctive
national flag."
I wish to call particular attention to the
words "distinctive national". What do those
words mean? I think you will agree with me
"Disthat their meaning is very clear.
tinctive" means characteristic, special, peculiar, distinct, outstanding or out of the
ordinary. If that is true, before we discuss a
distinctive Canadian flag, honourable senators,
I think we should stop and consider where we
are and who we are. The word "national"
has a somewhat similar application.
A
national flag means the flag of a nation;
the flag of a country that is a separate and
distinct nation. We must consider, in my

NOVEMBER 22, 1945
opinion, those two words before we even
decide to help the House of Commons by
appointing a joint co«nmittee.
Bef are dealing further with those words,
hcrnourable senators will agree with me when
I say that -the consideration of a flag is of
importance, flot only today, but always bas
been a matter of importance. People who are
loyal ta, the country and to, the British Crown,
but who live in the in&terior and do no't corne ini
as close contact with the 1¶ying of flags as do
we who live on the Atlantic and Pacifie coasts,
are juast as reueh interested in the flag, in at
least <me particular, as we are. We who were
born on and by the sea, who have been raised
to the sound of ocean waves breaking on the
shore, lie awake at night when the wind blows
and the storm rages. We wonder "Where is
my wandering boy to-night?" During the war
we rea.lized, perhaps better than anyone else,
the dangers faced by the lads at sea-on
transports, corvettes, navy boats and other
vessels; we aLso appreciated that the navy of
Great Britain was behind them, and the flag
wa2 flying over there.
As I have said, the flag deserves a special
place in the history of any country. It is an
institution, that goes far back in-to history.
Go back, if yau will, to the time 500 years
before Columbus, when Erie the Red, flying
the flag of the Vikings, came to the shores
of Labrador and Nova Scotia. When John
Cabot came from England to Nova Scotia ini
1497, the first thing he did when he landed
on the soil of this continent was to raise the
flag of the Cross of St. George, which was
the British flag of that day.
In 1801, after the Union of England and
Scotland, when King James II of Scotland
sat on the throne of Great Britain, the Cross
of St. Andrew was added to the Cross of St.
George. Shortly afterwards, when, Ireland
joined the union and the Kingdomn of Great
Britain and Ireland was born, the Cross of
St. Patrick was added, and that was the
beginning of the~ flag that today is commonly
known as the Union Jack-the British Union
Jack..
Great Britain bas also adopted another
flag, the Red Ensign.
These two fiags, the Union Jack and the
Red Ensign have two distinct purposes. It
is quite true that they are not always used
in their proper places. On my way up to the
Parliament Buildings this m.orning I noticed
on the flag pole over the Peace Tower the
Red Ensign with the coat of arms in the fiy.
The Red Ensign is not the proper flag to be
flown from the Peace Tower. The only proper
flag ta be flown over the Post Office, the

307

Governor General's residence, Rideau Hall,
and every other public building in Canada is
the Union Jack, with the three crosses of St.
George, St. Andrew and St. Patrick. Honourable senators may say that tlue Union
Jack bas a prominent position on the Red
Ensigu,. That is true. It will be noticed that
the Union Jack occupies the upper left-hand
corner of the Red Ensign. The Red Ensiga
is intended ta be flown on private residences,
and an merchant ships which sail the seven
seas on their lawful occasions, and enter
foreign ports.
When we talk about having a distinctive
nation-al fiag we must realize that we are still
"daughter in our mother's house," even if we
are "mistress in our own." May I say, that
the only fiag a merchant marine vessel may
fly in a foreign port is the Red Ensign, without a crown, a maple leaf or anything else on
it. The plain Red Ensign of the British
Empire is the flag which is officially "ccepted
in aIl ports of the world-in Buenos Aires,
Pernambuco or anywhere else. If one of aur
ships goes into. a foreign port flying any
other flag, she is not allowed 'ta dock until
the-Red Ensign is flying fromn her masthead.
I therefore say that before we start talking
about having a distinctive national fiag, we
should first decide whethier we are going Vbo
stay with the British Empire. If we waint ta
become a separate and indeipendent nation
we have a right ta a flag of aur own; but as
long aïs we are part and parcel -of the British
Emipire we should fly the flag of the nation
of which we are a part. During the last two
wars 1 believe we were en-titled to say that
whilst we were not gregt in ourselves we
were part of the British Empire. We are a
Dominion in the British Commonwealth of
Nations, and we have a perfect right ta "the
flag which braved a thousand, years the battle
and the breeze." We should think carefully
bef are substituting a new flag for the onei
that sa long bas been, aur emblem.
If anybody iants ta put a maple leaf or a
fleur de lis or *a beaver or a coat of arms ou
anything elee on the flag that he flics over
his own residence or private building, there
is niothing ta stop him; but over Government
buildings in this country and oveir ourf
embassies in foreign coun-tries the only flag
that can be flown. is the Union Jack, with itfi
three crasses; and the only flag that cain be
flown by aur ships which sail the high seag
us the Red Ensign.
Now, honourable senators, I arn going ta,
make a suggestion. In Nova Scotia we have
had a flag since 1621. It is a pretty nice flag,
as you will see when I show it in a 'minute

308

SENATE

or two. This flag was granted to us under
the charter of New Scotland, through Sir
William Alexander, afterwards Earl of Stir,
ling, by King James I of England, who was
James VI of Scotland. That flag still flies
in Nova Scotia. Of course, we know when
to fly it and where to fly it. We put the Red
Ensign at the top of the pole and the flag
of Nova Scotia next to it. I think that our
flag of Nova Scotia is older than either the
Union Jack or the Red Ensign. My suggestion is that if for some reason or other Canada
decides to have a distinctive national flag, it
should adopt this one. On behalf of my
honourable friend from King's (Hon. Mr.
MoDonald) and the other Nova Scotian
senators presentHon,. Mr. QUINN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: -I
think I can say,
without treading on the corns of aanybody in
Nova Scotia, that if the other provinces are
willing to accept this as the distinctive Canadian flag we shall be glad to approve.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: For the purpose of the
record, wild the honourable senator d'escribe
the flag?
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I do not know if I can
describe it properly or not. It has a white
ground, as you see, with the Cross of St.
Andrew stretching across it, in blue; and in
the centre is the Scottish Coat of Arms, a
lion, rampant.
It is a very beautiful.flag.
The Secretary of State said in Halifax that
some six hundred designs for a Canadian flag
had been submitted to his office.
I suggest
that instead of wasting time on considering
any of those designs Parliament would do
well to adopt this flag of Nova Scotia.
lion. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask the
honourable senator how tiat flag could be
kept clean if it were used much?
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Well, we use a lot of soap
and water in Nova Scotia, perhaps more than
people in Ottawa do.
Now, honourable senators, down in the
Maritimes we also have one or two radio stations which give us some very interesting
programmes.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Particularly on soap.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Tiere is a programme
which I enjoy perhaps better than any other.
It comes from the station in Charlottetown,
Prince Edward Island. Honourable members
need not fear that I am going to do any
advertising. I am referring to the programme
Ron. Mr. DUFF.

known as Don Messer and his Islanders,
which is broadcast on Monday, Wednesday
and Friday evenings at 7 o'clock. Just a few
months ago, when our boys were climbing
over the Normandy beaches and working their
way towards Germany, a soloist on that programme, Charlie Chamberlain, sang a song
which touched not only my heart, but the
heart of everyone who heard it. It was a song
about the flag. After listening to it I asked a
lady friend of mine to write to Charlie for a
copy of the song and music, and he was kind
enough to send it. I am not going to sing the
song for you, but I will recite it, for I think it
is worth putting on the record. Here are the
words:
THERE'S A UNION JACK FLYING OVER YONDER
There's a Union Jack still flying over yonder,
Bravely waving there amidst the shot and shell.
There's a Union Jack wherever you may wander;
When you see it you will know that all is well.

On that little Isle across the stormy ocean,
Our boys are fighting there for Liberty.
There's a Union Jack still flying over yonder,
And it means the world is safe for you and me.
There's a boy in khaki fighting over yonder,
Who left his home to keep this country free.
There's a boy in blue who didn't stop to ponder;
He didn't care just what the cost would be.
He's giving all he has for king and country,
To keep the dear ones safe across the sea.
There's a Union Jack still flying over yonder,
And it means the world is safe for you and me.
There's a boy in khaki fighting over yonder,
Wiere his dad once fought to keep this oid
world free,
Where the poppies bloom in Flanders by the
crosses,
Where lie gave his life to give us liberty.
There are crosses now beyond the cliffs of Dover,
On the shores of Dieppe and in Normandy.
There's a Union Jack still flying over yonderKeep it flying over there for you and me.
The metre is perhaps not as good as it might
be. but I think the sentiment is wonderful.
I feel now, as I felt when I heard the song
over the radio-that, after all that the British
Empire lad meant to us for so many years,
we should not be talking about a distinctive
national flag at this time. Why should we
discard the Union Jack and the Red Ensign?
They have been good enough in the past.
They have gone wherever our soldiers, sailors
and airmen have gone to fight for you and me.
The Red Ensign has been the emblem of protection for our commerce on the seven seas;
and tiat was the emblem flown by the transports which carried our troops overseas. And
let us never forget that not one of those

NOVEMBER 22, 1945
transports was Iost at sea, nor was a soldiier,
airman or navy rating lost. The transports
were, as we know, convoyed by vessels of the
British and Canadian, navies, and later on by
American naval vessels also.
We of this age and generation should be
proud of the fact that the Union Jack continues to fiy over our heads while we are on
land, and the Red Ensign wben we are on
ships at sea. Instead of experimenting with
the idea of a distinctive national flag-and I
arn sure we shall not get beyond the experimental stage, for nobody will be able to choose
among the six hundred designs-let us be
satisfied to leave well enough alone. Whether
we live in Canada or in Ne'w Zealand or in
Australia or in any other Dominion, we are

proud to be part of the British Empire. Then,
I say, leot us stand fifn by the Union Jack and
the Red Ensign.
The motion was agreed to.

TRANSPORT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved t end
liesecnd
reading of Bill 32, an 'Act to a rnend tbe
Transport Act, 1938.
He said: Honourable senators, I h ave asked
the honourable senator for Lethbri ige (Hon.
Mr. Buchanan) to explain this bil
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN:
H onourable
senators, the purpose of this bill i s comparatively simple. It is to bring water transport
in the area of the Mackenzie Ri ver Basin
under the jurisdiction of the Board of Transport Commissioners. Heretofor th e jurisdiction of the Transport Commissioners has been
confined to the Great Lakes and th e area as
far east as the western boundary of the Island
of Orleans, and has related solely to passengers
and package freight. This bill provid es for the
inclusion of bulk freight as well as passengers
and parcel freight. It affects ail navigable
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

waters in wbat is known as the Mackenzie
River Basin, including the, Athabaska river,
and lakes such as 'Grent Bear Lake and Great
Slave Lake-in faet, ail navigable waters running nortb from Fort McMurray to the Aretie.
I *might explain the reason for the introduction of the bill. During the past year those
who had to do with the deveiopment ni
minerai resources in tbe Great Slave Lake and
Great Bear Lake amas complained about what
they termed: exorbitant shipping charges, and
particularly about an incrcase irom $20 to $30
a ton. Representations were macle to the
proper authorities and, since no relief was
offered, this measure bas been brougbt iorward
for the purpose of placing ail rates cbargcd by
shipa opýerating in this area under the Board
of Transport Coýmmissioners.
The shipping is confined, very iargcly, as
most people acquainted with the area know,
b the producta of the mines that are being
deveioped, and to the ou whicb is being moved
from the Fort Norman, field to Yellowknife
sud the Great Slave Lake area, and to the
Eldorado Mines in .the Great Bear Lake area.
It was iargely in relation to the coat of
moving tbat oul in buik from Fort Norman to
these areas that the complaînt arose. Naturaiiy the amendment would affect the rates
on ail types of freights moving in and out of
the Mackenzie River Basin.
We are ail familiar with tbe development
tint bas taken place in this particular section of tbc Northwest Territories. There is
a, promise of very considerabie deveilopment
in the Yellowknife ares.
What bas taken
place up to he present bas been most encouraging. sud for ail we know at the moment it may become onýe of the riebest mining -sections in tbe wboie of Canada. We
cannot say wbat the future bolds for the
Eldorado hecome very successfui.
too may area, but the developments there
Tbe interests operating in tbose fields want to be
able to bring any complaints as to freigbt
rates before some Guvernment-ureated body
having authority to inquire and determine
whetber tbe rates are fair or not. Tbe purpose of this ameudment to the Transport
Act is simply to give to tbe Board of Transport Commissioners jurisdiction over the
sbipping by water in this ares. I might point
out that tbe Board's jurdiction on the Great
Lakes is only over sbips ni more than five
bundred tons, but on the Mackenzîe River
its juriadiction wili be over ail ships of more
than ten tons. Tbe vessel owners wiil bave
bu submit their scale of rates to tbe Board,
and shippers wisbing to complain about rates
will be able to make their objections and
representations to the Board.

311

NOVEMBER 23, 1945
That, in brief, is the purpose of th-is bill,
and I do not think I need say anything
more about it.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Has the honourable
senator any information as te, the number
of ships there are, and as to other means of
transportation from, say, Edmoniton north
into that country?
I have another question. If this amendment is passed, will it flot drive out of business some people who have been operating
vessels in the past and are unable to keep
down their freight rates because of increased
costs?
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: My understanding
is that there are three large shipping companies
operating in the area, but I do not know their
names. 0f course, there is a railroad running
from Edmonton to Fort McMurray. This
amendment, however, would apply not to the
railroad but only to ships operating on the
waters north of Fort McMurray. As to
whether the three shipping companies are
operating profitably or flot at present, or
wbether their charges are reasonable, I cannot say. This amendment would require them
to submit their rates to the Board of Transport Commissioners. If it can be established
that rates are f air, they would be mamntained,
1 presume; on the other hand, if producers in
the area feel that rates are too higli, no doubt
they will appear before the Board and ask
for a reduction.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Honourable senators,
it seems to me that the bill is a very good one.
I will suggest a probable answer to the questions asked by the honourable gentleman
from West Central Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine). At the moment the transportation
f acilities are very meagre and, altogether inadequate to meet the requirements, but I imagine
that more vessels will be made available in
due course. I think we may leave it to the
Board of Transport Commissioners to see that
reasonable freiglit rates are establisbed, and I
can see no reason why the vessels in those
waters should not be under the Board's
jurisdiction.

HONOURABLE SIR ALLEN
AYLESWORTH
BIRTHDAY FELICITATIONS

Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators
before his Honour the Speaker calls the
House to order, I should like to offer on behalf
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

of all honourable senators on both sides, our
most sincere congratulations to one of the
most distinguished members of this Chamber,
who today is celebrating bis birthday. It is
seldom that one bas an opportunity to offer
congratulations to a more outstanding member
of this House than the honourable member
for North York (Sir Allen Aylesworth).
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The honourable senator
is without exception the most distinguished
living lawyer in Canada today.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
May I introduce a
personal note? I can recall a member of the
firm with whom I studied law in Winnipeg,
forty-two y'ears ago, writing to the honourable
gentleman for a legal opinion and remarking
when it was received: "That is the law."
The honourable senator from North York
(Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth) gave this country
most distinguished service in the Alaskan
boundary dispute. With all due respect to
the Commissioners who rendered judgment in
that case, I say that the story would have
been different on the west coast of Canada
today if they had followed the advice and
opinion of the honourable gentleman from
North York. I aIso remember that in 1905,
for a period of about one year, he was Postmaster General and Minister of Labour in
the Government of that distinguished Canadian statesman, Sir Wilfred Laurier. Then
be was Minister of Justice in that Government
from 1906 to 1911, when he retired from active
politics.
I am informed and believe that the honourable member does something that I imagine
no other member of Parliaient does-he
reads every word of Hansard of the other
place and every word of the Senate Hansard. In
my humble opinion-I may not be a very good
judge of the subject-his knowledge of constitutional law is as good as, if not better
than, that of any other person in this House
or outside of it; and I hope to have the great
pleasure of hearing him speak on the question
of which notice was given yesterday by my
honourable friend from Central Saskatchewan
(Hon. Mr. Johnston).
The honourable senator from North York
is a pre-eminent member of this House. He
has a clear mind. Unfortunately for us and
for Canada, 'bis ability to hear things that go
on is limited; but bis mind is just as keen and
bis memory is just as good as it was long
years ago.
On behalf of myself and, of all members on
this side of the House, on my extreme left as
well as on my extreme right-and I know I

NOVEMBER 27, 1945
may speak on behalf of honourable mem.bers
opposite also-I wish to offer our beartiest
congratulations to our bonourable friend, and
to express the hope that he may long be
spared to be a distinguished mernber of this
House.
Some Bon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Bon. ATHANASE DAVID: It is seldom,
honourable senators, tbat a man is afforded
the opportunity of refiecting a full century.
Sir Allen Ayleswortb is to-day ninety-one
years of age. During his long and distinguisbed
career he bas always meritcd tbe unstinted
admiration and respect of bis compatriots of
aIl creeds and all racial origins. The Senate
is indeed higbly bonoured in having among
its members so rare and so briýlliant a personality.
A sincere and dcvoted friend of Sir Wilfrid
Laurier, be was just as faitbful to bis leader
in troubled days as in happy ones. For Sir
Allen fricndship was always a gif t of tbe gods
-a gif t to be used not to further selfisb
interests, but solely to serve tbe friend wbo
honoured bim with lis confidence. During the
stormy years from 1909 to 19519 Laurier
and Ayleswortb were a symbol of unity, and
their strong and unbreakable ties of reciprocal
esteem were a constant example and inspiration to all Canadians.
]Retiring fromn active politics in 1911, Sir
Allen in 1923 greatly bonoured this Chamber
by becoming a dominating figure and one
of its most eminent members.
Be assurcd, Sir Allen, we pray tbat Be, the
source of all true human grandeur, may grant
us the privilege of retaining in tbis Bouse
one wbom Be bas so ricbly endowed with this
attribute. Be assured also that your dignified
presence constitutes an example 'wbich, we shal
strive to emulate.
Could such a distinguished and useful ie
be summed up in a few words, I would say
that it is tbe synthesis and materialization of
loyalty, dignity, honour and intelligence. And,
Sir Allen, 1 would asic you to accept this
expression of our respectful admiration and our
sincere desire that you may long continue to
grace tbis Chamber and by your presence
inspire us to serve our country with even
grèater pride, f aitb and loyalty.
Some Bon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Bon. WISBART MeL. ROBERTSON: I
need bardly say, honourable senators, that I
arn happy to associate myself with the very
graceful tributes which have been paid to our
distinguisbed colleague. In extending to him
my very best wishes, may I add that I arn
proud to be a member of an assembly to
wbich he adds such lustre.

Bon. Sir THOMAS CHAPAIS (Translation): Honourable senators, I cannot refrain
from associating myseif with the eloquent and
well-deserved tributes that have been paid to
our venerable colleague who bas reached today
the extremely advanced age of ninety-one.
I merely wish to state to this bonourable
Bouse that for many years 1 have been one
of the most sincere and enthusiastic admirers
of this gentleman wbo, with bis admirable
personality and bis powerful mmnd, is stili
active in the service of bis country after so
many years of trials andi struggles crowned
witb outstanding success.
I arn happy to join the bonourable members
of this Bouse who bave just paid such an
eloquent trîbute to our honouraible colleague.
Bonourable members of the Senate, being
myscîf one of those among us who long ago
passcd tbe age wben a man usually sits in
tbe legislating bodies of bis country, I fee.l
an even deeper emotion wben I observe the
wonderful mental lucidity and superior knowledge wbicb cbaracterize the bonourable senator
wbose ninety-first birtbday we are tod.ay
celebrating.
1 bave just one word to add. before concluding. May Sir Allan Ayleswortb long
continue to grace this Bouse, and may he
long remain one of the moat brilliant figurés
in Canadian parliamentary if e.
Bon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTB: Bonourable senatore-Som-e Bon. SENATORS: Bear, bear.
Bo.n. Sir ALLEN AYLESWOBTB: Honouraible senators, I should be cither more
than buman or less tban buman if I d'id not
feel deeply toucheýd by the kindness and
gcnerosity of tbe reférences that bave just
been made to me. If I could have h-eard al
tbat twas said I sbould, no doubt, bave been
very mucb embarrassed in attempting to
acknowledge what bas been offered; but, in
that repsect I bave been mercifully protected
by tbe infirmity wbicb bas prevented me from
bearing more than a little of wbat has been
said about me.
I cannot deny-if I bad any wish to do
so-tbe fact that today I am entering, upon
my ninety-second year. That is acircumstance
in regard to wbicb my only feeling is one of
sincere tbankfulness that I ,have been allowed
to, live so long. But I would not wish that
anybody should look upon me as the uldest
member of the Senate or of tbe present Bouses
of Parliament. We aI know that the dean of
the Senate, the member oldest in service, i.9
the bonourable senator from Wentworth (Bon.
Mr. Smith). We ail regret, I arn sure, that
he is not with us todiay, and bas not beenable
to attend the meetings of tbe Senate for

314

SENATE

some time. He is not only the dean of the
Senate in years of service, but also in age.
I am on the threshold of my ninety-second
year; he is very near the completion of his
ninety-second year. The anniversary of his
birth, the Sth of December, falls this year on
Saturday of next week, and though he may not
be among us next week, I hope and trust the
anniversary of his birth will not be overlooked
by those of us who are here.
I can only say that I thank you, one and
all, for your kindness on this occasion. It
is but the same kindness in every respect
that I have enjoyed, during the twenty-two or
twenty-three years that I have had the honour
of a seat in this Chamber. I thank you all
sincereily, and especially the honourable gentlemen who have expressed their sentiments of
good will to me.

UNITED NATIONS MONETARY
FINANCIAL CONFERENCE
DOCUMENTS

AND

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On Notices of 'Inquiries and Motions:
Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators will recall that before we
considered the Charter of the United Nations
and the resolution approving of Canada's participation in the Food and Agriculture Organization, there were two interesting and profitable committee meetings at which departmental officials appeared and answered questions. In due course we shall soon have
before us two more matters of great importance-Canada's ratification of the United
Nations Monetary and Financial Conference
agreement, commonly known as the Bretton
Woods agreement, and a measure to increase
the amounts available under expert credits
for financing exports from this country. As
these two matters will very materially affect
Canada's export trade, it occurred to me that
it might be well to have some discussion on
them in committee before they are brought
up for consideration in the Senate. Therefore,
with leave, I would move:
That the United Nations Monetary and
Financial Conference agreement and a White
Paper ou Employment and Income, presented
to Parliaiment by the Minister of Reconstruetion. April, 1945, be referred to the Standing
Committee on Commerce .and Trade Relations.
Officers of the Department of Finance and
the Department of Trade and Commerce could

NOVEMBER 27, 1945
be invited to appe-ar bofore the committee in
order to answer any questions that honourable
senators may wish to ask.
It could perhaps be argued that these documents would more properly be referred to the
Committee on External Relations or the
Banking and Commerce Committee. However, as the Bretton' Woods Agreement has a
vory dofinite bearing dn trade and commerce,
this would soom to be a proper mattor for
re-ference ta the Committee 'on Commerce
and Trade Relations, which apparently bas
neyer yet held a meeting. That committee bas
a small memnbership, but I would remind ail
honourable senators who are not members
that they will be none the less welcome ta
attend tihe Committee's meetings and to participate in the discusions.
The motion was agreed to.
BUSINESS 0F THE SENATE
On the Orders of the Day :
Hon. Mr. ]ROBERTlSON:- Honourable
senators, before the Orders of the Day are
called, I shouýld like to make a brief apology
to the House for a situation that has arisen
with respect ta some of the business on the
Order Paper. There are at least three; measures
before us for second reading, but the honourable senators whom I fiad asked to explain the
legislation, owing to oircumstances beyond
their control, wilI not ho prepared to do so
until tomorrow. In view of this. I would suggest that when the Sonate adjourns we might
get along with some of aur committee work,
particularly that of aur special committee
whioh is considering the constitution and
functions of our standing committees. I should
like to remind hionourable senators iwho are
flot miembers of the committee that they are
weleome to attend its meetings, where I can
assure them theïr assistance will be appreciated.
Hon. (Mr. HAIG: I have been asked whether
or not the Sonate is likely to adjourn over
thie week-end on Thursday or Friday. Perha.ps the honourable leader of the Government
is ini a position to adrvise me on ithis.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I had inte.nded
to dleal with the question of adjourniment
when we take up Order No. il for the second
reading of Bill 172, an Act for granting ta
Ris Majesty aid- for National Defence and
Demobilization.
Hlon. Mr. HAIG: Very well.

WAR EXPENDITURE AND DEMOBIIIIZATION APPROPRIATION BILLL No. 2
SECOND READING

Hon. W18HART McL. ROBERTSON
moved the second reading of Bill 172, an Act
for granting to His Majesty aid for National
Dedience and Demobil-ization.
He said: Honourable senators, dleubtless
you will recail that this is one of the appropriation bills of which a certain interim portion
was granted Iast session and a furtJxer portion
early this session. Following a procedure
adopted in the past, I would suggest that if
the Senate secs fit to give it second reading,
this measure ho referred to the ýCommittee
on Finance. That comilUee, as honourable
senators know, has9 already given somte consideration te the estimates of which, this bill
covers a portion. There will be a further
meeting of the commiiittee on Thursday morniîng, after which it may report the bill. For

316

SENATE

the benefit of honourable senators who
are net present at the meetings of the committee, I propose that the bill be then consid'ered by a Committee of the Whole, when
officials of the department will be available
to supply any additional information that
honourable senators may require. If at that
time still further information is required, the
bill might be given further consideration on
Friday.
In answer to the question of the bonouraible leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig), I may
say that it is desirable that this bill be passed
in time to receive the Royal Assent on Friday,
because the interim supply already voted will
have been used up by the end of this month.
If any information is still outstanding on
Friday afternoon, we might arrange that it be
furnished when the appropriation bill dealing
wi.th the civil estimates comes before us. This
means of course that we cannot adjourn
before Friday.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I do not intend 'to indulge in what
might be called a financial discussion of this
measure. It has been very fuilly discussed
in another place, and wide publicity bas been
given to that discussion. Normally, financial
matters are discussed at greater length in the
other House than here. But one of our duties
with respect to any financial matters that come
before us is to say to the Government and to
the people that though we have no right to increase expenditures, we do have a right to suggest reduction. I have had the pleasure of
being prosent at meetings of the committee
when representations were made to us by the
Ministers of Defence for the Army, for the
Navy, and for Air; and today, in the absence
of the Minister, by the Deputy Minister for the
Navy. They stated fairly and reasonably the
facts of the case. But I am net sure whether
the Governnent really appreciates the widespread desire throughout the country that our
expenditures should be drastically reduced.
We are spending a very large sum of money
under this bill- 1,365,000,000. All the officials
who have appeared before us have said, without exception, that part of that expenditure
is a carry-over from the previous year and
part is the winding-up of the present year.
They explain that commitments and expenditures were being made up until V-E Day,
which was the Sth of May, and that V-J Day
came more suddenly than anybody expected.
I want to sound a note of warning. We
are determined that the expenses of government in this country shall be reduced by a
very large degree. Reconstruction will get
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

nowhere until we can say to the taxpayers of
Canada: "Your taxes are going to be reduced".
These are no idie words.
If companies are obliged to pay out a large
share of itheir profits in taxes, it means there
is just that much less encouragement for them
to take a chance. The same reasoning applies
to individuals. This House can sound a warning much more effectiively than can the other
House, because when dealing with people it
is popular to advocate the spending of money.
The public thinks the Government gets its
money from some secret mine. There is no
such place. The money comes out of the
pockets of the taxpayers of this country,
and nowhere else. If the Government continues
to burden the people with taxes-and the
main source of revenue now is the income
tax, which is a direct tax on energy and
enterprise-the people will take fewer chances
to make money. Many men and women will
tell you, "If I earn more money I will go into
a higher income tax bracket, and it means
nothing to me."
As a member of the committee on taxation,
I know that the Government bas spent a
great deal cf money; but also I realize that
the day of high expenditure in this country is
over. If we do not appreciate that now, it
will be forced upon us in much more painful
ways.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I think you are
rigbt.
Hon. Mr. QUINN:
should be.

If it is not realized, it

Hon. Mr. HAIG: It should be. If the
Government does not recognize the problem
the people will, and the country will be faced
with unemployment. It is impossible today
to get men to go to the bush; they will no
longer take the bard, roigi jobs. That is
because they have been coddled in soft jobs.
During the war many young men and women
came from the farms throughout the country
to work in industry. They enjoyed the
theatres, the bright lights, the eight-hour day
and lots of money, and they do not want to
go back to their former way of life. I do not
blame them. I would not want to go back
either. But somebody has to do the rough
work, and if the people of Canada are not
prepared to do it, the barriers of immigration
must be let down so that people who will do
the work may come in.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Many Canadians have
said that immigrants should not be allowed to
come into this country until everyone here is
employed. I am one who is old enough to
have lived through the years following the

NOVEMBER 27, 1945
advent of the Laurier Government, when the
bars were let down and people were allowed.
to corne into this country. Our period of
prosperity started about 1900 and continued
for many years.
We chall have no enterprise in this country
until our expenditures and taxes are eut do'wn.
Enterprise and industry are the only thinge
that can give employrnent. Canada cannot
seil goods even now. When we try to sei
goods to Russia, she demande that the price
be reduced. We cannot seil our goodes on the
world market because our prices are kept up
largely by reason of taxation.
In my early days on the farmi it took
twenty of us to do the work one man can
do today.
Honi. Mr. COPP:

A poor man l

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I would refer the honourable gentleman to my honourable friend back
bere (Hon. ýMr. Horner) who is familiar with
farm operations. I will speak for the provinces
of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, the two provinces I know best. With the advent of powerrnachinery one rnan today je able to produce
as much food as twenty rnen did forty years
ago.
I arn asking the Government to drastically
reduce expenditures in this country. They may
think they have a life-time lease on power;
but when people become unemployed things
can happen very fast. Ail honourable senators can remember the 30's when we encountered the unernployrnent problem. No one at
that time thouglit it would last very long.
But it lasted eight years, and probably would
have persisted if it .had not been for the war.
I have had this question p.ut to me: "Why is
it the country can do certain things in, time
of war that it cannot do in tirne of peace?
HGw je it that the Governrnent can get money
for war purposes when it camnot get it for
peace-time activities?" That is a question
that is asked by the C.C.F. Great Britain
in 1942 reached the bottom of the barrel; she
haà no more moniey to buy goods, hier foreign
securities had disappeared, lier investments
abroad had ail gone.
She reached the
stage where, if the United States, Canada or
corne other country did not corne to hier
assistance, she would be forced. ta stop buying.
Let there be no misunderstanding about it;that was the situation reached by Great Britain
in those days.
Hon. Mr. EULER: She did what we are
ding now-borrowing.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: She had reached, the stage
where she could not borrow any more.

Hon. Mr. EULER:

317

Hoýw about lend-lease?

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Lend-lease came from the
United States and Canada, and ail credit to
us for what we did. We advanced- large sums
of, money and gave goods on an exchange
basis. The assets of Canada consist only of
bricks and mortar once we lose, the markets
of the world and our securities. When, we have
no more securities to sell and nobody wants
to buy our surpluses, we will have to, start
borrowing àbroad. Our public debts indicate
that we are working in that direction now.. It
is said by corne that our obligation is payable
to, ourselves i a limited degree.
Honourable senators, 1 did flot inbtend to
speak so long on this question. I submnit,
however, once again that our responsi'bility
in this matter is very great. We muet challenge these expenditures to the limit. The
budget that. will come in next February or
March must show a drastic reduction in taxation and expenditure or we will not be able
to give employment tri our people. C.-C.F.'ers
are saying that if industry cannot take care
of unemployment, then private enterpriîse lias
failed. I say that no industry, if the life
is ta.xed out of it, can take care of unemployment. If I were a member of the C.C.F.
Party or a member of aC.C.F. goverrnent,
I would tax companies and ind-îviduals to the
limit, because I know that then they would
soon be. out of business. The~ government
would flot have to take them over; they
would disappear. I arn a 'believer in private
enterprise. I believe it offers the greatest
incentive to work and provides employment
to the people of our country. However, it
can only succeed if we treat it fairly ini the
matter of taxation-and that means our
expenditures must be redu-ced.
I agree with the honourable leader of the
Governrnent that the matter under discussion
should be brought before Cornmittee of the
Wbole House. 1 was brought up in a legislature where great use was made of the Comnrnittee of the Wholc. That was where we
really did our work. The bac-k-ibenchcrs-and I was one of them-had the chance of
their lives. They were not on the big coinmittees, nor were they members of the government or leaders of the opposition. They
were just ordinary back benchers, 'but in
Committee of the Whole they had' just as
good a chance as the fellows in the front
row to, make their views known. Therefore,
1 arn more than pleased by the proposai of
the honoursible leadýer.
I conclude with this candid remark: if in
six months time there bas not been a drastie
reduction in taxation and expenditure, and I
still have the honour to bie a member of this

s18

SENATE

House, I will ask the Senate to take steps to
resist such spending as we have seen by the
present Government.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, it is not my intention to prolong
the discussion on this bill at the moment,
because we will no doubt have ample opportunity to examine its proposals in greater
detail when we have the bill before us in
Committee of the Whole, or for third reading.
I think it proper at this time to refer to
what the honourable leader opposite (Hon.
Mr. Haig) has said about the desirability of
reducing the cost of government. All honourable senators will agree in a general way with
the view he has expressed, namely, that following the war the cost of government and
particularly the eost of civil government
should be reduced as much as possible. However, I would remind the honourable senator
that we have just finished a very costly five
or six years of war, and, whether we like it
or not, this country must inevitably face a
burden of taxation greater than that which
existed before the war.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I agree with that.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I do not think that
anyone who wishes to be fair can escape that
conclusion. I would therefore suggest to my
honourable friend that in his desire to have
the cost of government reduced, and in his
approach to this subject in the future, he
endeavour to be specific.
We have just been examining the defence
appropriations. It is known now that even
according to the most conservative estimates
that can be fixed, something like $300,000,000
a year will be required in future to maintain
our Defence Department. That is ten times
the cost of similar services before the war.
Taking that situation as an example, if this
country is to maintain the position it has
achieved as a result of the war, I am quite sure
that my honourable friend would not suggest
at this time that the expenditure for that
Department should be less. As a result of the
war and Canada's position in relation to the
world at large,, other departments of government must inevitably face great expenditures.
I rise now merely to emphasize the importance of specific and constructive criticism
rather than a general denunciation of the
appropriation bills and the Budget when they
come before this House.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators, I am not sure that this is the proper time
to make a few remarks in reply to the senator
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert). Personally, I am opposed to the huge expenditure of
the Government for housing. I think that
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

eventually 75 per cent of the amount will be
lost. I do not think the expenditure is in the
best interests of the men who are going to
receive the houses. The houses are costing
altogether too much, and in my opinion they
are being put in places where it will be
impossible for the occupants to earn a living
within a reasonable distance of their homes.
I do not think any proper consideration has
been given to the question of where employment is to be found for the men who are to
live in these houses. Time will probably show
that housing is one thing on which money is
being thrown away.
Hon. A. D. MeRAE: Honourable senators,
it seems to me that we discussed this bill
pretty thoroughly in the committee. I want
to say how pleased I was at the frankness of
the ministers and officers of the three branches
of the Department of National Defence in
explaining the expenditures covered by this
bill and forecast-ing those for next year. It
was next year's expenditures that interested
me chiefly, because the money covered -by
this bill has already been spent and we cannot do much more than approve it.
I agree with what has been said by my
leader (Hon. Mr. Haig) with respect to taxation, but I am afraid the public will be dis-.
appointed in the reductions that can be made.
As I recall it, the Minister explained that the
budget to meet Army requirements next year
will be very large. The total bill for the
three services-the Army, the Navy, and the
Air Force-will be pretty close to one and a
half billion dollars. That is a lot of money.
I believe that this large estimate will prove
to be not far wrong. We may get along with
one or two hundred million dollars less, but
that does not seem to count for much any
longer. So I repent that while I agree with
what my leader says as to the desirability of
reducing taxes in order to get things going, it
seems to me that we cannot hope for much
reduction when we think of the heavy expenditures that still have to be made because
of the war.
Hon. THOMAS VIEN: Honourable senators, we should bear in mind that this War
Appropriation Bill is the one which, normally,
would have been submitted to us in March
or April, 1945. It will be recalled that the
life of the last Parliament expired on the 16th
of April. Up to that time we had passed
only interim measures for war appropriations
and ordinary supply. It seems to me that,
in order fairly to judge the amounts involved
in this bill, we should remember that in
March and April the war was still going on.
Hostilites with Germany ended on the 8th
of May, and w-ith Japan on the 15th of

319

NOVEMBER 27, 1945
August. But there was na immediate cessation of military expenditures. Rundreds of
thousands of ou-r men were stili in Europe
and elsewhere, and our naval vessels were at
sea. So that there has hardly been any reduction of expense in that regard to this day,
when our armed forces are far from being
completely demabilized..
I agree with the honourable, leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Haig) that the Governiment ought
to eut down expenses. Great reductions have
no doubt ibeen made. I confes, however, that
when I see 80 many men and .wonlen stili in
uniform. on our streets, wvhen I read of s
many training camps being stili in operation,
1 wonder.whether expenditures could not have
been reduced muçh more. Is there an urgent
need for ail the jeeps, military cars and trucks
which one stilil observes 'being dTivenl around
by meni and women of the Aruny, the Navy
and the Air Force? I -arn willing to. give
credit to the Goverament and to assume 'that
everything possible is being dione. Let us
hope the Government ýwill heed the warning
recently given in the other place, and repeated
here today, and, that ail non-essential activities will be dirastically eut down. We should,
however, considee this bill now as if we .were
back in March or April, when, but -for the
circumstances to which. 1 have referred, it
would have been submitted to us.
I suggest that we proceed to the second
reading now, subject to further discussion in
one of our commÀttees or in the 'Committee
of the Whole.
T1he, motion was agreed to,, and the Bil was
read the second time.

CENTRAL MORTGAGE AND HOUSING

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN presented and moved
concurrence in the report of the Stand!ing
Committee on Banking and Commerce on
Bill 23, an Act to incorporate the Central
Mortgage and Housing Corporation.
He said: The committee have examined
this bill and now beg leave to report 'the same
with the following amendments:
1. Page 10, line 33. Insert the following as
new subelause (2) of clause 32:"(2) No person shall be eligible to be an
auditor unless he resides in Canada, is an accountant who has for at least six years preceding the date of his appointment practised his
profession in Canada, and is a member in good
standing of an institute or association of accountants incorporated under the authority of
the Legislature of any province of Canada.
2. Re-number subelauses (2), (3), (4), (5),
and (6) of clause 32, as (3), (4), (5), (6) and

(7).

3. Page 11, line 31. Add as subelause (3) of
clause 34, the following:"(3) As soon as practicable after the end of
each calendar year, the Board shall prepare a
report with regard 'to the administration of the
affairs of the corporation during the preceding
calendar year, and the report shall be laid
before Parliament at the same time as the copy
of the accounts and repo.rt mentioned in the
preceding subsection."
4. Page 13, line 49. After "Part II" insert
"and section forty-two."
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall these
amendments he taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Now.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, before the motion is put, may I say
that I was present at the meeting of the
committee this morning, and am entirely in
accord with the amendments.
These amendments mean that the auditing
shall bc donc by chartercd accountants who
belong to a regularly incorporated organization, and that the auditors' reports shall be
placed in the hands of the Minister for tabling
within a reasonable time after the opening of
Parliament.
It is also intended that the
Board shall make reports, which will be
tabled in Parliament.
I am in accord with the amendments because they are in agreement with the procedure followed in relation to other Crown
companies, such as the Bank of Canada, and so
forth. On the other hand, I am opposed to
this procedure generally, as I think the auditors for such companies should be appointed
by Parliament.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LEGER.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: The auditors for the
Canadian National Railways are appointed
by Parhiament, a method that has been found
very satisfactory. I think the Government
or some honourable member of this House
should introduce a bill next session to provide that the auditors of all Crown companies must be chartered accountants, and
that they shall be appointed by Parliament
and shall report to Parliament.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Do you mean that
the auditors should report to Parliament?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The auditors should
report to Parliament. As was said by the
honourable member from Lincoln (Hon. Mr.
Bench) in committee this morning-and I
agree with him-the auditors of a business
concern are appointed by the shareholders.
As far as Crown companies are concerned, we,
as members of Parliament, represent the people who own the shares, and we are the only
ones who can acet.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it your pleasure to adopt the amendments.
The motion was agreed to, and the report
was concurred in.

NOVEMBER 28, 1945
THE SENATE-HISTORICAL AND
CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION
DISCUSSION

Hon. J. FREDERICK JOHNSTON rose in
accordance with the following notice:
That he wil. call the attention of the Senate
to certain matters relating to the historical and
constitutional position of this honourable House
its functions -and its record within the scope of
the responsibilities assigned to this honourable
House under our Constitution.
He said: Honourable senators, in giving
notice' that I would call attention to this
matter I did not expect -or presume that I
would be able to bring much that was new, if
anything, to the attention of the House. My
hope was that I might refer to what the
Senate has done, and to certain benefits that
thereby have accrued to the taxpayers, particularly those resident in the prairie sections
of Canada.
Before dealing with the last mentioned subject, I desire to place on the record certain
quotations from the speeches of Honourable
John A. Macdonald, as he then was, and
Honourable George Brown, two outstanding
statesmen who had most to do with bringing
the provinces of Canada into Confederation
in the year 1867. They made it clear that in
their opinion the Senate had an important
part to play in our parliamentary set-up, and
I submit that the record of this House over
the years since 1867 gives abundant proof that
their judgment was sound. I now read from
a speech made by Honourable John A.
Macdonald on February 6, 1865, which will be
found in the Parliamentary Debates, at pages
36 and 37:
There would be no use of an Upper House, if
it did not exercise, when it thought proper, the
right of opposing or amending or postponin the
legislation of the Lower House. It would be of
no value whatever were it a mere chamber for
registering the decrees of the Lower House. It
must be an independent House, having free
action of its own, for it is only valuable as being
a regulating body, calmly considering the legislation initiated by the popular branch. and preventing any nasty or ill-considered legislation
which may come fron that body; but it will
never set itself in opposition against the deliberate and understood wishes of the people.
The members of our Upper House will be -like
those of the Lower, men of the people, and from
the people. The man put into the Upper House
is as much a man of the people the day after,
as the day before hie elevation. Springing from
the peoale, and one of them, he takes hie seat
in the Council with all the sympathies and feelings of a man of the people, and when he
returns home at the end cf the session, he
mingles with them on equal terme, and is influenced by the same feelings and associations,
and events, as those which affect the mass
around him. And is it, then to be supposed that
the members of the upper _ranb of the legislature will set themselves deliberately at work
to oppose what they know to be the settled

321

opinions and wishes of the people of the country? They wilfl not do it. There is no fear of
a deadlock between the two Houses. There is
an infinitely greater chance of a deadlock between the two branches of the legislature, should
the elective principle be adopted, than with a
nomina-ted chamber---chosen by the Crown, and
having no mission from the peuple. The members of the Upper Chamber would then corne
from the people as well as those of the Lower
House, and should any difference ever arise between both branches, the former could say to
the members of the popular branch-"We as
much represent the feelings of the people as
you do, and even more so; we are not elected
from small localities and for a short period;
you as a body were elected at a particular time,
when the public mind was running in a particular channel; you were returned to Parliament, not so much -representing the general
views of the country on general questions as
upon the particular subjects which happened to
engage the minds of the people when they went
to the polls. We have as much right, or a better
right, than you to be considered as representing
the deliberate will of the people on genera'
questions, and therefore we will not give way."
There is, I repeat, a greater danger of an irreconcilable difference of opinion between the
two branches of the leislature, if the upper
be elective, than if it holds its commission from
the Crown.
Now I shall read what was said by Honourable George Brown on February 8, 1865. This
may be found on pages 88, 89, and 90 of the
same- volume:
I have always been opposed to a second elective chamber, and I am so still, from the conviction that two elective houses are inconsistent
with the right working of the British parliamenta-ry system. I voted almost alone against the
change when the Counci-l was made elective, but
I have lived to see a vast majority of those who
did the deed wish it had not been done.
Honourable members will recall that at that
time Upper Canada had a second chamber
called the Legislative Council, which was
elected. That is the body to which Honourable Mr. Brown was referring.
Then, speaking at a later time, he goes on:
I thought it would be well to provide for a
more frequent change in the composition of the
Upper House, and lessen the danger of the
chamber being largely composed of gentlemen
whose advanced years might forbid the punctua-l
and vigorous discharge of their public duties.
Still, the objection made to this was very strong.
It was said: ",Suppose you appoint them for
nine years, what willl be the effeot? For the last
three or four years of their terrm they would
be anticipating its expiry, and anxiously looking to the Administration of the day for reappointment; and the consequence would be that
a third of the members would be under the
influence of the Executive." The desire was to
render the Upper House a thoroughly independent body-one that would be in the best position to canviass dispassionately the measures of
this House, and stand up for the publie intereste
in opposition to hasty or partisan legislation.
The points to be noted in these quotations
from the speeches of the Honourable John
A. Macdonald and the Honourable George

322

SENATE

Brown are that both gentlemen stressed the
desire to have the Senate a thoroughly independent body. They also gave their reasons
for favouring an appointive rather than an
elective House. This last opinion, as pointed
out by Mr. Brown, was one he had a-lways
held-an opinion in which he was confirmed
by the experience gained from there being an
elective couneil in the Parliament of Upper
Canada at that time.
I hope honourable senators will bear with
me while I deal as briefly as I can with
certain matters relating to freight rates. Freight
rates are very important in the economic life
of Western Canada. We in the West are
situated long distances from the seaboard, and
freight rates enter into the question of our
costs to a very marked degree.
Away back in 1898 the Canadian Pacific
Railway Company was desirous of building a
branch line from Lethbridge to the Crowsnest
Pass in British Columbia. They approached
the government of the day for financial assistance in the building of the line. The company had, I believe, approached the government in 1895 and 1896, but nothing was done.
A new government came into office in 1896,
and in 1898, as I say, the company approached
that government for financial assistance in
building the line. Assistance amounting to, I
think, $3,400,000 was granted. In consideration
of this assistance the Canadian Pacific Railway
and the government entered into an agreement known as the Crowsnest Pass Agreement, by which they undertook to establish
maximum rates on wheat and wheat products
eastbound, and on farm implements and machinery, fruit and other commodities westbound. At that time British Columbia had
not gone into the production of fruit to any
extent. From the date of the agreement up
to 1906 the farmers of the prairie provinces
had the benefits of those reduced rates.
In 1906 the Government of Manitoba entered into a similar agreement with the Mackenzie and Mann interests. The rates under
this agreement were somewhat lower than
those under the Crowsnest agreement. The
Canadian Pacifie Railway reduced their rates
to meet those under the Manitoba agreement.
Consequently, from the year 1906 to the year
1918 Western Canada enjoyed the benefits of
the rates under the Manitoba Agreement with
Mackenzie and Mann.
In the year 1918 the cost of operating railroads and all other businesses in this country
had increased very materially. I find in the
Hansard of this House that the Honourable
Senator Gideon Robertson, Minister of
Labour, stated that the cost of living had
increased 100 per cent. Another honourable
gentleman interjected that the cost had gone
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON.

up more than that. I think we will all
agree that costs had advanced, and I think
the railway companies were justified in asking for an increase in freight rates at that
time. At any rate, the government of the
day under Sir Robert Borden felt that something should be done, with the result that in
1918 the Board of Railway Commissioners
ordered an increase in rates. I am not a
lawyer and I have net been able to trace
the authority for this order, but I gather from
the records that the Board of Railway Commissioners simply forgot all about the agreements, or else overrode them.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: The rates were increased at that time under the War Measures
Act.
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: Anything can be
donc while we are at war. Those increased
rates were, as I have said, ordered in 1918.
In 1919 the Minister of Railways introduced
certain amendments to the Railway Act.
Those amendments were passed by the other
House, and had they passed this House the
two agreements to which I have referred
would have been nullified for all time. It may
seem strange that the amending bill was accepted in the other House, and I think I
should point out to honourable members that
in those days there was nio eleven o'clock
closing rule in the Commons, whose sessions
frequently continued until two or three o'clock
in the morning. I have left that Chamber at
seven o'clock in the morning 'after an all
night sitting. Members did not lose any
time getting away. The air was blue, and
not entirely by reason of the sulphur fumes
from the match factory across the river. I
mention these facts to indicate that at those
unseemly hours, with few members present,
it was easier to get certain matters through
the House than it would be at another time
with a full house. It was at this point that
this honourable House entered the picture,
and by its action more than justified its
existence for all time to come.
When the bill came to this House, it was
presented by Sir James Lougheed, the then
leader on the Govermnent side and a member
of the Cabinet. His words will be found in
the Senate Hansard of June 6, 1919, commencing at the bottom of page 668:
It is proposed that section 325 be amended

by adding thereto new subsection 5, as folilows:
5. Notwithstanding the provisions of section
three the powers given to the Board under this
Act to fix, determine .and enforce just and
reasonable rates, and to change and alter rates
as changing conditions or cost of transrrtation
may from time to time require, shal not be
limited or in 'any manner affeted by the provisions of any Act of the Parliament of Canada,

323

NOVEMBER 28, 1945
whether general in application or special and
relating only to any specific railway or railways,
and the Board shall -not excuse any charge of
unjust discrimination, whether practised against
shippers, consignees, or localities, or of undue
or unreasonable preference, on the ground that
such discrimination or preference is justified or
required by any agreement made or entered into
by the company.
I may say to' my honourable friend from
Portage la Prai.rie (Hon. Mr. Watson) thaf this
section has to do with the power given to the
Board to pass rates. This proposed amendment
will practicalily have the effect of overriding
agreements that may have been entered into between the companies and the Government.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: I think I am justified
in moving that we do not concur in that amendment. This question was the subject of considerable discussion in the House a year ago,
when the Rai-lway Bill was before us. An
amendment was introduced by the honourable
leader of the House to this effect:
The powers granted to the Board by this
Section shall not be restricted or limited by the
provisions of any special Act heretofore enacted,
or of any agreements heretofore or hereafter
made.
That was suggested a year ago by the minister-I suppose, at the suggestion of the Minister of Railways, and this House rejected that
amendment. It was not inserted in the Bill. I
move that we do not concur in the amendment
made by the House of Gommons, for the reasons
which I gave last year. I referred ,particularly
to the province of Manitoba, which would be

affected by this amendment.
made cash and guarantee contributions towards
the construction of railways on specific agreements with regard to freight rates, :and I claim
that the rigits of the province should not be
taken away. The proposed amendment would
affect also the province of British Columbia.
It will be noted that Mr. Watson mentioned
the provinces of Manitoba and British
Columbia, but did not mention the provinces
of Saskatchewan and Alberta, which were
vitally concerned. The debate continues:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Honeurable gentlemen,
I agree with the motion moved by my honourable friend from Portage la Prairie (Hon.
Mr. Watson). I think that the proposed amendment affects not onl-y steam railways, but also
certain questions with regard to electric railways in the province of British Columbia.
There is at the present time a case in the
province of British Columbia in which the Board
has sanctioned an appeal, and that case is being
argued, or is about to be argued, before the
Supreme Court. If this proposed legislation
went through, it would put the whole matter
out of court. I therefore have much pleasure
in seconding the motion proposed by my lionourable friend from Portage la Prairie.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Watson was agreed
to, and the proposed amendment was not concurred in.
At page 674 of Senate Hansard, June 17,
1919, will be found the report of an important
special committee dealing with the Railway
Act Consolidation Bill. The Honourable Sir
James Lougheed presented the report of the
committee. Dealing with clause 325, he said:
Your Committee recommend that the following
reasons be given, viz:

Sec. 325.-The Senate does not concur in
the amendment of the House of Commons to
Section 325 for the reasons shortly stated.
That the proposed, clause enables the Board
of Railway Commissioners to relieve the cornpanies from carrying out in good faith agreemente confirmed by Act of Parliament, entered
into with municipalities and provinces, the considerations for which were the granting of subsidies and financial aid.
The Senate is of opinion that if these agreements are to be terminated, it should be the
result of negotiations between the parties.

Then at page 808, some days later, I find
this:
The following message was received frorm the
House of Commons:
That this House doth insist upon its amendment made to Section 325 of the Bill No. 19
(Letter A of the Senate), intituled, "An Act
to consolidate and amend the Railway Act."
but with the following limiting provision thereto,
at the end thereof, that is to say: Provided that
this subsection shall remain in force only
during a period of three years from and after
the date of the passing of this Act.
That meant that rates guaranteed undier the

Crowsnest Pass Agreement and the Manitoba
Agreement were suspended for a three year
period.
Honourable senators wil

note that had it

not been for the action of this House on the
motion of honourable Senator Watson, agreed
te by the leader of the House, Sir James

Lougheed, those agreements would have been
abrogated and wiped out. There are some
interested people in this country who claim
this honourable House is of no worth to the
country. I suggest that that one act alone
should satisfy the people that the Senate is
serving a very useful purpose, and before I
conclude I hope to be able to give you some
facts which I think will bear out that
statement.
As I have stated, the rates were suspended
for a three year period from July, 1919. We
corne now to 1922. There had been a change
of government in December, 1921. The new
government, under the present Prime Minister, met Parliament for the first time in
March of 1922. One cf the first acts of that
government, I remember well, was to appoint
a special committee to inquire into the whole
matter of freight rates. I happened to be a
member of the comrnmittee, and certain other
honourable members in this House also were
members.
The committee laboured for many weeks,
and men who had been in this and the other
House for a long time said that never in all
their parliamentary experience had they seen
such a lobby put on to influence a decision as
was brought to bear by the railway companies
during that period.

There was opposition in

324

SENATE

that committee to the restoration of these
rates-and I want at this time to pay tribute
to the honourable senator from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) who, at a very opportune
moment, stepped in with a motion which was
very helpful. The decision was very close.
However, we did succeed in getting a report
to Parliament recommending that these rates
should be restored. The rates were restored
for a one-year period only-1922; then they
were renewed for the years 1923 and 1924.
During this interval the railway companies,
who did not like these agreements at ail,
held that the fixing of rates was ultra vires of
the Parliament of Canada. They took what
my lawyer friends would term a stated case
to the Supreme Court for adjudication. That
was early in the year 1925, but a decision was
not handed down until well into midsunmmer
of that year. The court found that the matter
was intra vires of the Parliament of Canada,
and almost immediately the government drew
an enactment that made these rates statutory,
as they are to-day.
What has the restoring of these rates meant
to the people of Western Canada? It was
stated in the evidence which the freighttraffic people of the railway companies gave
before the committee that the restoration of
these rates would mean a loss of revenue
to the companies of $20,000,000 a year. If
that was so, it must have meant an equal gain
to the wheat producers of Western Canada. I
do nôt think it can be fairly argued that when
the rates were restored there was a net loss
to the railway companies of $20,000,000, for
the restoring of the rates provided the
farmers of the Prairie provinces with extra
purchasing power, which enabled them to
make purchases of lumber and all the other
commodities that go into the making of homes
on the prairies, and the railways, of course,
would collect freight rates on all shipments
of such commodities.
I am now going to take the costs of operating the Senate and tie thern in with the
figures I have mentioned. It is charged in
the country by certain interested people that
the Senate as an institution is not worthy of
its hire. They say we are costing the taxpayers a lot of money, and they are going
to lop us off as soon as they have the power.
These freight rates were restored in 1922twenty-three years ago. The railway companies said the restoration meant to therm a loss
of $20,000,000 a year. By simply multiplying
$20,000,000 by 23, we reach the sum of $460,000,000, which has been left in the pockets of
the wheat producers of Western Canada. I
have made inquiries as to the cost of operatHon. Mr. JOHNSTON.

ing this honourable House, and am assured
that it does not run over $550,000 annually.
If you multiply $550,000 by 23 you get $12,650,000 as the total cost of maintaining the
Senate for twenty-three years, and if you
deduct that frorn the total amount saved by
the restoration of the freight rates, you still
have $447,350,000 left. Just how long would
that pay for the cost of operating this honourable House? Well, a simple calculation shows
that it would pay the cost for more than
eight hundred years. So I think it can be
said we are paying our way.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: I asked the Bureau
of Statistics for figures showing the wheat
production of the prairie provinces during the
twenty-three years from 1922 to the present
time. According to the return the province
of Manitoba produced 1,028,266,000 bushels,
the Province of Saskatchewan 4,607,024,300
bushels, and the Province of Alberta 2,858,830,000 bushels. The production of Alberta
and Manitoba combined in this period has
been 3,887,096,000 bushel-s.
Saskatchewan's
production exceeded this total by 719,928,300
bushels. This indicates that more than half
the amount saved to the wheat producers on
freight rates has gone into the pockets of the
farmers of Saskatchewan. Yet it is in that
province that we find the most criticism of
the functions of this honourable House.
While I have these figures before me
honourable senators might be interested in
knowing what were the years of greatest and
of least production. More wheat was produced on the prairies in 1928 than in any
other year in history. The figure for that
year was 544,598,000 bushels. The next highest
year was 1942, with 529,000,000 bushels, and
the third highest was 1940, with 513,800,000
bushels. The lowest production was in 1937,
when the total was 156,800,000 bushels; the
second lowest was 1936, with 202,000,000
bushels; and the third lowest was 1924, with
235,694,000 bushels. The total production of
wheat by the three prairie provinces during
the twenty-three year period was 8,494,120,300
bushels.
Honourable senators, I like to think of a
traveller from Eastern Canada, westwardbound on one of our great railway lines.
Emerging frorn the timbered area of Ontario,
he enters the Province of Manitoba. Going
on westward, he comes to the city of Winnipeg and to Portage la Prairie, the home of
the late Senator Watson. Proceeding across
the open spaces of Saskatchewan and Alberta,
he reaches the city of Calgary, the home of
the late Senator Sir James Lougheed. Such

NOVEMBER '28, 1945
a traveller views many farin homes on lis
trip across the three prairie provinces. The
living conditions in these homes, and the tasks
of wives and mothers have been made easier
and better; the health and welb-being of littie
chikiren have been improved-all by virtue of
the work done in this House on June 6,
1919. Some may say: "That is a long time
ago. Why review it now?" My answer is
that the wheels set in motion in 1919 by
action of this House are stilil turning
$20,000,000 every year into the pockets of
prairie farmers.
I have ventured to bring the matter up at
this time because the usefui-ness of this Huse
is 'being attacked by certain interested parties
in the country. I respectfully suggest that
the work of the late Senator Watson and the
late Senator Sir James Loughecd, as well as
that of ail other members of this buse who
assistcd in or agreed to the passing of
Senator Watson's motion-the motion that led
the way to the restoration of the rates under
the agreements already mentioned-would
have the hearty approval of those who drafted
aur Constitution and brought this House into
being. Those honourable senators in that
day did honour to themnselves, to Canada and
to hier Par]iamentary institutions.
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: Honourable senators

Hon,. Mr. HAIG: Before the motion is put,
may I ask the honourable gentleman from
Central Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Johnston)
a question? What was the political complexioni
of the Senate in 1919?
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: I am 'very glad
my honourable friend raised that point, which
would have. been brought out if I had not
departed froin my notes. I want to pay full
tribute to those who were members af the
Senate at that time. I thinic I mentioned
that Sir James Lougheed, a Conservative, was
Governinent leader in the Senate. He was
supported by a substantial. mai arity. He and
the other members of bis party had the numerical strength ta pass through the Senate any
measure coming from the ather Hause. But
they did flot choose to do that. iRat.her, they
chose to take the course that Sir John A.
Macdonald and the Honourable George Brown
expected members of this bouse ta take. In
other words, on that occasion the Senate did
nat divide on party lines; it proved itself an
independent body.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: I thought that polities
'were obliterated in this House.

325

Hon. Mr. HAIG: The reason I asked th~e
question-if I may be permitted ta explainis that the record since- Confecieration shows
that whenever the maj ority in this House bas
been, of the saine political complexion as that
of the majority in another place. this buse
bas been independent and has done its finest
work.
b on. Mr. EULER: May I ask my honourable friend from Central, Saskatchewan a
question?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: There is a motion
to adjourn the debate.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I know that. I was
caught, by a motion of that kind, last week.
What I want ta ask my honourable friend is
this: In the other bouse, when the Liberal
Governiment, desired to have those freight
rates abrogated, was it not Liberal members
who succeeded in having the rates preserved?
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTOIN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: He said that.
Han. Mr. EULER: Sa there has been
independence in the ather place as well as in
the Senate.
On motion af Hon. Mr. Mollay, the debate
was adopted.
PENITENTIARY BILL
SECOND READING

ban. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON
moved the second, reading of Bill 92, an Act
ta amend, the Penitentiary Act, 1939.
He said: bonourable senators, I have asked
the honourable gentleman from VancouverBurrard (bon. Mr. MeGeer) if he would be
kind enough ta explain, this bill.
Hon. GERALD G. McGEER: banourable
senators, this bill offers amendments ta the
Penitýentiary Act oi 1939. That Act was
passed after the repart was received froint the
Royal Commission ta investigate the penal
systein of Canada. The members af the Commission were the Honaurable Mr. Justice
Archambauît, Chairman; R. W. Craig, K.C.,
a former Attorney~ General af Manitoba, and
J. C. Malluer, K.C., oi Toronto. The repart
was filect on April 4, 1938. The Act was ta
came inta farce by proclamation. IL bas naot
yot been proclaimed..
The purpose af the proposed amendiments
is ta modify the teris of the 1930 statute
with a view ta facilitating implementatian of
the reforma and changes recommended by the
Rayai Cainmission's Report, which is now
known as the Archambault Report on the
Penal System oi Canada.

326

SENATE

The purpose of the first amendment proposed by this bill is to change subsection 1 of
section 4. so that the commissioners who compose the Penitentiary Commission shall, like
most other civil servants, be appointed to
hold office during pleasure instead of for a
term of ten years. Difficulty was found in
getting men to act under an appointment for
a period of ten years with no provision for
pension. The amendments are deemed to be
necessary not only to make the positions
sufficiently attractive to the best type of
men qualified to act as commissioners,. but
in order that the work of penal reform may
be gone on with as rapidly and effectively
as possible.
The second amendment provides that
instead of all three commissioners being
appointed at once, one or more may be
appointed from time to time. In putting the
1939 Act into force and in implementing the
recommendations of the Archambault Report,
it was found that a good deal of preliminary
work would have to be done. The Department believes that it would be better to
appoint one commissioner to do this preliminary work prior to the determination and
final setting up of the Commission.
The object of the third amendment is to
inide in the transfer of staff the employees
of the Purchasing Agent's Branch, the duties
of which relate entirely te penitentiaries.
The fourth amendment provides for the
application of the Civil Service Act to the
assistant commissioners and the staff of the
Commission, and for the application of the
Civil Service Superannuation Act to the commissioners as well as to the assistant commissioners, the staff of the Commission, and
the staffs of the several penitentiaries.
The fifth amendment provides that in whatever year the Act is proclaimed, any appropriation for the Penitentiary Branch included
in the estimates shall be available to the Commission, as though the Commission had been
in operation wven the estimates were passed.
The sixtlh amendient would change Section
84 of the Act so as to make it possible to
bring any part of the Act into effect by
proclanation.
Section 84 as at present
worded provides only that the Act as a
whîole may be proclaimed.
Section 2 of the bill really inaugurates the
adoption of whatever part of the Archambault
report is to become the permanent penal
policy of the Dominion. In our post-war
period we have to consider no more important phase of our national life than that
involved in this report, which I bel'ieve is
probably the plainest text-book that one can
read on the criminal situation in any country.
Hon. Mr. McGEER.

The, Commissioners who made that report were
splendidly equipped for their work. Two of
them now adorn the Supreme Court bench, one
in. Quebec and one in Ontario, and the third
Commissioner, Hon. R. W. Craig, was one
of the most outstanding Attorneys-General
that the province of Manitoba ever hadi. Section 2 reads as follows:
The said act is further amended by adding
immediately after section four thereof the fol'lowing:4A. The Governor in Council may appoint one
or more commisioners mentioned in the last preceding section of this Act with authority, pending the coming into force of this Act,
(a) to consider the several recommendations
contained in a certain report of a Royal Commission to investigate the penal system of Canada
made on the fourth 'day of April, nineteen hundred and thirty-eightThat is the report to which I have referred.
-other
than those relating to the subjectmatters referred to in subsection two of section
five of this Act;
That subsection deals with certain. incidental
matters, such as remissions, exercise of the
Royal prerogative of mercy, and the administration of the penitentiaries. Then follow
these paragraphs:
(b) to make inquiry, subject to the direction
of the Minister, into matters relative to the
aforesaid recommendations;
(c) to report the results of such consideration
and inquiry and to recomnmend to the Minist'er
what is advisable or expedient to be done to implement the aforesaid recommendations; and
(d) to perform such other duties as may be
assigned by the Minister.
I have before me a list of the reforms that
have been adopted and! developed since that
report, was filed. The very nature of these
reforms indicates something of the conditions
which at that time existed in our penitentiaries.
This, in part, is the list:
A convict at present earns remission as
from the date of admission instead of the seventh month of sentence as was the case previously. Remission is now allowed for holidays
and also for periods of sickness. For purposes
of remission, overlapping terms are considered
as one.
A thorough inspection of penitentiary industries has been made.
Shaving and bathing of conviets have been
made more frequent.
A tomato canning factory is in operation at
one penitentiary, the canned product being
shipped to other institutions. Arrangements are
also in effect to can other penitentiary-grown
vegetables commercially at factories near to two
other penitentiaries.
More liberal visiting and writing privileges
have been accorded to deserving convicts.
Imp-roved cell lighting has been installed
wherever possible.
Kitchens have been renovated and special
ranges installed in practica'lly every institution.

Cleanliness and preparation of food are receiving careful attention.

SENATE

Records of school attendance at Collins' Bay
penitentiary show that the enrolment of pupils
at present is several times higher than in 1937.
Increase in the number of work horses for
farm purposes at Collins' Bay penitentiary has
been unnecessary due to the purchase of additional farm tractors. Four tractors are now
in operation compared with two in 1937.
The separate range of the hospital at Saskatchewan penitentiary has been closed off by
a glass partition for the treatment of tubercular patients of the institution who can be
given adequate treatment outside of the provincial sanatorium. This range has a southern
exposure with the entire area glassed in.
Approximately 300 acres have been added
in the last five years to the cultivated portion
of Saskatchewan penitentiary farm. In addition, an area of over 400 acres suitable only
for pasture has been devoted to this purpose
in recent years in maintaining a herd of beef
cattle to provide meat for rations.
Improved varieties of grains and vegetables
have been seeded in recent years to learn those
best suited to the soil and climate of Saskatchewan penitentiary. In the rotation of crops,
the various soil formations are given consideration.
For several years Saskatchewan penitentiary
has maintained a herd of beef cattle and plans
are under way for a dairy herd to be established
at this point within two years.
That, I repeat, is a partial list of the reforms which the Royal Commission recommended, and which have been adopted during
the war period. But a number of major reforms still remain to be considered, and that
is why it is important that section 4A be
incorporated in the Act.
It may interest honourable senators te know
something of the criminal situation in Canada
today as compared with what it was the year
immediately following the Royal Commission's report. I have taken the statistics for
1939 and 1943. They are as follows':

It will be observed that there is no material change in the criminal situation as
shown by these figures, other than what
might bc expected uormally to follow during
the war years.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Has the honourable
senator any figures of the penitentiary
population?
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: I am just going to give
those figures. It is to be expected, and statistics are already showing that there will be an
increase of crime during the post-war period.
I shall now give some figures on the number
of persons held in custody for the same relative
years, 1939 and 1943.
Hon. Mr. McGEER.

-The latest figure I could secure for 1945
shows that the number of people in penitentiaries is increasing, and is already up to 3,200;
but that is less by 600 than in 1939.
I come now to the cost of administration.
This is important, because upon the financial
provisions depend the reforms that will be
made. Despite the decrease in the number of
prisoners, the cost of administration has increased from $87,920 in 1939 to $122,344 for
1946. The item for operation and maintenance bas increased· over the saine period
by $867,000-from $2,679,561 to $3,512,683.
That is not a very large sum, of money for
the Dominion of Canadla to be paying for
the maintenance of its penal institutions.
The Archambault Commission recognized
the need for a fundamental change, and the
Commissioners in their
recommendations
brought to the fore, above all, other things, the
need for prevention of crime. lu every consideration of penal systems there is great
justification for giving the humanitarian side
of the problem the deepest and most profound
sympathy; on the other hand, there is no
lessening of the need for giving serious and
immediate consideration to the protection of
society. The Archambault Commission at page
359 of its report makes these recommendations
for the prevention of crime:
60. The appointment and discharge of police
officers, whether federal, provincial, or municipal, and the administration of police departments should be entirely removed from the suspicion of political influence.
61. A defimte-system of training police officers
along the lines now followed in Great Býritain
shou'ld be adopted in all provinces of Canada.
62. The interest of the public should be enlisted in an organized manner, having regard to
the vital importance of the prevention of crime
by reducing juvenile delinquency, and the assistance of social service agencies and churches
and schools in co-operation with the home
should be organized to this end.
63. The responsibility of the state for the
financial support of community clubs, boys' and
girls' clubs, and leisure time programmes should
bc recognized. They are a means of preventing
or, at least reducing, juvenile and adolescent
delinquency.
I have had some personal experience of
the problem of policing in the city of Vancouver, and in my opinion we would do well
to recognize the heavy burden that our present
system imposes upon provincial and municipal

NOVEMBER 28, 1945
governments. Every city in Canada today is
overwhelmingly burdened with taxes. I venture to say that not one among the larger
cities of Canada is satisfied, with the accommodation provided for its children and youth.
These recommendations should make every
responsible citizen realize 'that if the tomorrows are going to be better so far as the
problems of crime are concerned, they must
be made better by providing now for our
children and our youth. These recommendations come from three of Canada's most outstanding counsel, two of whom are now
eminent jurists. The prevention of crime is to
be found. in part at least, in the proper care
of our children in the cities.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: We had a tragedy
here in Ottawa the 'other day when one pf
the finest members of the city police force
was shot in cold blood by three youths who
grew up in the capital city of Canada. The
same sort of thing is happening elsewhere.
Let me ask you this. What accommodation
is there for a very large number of the youths
of this city? There is no accommodation
provided. The tragedy which I have mentioned is in part the result of such a condition.
I am very much disturbed about the tomorrows because, as a careful student of bistory, I cannot overlook what is being said
today and contrasting it with statements
made in the past. When men stand up and
say "We have to begin to curtail expenses,"
we all agree with that statement in relation
to some phase of activity; but when the
remark is made as a general proposition it
implies the conclusion that we are now so
overwhelmed by debt that we have nothing
for the expansion of reform or development
programmes. I say that under the present
distribution of revenues as between federal,
provincial and municipal governments the
cities cannot hope for a change in conditions.
The Archambault Commission recognize
one phase of that problem, because under
the heading "Centralized Control," at page
354 of the report they say:
1. The Canadian penal system should be centralized under the control of the Government of
Canada, with the federal authorities taking
charge of al1 the prisons in Canada, the provinces 'retaining only a sufficient number to provide for offenders against provincial statutes,
prisoners on remand, end those serving short
sentences.
2. An immediate conference between the federal and provincial authorities should be held
with a view to obtaining the full co-operation of
the provincial authorities in putting the recommendations of the Commission into effect.

329

The Dominion-Provincial Conference is
now sitting, but on inquiry I find that the
subject of juvenile delinquency and criminal
reform is not on its agenda.
Another recommendation has been made
which has to do with the establishment of
schools for the training of penitentiary officers
along the line of the courses at Wakefield,
These recommendations of the
England.
Commission appear at page 355:
An outstanding prison authority from England, preferably Mr. Alexander Paterson, M.C.,
one of His Majesty's Prison Commissionera of
England, should be invited to come te Canada
'to counsel and advise the Prison Commission on
the reorganization of the prison system in order
to give practical effect to the recommendations
contained in this report.
After careful study of the penitentiary staffe
by the Prison Commission, al hopelessly incapable officers should be retired.
The pay of officers should be brought up te a
reasonable standard, having regard to the type
of service performed.
A complete revision of the methods of classification of prisoners should be made, with provision for a thorough medical and psychiatrie
examination of prisoners.
All incorrigible and intractable prisonérs in
the penitentia.ries should be aegregated in one
institution.
. Separate institutions, based on the principles
of the English Borstal System, should be established to permit of special treatment being
given to young offenders between sixteen and
twenty-one years of age. There should also be
a classification centre and three grade& in each
unit, each grade to be separately .located and
not contiguous to another. Two units should be
established at once, one in the province of Ontario, and one in the province of Quebec, with
a further development of the scheme in the
Prairie Provinces, the Maritime Provinces,
,and, in a modified manner having regard to
the population, in British Columbia.
Then at page 358 of the report there is a
series of recommendatione under the heading
"Amendments to the Criminal Code". These
amendments have been recommended by the
Canadian Bar Association for many years. I
am not going to burden honourable senators
with details, but shall only say that these are
amendments which have been carried out to
a considerable degree in England. One 'of
the most effective, I believe, is the one extending the time for the payment of fines.
However, the most important phase of this
report is the proposal to centralize control
and to put the responsibility for maintenance
of law and order, the prevention of crime and
the care of criminals on the shoulders of the
nation, where it should be.
In my own city of Vancouver the police
station was built some thirty-five years ago.
It was cheaply constructed at the time and
was not properly designed. To-day it is altogether inadequate to serve the city, whieh in

330

SENATE

the meantime has had a large increase in
population. My sympathies go out to the
men on the police force there, because they
work under heavy handicaps. The report
shows that a similar condition exists in most
of our cities. In Vaucouver there is a unit of
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, a unit
of the Provincial Police, and several other
protective services of the different governments. I believe that one -practicable solution for many of our present difficulties would
be the establishment in Vancouver and in our
other large cities of a central police headquarters, where the civic, provincial, and federal police forces would be co-ordinated.
Working together, the three organizations
would be able to develop and keep in operation a more effective system than we have
today for enforcing law and maintaining
order, and at the same time the total cost of
this work would be greatly reduced. Here is
what the Archambault Commission said on
this matter. I am reading from page 342 of
the report:
Your Commissioners are well aware of the
difficulties to be overcome in such a consolidation, but they are also aware that many of these
difficulties existed in England before 1877 and
did not prevent consolidation. It is in the
power of the Parliament of Canada to amend
section 1056 of the Criminal Code, the Penitentiaries Act, and the Reformatories Act, te
change the minimum term for which a convicted
person may be sentenced to a penitentiary and
to prescribe the nature of treatment to be given
in federal institutions. Alternately, an agreement might be made between the Dominion and
the provinces for the former to take over the
administration of provincial penal institutions,
paying compensation therefor, in order that
persons committed to prison should be committed
to federal institutions for terms of less than
two years.
Your Commissioners are emphatically of the
opinion that without this centralized control
of penal institutions the best efforts in prison
administration will be gravely handicapped and,
in many cases, defeated. Until such consolidation is attained, your Commissioners hope
that different provincial governments will cooperate with the federal authorities in establishing a system in provincial penal institutions
that will follow as closely and uniformly as
possible the system adopted in the federal institutions as a result of the recomnendations
contained in this report.
If I am not tiring the House I should like
to make one reference to the results obtained
in Britain, as set forth in the Royal Commission's Report, page 341:
In Great Britain, there existed before 1877 a
wasteful chaos in the administration of the
prisons. By the Prison Act of that year the
ownership and control of all local prisons, with
all the powers and duties relative thereto,
were vested in the Secretary of State, the cost
of their maintenance was transferred to publie
exchequer, and general superintendence, subject
to the control of the Home Secretary, was
Hon. Mr. McGEER.

vested in a Board of Prison Commissioners.
The rule-making power of justices having
passed to the Secretary of State, a new code
of rules was issued in 1878 and, as from April 1
of that year, all the local prisons came for the
first time under one single code and one central
control. The report of the Gladstone Committee, which followed in 1898, was accepted by
the Home Secretary as a further basis of
development in prison administration, and the
Prison Act of the same year, which resulted
from this report, has remained the authoritative expression of parliamentary opinion on
the subject. With the unrepealed portions of
the Acts of 1865 and 1877 it forms substantially
the legal basis of the present regime. As a
result of these measures county jails were
abolished, twenty-nine prisons were closed, and
the consequent decrease in the number of inmates provided a great saving in the administration of the prisons. Moreover, it bas made
possible *a tremendous decrease in recidivism
because of the scientific treatment of prisoners
and the uniform policy of the administration.
In England and Wales, with a population of
approximately 41,000;000 people, there are now
twenty-five prisons to which prisoners of al]
classes are committeed direct by the courts,
and these are known as local prisons. Under
the Penal Servitude Act there are also four
prisons for men and one for women, one training centre, and one preventive detention prison.
There are also six Borstal institutions for boys
and one for girls.
In Canada, with a population of 11,000,000,
there are twenty-two adult reformatories, seven
penitentiaries, and 118 county jails.
During recent years public interest in penology has developed rapidly and, as stated
previously, it has been more generally .recognized
that prisons are not merely places of custody
and punishment but also places of reformation
and rehabilitation.
Ve were able to finance war expenditures
at the rate of five and a half billion dollars
a year. How mucli money are we able to
spend on the prevention of crime in our
country through improving living conditions
of children in our cities and through putting
into effect the reforms that this magnificent
report so ardently champions? No estimate
has been made of what it would cost to carry
out the recommendations made in the report,
but I should say the capital investment would
run anywhere from ten t o twenty-five million
dollars. In my humble opinion that investment would within a comparatively short
period of time bring about a great improvement in community life in Canada, and as a
conscquence there would be a reduction in
the amount of money required for the prevention of crime.
In Canada there are no Borstal institutions,
but we have several provincial institutions
that have donc splendid work in caring for
delinquent youths. I do not think we need
have any fear about the criminal proclivities
of Canadian youth or of our people in general. The magnificent record of Canada's
young people justifies our confidence.

NOVEMBER 28, 1945
The iiuplementation of the Royal Commission's report is one of the first steps proposed b>' the Ministar of Justice 'for the postwar period, arnd in this undertaking what he
deaires, more than anything else in the wholehearted support of the public and of the
members of both Houses of Parliament.
Honourable senators, I have much pleasure
in offering these explanations of the proposed
amendments.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I will not dea> the Hoiise long. My
honourable friand £rom Vancouver-Burrard
(Mr. McGeer) bas coverad the subject-Il will
sa>', at least fulIy. My criticism. of the ibill is
restricted to a proposad amendment 'which the
honourable gentleman avoided explaining. I
rafer to clause 2, whîch adids a new section
4A to the Act. The other provisions ini the
bill are ord-inar>' onas, but this section 4A is
the strangest section 1 have avar secn in a
statuýte. Its purposa is to authorize the
Governor in Council to appoint one or more
commissionars to investigate the report of the
Archambault Commission. That Commission
was the -third to make a report on penitentiaries in Canada, but not one of the reports
bas ever been acted upon. True, the war
broka out shortly after the passing of the 1939
statute, which 'Was introduced a year or so
after the filing of the Archambault report.
The other night I histaned with much intereet
to a debata in anothar 'place and heard an
honourabla member from the province, of
Quebec-from Stanstead, I believe-say that
ha had takan an active part in the work of
the first of thase Royal Commissions; and
another honourable gentleman-from, Muskoka-Ontario, if I am not mistakan-said bis
father was a mambar of that Commission.
As I say, this naw section 4A would
authorize the Governor in Council to appoint
ona or more commissioners to inivestigata the
Archam'bault report. Where will that procedure end? After these men have
en
appointed and made a report, will new commissionars ba appointed to invastigate that
report, and so on indefinitel>'?
I agree entirely with my honourable friend
from Vancouver-Burrard (Hon. Mr. McG'eer)
that there should be greater public support
of prison reform. But I am not so confident
as ha is that an>' prison reform wiil make
battar citizens of our young men and women.
My experience of 111e bas not heen ver>' long
or wide, but I have seen bad boys and bad
girls coma from ail kinds of homes. Boys andi
girls who always had lots of îoodi tc, eat,
plent>' of good clothee to&wear, an,& their own
cars to. drive, have ended. up in the peniten-

331

tiary alongside boys and girls who, came from
the poorest families, which could flot afford to
give them an>' of these so-called privileges.
What 1 want t~o impress on the House is
that the main purpose of this bill is to provide for the appointment of one or more
commissioners to investigate the Archamhault
Commission's report. We must have something better than that. The government of
the day bas got to put its back behind the
,report, whether its recommendations are to
carried out b>' this or some other goverfiment. In my own province of Manitoba I
know that man>' young con-viets acquire their
criminal proclivities from the older convicts.
These youths must be segregated from the
older inmates. Manitoba bas gone quite a
long way in the matter of policing. B>' agreement between the provincial and Dominion
governments we use the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police. The arrangement bas been
in effect for about fifteen years and bas
worked ver>' satisfactorily.
An Hon. SENATOR: There is a similar
arrangement ini Saskatchewan, Alberta, Ontario and New Brunswick.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I can speak only for my
own province. I cannot see why this eould
not be dloue in our cities. I happened to, be
in the legislature of Manitoba when the agreement was made, and man>' persons predicted
that such an arrangement would be ýal'most
unworkable, since one of the parties to it
would beeome diasatisfied; but those predictions have proved to be ill-founded, and the
agreement bas been helpful to both the province and the Dominion.
I am in hearty accord with the purpose of
the bill. It is at least a slight step in tbe
right direction, but not near>' so far-reaching
as my honourable friand (Hon. Mr. McGeer)
would lead soma of us to believe. I hope
honourable members will, through the Minister of Justice, impress on the Goverament
that we must either accept the recominendations of the Archambault Commission and try
to carry them out, or elsa satisf>' public
opinion that nothing can be done to impIement them. I cannot go as far as my honourable friend bas gone, but I will go -a long
way with him to sea that the Commission's
report is carried out. While I shail vote for
the bill, yet I wish it went much further than
it does. I wish it empowered the new commission to carry out the recommendationg
contained in the report of the Archambault
Commission; but ail the bill does is to authonize the new commission to investigata our
penal system.

MAPLE SUGAR INDUSTRY BILL
SECOND READING

Hon.

WISHART

McL.

ROBERTSON

moved the second reading of Bill F7, an Act
respecting the manufacturing, inspection and
sale of maple products.
He said: Honourable members, I have
asked the honourable senator from Kennebec
(Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt) ta explain this bill.
Hon. CYRILLE VAILLANCOURT: Honourable senators, the purpose of this bill is
to protect the maple sugar industry, one of
the oldest agricultural industries in Canada.
Above ail, it would prevent the adulteration
of our maple products. Many tourists come
to this country during the summer, and it
gives them great pleasure to be served maple
syrup or maple sugar. Unfortunately, in recent years hotels, restaurants or stores have
sold a product called maple syrup, although
it contained no maple sap whatever. This
adulteration can destroy our maple market.
Before the war other countries were buying
Canadian maple products because buyers
were sure to obtain a pure product which
they could use in flavouring liqueurs, candies,
ice cream, and sa on. At that time, we were
building up a fairly large market in the
United States, Great Britain, France and
elsewhere.
Now that the war is over we
must regain that market, and in order to
succeed we have to protect this industry.
The consumer must be protected also. When
buying maple sugar one must be sure that
he or she is getting maple syrup, not a syrup
made of cane sugar coloured with a small
quantity of vanilla extract, to which is added
35 per cent of water. The substitute, which
is not only adulterated but also contains no
maple sap, is sold under a false name and
usually at a fairly high price, and so the
purchaser is cheated.
This bill is a revision of the present Act,
and for the most part is for the purpose of
clarifying its provisions. There are, however,
three important changes:
1. Sections 3 and 5 are somewhat related.
Section 5 of the Act requires that the names
of all ingredients be shown on suitable labels
covering products resembling or imitating
maple products, but forbidding the use of
the word "maple" on other than a pure maple
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

product. This resulted in some curious trade
names for artificial flavours; for instance,
the well known Mapleine became Mapeline,
and Mapleoil became Maypolol. Both spellings were ruled to comply with the requirements of section 5. The amending sections
will provide for honest and properly descriptive trade names for artificial flavours and
lists of ingredients on labels covering colourable imitations of maple products.
2. Subsection 3 of section 8 of the Act provides for the detention only of substances
which it is believed are intended for the adulteration of maple products. It does not provide for the detention of products which it is
thought are adulterated or that have been
otherwise dealt with contrary ta the provisions
of the Act or regulations made thereunder.
Paragraph (c) of section 7 amends this and
gives the Department more scope in its administration, of the Act.
3. Outlining the duties of the inspectors,
subsection e of section 7 of the Act requires
that in taking samples for analysis the inspector divide each sample into two approximately equal parts, sealing both, leaving one
for the owner, operator or agent, as a check,
and forwarding the other to Ottawa for
analysis. Experience has shown that the check
samples are very seldom used at all, and where
samples are in small containers, as in the case
of maple butter, it is impracticable to divide
the sample, better to send forward the unbroken container. This is provided for in the
new section.
Minor changes include: (i) Change in the
title of the Act to Maple Products Industry
Act, a more inclusive term, since all maple
products are controlled under the Act; (ii)
Sections 5 and 6 are combined; (iii) Definitions
either under the same or similar names have
been transferred from the regulations to the
Act; (iv) The change in renewal date for
licences was thought ta be advisable since
some small operators are undecided in December whether they wilil operate during the
following season.
The extra three months
would give them more time ta decide;
(v) Voluntary registration of sugar orchards
is dropped, as no requests for registration
were received after the first year or two of
administration of the Act; (vi) Sectiohs 12
and 13 are combined. Other minor changes
are of a purely formal nature dealing with
phraseology and construction.
Now that honourable senators know the
principle of the Bill, I may be allowedi to
give an historical survey of the maple industry
in our country. It is one of the oldest agricultural industries in Canada. The first statistics for the whole of Canada date from

NOVEMBER 28, 1945
1851. The annual production was at that
time aro-undî 13,500,000 ibs. of maple syrup.
In 1944, the production was 40,000,000 ibs.
Four provinces produce maple syrup and
mapie sugar: Quebec, Ontario, New Brunswick
and Nova Scotia. The province of Que'bec
produces almost 82 per cent of the, total.
This industry is very profitable to the producer because for a large number of farmers
this is the "cash-p-rop" of the spring season.
Taking the Dominion Bureau of Statistics
figures, we estimate that in 1941, there, were
39,270 farms with mapie trees, and that
34,232,267 niaple trees were tapped. In the
province of Quehec, we find more than 25,000
producers of maple syrup; in Ontario, 12,000.
The number of maple trees tapped in the
province of Quebec is more than 21,000,000,
while in Ontario it is 2,500l,000.
The Indians, naturai-bora observers, must
have discovered the value of t.hc sap of the
maple eariy. According to a iegend re]ated
by Maud Going in "Our Field and Forest
Trees", maple sugar was first made by
Nokomis (the Earth), grandmother of Manabush, a popular hero of Indian tales and
legends, Nokomis bored holes in the maples
and placed a vessel under eaclh. Manabush,
finding that these vessels were filled with a
thick syrup, went tb his grandmother and
said: "Graudmother, it is not good that trees
should produce sugar in this way. If men can
gather sugar so easily, they will become lazy.
They must be made to work. Before obtaining the sugar they want, they must be compelied to chop wood and spend nights watching over the pots of boiling syrup." H1e said
no more, but, fearing that Nokomis had flot
heeded, and that she wouid do nothing to,
prevent men from becoming lazy, he climbed
to the top of a maple tree with a vesseiful of
water and poured the contents into the top of
the tree, thereby dissolving the sugar in the
mapie. Since that time no thick syrup has
run from the mapie, but instead the sap contains about 1 to 2 per cent of sugar; sugar
is now obtained oniy Vhrough work. This
legend at least shows that the Indians knew
something of sugar-making.
The primitive methods em.ployed by the
Indians in making mapie products were
quickly improved upon by the whites. Father
Lafiteau wrote: "The French made much better sugar than the Indians who lhad taught
them." Since the eariy days of colonization in
this country the maple sugar industry has
progressed in an amazing manner, particularly during the iast 50 years. The wooden
spout and the cork vessel have been replaced
hy convenient metal spouts and aiuminum
huckets.

In view of the aduiteration of maple
products resorted to by certain dealers, and
with the desire to protect both themseives
and the public, some Quebec maple sugar producers decided to form. a co-operative society.
Each member bas to sign a contract undertaking to make bis produet pure, and under the
most sanitary condition~s. This society had its
birtb twenty years ago, and in the interval the
quality of the mapie products bas been much
improved. Ail we can do to improve the
maple produets industry wiil help the home
farmers and encourage them, especially the
mapie sugar producers of Quebec to develop
their industry. Wc will easily double the sale
of mapie products on the domestic market and
instead of a revenue of $9,000,000 as in 1944, we
could realize $18,000,000.
From the point of view of health, mapie
sugar products are among the most natural,
bealtby and sanitary of our foods. Indeed we
may weli termi them Mother Nature's sweetest
products.
11on. Mr. ASELTINE: Honourabie senators, if this bill is as good as the sampies of
mapie sugar that weýre sent to us by the
bonourable senator who bas just spoken, I
m
arn ail for the bill.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
The motion was agreed to and the bill was
read the second, time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved that the
bill be referred to the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry.
The motion was agreed to.
DEPARTMENT 0F RECONSTRUCTION
AND SUPPLY BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill 173, an Act reýspecting the
Department of Reconstruction and Supply.
He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable senator from Thunder Bay
(Hon. Mr. Paterson) to explain this bill.
Hon. N. MeL. PATERSON: Ho'nourahie
senators, Bill 173 is an Act respecting the
Department of Reconstruction and Supply.
The purpose of the bill is Vo create a njew
department undéer the nanfe mentioned, to
which will be transferred the functions of the
Department of Reconstruction and the Department of Munitions and Supply.
During the war the number of people engaged in war industry was 1,055,000, and there
were 784,000 in the armed services, making a
total of 1,839,000 whose duties were directly

connected with the war and would cease with
it. Those 1,800,000 persons hadt been drawn
from the natural increase of the population,
from married and other women not previously
enployed, and from agriculture and other
civilian industry.
It was estimated that
600,000 would return to their former employment, that 300,000 would be absorbed by
retirements and home occupation, and that
the stored-up demand for civilian goods
would provide employment for the remainder.
As the Government do not wish to go into
industry to provide the necessary work-they
believe it to be unwise-they wish this new
department to encourage and facilitate the
expansion of private industry for the absorption of workers by the following means:
through . international
(1) Contributing
arrangements to the relief and rehabilitation
of devastated countries.
(2) The maintenance and resumption of
exports to our historic markets, and, as supplies and shipping permit, to the development
of new markets.
(3) The reconversion, mod:ernization and
expansion of industria-l capacity released from

the war effort.
(4) The replacement and modernization of
agricultural equipment and facilities for production and marketing.
(5) Providing for as large a housing programme as labour and materials will permit.
(6) Providing consumer goods to satisfy
the deferred civilian demand.
The termination of war contracts will not
affect all communities equally, and dislocations in the transition from war to peace canot be avoided. Remunerative employment
and income are provided for by the spending
of money, and can be classified according to
the cliannels through which the money flows,
such as:
(a) Export trade for which the decision to
spend is made outside the country.
(b) Private investment for plant, equipment and goods in stock, which is governed
largely by prospective earnings.
(c) Consumption of goods, the volume of
which is governed largely by income.
(d) Public investment in works for the
productiveness of resources., and for the betterment of the people.
The Government proposes to use appropriate means to Influence expenditures in all
these channels, particularly those offering
the greatest opportunities, encouragement and
control.
The present strength of the :Munitions and
Supply Department is about 2,500 and of the
Reconstruction Department about 300. By
January 1, 1946, the strength of the combined
Hon. Mr. PATERSON.

Departments rwill be about 2,500, having been
reduced by 300. By April 1 the combined
staffs will equal approximately 2,000. During
the war the maximum number of employees in
the Munitions and Supply Department was

4,500.
For matters of reference, the original Munitions and Supply Act is to be found in R.S.C.
1939 (Second Session) 'Chapter 3, and amendments to this Act ,passed on the 7th of August,
1940, are to be found in R.S.C. 1940, Chapter

31.
Hon.-S. A. HAYDEN: Honourable senators,
there are one or two observations I wish to
make as to the principle of the bill.
In some respects the bill, which is entitled
"an Act respecting the Department of Reconstruction and Supply," is a most unusual
one. The first few sections of the bill make
provision for the establishment of the department named, for a minister who will preside
over it, and for the transfer to it of employees,
preserving to them their rights as civil servants, and so forth. Then there are several
omnibus sections, which confer upon the
Minister of the new department powers, rights,
liabilities, and so on, already provided for
under the Department of Reconstruction Act
passed last year, and , the Department of
Munitions and Supply Act which originated
in 1939 and was amended in 1940, 1943 and
1944. The bill then goes on and becomes what
I call "a consolidated law amendment bill",
and provides for amendments to the Department of Munitions and Supply Act.
In trying to arrive at the poxwers and funetiens of the new department one gets little
information from this bill, and must read the
Department of Reconstruction Act of last year
and the Munitions and Supply Act of some
years ago in order to learn what these powers
and functions really are. That is one phase
which I thinkis objectionable, and as to whicb
there might be some improvement. Surely
when a department of government is being
set up it is possible to incorporate in the
statute setting it up the duties, powers and
functions of that department.
Then a greater source of difficulty so far
as I am concerned arises in connection with
the amendments to the Munitions and Supply
Act which are contained in this bill. I find,
for instance, that under the Department of
Munitions and Supply Act provision was made
for the re-negotiation of contracts by the
Minister-that is munitions contracts. Honourable senators will recall that those provisions were discussed in committee some
years ago, and that notwithstanding the
fact that munition contracts provided for a
fixed price, the Minister might afterwards

NOVEMBER 28, 1945
determine that the price was too high, or that
unreasonable profits resulted from the working
out of the contrant, and he could then direct
some reduction in the price.
I find that the amendments made by this
bill to the Munitiaus and Supply Act change
the original definition of "munitions contract"
as it appears in the Act; and we now deal
with "supply contracts" instead of "munition
contracts". Those "supply contracts" are said
to extend to and include contracts entered
into under the Department of Reconstruction
Act. They are therefore contracts for supplies
that may be entered into by the Department of Reconstruction and Supply during the period of reconstruction following the
war, and in relation to which, as well as in
relation to contracts that originally came
under the Munitions and Supply Act, the Minister is given that same power of re-negotiation and determination as to what is a fair
and reasonable price.
It may well be, as a matter of principle,
that in committee or in the Senate itself,- we
will decide that while it was reasonable to
abrogate the ordinary incidences attached to
a contract between two contracting parties
during the period of the war, in the period
of reconstruction the Department should be
so familiar with supplies, contracts, prices and
costs, that when they fix a contract price they
will not afterwards require power to nullify
the effect of the contract and to allow the
Minister to determine what in his opinion is
fair and reasonable.
It is true that the provision of the Munitions and Supply Act for an appeal to the
Exchequer Court from the Minister's direction still remains effective under this bill.
But that may give rise to some serious legal
difficulty at a future date. The determination
by the Minister of what is a fair and reasonable price is an exercise of discretion; and
while there is a right to appeal his direction
or order to the Exchequer Court, recent decisions on the effect of the exercise af
such a discretion might open the door to
serious question if some day a party to such
a contract saw fit to go into the Exchequer
Court. He might be confronted with a situation such as this: that while he was appealing
a direction or order of the Minister, he would
be unable to present for the consideration of
the Court that part of the contract relating
to the exercise of discretion by the Minister.
We further find that the bill provides for
investigators, and confers on such of them as
may be appointed by the Minister to investigate any circumstances in relation to
47704-23

335

any business of the Department, particularly
as to supply contracts, powers specifically set
out under the Munitions and Supply Act.
There are so many unusual features in this
bill-unusual in the sense that we do not find
any codification or an explicit definition of
the powers, functions, and responsibilities of
the Department-that we must go into other
Acts, which are not being repealed in their
entirety at this time.
There is bound to be confusion in any attempt to assess the full scope of the authority being conferred; and when you have a
proposed continuance of the extraordinary
power to abrogate contracts carried into the
new Department, for the period of reconstruction at least, this measure becomes, from
the viewpoint of the rights of the public, one
of the most important measures that we have
ever had before us. It is my opinion that the
attention of the Senate should be called specifically to these provisions so that honourable
senators will realize what an important duty
they have to perform as and when the bill is
considered in committee.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. G. P. CAMPBELL: Honourable
senators, I do not propose to take much of
the time of the House discussing this bill. I
agree that the bill is of such importance that
it should be referred to committee, where
honourable members will have an opportunity
of expressing their views on certain sections.
The part of the bill that offends me most
is the proposed new subsection (5) of section
13 of the Act, and I hope honourable members will give some attention to this before
the bill goes into committee. The subsection reads:
Notwithstanding anything in this section contained, the gross income from any business other
than the performance of supply contracts carried
on by any person during any period designated
by the Minister for the purposes of subsection
four of this section,
This is the important partshall not, unless the Minister in his discretion
otherwise specifically determines, be deemed to
be greater than the gross income from the
business carried on by the said person during
the last period of like duration included in the
standard period of such person as defined in
or designated under The Excess Profits Tax
Act, 1940.
I should not expect any honourable member
to be able to interpret that subsection on the
first reading of it.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: I was going to
ask what it meant.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I took occasion
to ask an honourable member of the other
House, who is a prominent lawyer, if he

Ï1,R
~SENATE
would interpret the subsection for me. After
reading it three times he told me that he
could not say what it meant. I will now try
to state what I take it to mean. Assume that
in the standard period a companiy was engaged in the manufacture of ceytain products
used exclusively as civilian goods-farm implements, for instance-and that in 1939 its
profit on those goods was $100,000.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: 1936 to 1939.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: This subsection
refers to any fiscal period. Let us say that
in the last year of the standard period the
company made $100,000 profit on the manufacture of civilian goods. Then assume that
in 1944 it made $200.000 profit on civilian
goods and $100.000 on war goods supplied
under a contract. Unless the Minister otherwise directed-and, with all due respect, I
doubt that he would do so-the $100,000
profit made on the manufacture of civilian
goods in 1944 would be lifted over to the
profit made on the war supplies contract.
That is, profits on civilian goods manufactured for and, sold to the public would be
treated the same as profits on goods'made
for war purposes. If that is so, and if this
subsection is passed in its present form, there
wili be established a statutory finding in place
of a factual finding. According to the practice today, parties engaged in the manufacture of both war goods and civilian goods
present their accounts showing the profit
made on each class of goods. Surely it is
possible to determine by proper accounting
methods what profit is made with respect
to any particular contract.
What I say is
that this subsection seeks to make a statutory
finding to the effect that the taxpayer or
person who earned that profit is deemed to
have earned a profit equal only to that made
during the standard period, irrespective of
what he did in fact make during a period of
1944.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN:
limitation.

It

is a statutory

Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: It is a confiscation
of the company's profits on civilian goods,
which profits the company has made by finding its own markets, without any help whatever from the Government.
I submit that such legislation should not be
passed without the most serions consideration
of honourable members of this House. When
the bill goes to committee, people who are
interested in it will no 'doubt be able to
submit a number of illustrations to show how
it would work. I will not delay the House
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL.

longer. I simply. say that in committee the
bill should be most carefully considered in
the light of facts then available.
Hon. J. J. BENCH: Honourable senators,
I find myself very much in agreement with
what has been said by the two honourable
gentlemen from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden
and Hon. Mr. Campbell), but the section of
the bill which is more repugnant than any
other to my sense of what is proper is section
12, which is designed to amend section 22 of
the Department of Munitions and Supply Act.
This section received only passing notice from
the first of the two honourable gentlemen
from Toronto who spoke on it (Hon. Mr.
Hayden). May I just read the section and
then comment on it briefly? I trust that the
whole background of this type of governmental
procedure will be probed very carefully when
the bill goes to committee; and I certainly
hope to be present at that time, for there
are a lot of questions that I want to ask about
it. Section 12 reads:
Subsection one of section twenty-two of The
Department of Munitions and Supply Act, as
enacted by section eleven of chapter eight of the
statutes of 1943-44, is repealed and the following substituted therefor:
22. (1) The Minister may, whenever he deems
it expedient, cause an inquiry to be made into
and concerning any matter relating to or incidental to or arising out of any supply contract
as defined in section thirteen of this Act or any
group or series of such supply contracts or any
dealings in or with munitions of war or suppliesMay I just say, in parenthesis, that if honourable members will examine the definition
of "supplies" they will find it includes almost
everything but the kitchen sink-and I am
not sure that it does not include that. The
subsection goes on:
-and may appoint a person or persons by
whom the linquiry shall be cond.ucted.
(2) Subsection three of section twenty-two of
The Department of Munitions and Supply Act,
as enacted by section eleven of chapter eight of
the statutes of 1943-44, is repealed and the following substituted therefor:
(3) An investigator shall have all the
powersNot responsibilities, but powers.
-conferred
on- commissioners by sections four
and five of the Inquires ActThose sections of the Inquiries Act, may I
say, empower a commissioner to send for witnesses, to require their attendance, to put
them on oath and so onor which may be conferred on ceommissioners
under section eleven thereof and may in writing
authorize any Royal Canadian Mounted Police
officer or constable, or any police officer or constable or other person employed for the preservation and maintenance of the public peace, to-

writing, to enter and searcli, if necessary, by
forceHoný. Mr. LEGER: At the point of a gun.
Hon. Mr. BENCH (reading):
-any building, receptacle or place, for books,
records, documents or things which may contain or give, information required for the
purposes of the inquiry,,and to seize any books,
records, documents or things and carry them
before the investigator or sucli othar person
as the investigator may direct, to, ha held at the
discretion of the ýinvestigator for the purposes
of the inquiry.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: They can look into
your hollow tooth, if they want to.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: That is noýt ail they
may do, I can assure the honourabie senator.
I draw the attention of the House to the
explanatory notes on the page opposite to
section 12 in the bill:
Section 12 is designed to replace subsections
(1) and (3) of section 22 of The Department of
Munitions and ýSupply Act, which read as
f ollowsI wili not raad subsection (1) but will go on
to subsection (3):
An investigator shahl have ail the powers of
a commissioner under Part I of the Inquiries
Act.
That is how subsection (3) now reads. The
axpianatory note goes on to say:
'he proposed new subsections are întended
(a) to clarify the scope of the section.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: There is no doubt
ab-out that.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Honourable senators, I
can understand what is meant by "the powers
of a commissioner under Part I of the Inquiries Act."
My submissio-n isthat that
wording requires no clarification whatever.
The note goes on to say that the proposed
new subsactions are intended:
(b) to cover situations where it miglit not
be apparent at 'the outset of an investigation
what specifie supply contracte were invoived.
That is cleaxiy an open admission that this
section is to ha used for the purposes of a
departmentai fishing expedition. It seemas to
me that Parliament wouid ha going a vary
long way if it clothed any minister-I waa
about to say if it clothed. any government,
but Parliament would he going farther if it
clothad any minister-with these powers.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: It is an investigator
who is given these powers, not the Minister.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: The proposai is that
the Minister shall ho authorized to pass on
to an invastigator powers to engage in a. fishing expedition by searching the books and

if there is any evîdenca of impropriety in
dealing with contracts for supplies.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: And force 'may be used,
if necessary.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: And, as tha honourable
gentleman, points out, force may be used if
necassary. Moreover, in addition to. using
force, the investigators mny searcli records
in any place, inciuding the office of the contractor's solicitor, tberaby violating a privilaga
that fromn time immamorial bas bean regarded
by the iaw of this country as inviolate.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: And ha may ratain
the records indefinitaly.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Having got the records,
the investigator may ratain tbtem incbefiuitely.
In a ruattar of this kind one hesitatas to refer
to personal experiencas, particulariy when
tbey are of a profassional character, but I
want to mention a racent personai expariance.
where the action of a public officiai raached,
in my judgmant, an all-timae bigh in Star
Chamber methods.
In April a company's
books-flot on1e, but several-were seized and
an investigation was made by a gentleman
who was descrihad, and I bave no doubt
correctly, as 'being an inspector for the Foreign
Exchange Control Board.
That iniquiry to
ail intents and purposes was terminated some
time in July. Then under another enactmnent
by the Governor in Council anotber inspecter
saszad the records ail over again. Some of
them bad flot aven been returned, to the company by the Foreign Exchange Control officar,
aud the new investigator took tbemn over from
bimn. So the ground was diskad and harrowed
again, and so far as I know it is still being
diskad and barrowed.
In the meantime a
large portion of the records of these companias and individuals remain in the possession of the agents of the Govermaent.
While thera may ha reason for the Government to carry on tha investigation to which
I refer, it dues seam to me that the subjeet should bava soma rigbts in matters
of tbis kind, and that ha should not be denied
accass to bis ordinary business records for
aight, nîne or tan months at the whim of
some gentleman who lias receivad a latter
over the signature of the Mintistar of Reconstruction.
I was daing with the expianatory note to
subsection 3 of section 2. It is paragraph (c)
and raads:

and net se legitimate, te invest in gohd mining ventures. Too many gullible persons of
the get-rich-quick mind are taken advantage
of. I arn even informed that certain more
or less scrupulous brokers have classified lists
of prospective bitýers, te whom, with the candid
co-operation of our teiegraph and telephone
cempanies, they send periodical messages,
ahways calling for more and more money,
with the promise of early and most substantial returns. Much bas been said, although
net in the course of this debate, about such
sharks, who are more interested-for their
ewn benefit-in digging silver out of the
pookets of well-meaning but altogether misinfermed investors than in actually digging gold
from the ground for the benefit of the
country.
I even know of instances where newspaper
obituaries are carefully scrutinized by invcstment pedlars at se much per cent, in order
te take advantage of whatevcr insurance
money is left to bereaved wives and methers.
It is against that type of money-mad agents
that I raise my veice to-day, and I submit
that the law should make such greedy exploitation more and more difficuit, if net altegether
impossible.
Hen. Mr. McGEER: bear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: It should always be
honestly emphasizcd by ail concerned that
mining investments are a form. of gamhling
and. moralhy speaking, pcrmitted only te those
who can afford it. Well do I recaîl the
cries of horrified indignation which greeted the
suggestion in this very House a few years
ge., that sweepstakes be made legal in
Canada. True, a distinction must be drawn
as between investing in gold mines and betting
on herse races. But whe will deny that, in
I repeat, none
both cases, it is gambling?
but thoEe who can afford to should. risk their
hard-earned money in such speculative ventures. I for one have always belîeved in the
principle cf earning an honest living by the
sweat of my brow and by putting in an
honest day's work. The artificial and fastvanishing fortunes but on boot-legging in
Ontarie and elsewhere a few years back , in
the days of the O.T.A., convinced me that I
was net altogether wrong.
My conclusion therefore is that while gold
production should indeed be encouragcd. nt
the saine time the publie sheuld be protected
as much as possible from unscrupulous
expleiters.

WAR CHAIRITIES BILL
ÇONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE-PROGRESS
REPORTED

On motion of Hon. Mr. ROBERTS-ON, the
Senate went into Committec on Bill 13, an
Act to amend tihe War Charities Act, 1939.
Hon. Mr. Sinclair in the Chair.
On section 1-"ýWar Charity Fund":
Hon. ANTOIiNE J. LEGER: Honourable
senators, as I requesteýd yesterday that this
bill be referred to the Committee of the
Whole. perhaps I may b.e permitted te say
a few words in connection with it. I made the
motionbecause of certain discussion whioh had
taken place in a committee of this bouse, and
which I arn not privilcged, to disclose, and in
order te give honourable members of thle
Senate a chance te discuss the merits of the
bill.
.My objections to this bill are: First, in my
humble opinion it is just another control
phaced upon the endeaveurs of well-meaning
and well-intentioned citizens towards the coommemoration of glorlous deeds by the erection
of monuments; second, I contend that bhis
bill is neither necessary nor desirable; thýird,
when it is argued that this bill is to prevent
fraud, I contend-and it is so-that- the subjeot is weIl covercd under the Criminal Code;
fourth, if its purpose is to have contributions
counted as charity, that matter can easily bc

SENATE
taken care of by the Income Tax Act without
this kind of regimentation; fifth, I claim that
the bill is an infringement to section 92, subsection 13, of the British North America Act,
inasmuch as it deals with property and civil
rights within the provinces. This last is my
main objection. I have no d'oubt at all, and
I could cite authority for my opinion, that
this bill is absolutely ultra vires of this
Parliament and infringes upon the rights of
the provincial legislatures.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, as I understand it, the amendment before us purports to extend the authority of
the War Charities Act to any public fund
baving for its object the erection of a war
memorial. I am net in a position to argue
the question whether the War Charities Act
as a whole is ultra vires of the Parliament of
Canada.
It seens to me te be debatable
whether campaigns for war charity funds
should be regulated by Parliament or by the
provincial legislatures. On that point I have
an onen mind. But the fact is that since
1939 a large number of caimpaigns have bren
regulated under the War Charities Act. If
in due course it is deemed desirable to discontinue operation of Il Act for the rqson
suggested by the honourable scenator from
L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Leger), well and good;
but I suggest tLat in tbe meantime it would
be unfortunate if people contributing towards
the erection of war inemorials were net given
the saie protection as iose who have contributed to other war charity funds.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Honourable senator,
mai I for a moment develop the question as
I see it? The War Charities Act of 1939, like
the War Measures Act, was passed at a time
when we were in a state of emergency due to
the war. Persons conducting campaigns for
public subscriptions to war charities were
require d to register under the War Charities
Act. Non-registration was made an offence,
and there are penalty sections whereby those
sponsoring, promoting or making such solicitation without registration may be summarily
prosecuted and fined.
As I understand the question, it is not
whether the original Act was constitutional
when it was passed, but rather the narrower
one of whether at this time-now that we
have emerged from the war period-Parliament would be within its constitutional powers
in enacting such a measure. That seems to
me to be the important question, and I submit we should not just idly and without due
consideration pass amendments to a statute
which we might feel was not now constitutional.
Hon. Mr. LEGER.

This does not mean that people who want
to go out and solicit funds for war memorials
cannot do se. Nor does it mean that we cannot pass this amending bill. But it does seem
te me that if we made the registration under
the War Charities Act voluntary instead of
compulsory, and did away with the penal
sections, we would accomplish everything
desired by this bill and by those who may be
soliciting funds, because their main purpose
is to get moncy as quickly and in as substantial amounts as possible. The one inducement
they Lave to offer, if you are contributing to
a cause registered under the War Charities
Act, is that you may make a deduction from
your taxable income within the limnits of the
10 per cent which the Income Tax Department will recognize as a deduction by individuals for charitable purpo-s.
Of necessity
theose who intend to appeal for funds would
voluntarily register their scheime or plan in
oider to stimulate the necessary interest and
to assure a speedv flow of subscriptions. But
I Io suggest tbat it is open to serious question whether at this time the Act in its prne'sent form, wihi the compulsory regi.straion
and pena! provisions, is con-tituttionally within
the authoity of the Pailiament of Canada to
ena t.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Mr. Chairman, I have
a great deal of respect for the Lonourable
gentlemen who Lave just. spoken. But there
is a little more than the income tax feature in
this question. If there is fraud in the collection of money for a charity fund-and a war
memorial would be so designated-you could
of course take proceedings under the Criminal
Code. I speak with some personal experience,
for in our city before this Act was in operation we had difficulties about thîis very thing.
But another development las taken place in
our city and, I believe, in other cities. Formerly yo could have a tag day whenever you
wished; now, under provincial legislation you
cannot Liold a tag day in Winnipeg unless yeu
get the consent of the city council.
An Hon. SENATOR: Yeu do not need
that for a war charity fund.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I know yen do not. But
you do have this feature, that without compulsory registration, as my honourable friend
from Toronto Las just said, frauds can go on
just as gaily as ever. You Lad better have
either no registration at all or complete registration, one or the other; otherwise it would
be difficult to tell whether a charitable plan
was registered or not.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Would not the Criminal Code take care of that?

NOVEMBER 29, 1945
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It failed in Winnipeg.
We could flot make it stick.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Was it through iack
of evidence?
Hon. Mr. HAIG:- It is very bard to furnish
proof of fraud. The promoters who open a
subscription for what is ostensibly a war
charity may say, "We spend 75 per cent of
the subscriptions on our campaign." The Act
allows onliy 25 per cent.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Supposing the cornpulsory feature remains and the plan or
scherne is registered, how mucli stronger
position would you be in to prosecute under
the ýCriminal Code for fraud in the handling
of the meneys collected? I do flot think you
would be in any stronger position. But there
is a provision in the present statute that you
can prosecute-unless, of course, the court
shoýuld hold that the Act was ultra vires.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Would it be casier to
presecute under the Act than under the Criminai Code?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I think it wouild be mucb
casier.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: The prosecution would
net be for failure to register, because the plan
would be registered.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, the presedution would
be based on the way in wbich the funds were
handled. You agree to spend not -more than
25 per cent on the carnpaign. We were told
the other day that there have neyer been any
prosecutiens under the Act. The resistance
in this House to this provision -is made on
the basis that the wbole country is desperately
against regirnentation. You wilI find- that to
bc the feeling ail ovni, Canada. I entirely
agree with that resistance.
Hlon. Mr,. FARRIS: Have yeu eonsidcred
the constitutional aspect?
Hon. Mr,. HAIG: We did the other day
in comrnittee. 1 quite agree with rny bonourable friend froma L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Leger)
that il yeu prosecute the constitutional question docs arise. But, flrst, yeu have the
fact that the promoters have to subseit the
plan for approval by the board. Then,
secondly, there is the provision that the
income tax release will apply if the plan is
registered. If I make a contribution, and ask
for a receipt, anticipating that there will be
an income tax release, I may find at the end
of the year that I do not get my rilease
because the scheme was not registered. Then
I arn up against it; I arn allowed no deduetion
from rny income tax. There is no way you

341

can get an income tax release unless the
plan is registered in advance. I arn serry to
take this position, but I mnust Say quite
candidly that an appeal for a subscription
to a war charity is sornething entirely different
fromn a gêeral business transaction. When
you ask people for contributions for charitable purposes there is always a hearty respense.
Unleas there is some protection to the public
I arn afraid frauda will be cornmitted, and
there will be grcat difficulty in securing convictions. I think we ought to pass this bill.
If the House feels thc whole bill should be
rcjccted, wcll and good; then we will discuss
it on another ground. But if we are going to
retain the bill as to certain thîngs, then I
think we should proceed.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: How does rny
bonourable friend intcrpret the words in paragrapli (c) "designated by regulation as a war
memorial"?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: We have struck that out.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: We struck out everytbing after the words "war mernorial."
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Assurning a municipality decides to creet a library as a war
memorial, and desires to register it under
the provisions of this bill so as to be able to
collect funds, arn I correct in my interpretation
of the section thàt if thc department in charge
of the administration of the *Act refused to
designate the library as a war mernorial,
then the rnunicipality would be unable to se
register it under the Act?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The f'irst arnendrnent
suggested in cemmittee was to strike eut aIl
wercis after "war". Then the question wbicb
you have just raiscd was brought up, and
we put the rernainder of the clause in se that
types of mernerials, such as libraries, recreatien centres and bospitals would be designated.
If it was intended te go bcyond that it would
be neccssary te apply for permission.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Is it net true the
projects woul have te be designated by the
department in charge of the administration of
this bill?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No. There woulcb be a
general designation.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: No. It bas te be a
particular designation.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That would be se if you
wanted- a particular designation, but there
would be a general classificaition.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: No. Any general
regulatien is taken eut of the bill.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: The intention was that
the board should give a list of what could
be regarded as war memorials. Special permission would be necessary to go outside that
list. That is the intention of the amendment.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: The point I arn
making is that any municipality would be
entirely dependent upon a de.partment of the
Government, or the Government itself, to
designate a certain class of building or park
as a war memorial. It seems to me that
municipalities have a certain amount of understanding as to the requirements within their
borders. A municipality might wish to erect
a skating rink, and if it was obligead to comply
with all the provisions with respect to registration, control over collections, and so forth,
it would not be in a position to exercise its
own judgment as to the type of memorial
to be erected.
Under the provisions as they now stand, a
municipality could not possibly collect the
funds or register under the Act unless it cornplied with the wishes of the department and
the regulations designating the type of building
or park as a war memorial.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: My memory is that the
committee diesignated what buildings and
other things were to be considered as war
memorials. If you complied with those designations you would be iwithin the Act; if you
went outside of them you would have to
secure special permission. The further provision "or as designated by regulation," was
cut out at the request of the honourable
member from Ottawa.

amendments before me. Have they been

Hon. Mr. CRERAR: As a layman, there is
one point that interests me. I think it can
be assumed from the expressions of opinion
by some honourable members who belong to
the legal profession, that in normal times the
enactment of this legislation would be beyond
the competence of Parliament.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Will the honourable
member allow me? There would be one exception. To a very large extent the purpose
Hon. Mr. TIAYDEN.

of this legislation is associated with the payment of income tax. All will agree that that
is correct. If one contributes toward certain
charities then a deduction, on income is
allowed.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: It appears to me in
respect to that point that this legislation goes
a little farther. If a community desires to
mark its appreciation of the services of men
from that community who enlisted and served
in the war, and it proceeds to open a subscription list and collects funds to build a
memorial of some kind, it is breaking the law
and is liable to a penalty if it does not first
get permission from Ottawa.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: That is right.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I think that is correct. That is not a question of income tax
at all. The matter of whether or not the
Income Tax Department would allow the
deduction of subscriptions for the construction of a war memorial is another matter. If
it is desired to provide for such deductions,
i' could be donc by a very simple amendment to the Income War Tax Act. If I
make a subscription te a church, hospital or
any charitable organization the law permits
me to claim certain deductions or allowances
when I make my income tax return.
May I come back to my original point. If
this type of legislation is beyond the cornpetence of Parliament in normal times, as I
believe it is, since property and civil rights
are matters of provincial jurisdiction, under
what authority does this legislatiei seek to
operate?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I would say none.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: It may be said that
we have passed the time of war emergency
legislation, except for such measures as may
be necessary to the maintenance of stability in
the price level. The peace, order and good
government of Canada are not threatened, as
J see it, by anything these amendments seek
to guard against. For that reason I should
like some of my honourable friends of the legal
profession to explain at just what point we pass
into the normal state, when such powers as
these cannot emanate from this Parliament.
That is a very pertinent point, because there
may be looming up here an issue involving
the whole field of federal and provincial
jurisdiction.
I am speaking as a layman, perhaps out of
an abundance of ignorance; but I do not like,
for the mere sake of centralizing power in
Ottawa or with the federal Government, to

343

NOVEMBER 29, 1945
see steps taken that may threaten the constitutional relationship between the provinces
and the federal Government.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable senators,
the honourable member who has just spoken
has raised a legal question. I should like to
raise -a similar question, because I am not
certain of my ground. The discussion so far
indicates that the main purpose of this law
is to provide for deductions from income tax.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: No. May I answer
that question now? As a matter of fact,
the right to make such deductions is contained
in the Income War Tax Act, not in this bill.
The bill requires the registration of plans
and so forth.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes; but is it not so,
that in order that the Income Tax department
may make the deductions, it is first necessary
to provide measures to control charities? I
understand that deductions are allowed on all
charities that are created under this Act. Is
that true?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, that is correct.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Assuming that to be
correct, the simplest way to deal with the
matter would be to embody the principle of
this bill in the Income Tax Act itself. Surely
the Government would have constitutional
authority to do that without infringing on
provincial rights. There is no question of the
right of Parliament to pass the Income War
Tax Act with all its provisions. If it is
desired to make provision in that law for the
deduction- of any part of income, surely
Parliament bas the necessary power. If those
deductions must be controlled in a certain
way, surely there is a right to provide for
that in the Incorne War Tax Act? That is
the point I should like to have answered.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: As I understand it, and
according to my own experience, the Income
Tax department has an al-most absoilute right
to include any charitable fund in the class
entitling the taxpayer to exemption from tax
on subscriptions up to ten per cent of his
income. There was a certain matter in which
I was interested, and the department, after a
little study, ruled that donations would be
exempt from tax. A similar ruling could be
made here. But, as was pointed out by the
honourable leader opposite (Hon. .Mr. Haig),
there are other questions to be considered,
such as fraud and various other criminal
offences. There are two distinct sides to this
proposed amendment.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is correct.
4704-24

Hon. Mr. CALDER: But surely fraud is
covered by the Criminal Code.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: As to the point raised
by the honourable senator from Saltcoats
(Hon. Mr. Calder), there is no doubt that
the object of the Income Tax department
would be fulfilled by a ruling that tax exemption would be allowed only if the fund was
registered. But this bill, as I understandi it,
goes further than that, and says that if you
do not register your fund you cannot collect
subscriptions. That is entirely outside the
object and purpose of a taxing statute.
There are features of the bill that I find
somewhat perplexing. I was unavoidably
absent from the committee meeting, and offhand I cannot understand why words designating a class were struck out, for it seems to me
it would have been desirable to have them in.
Now that the constitutional question bas been
raised, I think the Senate should not be
asked to vote without further consideration.
I therefore move that the committee rise and
report progress and ask leave to sit again.
Section 1 stands.
Progress was reported.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall the
committee have leave to sit again?

AERONAUTICS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. WISHART
McL. ROBERTSON
moved the second reading of Bill 19, an Act
to amend the Aeronautics Act.
He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Campbell) to explain this bill.
Hon. G. P. CAMPBELL:
Honourable
senators, briefly stated, this bill is designed
to clarify and extend the powers of the civil
aeronautics board known as the Air Transport
Board.
The original Aeronautics Act, the
framework of the law relating to aviation
in this country, was passed in 1927, but the
board was not constituted until 1944, when
Part Il of the Act was passed. The 1944
legislation, which was discussed here at some
length, vested in the board power to conduct
hearings, grant licences, and generally to set
up an organization to keep abreast of aeronautical developments throughout the world,
and to advise the minister in charge of the
department. Formerly applications for licences
to fly planes on specified air routes had to be
made to the Board of Transport Commissioners. That body is given by the Railway
Act much broader powers than the Air Transport Board possesses.
The Air Transport Board has not yet been
functioning for a full year. It has set about
the establishment of an organization
comprisng a research department, an aeronautical
engineering department, and an economic developments department for surveying
rates,
tariffs and general economic conditions affecting air transportation. The board has also
kept itself informed on air traffic in other
countries. In setting up its organization the
board bas avoided duplication by utilizing the
regional and field services of the Department
of Transport, which is responsible for safety
regulations and technical standards.
The trend of the legislation is to create
within the department an organization to deal
exclusively with transportation by air. As
-on. Mr. ASELTINE.

honourable members are aware, under the
Railway Act and the Transport Act the department exercises similar jurisdiction over
transportation by land and water
The bill itself is short and simple, and I
will run over the various sections in order to
give honourable senators an indication of
what is proposed. The amendments for the
most part concern part II of the Act which
was passed last session.
Section 3 vests further powers in the board.
For instance, it gives the board jurisdiction
over all commercial air operations, whereas
formerly its authority extended only to commercial services engaged in the transport of
goods and passengers. Honourable members
no doubt have seen aeroplanes trailing advertising signs over public gatherings. These
will come under the amendment, which is
designed to cover all air operations for hire
or reward.
Section 4 empowers the board to relax the
regulations. Cases have arisen in which the
board found it would be contrary to the
publie interest or would work unnecessary
hardship on certain classes of air carriers,
such as chartered planes, to insist on full
compliance with the regulations. The amendment will provide flexibility similar to that
prevailing in the legislation of other countries.
Section 5 deals with penalties. The maximum is increased from $1,000 to $5,000. When
presenting the bill in another place the
Minister explained that a fine of $1,000 would
be altogether inadequate, because the board
would be dealing chiefly with substantial
corporations. The court's power to cancel
licences has been deleted from this section.
It was felt that the board is better qualified
to decide questions of cancellation.
Section 6 provides for control over free
and reduced-rate transportation. There was
some discussion in the other House as to
whether members of Parliament should not
have free transportation.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Is there any appeal
from the decision of the board on the cancellation of a licence?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: There is an appeal to the Minister; and on points of law
and jurisdiction, to the Supreme Court of
Canada.
Section 7 is amended with respect to the
application of the principle of public convenience and necessity to certain non-scheduled
services. Under the Act a person could get a
licence from the Air Transport Board only on
the grounds of "public convenience and necessity", following the phraseology of the Railway Act and the practice set up both under

NOVEMBER 29, 1945
that Act and the Transport Act. The board in
the light of its experience during the last few
months has learned that in certain cases, such
for example as chartered services, it is impossible for the applicant to prove public
conivenience and necessity; these services could
only be regarded as being more or less for
private convenience.
Section 8 is amended se as to enable the
board to issue a licence before an operating
certificate is obtained. Under the Act no licence
can be issued until certain conditions have
been complied with. It has been found that
pèrsons desiring to start up in the aviation
field might have to. secure a licence before
they could arrange their financing and get
their planes. Under this amendment a licence
may he issipd, but operation cannot be
started until an operating certificate is
obtained.
Section 9 gives the board power to suspend,
cancel or amensi licences. At present no such
power is vested in the board, although I believe it was argued in the other place that
prob4bly as a matter of law anybody charged
with the responsibility of issuing licences
could, on violation, suspend or cancel them.
This amendmeet removes any uncertainty in
this respect.
Section 10 is amended by changing the
penalty for operating without a licence from
S1.COO te $5,000, to b.ring it înle e with the
penalties section týo which I have already

GOLD PRODUCTION IN CANADA
DJISCUSSION

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjcurned debate on the notice cf Hon. Mr.
McRae:
That he will caîl the attention cf the *Senate
te the development cf our gold resources, and
what an active programme te inerease our gold
production could m-ean te the general prosperity
cf Canada, particularly je the empîcyment of
labour, the establishment of new communities
and the importance cf gold ie takieg care of
our fereign obligations.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, in adding a word or twe te the
discussion on this resolution I wish te refer
te a phase cf the subject which so far has
net been touched u-pon. My excuse for se
doing is afferded largeiýy by the remarks cf
the former Minister cf Mines and Resources
(Hon. Mr. Crerar), who extended the scope
cf the resolution te the whoie mining industry
of Canada.

346

My interest in mining, directly or indirectly.
is very definitely limited to the possession of
a rather modest sized packet of paperslabelled
"Cats and dogs." representing the varied fortunes of organized groups of gentlemen in
their search for gold. But what I wish to
discuss this afternoon is silver, the rather
anaemie sister of gold. Silver may be fittingly
described at the present time as a sort of
Cinderella of the mining industry. I hasten
to assure honourable members that I do not
intend to inflict on them any monetary
theories, such, for example, as the relative
merits of bimetalism and monometalism.
Since the rise in the price of silver in New
York last September from around 44 cents
to 71 cents an ounce, there lias been an increasing interest in this precious metal, and a lively
discussion in the United States for and against
advancing the price still higher. The satittory limitation there is $1.29 an ounce. and
representatives
from
the
silver-producing
states have been urging the authorities at
Washington to advance the price to this
maximum. The reason for this is that there
has been a very marked decline in both production and the accumulated supply of silver
al over the world. To illustrate this condition one lias only to mention that in 1939
the United States had an accumulation of
silver amounting to something like 3,200,000.000 ounces; the latest available figures
indicate present holdings of something like
250.000,000 ounces, a decline between 1939
and the present time of approximately 3.000,000.000 ounces.
The price of silver in London and Bombay,
two of the world's chief markets. is iiglier
than the price in New York as of October this
year. Today in London silver is quoted at
eighty-three cents an ounce, while the Bank
of India in Bombay is quoting $1.31 per ounce.

In view of the wide spread in value, and the
world searcity of silver and its effect on
Canada, an increasing amouni of interest
should be taken in the subject by the memhers of this honourab'e Chamber .
'ilver production in Canada in 1939-I take
my figures from a statemîent prepared by the
Division of Economics, Bureau of Mines,
0
ttawa-was almost 24,000,000 ounces. The
latest available figures show a decline to a
production in 1944 of 13,627,000 ounces. The
-duction
in volumne in Canada as repreb.Iated by these figures is in keeping with the
decline in supply that is taking place all
over the world, and is due to such factors as
lack of labour and a price for silver which
does not enable the smaller operators to
engage profitably in the industry.
Hon.

Mr. LAMBERT.

Since the wide difference was established
between the price of silver in New York and
the price of silver in Canada there has been
a good deal of discussion in Ottawa by certain
officiais and those interested in silver mining,
in the hope that the Canadian price of silver
might be advanced to the New York price. It
should be pointed out that the price of silver
in Canada for some years past has been
around forty cents-41-4 cents. I think the
price for fine silver is generally quoted
at something less than forty cents per ounce.
In addition to what I have already mentioned. flit miaintenanee of a price ceiling by
the Wartime Prices and Trade Board lias
had an effect on the silver industry in Canada as compared to other countries. That
control applies to various products of the
silver industry in Canada, such as sterling
silverware, minted silver, silver nitrate for use
in the photographic film industry, scientifia
equipment, fountain pens, pencils, jewellery,
medical and pharmaceutical preparations, and
some miscellaneous chemicals. The domestic
demand for silver, in iny opinion, bas not
been proportionate to the total production,
and therefore the ceiling bas, during the past
three months, prevented the price of silver
in Canada from rising to that of the New
York market.
May I quote some figures to support tiat
theory. In 1940 there were 23,833,000 ounces
of silver produced in this country, of whih
19.000,000 ounces were exported, leaving for
domestic use approximately 4,500,000 ounces.
The last figures recorded for 1944 show a
total production of 13,627,600 ounees, of which
6,000,000 ounces
owereexported, leaving a
balance of approximately 7,660,000 ounces,
which evidently were consumed by the combined demand of the Mint and local industry,
In the last few years there lias been an
increase in the amount of silver consumed
in this country compared to the total production. In view of the advance in the
price of silver on the worid markets that fact
should be recognized.
I do not wish to suggest or imply a note
of criticism about the policy of the Wartime
Prices and Trade Board. I have discussed
the matter witlh officials of that organization
and others who have been closely in touch
with the negotiations recently going on among
the silver mining producers, and the MetalController. I have recently learned that in
the very near future there will· be an adjustment made whereby silver producers, partieularly the smaller operators, will be able te
get a price for silver equivalent to that paid
in New York today
It should be said that

347

NOVEMBER 29, 1945
the operation of the silver industry in Canada
under the present control has resulted in five
large producers supplying the bulk of the
silver needed in Canada; and that through
export permits the same producers shipped.
the surplus of their product to New York,
where they get a higher price. In other words,
in the year 1944 roughly 6,000,000 ounces were
exported to New York, while 7,600,000 ounces
were used at home. The situation whereby
large producers are able to refine the silver
needs of this country, results in many small
producers being unable to conduct their operations profitably. The bulk of silver comes
from such mines as Consolidated Smelters,
Hudson Bay Mines, International Nickel and
Noranda. In these mines silver is a by-product
of base metal or gold. As I have intimated,
these companies have the advantage of refincries and really make the bulk of their revenue
out of the other metals which they refine,
namely, gold, lead, zinc, copper and so on.
With the shortage of silver the world over,
and the increase in price that has taken place
outside of Canada; it has become necessary to
have more data and information on the silver
situation in Canada. I think it is important
that any feeling or suspicion that hoarding has
existed should be immediatelv offset, and, in
concluding my remarks I should like to make
a definite suggestion that the Government
consider answering four questions which I
shall now put:
(1) What amount of silver is being held in
,Canada at present by the Dominion Government and by private companies, and for what
purposes is it proposed to be used?
(2) How much new Canadien silver was used
in Canada during 1944 and 1945 for the minting
of coins, and what price was paid per ounce to
the producers?
(3) What are the estimated requirements of
silver for minting of Canadian coins during
1946, and what are the estimated requirements
for other purposes in Canada during 1946, and
for what purposes will it be used?
(4) What reason is there for the sudden advance in Canadian consumption of silver during
the past year?
I have attempted to get some answers to
these questions by dissecting and analyzing
the best figures obtainable from the Department of Mines and Resources, but the answers
have not been at all definite. Now that the
situation is being improved by the proposed
advance in price, I think our officials should
see that it is made impossible for Canadians
to hoard supplies of silver, or traffic in it
outside this country. I am assured by officials
of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board that
there has been no undue accumulation or
so-called hoarding of supplies of the white
metal in Canada, but whether that statement
is based upon any actual physical check-up,

I do not know. At any rate I think it is
worth emphasizing now that every possible
step should be taken to prevent profiteering.
In conclusion I should like to refer to the
situation that existed in Canada in 1923-24.
which was, as many honourable senators will
remember, somewhat similar to the situation
of to-day. Canada's dollar was selling at a discount of about 20 per cent in New York. The
then Minister of Finance, Right Honourable
Mr. Fielding, undertook to pay Canadian
producers of gold in Canadian funds rather
than in New York funds. A large deputation,
including Englishmen. Americans and Canadians waited on the minister and pointed out
to him how seriously Canadian producers
would be injured if they were denied the right
to sell gold at the world price. Much stress
was laid on the fact that such a policy would
prevent the flow into this country of capital
for the development of gold mining. Upon
further consideration the minister reversed his
policy and directed that payment should be
made to Canadian producers at the market
price. I submit that there is good reason why
the present Minister of Finance should follow
in relation to silver the precedent established
by his illustrious predecessor some twenty years
ago with respect to gold. The result of such
a course would be a useful stimulation of
silver mining in Canada.

DEPARTMENT OF RECONSTRUCTION
AND SUPPLY BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed froin Wednesday, November 28, the adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr. Robertson for the second
reading of Bill 173, an Act respecting the
Department of Reconstruction and Supply.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Ronourable senators, this is a bill to create a Department of
Reconstruction and Supply. When I read the
bill I expected that, as in any other piece of
legislation for such a purpose, I should find
described in detail the powers of the proposed department and how it is to be set
up and administered. But I could find nothing more than a reference to an earlier
statute, the provisions of whiei are to be
changed in certain respects.
I may say quite frankly that on first perusal
I did not understand some sections at all,
particularly the section having to do with
the adjustment of profits; but after hearing
the honourable member from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Campbell) explain it the other day, I
think I do understand it now. In my opinion
the diraftsman should be asked to set out all the
Hon. Mr. EULER.

powers that are to be exercised by the department. In short, the bill should be in plain
language that anybody can understand.
This bill-and I say it in all kindness-is
undoubtedly drafted by a man who, by reason
of the powers he bas exercised during the
past six or seven years, is fundamentally a
dictator. Nobody but a man with a dictatorial
mind would ever countenance a bill like this.
One can readily understand that when creating the Department of Munitions and Supply
it was becessary to give it wide powers so
that it could get things donc at once. That
was a wartime necessity; but to-day there
is no reason why a dictatorial principle should
be continued in our legislation.
One or two things within the scope of this
bill should be brought to the attention of
the Senate. Under the direction of the Department of Munitions and Supply houses for
veterans are now being built in my own city
of Winnipeg, and, I am credibly informed.
in other of our cities, such as Montreal,
Toronto, Halifax, Vancouver, Regina, Saskatoon, Calgary and Ottawa. There is a strong
sentiment thiroughout the countryiihat
we
should do all in our power to get rid of slum
conditions in our cities, and with this I
entirely agree. A commission investigating
conditions in Winnipeg found that 75 per
cent of the hospitalization cases originated
in an arca covering about one-sixth of the
whole city. That is a slum area. I say this
net to deride my own city, but to point out
the dangers inierent in slum conditions. The
general opinion is that the veterans' houses
now being built in Winnipeg will create
another slum area in five years, if pot sooner.
I understand tbere is a similar prospect for
this class of housing in our other cities. I
submit that such a state of affairs should
not be allowed, to continue. It is no answer
to say that returned soldiers must be provided
with homes and these hastily built houses
are better than none. I would remind honourable members that the West is a cold countrythougla not quite so cold as the people of
Ontario, British Columbia and the Maritimes
would lead the world to believe. However,
it is cold enough, and for that reason we
who live there need good houses-not exfravagantly built, but of sufficiently solid
construction to protect us from the cold.
These veterans' houses have no celars and no
arrangements for beating. I freely admit that
in early days we had to get along without
many conveniences, but we always had a
cellar where vegetables could be kept. The
houses being built by the Department are
flimsy, and it is as sure as anything can be
that in a few years they will be dilapidated.

NOVEMBER 30, 1945
Another very unsatisfactory thing is the
department's priority order reserving al
building materials for its bousing scberne. As a
resuit, ail over Canada hundireds of bouses
whose construction was begun by private
builders cannot be macle ready for occupancy.
I may be told, "Oh, yes, Mr. Haig, but these
cbeap bouses are for soldiers, whereas the
bouses you are talking about, costing $5,000,
$6,000 or $7,000, axe for rich peoplie." In every
city there are people needing bouses. If six or
seven huncfred new houses were cornpleted,
they would accommodate that number of
families.
Hon.,Mr. EULER:. May I ask a question?
My bonourable friend stated that these, houses
are te be 'built without cellars. Is that
specified?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I do not know about the
specificationsHon. Mr. EULER: I1arn merely asking for
information. Why does my bonourable friend
assume the bouses will have no cellars?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Because they are, being
built in that way. Contracts have been let
for four hundred such bouses to be built in
the city of Winnipeg. Honourable gentlemen
from Montreal can tell you bow many bouses
are being built in that city.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Without cellars?
Hon .Mr. HAIG: Witbout cellars.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: There are some bouses
being bujît outaide Ottawa, I notice, with
foundatiens tbree or four feet higb. I saw
the excavations. I cannot say that cellars are
to be built, but foundations were being put in.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Two types of bouses are
being built. One type does not corne under
this bill, but if the House will permit me I
will refer to it. That is the type being put
up by the Depar.trent of Veterans Aif airs in
certain areas outside cities, eachbhouse occupying at least haîf an acre of land'. It is likely
some of these bouses Vo whicb the honourable
gentleman refera.
Hon. Mr. HARDY:. I tbink it is. Tbey
bave considerable land around tbem.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: There must be hall an
acre of land. Tbese bouses are being built
outside the city of Winnipeg too. I have been
criticizing the poorer class of dwelling erected
by the Departrnent of Munitions and Su.pply.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Under agreemnt
witb tbe municipafity.

349

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Under agreement with
the municipality. Tbey are building one or
two hundred in the nortb part of Winnipeg
and approximately the same numnber in the
soutb part. Wben you suggest Vo people that
this kind of bouse sbeuld not be buiît tbey
imrnediately ask you: "Wbere will the homeless farnilies go? Wbere will tbey sleep?"
That is not a good argument, because in five
years' time, as I bave said, these bouses will
bave created slum areas. Tbey are a cbeap
kind of sback, similar to wbat tbe early bornesteader built at a cost of $10. 1 can remiemaber the time wben sbacks like that bad sods
on tbe roof.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Tbe municipalities will
be equally responsible witb the Government.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Tbat is a different matter. Tbe municipalities do notbing more than
give the land.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: There is au agree-'
ment between tbem and tbe Government as
te the type of building.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That does not justify
the spend-ing of ail this money by Canada.
The municipaliities are desperate, but that is
no excuse for putting up cbeap-jack bouses,
tying up supplýies and stopping the construction of other bouses already und er way. I
know of new bouses in tbe city of Winnipeg
wbose windows have been nailed up for tbree
montbs. On some of tbem construction was
st-arted last spring.
1 do net tbink the bousing probiem will be
solved by tbis type of construction. Tbe
tenants will try to get into a better place
very soon-tbey could not geV worse-and
tbey will move eut and leave the bouses on
our hands.
There is one other question under tbis bill.
Wby is it that the Bird Construction Company
bas the contract for the building of all tbese
houses in Winnipeg?
Hon,. Mr. BUCHANAN: M'ass production.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: There is ne mass pro-.
duction in bouse building. One migbt excavate cellars by the use of modern macbinery, but it takes se many men and se
rnucb material to, build a bouse. A great
many builders in the city of Winnipeg have
been building bouses, te my personal knowIedge, for tbirty years. Tbere is ne reason
wbhy tbey sbould be denied a contract for
five or ten houses. The Bird Construction
Company is a good enougb company, but it
bas been erecting big buildings, sucb as tbe
Swift Ca-nadian and the Canada Packers packing bouses in Winnipeg.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. EULER: The price might bave
something to do with it.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I do not think the price
had anything to do with it.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: The price is high
enough. The bouses cost about $5,000.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Does my honourable
friend not think that the points be is now raising are more relevant to another bill than
to the bill now under discussion? I do not wish
to bu critical, but I think my honourable
friend is entirely out of order.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I am not sure about that.
This bill creates a new department, which will
be responsible for building the kind of houses
I have been criticizing.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I do not think you
are in order.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I an very much in order.
Thisbill deals with the very subject I am
discussing. I admit that I was out of order
in answering the question asked by my honourable friend from Brockville (Hon. Mr.
Hardy). I an entitled to say what will
happen in the future under this legislation.
Hon. Mr. HOWDEN: May I ask if building restrictions in Winnipeg do not apply to
the situation to which moy honourable friend
refers.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: We have building restrictions in Winnipeg, but as to area only. The
cost of building has inrreased 40 per cent
since those restrictions were put on. These
houses built by the Department wouild not be
permitted in a nunber one district, such as
that in which I live. They are being built in
number three or number four districts. The 40
per cent increase in the cost of construction
is due in part to the bigh cost of building
materials and labour.
This bill should be revised and made to
state definitely what is intended to bu done.
One is shoked by the remarks of the honourable gentleman from Lincoln (Hon. Mr.
Bench) and the honourable gentleman from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) on some of the
provisions contained in this bill. I could not
accept as readily as did my honourable friend
from Lincoln the legal implications of this
bill. Our country is not at war any longer. I
hope, although I am at times not sure, that we
are through with xwar. We should not give
by legislation the powers that are contained in
this bIl
For instance, my honourable friend
frou Toronto referred to the resting of investigators with almost unlimited authority. The
pre-sent endenuy is, a honourable mtuebers
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

on both sides know, te give too much power
te the Cabinet and to take away power fiom
Parliament. That tendency would be strengthened by the passing of this bill.
In my opinion the bill should bu sent to
committee and completely revised. I hope
the present Minister of Munitions and Supply
did not give instructions for drafting the bill
in its present form, and that the reason why
we see it in this formo is that the draftsman
did net want to take time to include evervthing that should have been included. We
ought to bu careful about the powers that
we give to any minister under any conditions.
I do not need to go over the clauses in
detail. I acknowledge the contribution; made
by three honourable senators opposite on
Wednesday. including the analysis of the legal
effect of certain clauses.
I

am very

much opposed

to

the Govern-

ment going into the building of houses, and
J am afraid the bill continues that policy. In
this country it might be necessary for the
Government to lend mioney to the municipalities for the building of houses that could
be let to people with low incomes. That
would bu a better method than the building
of houses by the Government itself. Per-onally I would prefer to sue a better standard
of wages that would, enable the people to
pay for their own shelter, food and clothing
and other reasonable amenities of life. But
if that cannot be donc-and apparently xwe
have not the courage or the ingenuity to tIo
that-and if public mnoney must be used to
build houses for rental at low rates, they bad
better bu built by the municipalities, wio are
the authorities closest to the people.
I would certainly vote to let the bill go
to committee, but I hope the Minister will
corme there and Say, "I want vou to revise the
bill in the way that you think will bu in the
best interests of Canada. regardless of wlat
may have been suggested by my department."
If that attitude were taken the bill could be
extensively amended so as te become a credit
to the Minister. his department and the whole
country.
Hon. Mr. COPP: In order to obtain sone
information. may I ask a question of my
honourable friend? I have always understood
that it was at tise reques t of the municipalities that the Governument entered into the
building of houses. Arn I wrong in that?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: At first the municipalities suggested the Governrment should lend
theon noev to build houses, but the Go\ernmisent refused. At least, that is iy understanding.
Then the Govcronient prepared
plans for a certain type cf bouse and -sid.

NOVEMBER 30, 1945
Hon. Mr. COPP: Does my bonourablt,
friend say that in building bouses the Government was flot responding to a request from
the municipalities?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The Government said,
"There is the house we will biýild." It is a
standardized house of four rooms. 1 arn subject to correction on that; in some instances
the bouse may have five rooms. It bas no
cellar and no furnace. Tbe Government saîd
to the municipalities: "We will build that
type of house in blocks of one hund.red at a
cost of se mucb, if you will furnisb tbe land
and accept a certain sum of money every
year in lieu of taxes."
Hon. Mr. COPP: And the municipalities
said "Ail right"?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: What else could the municipaliiies say?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Tbey did not
have to ask for these houses.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The municipal authoirities
were harassed by people' seeking a place to
live, and there was no alternative to acceptance of the Government's offer.- The eity of
Winnipeg, for instance, would bave buiît
bouses with tbe rnoney that the Government
is spending on construction there. The city
tried to get the right ýto do wbat the Government is doing, but it was refused. In Toronto,
Montreal anct Ottawa you will find the same
tbing is true. The pcpple wbo want to sc our
cities rid of slums are up in armas about these
Government bouses. But consider the predicament of a mayor and tbe members of bis city
council. Here are returned soldiers demanding living accommodation, and none can be
found. Tben along cornes the Government and
says: "We wiil buil.d bouses of this type. You
can take tbemn or leave tbem." Now, I ask my
bonourable friends opposite, wbat would tbey
do if tbey were on the city coundil? I say tbey
would do just wbat tbe various city councils
have done-accept the Government's off er.
But the people of Canada would nlot approve
of the Government's action, if tbey knew tbe
facts.
From his knowHon. Mr. RtOBERTSON:
Iedge of tbe situation in Winnipeg, will my
bonourable friend say definitely that tbe city
council asked the Goverument for money.
but that its request was turned down, and it
accepted tbese Government bouses under
protest?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Tbe Government's offer
was at flrst rejected, and was only agreed to
after a long struggle between the different
elements in the couneil. Tbe municipality

finally agreed to ask the Government to build
one or two bundred bouses--originally it was
one hundred, I tbink. As I say, tbere was a
long struggle before the council came to this
decision, and the matter was neyer put to a
vote in the city. If it had been, it would
nlot bave carried.
Hon. Mr. iROBERTSON: It is the municipalities' fault, is it net, if they accept something they do not like?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No. It is the Government's fault, for building tbat kind of bouse.

bave te accept the Government's offer. They
could have bujît tbe bouses themselves.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No; tbey did net bave
the money.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Tbey bave credit,
baven't they?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Before tbe city council
could start building bouses it would bave te
pass a bylaw and submit it te the people.
And tbe people .would bave voted against it,
because they believe tbat after tbings settle
down there will net be jobs for alI the temporary residents wbo moved into the city
during tbe war, and tbat tbey will bave te go
back ýwbere -they came from. Personally, I
believe the people are rigbt in this.
To my honourable frienil the leader of the
Governme'nt (Hon. Mr. Robertson) 1 will say
this: You are a young man and yeu will live
long enough to see these bouses become a
dead bass te Canada. You will also live te see
terrible anger displayed at tbe conditions that
bave been created, in our cities by the building
of these bouses.
Hon. WISHART MoL. ROBERTSON:
Honouraible senaters, at the moment 1 amn, net
in a position to reply te the criticism of the
pewers that are given te tbe Minister or
anyone else by this bill. 1 arn confident that
if any sucb criticism is expressed in the cernmittee. the Minister or accredited officials of
bis department will be able te make a reasenable answer te it. Therefore 1 saal refer ne
furtber te this peint noiw.
I do want to say a word, thougb, about tbis
constant bammering at tbe Department of
Munitions and Supply for baving em'barked
upon a programme te provide bouses for
returned men in the shortest possible time.
During the war period many cities bad a great
influx of people-I know this was true of
Halifax-and bouses of a temporary nature
were built to accommodate tbem. Then as
soon as the war ended various municipalities
asked tbe Department of Munitions and Supply

352

SENATE

to build houses, and great insistence was laid
upon the need for building them expeditiously.
The Department respondetd to this request.
I do not know whether the bouses that have
been built were properly designed, or whether
they were too cheap, or whe.ther they should
have contained more conveniences, but I
understand that housing accommodation bas
had to be provided in a hurry to meet the
virtual emergency that exists today in many
of our cities because large numbers of veterans
and their families have no roofs over their
heads. The cities did not have to ask the
Department to start this building programme,
although, as was said by the honourable
leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig), they were
under pressure to do some'thing to satisfy the
demand. But whatever was the motive, and
even if some city councils in their wisdom took
action of which the majority of their people
disapproved, I do know that other municipal
councils have asked the Department of Munitions and Supply to build, houses. The Department has undertaken the work only when so
requested. That being the case, I ask honourable members to bear in mind that the
Department has issued priority orders only
to the extent that it needs building materials
for veterans' homes. My honourable friend
would seem to intimate that every foot of
lumber and every bit of other building
material was or will be pre-empted under this
bill. That, honourable members, is not so.
Thousands of houses other than those under
construction by the Department are being
built.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: How much hardwood can
you get?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I ýdo not know
any of the details, but I can say that private
builders are erecting thousands of houses.
True, if in a particudar case you have to choose
between the housing need of a veteran and
that of a civilian, the civilian must await
his turn. For my part, honourable senators,
I am heartily in favour of the veteran having
the first chance, and I am surprised to hear
the honourable leader opposite taking any
other stand. Surely the men who have risked
their all for us overseas should have the first
preference for the housing of themselves and
their families! It is the duty of those who
stayed at home to provide them that accommodation. It may be that the kind of bouse now
being built for their use will not last for a
long time, and that the architects should have
designed a more or less permanent type.
Hon. MT. HORNER: Many of the bouses
that private builders want to erect are also
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

for veterans, but their construction is held up
because of the priority given to the Government housing plan.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That is quite true,
but, as my honourable friend is well aware,
there is no way of deciding whether the houses
that private builders want to erect are or are
not for veterans. It may be, as the honourable leader opposite las said, that the Department's type of bouse is not properly designed,
that it should have six insteatd of five rooms,
and so forth. I know nothing about that, but
I do know that the Governiment housing
scheme is a practical and reasonable attempt
to give the men coming back from overseas
an opportunity to get a cover over their heads,
and I applaud the action of the Governiment,
even if-as I am told-these houses will not
last as long as other types that might be
erected. Certainly if you start to build a
larger class of bouse the cost must go up.
On the general question as to the powers
contained in the bill, I am sure honourable
senators do not -desire to give any greater
powers than are -necessary to carry on the
Department's work efficiently, and I think we
can safely leave the committee to decide what
is proper in thlat respect.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved that the
Bill be referred to the Standing Oommittec
on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: As honourable senators
will appreciate, several rather important legal
aspects of this bill will require consideration
in committee. Those of us interested in the
matter are trying to work out a solution that
would meet the requirements of the Goveinment and at the same time satisfy some of
the objections raised in this Chamber. That is
not altogether a simple task, and it will take
probably two or three days to put the amendments into draft form. Then after discussion
with the officers of the department concerned
we might considerably expedite the work of
the committee.
Consequently I would respectfully suggest to the honourable leader of
the Government and the chairman of the
Banking and Commerce Committee that the
committee defer consideration of the bill until
next Thursday. I may add that I have heard
it is the desire of some interested parties to
make representations before the committee
in respect of this legislation.

NOVEMBER 30, 1945
Hon. Mr. ROBERTS-ON: As far as lies
in my power I shall be only too happy te
accede to the suggestion of .my honourable
f.rjend.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: May 1 ask the
hýonoureble senetor from Lincoln (Hon. Mr.
Bench) if in his praiseworthy effort to draft
suitable amendments to the billlie is availing
himself of the services of the Parliamentary
Counisel of the Senate? I assume some time
wouhd bc needed for this work.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I mey tell the honourable gentleman from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) that the Parliementary Counsel lias heen
consuIted.
Certain suggestions have been
made te bim as to eppropriete amendmnents,
and lie bas intimated~ to me that it wilh take
him two or three d'ays to consider them. That
is et the bottom of my request to have the
first sitting of the committee set clown for
Thursdey.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Robertson was
agreed to.
INCOME AND EXCESS PROFITS
TAXATION
MEETING 0F SPECIAL COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. HAiG: I bave another matter
to raise. The Special Comimittee investigating the provisions and workings of the Income
W'ar Tax Act bas set aside next Tuesday and
Weclnesday to enable delegatiens front outside points to make representations before it.
With tel due respect to the leader of the
Goverument and the cheirmen of other important committees, I would suggest that they
defer meetings of those committees so thet
our wh.ole time mey be given to the work of
this Special Cominittee.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: That could be arranged with the chairman of the Banking and
Commerce ýCommittee.
Hon. Mr. HAIC: I would not wnnt te do
so unless the leader of the Goveroment wcre
agreeahle. We are anxious to do a proper job.
Hon. Mr. COPP: The Special Committea
meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday wilh net
interfere with the meeting of the Banking
and Commerce Committee on Tbursday.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Thrce delegations have
been notified to appear before the Speciel
Committee ncxt Tuesday. Their representati&ns may not be completed before Wednesday, but I dloubt very much whetlier they wilh
go beyond that day.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I arn quite wiIling to adopt the suggestion, with one reserva-

~353

tion. The Special Committee on Income Tex
is doing excellent work, but, efter all, I in my
officiel cepecity and honourable senators in
their general capacity have the responsibility
of seeing that the ordinary work of the Senete
is not neglected.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is riglit.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Before I cen ask
the House to .pass the War Appropriation Bihl
we must have a meeting of the Finance Committee, whicb my bonoureble friend would
want to attend in ordier to resume discussion
of the questions that ho himself lies elready
brouglit up. We have five committees elreedy
fulhy engeged, and other bills mey lie referred
to them this afternoon. I had occasion to
discuss the question withi the cheirman of
the Speciel Committee, and lie intimated
that bis committee would probebhy lie tied

even ho sitting agein the following week,
whicli wihl probabhy 'be the lest week of the

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Could we not deal with
thet on Mondey next?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Since we have

NOVEMBER 30, 1945
-unless during that period proceedings iinder
this Act in respect of those fsh or containers
are undertakenBy wbomn are they to be undertaken? Proceedings may be taken by way of the inspector
laying information against the fish merchant,
ur*by way of the fish merchant appealiug to
to the Minister. Ail honourable senators know
how long it takes to have an appeal settled
by the Minister; and if the matter is brought
before the courts it may not be disposed of
for sorne considerable time. When one side
or the other makes any move in the inatter,
the seizure of fish is ipso facto postponed until
a final settiement is reached.
Now, I ask, if several tons of fresh fish
belonging to rny honourable friend frorn Margaree Forks were seized in that manner, what
would be the financial eifect uponý hirn? There
is no provision in the bil] for cornpensating
hirn if the inspecter or the Departrnent makes
a mistake. So he loses for two reasons: first,
breause he was not allowed a fair opportunity
to dispose of his fish when the rnarket wvas
good,; and second, because while the fish
w-as being held it would deteriorate-in fact,if it was fresh when seized, it would probably
have spoiled.
I think an.y necessary arnendrnent could
have been made by adding just a few words
to certain clauses of the Act as it now stands.
I arn absolutely opposed to this bill, and
especially to section 3, wbich empowers
inspectors to seize flsb but contains no provision for giving redress Io innocent and bona
fide fishermen who suifer less througb seizures
that are proven to have been made for insuffidient reasonis.
Hon. WILLIAM DUFF: Honourable senators, I used to thin-k that I knew a littie
about the fish business, but I have corne to
the conclusion that I do not.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Don't get discouraged.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: The Department of Fisheýries is like Rip Van Winkle. It bas wakened
up aiter forty years-Hon. Mr. HARMER: Twenty.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Twenty, is it? I thought
it was forty. Anyway, it is trying to justify
its existence. This 'bill is nothing but a lot
of carnouflage. The officiais who are drawing
salaries of $9.000 and so on have to do something to show that they are on the job, so
they try ta pull wool over somebody's eyes.
I agree with what was said by my friend from
L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Léger). These amendments are ridiculous nonsense. Take clause
1. Now, do not forget that we have had a
Department of Fisheries and laws gov erning
fisherie8 since 1867, but these gentlemen in

35.1

the Departrnent have only now, in the year
of our Lord 1945, wakened Up to the fact
that the word "fisb" should include shellfisb
and crustaceans. So f ar as these gentlemen
knew, such fish were of course neyer caught
before. It rnay be tbat lest summer someone
in the Departrnent received a gif t of haîf a
dozen lobsters or haîf a dozen oysters, and
suddenly thought it would be a good idea
to have the Act arnended. That is the only
reason I can see for clause 1.
Clause 2 extends inspection to processing
and rnnrking of fisb to be packed in containers. Every rnan in the fish business bas
always been subjeet to inspection, whether be
is selling pickled flsh or fresb fish or any
other kind of fish. 0f course. I do not know
wbetber this inspection bas been carried on by
authority of the Act. Perbaps inspectors were
acting without any autbority. However, as
I say, flsb packers have always been subjeet
to inspection, but now the Departrnent cornes
along and says it is necessary to give the
inspectors authority "respecting the processing and marking of fish to be packed in containers." It appears that these gentlemen
down in the Departrnent know more about
fish than I do.
Now I corne to the third clause of the bill,
wbich was the one particularly criticized by
rny bonourable friend from L'Acadýie (Hon.
Mr. Léger). This clause reads:
Whenever an inspecting officer suspects on
reasonable grounds that an offence against this
Act or any regulation has been committed, he
may seize alI fish and containers by means of or
in relation to which he reasonably believes the
offeoýce was committed.
If that becomes law it migbt cause a lot of
trouble to the fisherman. He is the man wbo
gets up before daylight, lcaving lis wife in
bed, and makes bis :breakfast of a cup of tea
and perhaps a piece, of dry bread-he bas
not been able to get any butter in the last
six or seven years-and goes out in the fog
and ramn and stormy weatber and catches one
or two hundred .mackerel or enough berring
to f11l tbree or four 'barraIs, and some pollock
or eodfish. Wben tits poor fellow cornes in
with bis day's catch he is likely to 'be met
by some inspector from Halifax, Who dýoes not
know a kayak from an alewife, but who m.ay
seize the fish and hold it for several months.
I say this bill is ridiculous nonsense. There
is no need for it at aIl What we ought ta do
is to give it the six months' hoist and then
send it back ta the Department of Figheries.
The motion was agreed. ta, and the Bill was
read the second time.

SENATE
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, I move that this bill be referred to the
Standing Committee on Agriculture and
Forestry. Perhaps at first it may seem that
this is not the appropriate committee, but
we are hoping that in future it will consider
all measures dealing with natural products.
The motion was agreed to.

WAR SERVICE GRANTS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. WISHART
McL. ROBERTSON
moved the second reading of Bill 176, an Act
to amend the War Service Grants Act, 1944.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill contains a considerable list of amendments to
the War Service Grants Act of 1944, which has
to do with such matters as gratuities to war
veterans. These amendments are for the most
part of a minor nature. Apparently in practice it has been found desirable to make
certain changes in the law, and some of these
have already been put into effect by Order in
Council. Early this year a committee of
sixty honourable members of the other place,
all ex-service men, drawn from all the political
parties there, spent a good deal of time in
studying tbis Act, and they unanimously suggested the amendments that are set forth in the
bill. These amendments have to do largely
with improvements that actual administration
of the law indicated to be desirable. One of
them introduces a new feature into the Act,
however, in that it constitutes a Board of
Review to whom would be referred applications from discharged airmen, soldiers and
seamen for gratuities of which they were
deprived by disciplinary action. I am sure
that anyone who had anything to do with
the armed forces in the war just ended or
the war of 1914-18 will realize the desirability
of tolerance in dealing with applications of
this kind. I feel that the proposal to set up
a Board of Review will commend itself to
every honourable senator.
After the bill is giv en second reading I
shall move that it bereferred to a committee,
where further details will be made available.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved that the
Bill be referred to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. DUFF.

ALBERTA NATURAL RESOURCES
TRANSFER BILL
SECOND READING

Hon.

WISHART

McL.·

ROBERTSON

moved the second reading of Bill 16, an Act
to amend the Alberta Natural Resources Act.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Is that bill printed?
is not on my file.

It

Hon. Mr. CRERAR: It has been available
for two or three days.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I am informed
that copies came in about five minutes ago,
and will be placed on honourable members'
desks at once. It is not a very long bill, and
I hope the House will agree to our proceeding with it now. I have asked the honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) to explain the bill.
Hon. T. A. CRERAR: Honourable senators, this is a measure which I anticipate will
raise no controversy. It will be recalled that
in 1930 by an amendment to the B:itish
North America Act the natural resources of
Alberta were transferred for administration
by and for the benefit of the Crown in the
rigbt of that province. That was done by
the Parliament at Westminster approving the
Natural Resources Transfer agreement made
between the federal Government and the
provincial Government. The agreement provided that if at any time in the future a
change in its terms was found necessary. it
would be effected by agreement between
the two Governments, such agreement to be
ratified by the Parliament of Canada and the
Legislature of Alberta.
When the transfer was made in 1930 the
federal authority retained control of the Indian reserves. It was also provided that certain bird sanctuaries should be maintained.
Hon. Mr. LEGER:
federal authority?

Maintained

by

the

Hon. Mr. CRERAR: By the province.
Under the terms of the agreement the province
could not alienate these bird sanctuaries.
Prior to the transfer of the natural resources,
tliree licences for the development of power on
the Bow river had been issued by the Department of the Interior to the Calgary Power
Company. The first of these, issued in 1909,
was the grant of a power site at the Horseshoe Falls, which are on the Stony Indian
reserve. The next grant, made in 1913, was
of a power site at the Kananaskis Falls. A
third grant was made in 1929 of what is known
as the Ghost power development.
For a good many years there has been
some contention between the Alberta and

NOVEMBER 30, 1945
Dominion governments as to which authority
should have the right to control these power
sites. The water generating the power originates outside the Indian reserve altogether, and
then flows either alongside the reserve or, as
in one instance, through the reserve itself. The
Alberta Government contended that it should
exercise control. Acting on the advice of the
Department of Justice, the federal Government
denied this contention. This bill amends the
Alberta Natural Resources Act of 1930 and
embodies an agreement by which these outstanding differences are settled in a way
that appeals to me as a fair compromise.
For the benefit of honourable members I
might refer to the terms of this new agreement. The three licences originally issued by
the federal Government were for twenty-five
years, and subject to revision at the end of
that period. Up to the present time revision
has not been made, because of the differences
to which I have referred. Under the licence
of the Horeshoe Falls site the Calgary
Power Company paid an annual rental of
$1,500. The company is now generating 19,500
horsepower there. Under this new agreement
the rental is increased-to $6,375 for a further
period of twenty-five years from October 14,
1935, when the original licence expired. All
this revenue goes to the federal Government
for the benefit of the Indians on the Stony
reserve, the dam and all the generating works
being within the reserve.
At the Kananaskis power development the
company is generating 11,600 horsepower, a4
arrangement had to be reached for an allocation of the revenue. The provincial land
adjoins the river on one side; the reserve is on
the other side. The dam and generating
facilities were constructed largely within the
reserve, while the greater part of the land,
flooded by the erection of the dam is within
the province. For this site the power company
paid to the federal Government a rental of
$1,562, and the province received $38 as compensation for its flooded land. Under the
new arrangement the total rental is divided
on the basis of 45/72 to the federal Government, for the benefit of the Indians, and
27/72 to the province. The new arrangement
will be retroactive to October 14, 1936. The
Dominion will receive $2,750 a year and the
provincee $1,ß50. The agreement provides that
the control and administration of these two
power sites shall remain with the federal
authority.
The greater part of the works of the Ghost
power development is outside the reserve, but
rather more than half the land flooded is on
the reserve. Consequently a little more care
was required in negotiating the agreement

357

with respect to this particular site. The company generates there 37,400 horsepower. Under
the new arrangement the Dominion will receive annually $8,000 and the province $8,500.
That is, slightly more of the revenue goes to
the province than to the Dorinion. I would
again remind honourable members that the
revenues received by the federal authority
are entirely for the benefit of the Indian band
on the Stony reserve. These new rentals are
retroactive, and are a substantial increase on
the old rentals. Here the federal authority
issues the final licence, and the control thereafter is ieft to the province.
The agreement provides that at the expiration of the term of the existing licentes the
rentals cannot be changed without concurrent
agreements between the province - and the
Dominion. Certain provisions will operate in
the event of the properties being sold or
otherwise disposed of.
The other part of the agreement relates to
the disposition of the bird sanctuaries that I
mentioned earlier in my remarks. Many of
these have dried up or are otherwise unsuitable for the purposes for which they were'
originally set aside, and it is provided that
by agreement between the Minister of Mines
and Resources of Canada and the Minister
of Lands and Mines of Alberta, approved by
the Governor in Council and the Lieutenant
Governor in Council, respectively, certain of
these areas may revert to the Crown in the
right of the province and other areas may be
substituted for them. This is a very fair disposition of the matter.
I may add, honourable senators, that during my administration of the Department of
Mines and Resources we had frequent discussions with the province of Alberta on
these various points with a view to reaching
a settlement. I have no hesitation in saying
to the House that I believe this bill embodies
a fair settlement of all outstanding differences between the two governments. While
this is not part of the agreement, I may add
that I hope ere long the substantially increased revenues resulting from this arrangement may be utilized to secure for the
Indians of the Stony band some land which
will be of much more value to them than
what is included in their present reserve, which
as a matter of fact is very poor land.
Hon. Mr. F. W. GERSHAW: , Honourable
senators, the honourable member from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) has covered fully the
agreement with Alberta. However, I have a
few remarks to add.
A short time ago I brought to the attention of this honourable House the fact that
people in certain parts of Alberta were suf-

SENATE

358

fering from lack of water because streams,
sloughs and lakes were drying up. This condition bas become so severe that even the
bird sanctuaries are no longer suitable for
the purpose for which they were intended;
the :iougls and streams which provide water
for the ducks have completely dried up. It
is wisely provided that these reservations may
Le discontinued, and new areas set aside for
sanctuaries. The importance of sanctuaries
as an attraction to hunters and as a source of
livelihood to many people should net be

averlooked.

The honourable gentleman from Churchill
drew attention to the wretched condition under which the Indians of the Stony reserve live.
The provision of more iand for cultivation
and pasture will Le a great blessing to them.
On the consummation of these agreements the
Calgary Power Company will of course pay
more rental, but it will have sufficient power
te extend electrical services to vast farming
arcas. The provision of power to the outrying communities will serve te make farm
life more attractive, by enabling country
people to take advantage of modern facilities.
Farmers in Alberta will he delighted to have
tie opportunity of installing electrical equipnent.
I am in full accord with the sentiments expressed by the honourable gentleman from
Churchill.
J believe this bill will receive
general support and approval.
Honourable
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN:
senators, I an sure if my honourable colleague from High River (Hon. Mr. Riley)
were iere he would wish to express himself
on this measure. I know of no other man
in southern Alberta who is so great a friend
of the Stony Indians, who benefit through
this legislation. I have been in the honourable.
gentleman's home when chiefs of the tribe
lave comne to consult him about matters relating to the reserve, and personal probleims.
One of their greatest difficulties las been due
to the nature of the land upon which they
were settled. I believe the name by which
they are known, Stony Indians, must come
from the land upon which they live, for it
is composed mainly of gravel and stones.
The Stony Indian tribe raise a great many
cattle, and the continual grazing bas made
their land almost barren. From assurances
given in the other Chamber I think the intention is to provide more land for their
live stock. and so place these Indians in a
position where they can maintain themselves
better than they have been able to do it in
the past.
Hon.

Ir. GERSHAW.

I repeat, if my colleague from High Rivera very worthy member of this Chamber who
unfortunately does not enjoy the best of
health and is confined to his home-were here,
J am sure he would wish to express himself
on this measure.

Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Honourable senators,
perhaps the Chairman of the Divorce Conmittee would explain te the Senate why
twenty-nine cases were no-t proceeded with.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: My understanding
is that those twenty-nine cases are not absolutely disposed of. The petitioners were not
ready to prcueed, and the cases may come ip
for hearing next session.
Hon. WISHART
McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable stnators, with leave of the Senate,
I shouild like to say that whatever differences
of opinion there may be among honourable
senators as to the desirability of Parliament
being charged with the duty of dealing with
such matters as those referred to in the report
of the Divorce Committee, we are allof one
mind in expressing our keen appreciation of
the work donc by this committee uînder the
very capable leadership of the honourable
senator from West Central Saskatchewan.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: In addition to
honourable Senator Aseltine, the Chairman,
the Divorce Committee consists of following
honourable senators: Copp, Euler, Gershaw,
Haig, Howard, Sinclair, Stevenson and Taylor.
For the information of honourable senators
I may say that the main Divorce Committee
and the sub-committee devoted approximately
117 hours to the hearing of petitions. The
nature of this work is most exacting, for wlen
witnesses have been called it is absolutely
necessary that the committee function. This
makes it impossible for members of the committee to attend meetings of other committees
in vhich they may be very much interested.
The Senate owes a great debt of gratitude to
the honourable gentlemen who have performed the none too pleasant duty of carrying
on the work of the Divorce Committee, and I
should not like this opportunity to go by

DECEMBER 3, 1945
without saying how much I myself and, I am
sure, all other honourable members, appreciate the important contribution they have
made to the work of the Senate.
CANADA'S

SILVER SUPPLY

NOTICE OF INQUIRY

Hon. A. D. McRAE gave notice of the
following inquiry:
1. What amount of silver is being held in
Canada at present by the Dominion Government and by private companies, and for what
purpose is it proposed to be used?
2. How much new Canadian silver was used in
Canada during 1944 and 1945 for the minting
of coins, and what price was paid per ounce to
the producers?
3. What are the estimated requirements of
silver for minting of Canadian coins during 1946,
and what are the estimated requirements for
other purposes in Canada ,during 1946, and for
what purposes will it be used?
4. What reason is there for the sudden advance in Canadian consumption of silver during
the past year?
5. What are the names of corporations or individuals to whom licences to export silver have
been issued, with the amount of silver exported
under each licence last year and in 1945 up to
the latest date available?
6. What, if any, limit is imposed on silver
purchases by companies using silver in their
business?
7. Has any silver been sold in Canada to corporations or individuais not requiring silver in
their business-if so, to whom and how much?
8. According to Press reports the major silver
refineries will supply -approximately 50 per cent
of their output for 1946 for domestie requirements. Will this, plus one-half of the silver
by-product from the gold mines, provide sufficient for domestic requirements?
9. If the answer is no, then how is it proposed to give -the small silver producers the
export price for all their production as reported
in the Press?
10. What is the estimated silver production
for the year 1945?
He said: Honourable senators, the first four
of these questions are exactly the same as
those asked by the honourable senator from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) in his speech on
Thursday last.
PRIVATE BILL
REFUND OF FEES

Hon. Mr. BLAIS moved
That the Parliamentary fees paid upon Bill
W2, an Act to incorporate The Catholic Episcopal -Corporation of Whitehorse, be refunded to
Messrs. Milner, Steer Dyde and Company,
Barristers, Edmonton, Âlberta, solicitors for the
petitioner, less printing and translation costs.
He said: Honourable senators, this motion
requires no explanation, I believe, as the
refund of fees on a bill of this kind is in
conformity with regular practice.
The motion was agreed to.

WAR CHARITIES BILL

The CHAIRMAN: Honourable senators,
when the Committee rose we were dscussing
section 1. Shall the section carry?
Hon. J. W. de B. FARRIS: Honourable
senators, on Friday I moved that the Committee rise and report progress and ask leave
to sit again, in order that further consideration might be given to the question of th.e
constitutional validity of the bill. Honourable senators will recall that the honourable
gentleman from L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Leger)
raised the point that this bill was an invasion
of the provincial field of property and civil
rights, which comes under section 92, paragraph 13, of the British North America Act.
I think that the lawyer members of the House
in particular felt-I know I did-that once
this question was seriously raised it should
not be lightly passed over by the Senate. At
this time perhaps more than at any other
time we should be careful not to enact legislation that is clearly beyond the jurisdiction of
the Dominion. And there is special need to
be careful when we are dealing with the question of what is termed the residuum, or peace,
order and good government section of the
British North America Act, section 91. In the
cases that I am going to cite in a moment the
courts have held that this has to do with
statesrnanship, and they are reluctant to question the decision of Parliament that a certain
measure comes within this section. That rather
puts Parliament on its honour not to invoke
a mere pretence of national emergency in
order to acquire jurisdiction to pass an Act
under the peace, order and good government
section
During the week-end I have given as much
thought and study to this matter as time would
permit, and I have decided that I am going
te vote for the bill, although I shall do se
with a good deal of uncertainty. Perhaps
honourable senators would be willing to listen
to My review of the situation.
Some Hon. SEýTATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I hwve looked at the
question of how this bill could reasonably be
supported. The first point that occurs to
one is: Might it be supported under section

362

SENATE

91, paragraph 27, which gives the Dominion
jurisdiction in criminal law? Well, there are
some comparatively recent cases on that point.
The Proprietary Articles Trade Association case
was decided by the Privy Council in 1931,
and the case involving the amendment to
section 498(a) of the Criminal Code, which
was one of the cases having to do with what
was loosely termed the Bennett new deal
legislation, went over to the Privy Council
in 1937. Those two cases in my judgment
extended very widely the powers of the
Dominion to regulate by means of criminal
law. But of course the Privy Council never
acknowledged it as regulation, and the printiple was laid down that any time the Dominion sees fit to declare a certain offence a crime,
and to apply suitable penalties by fine or imprisonment, it then becomes a crime, whether
in the category of what previously was known
as criminal law or not. Howevcr much we
may doubt the soundness of that decision, unquestionably it is the law today.
But I do not think this case can come
within that decision, because looking at the
Act itself I would not consider that its
intention was to declare that the non-registration or the solicitation of non-registered funds
w-as a crime, but rather that its primary
object was to regulate war charities, the
penalty being prescribed merely to give force
and effect to the regulation, and not to declare
a new and substantive offence known as a
crime under the criminal law. Therefore, I
would conclude that this could not be supported as a matter of criminal law.
Let me come next to that question which
is always somewhat perplexing, what is termed
the residuum clause of section 91, which
declares that the Parliament of Canada may
make laws for the "peace, order and good
government of Canada." Honourable senators will recall that the section goes on
"for greater certainty," to enumerate twentyseven classes of subjects which are said not
"to restrict the generality" of the section.
Then at the foot of the section it is said
that any provision coming within one of
the twenty-seven enumerated classes of subjects "shall not be deemed to come within
the class of matters" assigned exclusively to
the provinces by section 92. As honourable
members will recall, there are sixteen classes
of subjects enumerated in section 92 which
specify the exclusive jurisdiction of the
provinces. Of course the most comprehensive
and the most important of those sixteen
headings is "property and civil rights".
Now, looking over the twenty-seven enumerated headings of section 91, it is clear that not
one of them would confer on the Dominion
Hon. Mr. FARRIS.

the powers undertaken to be exercised by this
Bill. So if the legislation is to be supported
in this particular, it must be under the general
words "peace, order and good government."
Those are the words on which the War
Measures Act was based, and they are the
basis of the important decision in Fort Frances
Pulp and Power Company versus Manitobai
Free Press, which will be found in 1923 Appeal
Cases. page 697. It will be also found in
Volume 2 of Cameron's Cases, page 303.
The judgment in that case decided two
things. First. that in a national emergency
sucli as a war the words "property and civil
rights" may acquire an entirely new meaning
extending beycnd the ordinary local meaning.
For example, my house is property, my right
to make a contract with my honourable friend
is a civil right. Ordinarily neither can be
interfered with by the Dominion.
In the Fort Frances case Lord Haldane sail
-and this is my own digest of the law that
Pe then laid down-that what is ordinarihv
regarded as "property and civil rights" in its
provincial aspects does in a national crisis,
such as war or a pestilence, take on new
aspects which are no longer provincial but
national and affect Canada as an entirety. Sa
that these classes of subjects fall within the
general powers of the Dominion to make laws
for the peace. order and good government of
Canada. That is the first proposition decided
there. that many subjects may cease to be
property or contracts in their ordinary sense.
For national purposes in a grave emergenev
they take on ncw aspects that could not b'
considered at all in peacetime, and so they
come within the peace, order and good government clause.
There was a second matter decided in that
case. in which, honourable menbers will reeilh
judgnent was handed down in 1923. It arose
over a dispute between the Paper Controller
and the companies quite a while subsequent
to the war. The question was. the war having
aîctially ended, did the national crisis contiinuer'
so as to continue juirisdiction in the Dominion.
Tiat case decided tiat a war emergency is.
not confined to the actual period of the war.
The post-war conditions may be sufficiently
grave to continue the emergency and consequent!y to extend the federal pow er.
That case stands alone. From 1867 down
to the present time in almost every other case
whPere the federal authorities sought jurisdiction on the ground of peace, order and good
government, it was refused by either the
Supreme Court of Canada or the Privy Council. Chief Justice Duff, in a decision that I
shall mention in a moment, has pointed out
that the Fort Frances case and Russell versus

DECEMBER 3, 1945
The Queen-the Scott Act case, generally
regarded by lawyers as rather doubtful laware the only two cases in which legislation
has been upheld under the general provision
of peace, order and good government.
I would. impress upon honourable senators
when they are considering for themselves how
they should decide this question, that it is not
every emergency which takes away provincial
jurisdiction, and it is not every so-called
emergency that confers jurisdiction on the,
Dominion. It is not every class of subject that
falls within the federal jurisdiction merely
because there is an emergency. That is what
they have to consider here.
The outstanding decision that clearly marks
the very important limitations to the right of
the Dominion to invade provincial powers
under the peace, order and good government
clause is that of Chief Justice Duif in what is
known as the .Natural Products Marketing
Act case. That again was a case concerning
one of the so-called Bennett new deal measures.
Chief Justice Duff gave judgment in the case
in 1936, and it will be found in the Supreme
Court Reports for that year at page 417.
When these cases went to the Privy Council
in 1937, it held that the judgment of Chief
Justice Duff in the Marketing Act case was
the last word on this subject. Lord Atkin said
it was the locus classicus, and would be the
guide for all future decisions in connection
with legislation on the powers of the Dominion
to be established undier the general rule of
peace, order and good government, where it
was sought to invade what normally under
peace, order and good government are the
powers of the provinces. It was in the Labour
Conventions case in the Privy Council in
1937, and reported in that year, that it was
stated by Lord Atkin that Chief Justice Duff's
decision was the locus classicus.
One must not read the Fort Frances case
alone. Many lawyers seem to have the idea
that, because of the wide language of Lord
Haldane in that case, anything can be donc
under the guise of wartime emergency for
peace, order and good government. For my
part, I am glad to go on record as saying that
in my opinion there are very very definite
limitations to that rule. The effect of the
decision in the Fort Frances case, taken as a
whole, together with judgment of Chief Justice
Duff, and Lord Atkin's strong endorsement
in the more recent case, is that the conditions
which can override the normal distribution of
powers under the B.N.A. Act must be very
drastie and exceptional.
Now let us apply the principle to the present
case. We have to consider both the original
Act and the amendment. The honourable

363

leader opposite suggested that if this amendment is bad the whole Act is bad. The honourable senator has perhaps not given as much
thought to the matter as I have, and I am
inclined to think that on closer study he will
agree with my suggestion that there are some
fundamental distinctions between the original
Act and this amendment.
The original Act was passed in 1939, second
session, Cþapter 10. Section 2 (b) of the Act
defines "War Charity Fund" as follows:
"War Charity Fund" means any fund having
for its objects or -among its objects the supplying of needs or comforts or the relief of suffering
or distress for the benefit of the personnel of
the armed forces of Canada or the families or
dependents of any of them or of any other
sufferers from the present warI have very little difficulty assimilating that
to the provision for the peace, order and good
government of Canada arising out of war
emergency; but, as a trick too often indulged
in by drafting officials, this clause is thrown in:
-"or any other charitable purpose connected
with the war."
I am not at all sure as to the validity of that
last clause. I would express the opinion, with
some hesitation however, that the general
clause as worded in the original Act would
come within what Lord Haldane described in
the Fort Frances case as a war necessity of
such comprehensive and national nature as to
affect the welfare and safety of the whole
community, and therefore giving jurisdiction
to the Dominion.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question? While that may
have been truc when the Act was passed, is it
true now? Could the original Act be passed
now?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I would be inclined to
say yes to that question, under the principle
of the second branch of the Fort Frances case,
where it is so clearly indicated that the regulations of the Paper Controller could last after the
war. The problems of dependents, of soldiers'
widows, of looking after those who have lost
the support of the head of the house-not
necessarily through death, but through broken
constitutions or war injuries-probably would
begin to show itself more after the war than
while the war was actually in progress. For
that reason, and because this Act and its
general provisions were subject to a condition
of national emergency during the war, I should
think they would continue to be equally
so for a reasonable time after the war was

over.
A question that comes up under the amendment perplexes me. I have written it down
and asked it of myself, and I think honour-

'364

SENATE

able senators might ask it of themselves. It
is this: "Has the class of subject, war memcrials-namely buildings or other structures
to commemorate the war-taken on such new
aspects because of the existing post-war
national emergency that regulation and control requires federal legislation for the safety
or welfare of the Dominion as a whole?" The
first answer I wrote down to that question
disposed of it completely in the negative. It
is as follows: "The special jurisdiction conferred on the Dominion under the peace, order
and good government, provided by section 91,
is no wider than the necessity on which it is
based. In other words, the rule of national
necessity sets up a new class of property and
civil rights only to the extent that the particular property and civil rights are within the
ambit of the necessity." Looking at it on the
basis of that test it would seem to me clear
that as te war memorials, no necessity exists,
and that these could not be regarded as a
subject of special legislation, coming within
the emergency.
I wish te deal next with two other aspects
of the case. The draftsman of the bill has
sauid:
"War Charity Fund" means any fond having
for its object or among its objects any purpose,
charitable or otherwise arising out of or connected with the warFrom that it would almost seem to have
been his idea that if you tad any object or
purpose relating to the war, that would settle
the question. The power would come out of Section 92 and go into Section 91, under peace,
order and good governrment, because of the
object or purposeHon. Mr. ASELTINE:
May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question? Does he
think that clause is wide enough as it now
stands to include the situation where a town or
village goes out to collect money for the
purpose of entertaining returned men fron
that district or giving them a prize or present
in the form of Victory Bonds or something of
that sort?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS:
I would prefer net
to answer the honourable gentleman's question,
for the moment at least. I would rather keep
to the general principle of the constitutional
question than go into some of the details. It
may well be, honourable senators, that the
general provisions of this Act are good; yet
some of the details may be bad. Honourable
senators will remember that decisions on that
question in the Supreme Court and in the
Privy Council have been that where you cen
separate the good frern the bad, the good will
remain. Lord Haldane said in one case the
Hon. Mr. FARRIS.

Act never could have been intended to pass in
its "truncated" form because so much had
been carved out of it.
If mv honourable friend does net mind, for
a moment I should like to discuss the broad
principle, even though some parts of it when
more carefully scrutinized, may not be in strict
accord with the principle I am enunciating.
First, let me look at this question from the
standpoint of a certain class of war memorial
suggested, namely, buildings and structures.
There is clearly no need for them to be looked
after from a national standpoint by reason of
an emergency or calamity. The next thing is
the question of object or purpose of the legislation. Can the tact that the legislation is
said to have a war object confer jurisdiction?
That brings to my mind one of the appeals
to the Privy Council in the new deal legislation in connection with the labour conventiens of the Versailles Treaty. One of the
questions that came up in the Privy Council
was the power of the Dominion to implement
its treaty obligations by federal legislation
affecting matters in the provincial field. Honourable senators will recall that the labour
convention
connected with the Versailles
Treaty imposed certain obligations on Canada
as to tours of labour and other similar logislation, after Aie made terself a pafty te the
agreement. When the legislation was introduced
by the Bennett Government in 1934 or 1935,
it was suggested that Canada had an obligation to implement the treaty. Honourable
senators will recall that treaties in regard to
jurisdiction are divided into two distinct
branches. A treaty is made by the Crown on
the advice of the ministers. So his Majesty,
acting on the advice of Canadian ministers
apart from Parliament can make a treaty
binding on the nation. But the giving Of
effect to the treaty inside the nation, doiestically, is another question.
For instance,
His Majesty the King, on the advice of the
Canadian Government, could sign the Versailles Treaty and labour conventions; but the
legislation to give effect domestically to the
obligations undertaken by this treaty involve
a strictly provincial subject-matter, since it
comes within the property and civil rights
section of the British North America Act.
The contract that a man makes with tis
employer or that an employer makes with his
employee, as to hours of labour, is purely a
matter of civil right, and therefore one that
eould be dealt with by the provinces only.
The question was whether the Dominion could
pass the legislation as so-called treaty legislation. In the radio case a similar question
came up. There the argument was made
before the Privy Council-and it was pretty

DECEMBER 3, 1945
nearly accepted-tbat inasmucb as section 92
of the Britisb North America Act bas no provision respecting treaty legisiation, that subject must corne under the omnibus clause
covering peace, order and good governîent,
and he'nce be within the jurisdîction of the
Dominion.
But in the Labour Conventions case the
Privy Council rejected tbat theory and said
in effeet: "You are confusing objeot with
subject. The object of your legislation is the
implementation of a treaty, but that is not
a class of subject at ail. Your class of subject
is hours of labour. You cannot confuse an
object with tbe subject at wbich the abject
was directed." May I quote the, exact language
of the Privy Council in the Labour Conventions case? I arn reading from Plaxton's
Canadian Constitutional Decisions, page 302:
For the purposes of sections 91 and 92. that is
the distribution of legislative powers between
the Dominion and the Provinces, there is no
such thing as treaty Jegisiation as sueh. The
distribution is based on classes of subjects- and
as a treaty deals with a particular class oi subjects se will the legisia-tive power of performing
it be ascertaiaed. No one can doubt that thi
distribution is one of the most essential conditions, probably the most essential condition, in
the inter-provincial compact ta which 'the
British North Amnerica Act gives effect.
Applying that to the present case, I know of
no principle by wbicb you can acquire
federal jurisdiction by merely saying tbat tbe
object of tbe Act bas to do with war, any
more than you could bave acquired lurisdiction in the 'Labour Conventions case by
saying that the object was to implement a
treaty. That does not embrace a class of
subi ect; it embraces only a purpose or object,
and 'as such cannot confer federal jurisdîction.
So far I have pretty nearly argued myself
out of tbe vote I intend to give.
The only other ground I can see on whicb
this legislation can be supported-and I
advance this witb a great deal of hesitationis the ground that the legislation is necessarily
incidentai or ancillary. The first case in
which that came up is known as the Grand
Trunk case. An Act of the Dominion Parliament or an order of the Board of Railway
Commissioners, I have forgotten wicb-but
in either case it would be done by a federal
authority-prevented railway companies froma
contracting out, as it was termed; that is,
from making a contract with employees that
the companies would *not be liable for personal injuries. Naturally the argument was
raised: "You are invading the right of an
employee te contract with bis employer, and
tbe rigbt of an employer to, contract with
bis employee, which is purely a civil right,
and so within the jurisdiction of tbe prov-

365

inces." Bnt the Privy Council held that as
Parliament had exclusive jurisdiction over
interprovincial railways, a necessarily incidental power was tbe power to, deal with tbe
contracts of railway companies. So the legislation or order in that case was held to be
within federal jurisdiction as andillary.
The saine question came up in two otber
cases wbich 1 will mention. One was the
Ontario Liquor Act in 1896, and the other
was tbe case of Montreal vs. Montreal Street
Ilailways, which is known among lawyers as
the "tbrough traffic case". It is what was
said in those cases about ancillary legisiation
that is now bothering me. The Privy Council
said that tbe ancillary legislation principle
applied only wben tbe legislation was ancillary to an Act passed under one of the enumerated beads of section 91 of tbe British North
America Act. For instance, the power of the
Dominion to operate interprovincial railways
is expressly given in one of the enumerated
subsections of section 91. I bave not yet
found any case-tbere bas not been time for
me to study tbem ail but in, any event, I
feel sure there is no Privy Council casestating tbat this doctrine of ancillary legisiatien may be invo-ked where you are not relying on one of the twenty-nine paragraphs in
section 91, but where you are relying on the
peace, order and good government clause. The
only authority of wbich 1 know was expressed
by way of wbat we caîl a dictum. Honourable senators wbo are n<it lawyers may be
interested in- tbe distinction 'between a dictum and a decision. If tbe point involved
in tbe court's statement is necessary to the
deciding of the case, tben it is a decision or
basic autbority; but when sometbing is said
by tbe way and is not ne-cessarily involved ;n
tbe decision, that is a dictum. We have the
dicta in those two cases that the doctrine of
ancillary legislation does not apply unless the
primary legislation can be brougbt under a
specified head of section 91.
There is no question that jurisdiction for
tbe War Charities Act of 1939 is not given

by a specified paragraph of section 91, but,
if it is given at ail, it must be by tbe peace,
order a.nd good goverrnuent, clause. The more
I think of it the more strongly I believe tbat
if the courts are faced with this question, they
wilI decide tbat wbere you are legislating in. a
national emergency you are not going ta
split hairs any more. than you would wben
legislating un-der an enumerated head of section 91. If in legislation witb respect to railways the tail must go with the bide, as the
saying is, so that the jurisdiction ta legislate
with respect to railways will include jurisdictien to legislate with respect to tbe incidentaIs
of a contract between a railway and its em-

taken into account· when estimating his income
tax. On the other hand, I believe it is not
at all necessary to register at Ottawa a
charitable institution operating in an urban or
rural municipality. Thousands of people give
to all sorts of charitable institutions, and
they do not come under this law at all. So
it seems to me that if a small village proposed to layout a playground as a war memorial, nothing in this bill would prevent it
fron going ahead. On the other hand, if a
war memorial project is not approved and
registered as such, a person who subscribes to
it gets no deduction from his income tax.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: No. I think the law is
just the other way. If the amendment is
passed, then, before subscriptions for a war
nemorial are invited, application must be
made to the federal authorities for permission to collect; otherwise both the person
soliciting subscriptions and the donors are
subject to a fine.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSW : It is with some
trepidation that I venture into a discussion
between learned legal gentlemen who possess
a much greater knowledge of the law than I
can lay claim to. I must confess that on
some of these legal points I am not quite as
clear as I should like to be, but I have made
some inquiries in regard to them. To begin
with, I think the picture of a little municipality
having to submit to dictation by soie .great
organization in Ottawa is overdrawn. In fact,
the organization is so small that at the
moment the man charged with its administration is over in the Old Country inquiring
into one of the ramifications which extends to
Great Britain. By this amendment anything
in the nature of a war memorial, municipal
or otherwise, for which subscriptions are invited rather than voted, would have to be
registered in the same way as have the other
4,000 odd charitable funds started during
the war.
I have it in mind that no one here is, in
his own opinion, able to judge the merits of
particular proposals for local war memorials
and the wisdom of registering them. I am
advised that throughout Canada there are
Feventy-one citizen organizations to which the
official who receives the applications may
refer as to the wisdom or otherwise of registering a partioular war charity. That having
been done, no bona fide case encounters any
difficulty whatever. It may be asked, "Why
bother with it?" The answer is that these
citizen organizations as well as the Canadian
Chamber of Commerce have been insistently
requesting the department to bring appeals
for subscriptions to war memorials under the
47704-25

367

War Charities Act, since their experience
proves there is great scope for persons of no
very high standards to prey upon the public.
I am not in a position to discuss the constitutionality of the bill. I would assume
that any war memorial of a national or interprovincial scope could not be looked after
by a provincial association. I am ready to
admit that if any of the nine provinces decided to set up an organization to control a
provincial war charity, it could be controlled
as effectually as is possible under the present
set-up, perhaps even more so.
On the point of income tax deduction, I
am assured that income tax deductions under
the four classifications of charitable subscriptions are not made by virtue of the War
Charities Act. As the honourable senator
from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder) has pointed
out, there are many charities which do not
come under the Act but in respect of which
the Income Tax department allows a deduction. For instance, a contribution to a community chest fund, with respect to which anyone can apply for a deduction of income tax.
does not come under this amendiment. Probably there are dozens of other instances.
Nevertheless the income tax people say that
in determining the genuineness of a contribution to a war charity it is of great assistance
to them to be able to avail themselves of the
decision of the seventy-one citizen organizations distributed throughout Canada. If this
amendment were not passed the Income Tax
department might be prevented fron considering a contribution to a war memorial as
something which entitled the donor to deduction from income tax.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question. As I understand it, there are several classes of charity
mentioned in this bill, for example, the Red
Cross. Are contributions made to every one
of these charities deductible from income tax?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

Yes, every one.

Hon. Mr. CALDER. That is to say, if a
contribution is made to one of these charities
registered under the law it at once becomes
deductible from income tax. Is that correct?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes, it is. Apparently it has been the administrative policy of
the officials in the department up to the
present moment to unhesitatingly allow such
deductions.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: It applies to every
charity mentioned in the bill?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: To every one.

368

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Honourable senators,
I support this bill because I believe it
is the wish of those who go out collecting
subscriptions for war memorials to have such
projects registered at Ottawa. Registration
helps the canvasser and gives protection.
I am inclined to agree with the honourable
member for Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder) that
income tax deductions are of some importance,
but I do not think that feature is as important as the ability to say to a prospective
generous subscriber: "This project has been
registered and passed by the authorities at
Ottawa."
I think all honourable senators would
hesitate to subscribe to a fund for a war
memorial without some assurance or guarantee as to what was going to happen to the
funds.
Everyone knows that moneys are
collected for various funds, and frequently such
funds are carelessly audited. While I do not
wish to mention any community or city, I
recollect the case of a hockey club which
charged up $500 in one year to a fund to
sharpen skates. We all know that such things
happen, and we just smile at them.
The city of Kingston is now in the midst
of a campaign to raise $225,000 for the purpose of erecting a war memorial in the form
of a community centre. The total cost is to
be $325,000, and provided the public subscribe
$225,000 the city council are prepared to raise
the other $100,000. I am quite sure that the
committee in charge of that fund will be glad
to be able to go to large manufacturers and
other prospective subscribers in Kingston and
say that this project bas been registered in
Ottawa and is in accordance with the provisions of the War Charities Act.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: May I ask the
bonourable leader of the Government a question? Did his inquiry on this subject throw
any light on the question of the design of war
memorials? The suggestion was made in committee that it was undesirable to have a war
memorial committee centred in Ottawa controlling the designs to be adopted throughout
the country. I am curions to know if the
honourable leader has any information on
that point.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, if there are any persons with sufficient
knowledge to pass on the question of design,
I should like to find them. I have had great
difficulty finding anyone who can throw any
light on the question .whatsoever. It is my
personal impression that the type and style
of memorial to be erected is left almost entirely
to the judgment of the local citizens' comHlon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

mittee. The type of memorial and the extent
of the expenditure are left almost entirely
to the citizens in the community affected.
The income tax officials told me of one type
of war memorial under consideration for which,
if it were accepted by the War Charities
Committee, subscriptions could be ded-ucted
as far as income tax was concerned. The
Jewellers' Association proposed, as a war
memorial, to educate men in the delicate art
of watch repairing. Apparently decision as to
whether the plan would be accepted or not was
left for the most part to the local citizens
committee. I doubt if there are any restrictions at all on the type or form of war
memorial.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Honourable senators,
in view of the sample of war memorial we
have here in Ottawa, I am very glad to hear
the honourable leader make that statement.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Honourable senators,
what I have to say now will be very brief.
It seems to me th* under this legislation
the persons in charge of administration can
go very far indeed in the control of designs
and some other matters as well.
I was impressed by the remarks of my bonourable friend from Kingston (Hon. Mr.
Davies). In a case like the one he mentioned,
where a large sum of money like a quarter of
a million or a half a million dollars is to be
raised, there might bo some argument advanced
in support of this bill, particularly if the appeal
is broadcast over a large territory. But if the
people in a rural community in any part of
Canada, out of the goodness of their hearts
want to erect, for example, a small conmunity hall costing $4,000 or $5,000 as a
memorial to their young men, is it reasonable
that they should have te come te Ottawa and
ask permission to do se? Is it fair that such
a community should be asked to conform to
all the regulations that may be imposed by
the administration of the War Charities Act?
These are features that concern me.
On the basis of the argument made by the
honourable gentleman from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. Farris), it seems to me that such legislation as this would be found unconstitutional
if tested in the courts.
I do think that if a small community wishes
to spend a moderate amount of money, and
makes no widespread appeal, the necessity of
applying for permission and registering under
the Act would simply be an obstruction in
the way. I do not think it is reasonable to
put a small group of citizens to the trouble
of having someone write a letter of application for them, for which a fee would probably

DECEMBER 3, 1945
be charged, and ta require them ta confarmn
ta ail the regulations that may be intposed
by the administration in Ottawa.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honaurable senators, is it net a fact that if it were not
for the incorne tax feature there would be no
necessity for this bill? It is true is it not, as
has been suggested, that people in a srnail
comrnunity could build a war memorial hall
for 35,000 and nothing wouhd be heard about
it, and that the anly difficulty is that if it
were not an authorized war memorial thase
wha contribute $5 or $10 would be denied
relief ta that extent on their incarne tax?
According ta my understanding, that is all
there is ta the bill. This question would
neyer have came before us if it had nat beco
for the canvasser who goca out ta raise $5,000
for a war memorial fund, gives a receipt for
a srnall donation and tells the donor that to
that extent lie can get relief on his incarne
tax.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Honourable senators, I arn not very much concerned with the
constitutionality af the amendrnent ta the
Act, but I arn concerncd with the incarne tax
feature. This is rny reason:- I have been
asked ta contribute $100 ta a $5,000 fund
being raised for charitable purpases in a western cornmunity. If that project is not registered under the Act, and the cammunity is
not properly authurized ta colleut. the rnoney.
my contribution ai $100 ta the fund is gaing
ta cost me $200 or $300. That is ta say, 1
have ta ern $200 ar $300 befare I have 3100
exempt frorn tax. Therefore, as the honourable member frorn Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdack) has said, the incarne tax feature is very
important indeed.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Is there anything
else ta it?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I agree with practically everything said by the honourable
senatar frorn Kingstan (Han. Mr. Davies). I
think the angle lie otressed is very important.
because if a persan is asked ta give a big
danation and cannat dlaim deductian from
bis incarne tax, bis contribution is going ta
cost him a lot of money. As a matter of
fact, he wihh not contribute.
The CHAIRMAN: I do not think this bill
provides for exemptions from incarne tax.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: If the niemorial is
registered under this Act 1 think the Income
Tax departrnent, is obliged ta deduct the
contribution.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: There is a bird
sanctuary at Kingsville, Ontario. If you give
47704-25J

369

$10 to the sanctuary yau can deduet that

arnount from your incorne tax, the reason
being that the scherne is registered and permission has been gran'ted to canvass for funds
for maintendnce purposes.
Section 1 was agreed to.
Section 2 was agreed to.
The preamble and the titie were agreed ta.
The CHAIRMAN: Honourable senators,
shall I report the bill without amendrnent?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Honourable senators,
I move that the comrnittee risc and report
progress.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: We did that before.
The CHAIRMAN: I think, if I understand
the honourable senator, he is making a
motion.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: There was a motion
made that you report the bill, Mr. Chairman, and naw I arn moving in amendment
ta the motion that yau report progress.
flan. Mr. MURDOCK: And ask leave ta sit
again?
flan. Mr. LEGER: No.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Question!
The CHAIRMAN: You have heard the
motion af honourable Senator Leger that the
committee repart pragress. Shail the motion
carry?
Some Hon. SENATORS: No.
The CHAIRMAN: Ail in favour- af the
motion say "Aye."
Some Hon. SENATORS: Aye.
The CHAIRM AN: In my opinion the
motion is lest.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Vote!
Hon. Mr. DAVID- Honourable senators,
if it is true that one af the Senate's mast
important dutiee is ta pro tect aur Constitution. I think we should not accept hastily
the argument that this is merely a matter
that can be deait with under the incarne tax
law. The incarne tax is very unimpartant
compared with anything that would have even
the slightest bearing an aur Constitution. In
the past-I say this without, any reproach ta
governrnents--laws have been passed in a
speedy manner, and later declared unconstitutional or, at least, in the view of erninent
caunsel, of doubtful validity. I think the
honaurable gentleman wha just moved that
the cornmittee repart progress means that
hie would like ta study the speech made by
the honourable senatar from Vancouver South.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I ask a question?
Will you ask the honourable gentleman what
his motion means?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: If the motion carries, it
means that the bill is killed.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: I know very well that
in legislatures that kind of amendment is
often moved to the main motion when you
want to get rid of a bill. I would support
the honourable gentleman's amendment if he
would add the words "and ask leave to sit
again." It seems to me we should have a
little time to read the speech of the honourable senator from Vancouver South, which I
must say absolutely .convinced me that this
bill is unconstitutional, though as an eminent
lawyer he tried afterwards to convince himself that he was wrong. If the honourable
senator would accept my suggestion and make
his motion read, "That the Committee rise
and report progress. and ask leave to sit
again," I will second it.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: There was some discussion as to what this bill means. It is an
amendment to the War Charities Act, 1939.
Section 3 of that Act reads:
3. (1) It shall be an offence under this Act
(a) directly or indirectly to solicit or make any
appeal to the publie for donations or subscripLions in money or in kind for any war charity
fund, or to raise or attempt to raise money for
any war charity fund by promoting or conducting any bazaar, sale, entertainment or exhibition, or by soliciting for -advertising or by any
other means, unless the war charity fund is
registered under this Act.
If a war charity fund is made to include a
fund for the erection, construction, acquisition,
development or maintenance of a war memorial, you will not be able to make any move
towards raising money for a war memorial
unless you register under the Act. To me
that is just as plain as A B C. The only
exemption is in subsection 2 of section 3:
This section shall not apply to any collection
at Divine Service in a place of public worship.
I certainly am opposed to passing this bill
and putting it on our Statute Books.
Hon. Mr. HARDY:

What is the motion.

Hon. Mr. DAVID: I said that if the honourable senator would amend his own motion
to read "That the Committee rise and report
progress and ask leave to sit again," I would
have no objection. The honourable gentleman's motion, as it is, would mean the killing
of the bill.
The Bill was reported, without amendment.
Hon. Mr. DAVID.

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

TRUST COMPANIES

BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill P7, an Act to amend the Trust
Companies Act.
He said:
Honourable senators, I have
asked the honourable gentleman from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) to explain
this bill.
Hon. J. W. de B. FARRIS: Honourable
senators, this bill is rather technical. It is
supported by Mr. Finlayson, the Superintendent of Insurance. In section 3 of the
Trust Companies Act, in the revised statutes
of 1927, there was an obvious error. Subsection
3 of section 3 of the Act read as follows:
The provisions of sections 15 (d), 32, 34, 42
to 48, both inclusive, 62 to 88, both inclusive,
and 83 to 90, both inclusive, hereof, shall apply
to every trust company incorporated by Act of
Parliament of Canada before the twelfth day of
June, one thousand, nine hundred -and fourteen
Honourable senators will observe that there
was an overlapping.
It
was apparently
intended to say "62 to 81". I understand from
Mr. Finlayson that because of the ambiguity
in that wording the department has always
been uncertain whether section 81 of the Act
applied to the old companies or not. This
amendment bas relation only to Trust Companies that were incorporated before 1914.
Personally, I do net sec just why Mr.
Finlayson is worrying about the point, because
it seems to me that if you have a thing in
twice it is not less valid than if it is in only
once. However, for some years the department
has proceeded on the assumption that the legislation was defective and that trust companies
incorporated prior to 1914 did net get the
benefit of section 81.
It is now proposed to make clear by this
amendment that section 82 of the trust Companies Act is not applicable to old companies.
As that section deals with the organization of
companies, it quite obviously was intended
to apply only te new companies.
Section 2 of the bill repeals subsection 3
of section 81> of the Act and, re-enacts subsection 3 of the 1927 amendment.

371

DECEMBER 3, 1ý45
Honourable members will find at the bottom of the right-hand page the old subsection
3. It reads:
Any provision in any special Act or elsewhere
conferring upon any company -any other or wider
powers of loaning or investmnent or iiposing
any other restriction upon such power ot laning or investment than those conferred or imposed by this Act, is hereby repealed.
In 1927 a standard set of powers was set
up, and only new companies had the benefit
of that standard.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:

Right.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: So the old companies
found themselves handicapped. There was a
provision in nearly all the Acta of Incorporation of these companies--I have a sample
here of the Sterling Trust Company-making
applicable the former Companies Clauses Act
or Part II of the Companies Act, which stated
that no company should loan any of its
funds to a shareholder. Old subsection 3
took away the extra powers, but it did nlot
take away this limitation. As a result, while
ail modem companies can lend money to
their own shareholders under the supervision
and control set forth ini the Trust Companies
Act, these earlier companies neyer had tbat
power, although it was clearly intended that
they should have it. AUl this amendment does
is to put the old companies in exactly the
same position as companies incorporated since
1914.
I may say that in my opinion the dzraftsmanship of new section 3 is poor, and if the
bill goes to committee I am going te move
that certain words be struck out. The amendas follows:
ing clause now re
The loaning and investment powers of a
trust company shall be determined by reference
exclusively to the, provisions of this Act.
You neyer determine powers hy reference to
the Act, you ascertain them.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I am entirely in faveur
of this bill. Would the honourable gentleman
be s&tisfied to refer it te Committee of the
Whole and dispose of it now?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Certainly.

THE IMMIGRATION ACT~
MOTION WITHDRAWN

Hon. ARTHUJR W. ROEBUCK rose in
accordance with the following notice:
That the Committee on Immigration and
Labour be authorized to inquire into -the operation and administration of the Immigration Act
(RiS.C. Chap. 93 and ýamendments) and the
circumstances and conditions relatingthereto.
And ýthat the said eommittee have power to
sen-d for perrons, papers and records.
He said: As ail honourable senators realize,
many phases of the subject of this motion are
of great interest to a large number of people
and of vast importance to the present and
future of Canada. Some of them. are contentious and of such a nature that people will,
quite rightly, differ in their opinions about
them. However, as this notice has drawn
public attention to the fact th.at the Senate
will be making an inquiry, and as the session
is drawing to a close-it has been intimated
that probably we will prorogue next weekand it will be quite impossible for the coinmittee to give this important matter the
attention it deserves, I should like to withdraw the motion. In taking thîs action I do
se with the stated intention of re-moving the
motion in the early part of the next session.
The motion was withdrawn.

BUSINESS

OF THE SENATE

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, before the Orders of the Day are called,
may I say for the information of honourable
senators that there is very little business to
come before the House today. Therefore,
with the approval of honourable senators, the
House will adjourn early so that the Special
Committee on the Income War Tax Act will
have an opportunity to continue with the
evidence of witnesses who are now waiting to
be heard.
Tomorrow morning three committees will
meet: the Standing Committees on Railways,
Telegraphs and Harbours and on Forestry and
Agriculture and the Special Committee appointed to consider the constitution and funetions of Senate committees. Tomorrow afternoon, if honourable members approve, I am
going to move that the Senate adjourn until
Thursday evening in order that the Committee on Com.merce and Trade Relations may
hear two very important witnesses who are to
come before it on Thursday aftcinoon. The
subjects to be discussed are the Bretton
Woods Agreement and the whole question of
the trade which will arise in due course under
the Export Credits Insurance Act. This
promises to be a very interesting meeting,
and every honourable senator is invited to
attend. I am sure it will facilitate matters
to adjourn our session tomorrow until Thursday evening.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The Banking and Commerce Committee is to meet on Thursday

INCOME AND EXCESS PROFITS
TAXATION
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. W. D. EULER presented and moved
concurrence in the third report of the Special
Committee appointed to examine into the
provisions and workings of the Income War
Tax Act and the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940,
as follows:
Your committee recommend,1. That the quorum of the Committee be re.duced to five members.
2. That the life of the Committee b continued
.and that it be authorized to hold meetings and
hear witnesses during the recess of Parliament.
3. That the Committee be authorized to adjourn from place to place.
4. That :the order of reference of the Senate
dated October 24, 1945, to the Special Committee appointed to examine into the provisions and
workings of the Income War Tax Act be
amended by adding, after the word "thereunder,"
in the last line of the first paragraph thereof,
the following words:"and the provisions of the said Act by redrafting thern, if necessa'ry;"
and further, by striking out the word "and"
after word "assessment," in the fourth line of
the first paragraph thereof, and substituting
a comma in lieu thercof.
Tise Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall the
report be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, some questions have been put to me
about certain aspects of this matter, and I
should like to have the report stand for a
day. Perhaps a further explanation might be
made either now or tomorrow as to where
the contemplated meetings of the committee
are likely to be held. I am asking for this
information on behalf of other honourable
members.
Hon. Mr. EULER: If I am in order, bonourable senators, I may say it is not likely
that any meetings will be held-or at least
not more than one or two. The committee
had in mind the fact that there is a great

373

DECEMBER 5, 1945
deal of evidence to be heard and considered,
and the thought was that if we desired Vo
make recommendations in time for them to
be implemenited ini the next budget we, should
h-old meetings i the interval between sessions.
Otherwise, any action upon these recoinmendations miglit have to be postponed until
1947. Our whole thought was ta have the
recommendations forrnulated in turne to receive consideration before the next budget is
brought down.
The Hoa. the SPEAKER: Unless there is
unanîmous consent, the report will have ta
stand.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I should like ta, see the
report concurred i.
Hon,. Mr. HAIG: I want to support what
hias been said by the honourable chairman of
the committe-e (Hon. Mr. Euler). Sorne question bas been raised as ta whether the Senate
can authorize a committea ta sit aiter Parliament bas prorogued. If we are willing that
the cornmittee sh-ould sit, no difficulty could
arise over the matter unless the committee
were ta send for papers or documents and
some persan should refuse Vo camply. The
explanation af the desire for authority to,
travel froin place ta place is that the small
sub-oomrnittee miglit want to pay a visit af
inspection ýta the incarne tax offices at Mon-treal or Toronto, which are the largest incarne
tax offices in the country.
The committee is cager ta start its meetings agail when the new session begins. If
in the interval meetings have been field, and
the varions representations made have been
reported ini shorthand and printed, the coinrnittee as a whole wonld be able ta stndy
theni properl3i and bring in a report early
next session. I assume, of course, the coinmittee will be reappointed. The report then
could probably be made i tirne ta be considered by the Minister of Finance before he
introduces bis budget.
Honourable members shonld remember that
the cornmittee is noV trying ta tell the Goverament what policy sbould be adopted. The
airn is simply ta, try ta suggest improvements
in the machinery af collecting tbe incarne tax.
No harm wonld be dane by allowing the
report that lias just been brought in ta stand
until to-marrow, but I sbould like ta see the
House consider it at an early date i order
that appointinents may be made for meetings. The Incarne Tax Payers Association
of Canada bas written reqnesting an appointment for next Tuesday, and the Canadian
Bar Association would also like ta be heard
then. If we decide ta meet between sessions,
publicity would be given ta that fact, and I

bave no doubt other organizatians would
write in ta, say that they wanted ta, be beard.
I arn confident that five members of the
cammittee could be gat together Vo hold meetings between sessions, and in that way probahly a mantb's work conld be saved next
session.
I may say that a very able legal adviser will
belp the comrnittee. I would urge that ternorrow we be prepared ta deal wîth the
report s0 that the committee may make
progress during the recess.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: In reference ta the
report af the Committee an Incarne Tax
and Excess Profits Tax, presented by the
hononrable senator.froin Waterloo MHan. Mr.
Euler)-and may the motion ai the honourable leader opposite stand-I would cite Rule
533 of Beauchesne's Parliarnentary Rules and
Forrns, wbich is as follows:
533. Coimmittees may be authorized by the
Hanse ta adjourn fromn place ta place as may
be found expedient-or meet at a particular
place, but ne committee can ait after -a prorogation. B.467.
.In. 1873, a select cammittee was appointed. te
inquire into certain niatters relating ta the
-Canadian Pacific Railway with ipower to oit
after the prorogation; but on close examinatian, it was fonnd and agreed by -the leaders
of the Hanse that this procedure was net
regular. Sir John A . Macdonald, addressing the
Hanse on the subject, on the 3rd November,
1873, said: "On consideration we found that
this Hanse conld net confer Vthe power (toa it
,after prorogation) and for a very substantial
reason, because if this Parliament could appoint
-a eamniittee te sit dnring the recess it conld
.also appoint a Committee of the Whale Hýouse
ta sit during the ýrecess, and thus the prerogative
ai the iCrown ta pTarogne wonld be invaded,
and Parliarnent as -a Committee of the Whoee
miglit ait indefinitey." It waa then arranged
that the Hanse ehould take a long adjounuxent
se as ta enable the commnittee te complete its
investigation and frame itS report.
I tbink this provision is quite final, and
speaks for itself.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I did flot make a motion.
The report stands.

.375

Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Honourable senators,
I was about to ask if we could .have some
explanation of the amendments. This bill
was considered the other day and was sent to
committee. From the report I judge that there
have been several amendments made, and
personally I should like to have some idea as
to whether they make any serious change in
the bill or are merely formal amendments.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: Perhaps the honourable gentleman did not hear what I said
when I presented the report. In the opinion
of the committee the amendments do not
affect the principle of the bill. They were
made on the advice of the Law Clerk of the
Senate with the object of improving the form
of the bill.
If honourable
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
members would permit me, I could briefly
state what the suggested amendments are.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK:

Yes, go ahead.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: They are very
simple, as I think honourable members will
agree, if they have a copy of the bill before
them. I will just read the amendments:
Page 1, line 4. For Sugar" substitute "Products."
Page 1, line 8. For "deterioration" substitute
"deteriorated."
Page 1, line 13. For "article" substitute "eubstance."
Page 2, line 19. Leave out the word 'with."
Page 2, line 19. For "artifieally" substitute
"art-ificially."
Page 3, lines 31 to 35, both inclusive. For
clause 8 substitute the following:
S. Any person who, or whose agent or employee, wrongfully removes or selle or otherwise
disposes of any product or substance which has
been seized by an inspector under authority of
paragraph (c) of section seven or substitutes
anything therefor shall be guilty of an offence
under this Act.
Through a typographical error the original
clause referred to subsection 3 of section 7,
instead of (c) of section 7.
The last amendment is:
Page 6, line 14. For "analysts" substitute
"analyses."
These changes were made by the committee
after consultation with the Law Clerk of the
Senate, and have been acquiesced in by the
department. As was said by the honourable
Chairman of the Committee (Hon. Mr. Donnelly), they are intended to improve the form,
and in no way affect the principle of the bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.

INTERNATIONAL CIVIL AVIATIONINTERIM AGREEMENT
RESOLUTION OF APPROVAL

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON
moved:
That it be Resolved,-That it is expedient
that the Houses of Parliament do approve the
Interim Agreement on International Civil Avi!a-

tion signed by Canada on 7th December, 1944,
tabled on 11th September, 1945; the Convention
on International Civil Aviation signed by Canad-a on 7th December, 1944, tabled on 1lth ,September, 1945, and the International Air Services
Transit Agreement signed by 'Canada on 10th
February, 1945, tabled on 11th September, 1945;
and that this House do approve the same.
He said: Honourable senators. I would ask
the honourable gentleman from Toronto (Hon.

Mr. Campbell) to speak on this resolution.
Hon.

Mr. ROBERTSON.

Hon.

G.

P. CAMPBELL:

Honourable

senators, a resolution in the same form as this

has been passed by the other House. The
purpose of the resolution is to obtain the

Senate's approval of the agreements necessary

to carry out certain provisions in the convention that was recently entered into at Chicago,
and also to obtain approval of the convention

itself.
Before specific

reference

is made to the

agreements and the convention, honourable
members may find it interesting to know something of Canada's contribution to the preparation of the convention at Chicago. Back in 1942
the Canadian Government felt that in the near
future all nations should be called together to
study international air transportation problems.
Departmental officials were instructed at that
time to collect data and information respecting
air traffic and matters pertaining to civil air
navigation problems throughout the world. A
great deal of information was obtained, and
in 1943 the Prime Minister presented- to Parliament a statement of the broad lines of the
Government's policy with respect to international civil aviation.
The Government continued to study the
subject, and invited other countries, particularly the United ICingdom and the United
States, to cal] a conference of all nations for
the purpose of dealing with this important
question before the cessation of hostilities. It

was felt that Canada had an extremely important part to play in the development of postwar international aviation. It was also felt
that prior to the war a great deal had been
learned about the subject by other countries,
and that this information could be made
available at a conference. so that some gen,
eral programme and policy could be formulated for the development of international air

transportation.

Honourable

senators

may

recall that before the war there were no
nultilateral agreements in effect, and each
country had to make special arrangements
for the operatidn of its planes over another
country.
This resulted in many cases of
hard bargaining. particularly among European
countries, and developed what may be termed
unrestricted competition in international air
transportation.

In 1944 the

Minister of Munitions and

Supply, then in charge of the programme
being worked out, tabled a draft convention
in the other House. Later this was revised,
and became the basis for discussion at the
Chicago conference in November of that year.
I feel that our citizens can take pride from
the fact that of all the countries assembled
at that conference Canada was the best prepared and probably the best represented. This

DECEMBER 5, 1945
is pretty well demonstrated by the fact that
of all the formal documents and proposals
brought forward Canada's draft convention
was adopted as the basis for discussion.
While the conference did not meet with
the entire success that had been hoped for, a
very substantial step forward was taken, and,
there was established the framework of an
international organization charged with the
responsibility of continuing studies and cooperating with all countries who are parties
to an interim agreement. Within the next
two or three years a further conference is to
be called, and it is hoped that the problems
remaining over from the Chicago conference
may then be solved in a satisfactory manner.
The documents before the Senate for
approval consist of: 1. An interim agreement
on international civil aviation, signed by
Canada on December 7, 1944. This agreement
has been tabled and will be found in pamphlet
form in treaty series 1944 No. 36. The agreement established a body to be known as the
Civil Aviation
International
Provisional
Organization, sometimes called PICAO. The
structure of this organization consists of (1)
an interim assembly, composed of representatives of all the member countries, and meeting annually; and (2) an interim council of
twenty-one members elected by the assembly
at its annual meetings. Canada was again
honoured by the choice of Montreal as first
seat of the organization.
The council is constantly in session in
Montréal. It receives reports from membercountries and has power to set up technical
and other organizations to conduct inquiries
and collect facts relating to the development
of civil aviation.
The interim agreement, which is intended to
be the framework of a more permanent agreement, sets up an organization that is substantially the same as the proposed permanent
organization which is to be formed within
three years of the coming into force of the
interim agreement. The permanent agreement
will contain provisions for the enforcement of
orders by a court and for appeals to an international court. This I will deal with later.
The organization set up under the interim
agreement is now functioning.
The important document is the convention
itself, because it embodies all the principles
agreed upon between the member-countries.
It will be found in the same treaty series No.
36 to which I have already referred. The
convention, divided into several parts, deals
with certain principles, one of the most important being the preservation of the sovereign
rights of the member-countries. Each membercountry is accorded the right to fly its planes
47704-26J

377

over the territory of other member-countries;
but to each country is reserved the right to
designate routes, prescribe safety regulations,
and so on within its own boundaries. Provision is also made for registration of planes,
display markers, and all other matters relating
to aviation. These provisions are in some
respects similar to those which apply to
vessels operating in international waters; that
is, planes must be registered, must carry
certain papers, and must keep a log. In.
short, the regulations and conditions laid down
are made as universal as possible, but a
plane flying over the territory of another
country must at all times comply with the
regulations of that country.
One important provision under the convention deals with the inability of any state to
provide the facilities and landing fields which
may be required to ensure safe and efficient
operation of planes. Contributions may be
made by the organization to this end.
The convention further provides for the
International Civil Aviation Organization.
This is the permanent organiza;ion already
mentioned, which is to be formed within three
years from the date of the interim agreement.
Like the present organization, it is to have an
assembly and a council. The articles of
agreement are set out in full in the treaty to
which I have referred. I think it is unnecessary to refer to any particular item, but I
would point out that the articles contain
enforcement provisions, so that when a dispute arises between any two members it
may be decided upon by the council. If
necessary, an appeal may be taken to an
arbitrator to be agreed upon by the two
members or to be appoitited by the council.
If necessary, there may be an appeal to the
International Court.
This convention has been signed by, I
think, fifty-two nations, and will become
operative when passed by Parliament.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: May I ask the
honourable gentleman to name the countries
that are not signatories to this agreement?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I am not prepared
at the moment to give names of all the
countries.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Just the better
known ones.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I might say that
Russia is one of the major countries which
lias not yet signed. The complete information can be obtained if the honourable
senator desires it.

378
Hon.
right.

SENATE
Mr. BALLANTYNE:

That is all

Hon. 'Mr. CAMPBELL:
Another agreement signed at Chicago was the International
Air Services Transit Agreement, which provides for two freedoms. It was hoped that
some provision could be made whereby a
unilateral agreement could be arrived at
between countries to permit a plane to fly
over a certain country, pick up passengers
and carry them to another country. For
instance, a plane travelling from Canada to
France might be permitted to take on passengers in Canada, Newfoundland and England,
and carry them to France. However, the
representatives of the countries assembled
were unable to come to terms. The only
agreement reached at the Chicago Conference
was for the two freedoms. Under the International Air Transport Agreement each contracting State grants to the other contracting
States: 1, the privilege of flying across its
territory without landing; and, 2, the privilege
of landing for non-traffic purposes. In other
words, it is now possible for planes going
from one point in Canada to another to
fly over any part of the United States, and
to land in that country for servicing without
further permission; but they are net permitted to pick up passengers in the United
States.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE:
allowed te take on freight.

Nor

are

they

Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: That is correct.
They are not permitted to carry traffic of any
kind. It is left to the various countries to
negotiate bilateral agreements on such questions. Canada bas already negotiated an
agreement with the United States. The negotiation of an agreement with Great Britain to
permit the taking of passengers from Canada
to that country, and the picking up of passengers there and bringing them back to Canada, is under way.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: That same restriction applies, does it net, to boats engaged in
coastal shipping?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Yes.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I recall that on
one occasion when I was in Alaska, boats were
not allowed to take on passengers under simi.
lar circumstances.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: That applies te
vesseis trading coastwise. That is to say, a
boat sailing from one Canadian port to
another may call at an American port en
route, but se may net pick up passengers
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL.

or freight there. On the other hand, a boat
travelling from a Canadian port to an American port may carry passengers or freight to
and from either country. It was hoped that
a similar ararngement could be made with
all the countries represented at the Chicago
Conference. However, such an agreement was
not effected.
If honourable senators are interested in the
terms of the International Air Transport
Agreement, they will find it at page 60 of
the Treaty Series. The five freedoms sought
by Canada and some of the other countries
represented at the Chicago Conference were
as follows:
1. The privilege to fly across its territory
without landing.
2. The privilege to land for non-traffic purposes.
3. The privilege to put down passengers, mail
and cargo taken on in the territory of the State
whose nationality the aircraft possesses.
4. The privilege to take on passengers, mail
and cargo destined for the territory of the
State whose nationality the aireraft possesses.
5. The privilege to take on passengers, mail
and cargo destined for the territory of any other
contracting State and the privilege to put down
passengers, mail and ýcargo coming from -any
such terr:itory.
The first two
freedoms were
agreed
upon, but the other three remain unsettled. It
is necessary that individual states bargain for
these privileges as they wish to obtain them.
I do net think I need take the time of
this honourable House to further discuss the
details of the many provisions contained in
the convention. In conclusion I may say that
it has been the policy of those in charge of
Canada's air programme to keep pressing for
multilateral
agreements,
or
agreements
between nations which would enable them to
retain in peace-time the spirit of good will and
co-operation that was enjoyed during the
period of war.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

The motion was agreed te.
GOLD PRODUCTION IN CANADA
DISCUSSION

The Senate resumed from Thursday, November 29, the adjourned debate on the notice of
Hon. Mr. McRae:
That he will call the attention of the Senate
to the development of our gold resources and
what an active programme to increase our gold
production could mean to the general prosperity
of Canada, particularly the empl-oyment of
labour, the establishment of new communities
and the importance of the gold which it will
provide in taking care of our foreign obligations.

SENATE

Let us try and develop that, and, if we can,
prove it. What has caused many wars of years
gone by? We are proud to be living in Canada,
a country of about twelve million people and
having 444,000 more square miles of territory
than has our great neighbour to the south,
with a population of about 135 millions.
How is it that one of these two nations is,
unfortunately, not still a part of the great
British Emrpire? What caused the separation? Let us read from the encyclopedia:
Boston Tea Party
When repealing the Townsend Act, the British
Parliament had continued the tax on tea, partly
as a symbol of their right to tax the colonies,
and partly to aid the financially embarraassed
East Indies Tea Company.
Patriots in America were certain that no tea
should reach the consignee in America. At New
York and Philadelphia the tea ships were permitted to return home with their cargoes intact.
At Charleston, Mass., officials seized the tea and
held it in government warehouses. In Boston,
Governor Hutchinson would not allow the tea
ships their clearance papers to return, and so
the patriots, ýdisguised -as Indians, boarded the
ships after dark on December 16, 1773, opened
the cases and threw the tea into the harbour,
and thus commenced a war that divided the
North American Continent into the United
States and Canada.
Money! Goldi There was no other cause,
except that in the vicinity of Boston there
were a number of so-called patriots from overseas who had lived in the Mother Country in
a condition that they considered unfair and
unjust, and who were only too eager to have
sorne reason for retaliating against Great
Britain. That is what caused the separation,
and made Canada and the United States two
distinct countries.
That was back in 1773. Let us come a little
further on. What about the South African
War? That was caused by gold and money.
Let us read again from the encyclopedia:
South African War 1899-1902
The Boers resented the influx of miners and
prospectors following the discovery of gold in
1886 and they refused the Uitlanders adequate
political rights.

men, lost 5,000. The Boer army, with 366,000
men, lost 3,700.
The real cause of the two wars mentioned
in those brief references was gold, money.
But let us come down to present-day conditions. The other day in a committee-I
think it was the Banking and Commerce
friend
from
honourable
Committee-my
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) made a statement that I thought was not only correct but
very opportune. He said:
We are out of the war now, at least for the
time being.
That we are out of the war, is self evident,
and my personal judgment is that we are out
only for the time being. Every day we hear
over the radio and read in the papers that
war is continuing in different parts of the
world. What for? I do not think it can be
shown that the underlying cause in any one
of these cases is not the effort of human
beings to get some of the wherewithal to live
more decently or happily with their fellows.
Let us refer for a few moments to the
second Great War and discuss what horrified
us all around 1934-35. I am sure that in
those days we all were horrified when we read
in the papers about the position that the madman of Germany was taking with respect to
the Jews. We all know that no people in
the world work harder or are more loyal to
their own interests and zealous to secure a
competence, the means to live and carry on.
What was the underlying intent of the madman of Germany? Is it not reasonable to
assume that he was bent on the annihilation
of the Jews and the confiscation of their
wealth? Why? Because it was known the
world over, and particularly in Germany, that
the Jews individually and collectively had
substantial nest eggs laid away.
Let us go a little further. Press reports from
a neighbouring capital have for several months
kept us informed of important negotiations
between British and United States representatives. The Globe of Monday last contained
a dispatch from Washington, headed: "Special
meeting on British loan lasts six hours." This
is the concluding paragraph:
A few more days will tell the story of three
months of negotiations-complete success or
final failure. The point et issue-with all the
cards on the table-is British concessions for
which the Americans are calling as conditional
to the loan. The most important now under
discussion are reduction of British import and
exchange controls and release of blocked sterling.
In other words, the proposal, if our intelligence is at all reliable, is to keep the British
pound at $4.04 or even lower, and so far as
possible to crowd the British Empire from
the markets of the world in order that the
United States may monopolize them.
I am sorry that my friend from Lethbridge
(Hon. Mr. Buchanan) is not in his seat, because the Ottawa Journal of yesterday contains a short quotation from the Lethbridge
Herald as follows.
Politicians all across the line are trying to
prove that Cordell Hull started the war with
Japan.

is an investigation going on ini aur neighbouring capital as to the reasons for the Pearl

told the real cause. We shall not be told
that the Japanese representatives were trying
b y every means at their commnand ta evade
payment of their maney, at a discount of four
or five times the value of the American dollar,
for scrap iran and other commodities that had
been shipped ta Japan in the preceding three
or four ycars. In my humble judgment
money was the cause of the war between
Japan and the United States.
A great deal more might be said i this
connection. I had h'oped -that at some time

which was intraduced an the 23rd af Octaber,

biblical -quotatian I made a littie while ago as
the root of ýail cvii. It has been the cause of
ail the wars in days gone by. I only went
back ta 1773, but I could prove ta honaurable
members that hundreds af years befare that
money was the cause af numerous wars. In
my humble judgment the honourable senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) was absolutely right the other day when he said, "The
war is over for the time bcing." We are
going ta have another war. Money will be
the cause of it, in anc man's .iudgment, because
as individuals and hum-an beings we have
grown up ta believe that it is consistent and
logical and proper for us by every means at
hand ta get a reasonable competence in gold
or its equivalent in money. Money is the
cauêe of ail the present-day hold-ups, and of
aIl the shootings and other tragic circumstances
connected therewith.
I have spoken for only twenîty-five minutes,
but I could continue a great deal longer and
cite many other circuatances in support af
my contention. However, I should prefer ta
have someane tell me, whether gold, that i8,

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yesterday, in
order ta provide apportunity for a meeting
of the Committee on Commerce and Trade
Relations on Thursday, I suggested that at
the conclusion of aur business taday we might
adjouruv until tornorrow night at 8 p.m. It
has, howcver, been poînted out to me that
it might convenience some honourable senators to meet tomorrow at 3 p.m. and later
adjourn during pleasure, to reassemble at, 8
o'clock at the caîl of the bell.
With that explanation, hon-ourable senators,
I move that the House do now adjourn.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I take it from
the honourable leader's remarks that the
Senate will be sitting on Friday?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Sa far as the immediate business before us is concerned, I
must say frankly that I know of no particular
reason for a Friday sitting. I had thought
that in the event of an uneLpected burst of
activity in another place, wc might faciitate
the closing of the session by sitting on Friday;
but we have pretty well cleancd up our business, and unless somcthing unforeseen develops
I shail move tomarrow night that the Senate
adjourn untîl Moncfay.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I thought that
aftcr the cammîttce had reported Bill 173
rcspecting the Departmcnt of Reconstruction
and Supply, it would be ready for our consideration and we might sit on Friday ta
deal wîth it. But I amn not asking that we
do sit. Am I ta understand that -the debate
will flot procecd tomorrow on Bill 173?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It will depend
largely upan what action the committec take.
Should they report -the bill tormorrow evenýing, I see no reason why it should not then
be discussed. I have endeavoured ta ascertain what likelihood. there is of the session
terminating towards the middle of next wcek,
and my present information la that the other
Huse wili not have finishcd its business before the end of next week. This being the
case, I sec no particular reason why the
Senate should meet on Friday.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I think tornorrow we
cauld safely adjourn until Monday. The bill
now before the other House is still under
discussion on the motiion for second reading,

its being disposed af in short order.

Canada and Alternate Chairman of the Foreign
Exchange Control Board, and one of the
greatest authorities on the subject-matter of
the agreement, will attend before the committee between now and 4 o'clock.
After discussing the Bretton Woods agreement, the committee will hear Mr. MacKinnon, Minister of Trade and Commerce,
and his Deputy, on questions relating to
Canada's foreign trade. As honourable members are aware, we shall shortly be asked
to consider a bill to amend the Export
Credits Insurance Act by increasing the aggregate amount of loans and securities from

$100,000,000 to $750,000,000.

As the measures

referred to may not reach this House until
very late in the session, it is to the interest
of all honourable members to attend these
meetings in the meantime.
It had been my thought to mo;e that the
House adjourn during pleasure to 'reassemble
this evening at the call of the bell, and then
to move that we adjourn until Monday at
8 o'clock. But as there may be some further
matters ready to come before the House
tomorrow afternoon, with leave of the Senate,
and following the suggestion of the honourable
leader opposite, I would move that we now
adjourn until tomorrow afternoon at 3 o'clock.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow

INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANIZATION-PROTECTION OF WORKERS
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. JAMES MURDOCK presented the
second report of the Committee on Immigration and Labour, as follows:
1. Your committee have in obedience to the
order of reference of the 12th November, instant, considered the following proposed resolution:-

383

DECEMBER 7, 1945
"Resolved, that this House do ýapprove of the
Convention concerning the protectioni agaînst
accidents of workers employed in loading or unloading ships (revised), which was adopted by
the General ýConference of the International
Labour Organization of -the League of Nations
at its sixteenth session in Geneva on the 27th
day of April, 1932."
2. Your committee recommnend the 'adoption
by the Senate of the proposed resolution.
He said: Honourable senators, on November 1 the honourable leader of the Goverament
submitted the resolution approving this convention to the House, as set forth at pages
195 and 196 of Hansard. Perhaps I should
place before the House this additional information.
The terni§ of this convention are incorporated in the regulation-s for the protection
against accidents of workers employed in loading and unloading ships. These regulations,
approved by Order in Council P.C. 3120 of
December 14, 1938, were later amended, and
as approved by another Order in Concil,
P.C. 1342 of February 19, 1943, were issued
under the provisions of section 467 of the
Canada Shîpping Act, 1934.
Under the régulations, which. have been in
operation since 1938, Inspectors of Ships Tackle
have been appointed at various ports throughout the Dominion, namely, at Port Aiberni,
Vancouver, Montreal, Charlottetown, Halifax,
Saint John. Now that additional personnel is
available, and higher salaries are being offered,
I iinderstand that inspectors will be appointed
at other ports. These inspectors have authority
to prevent the unlâading of a. ship until the
standards required by the Canada Shipping
Act have been compl'icd with, and to see that
only propeýr safety devices in good condition
are used.
The I.L.O. Convention has been ratified by
the following countries: Chile, China, United
Kingdom, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain,
Sweden, Uruguay.
The United States have ratified three maritime conventions, aIl passed at the 1936 conference, this being the first conference attended
officially by that country where there were any
conventions coming within its federal scope.
It has not concerned itself with conventions
passed in earlier years.
Conventions regarding minimum age at sea,
unemployment indemnity due to shipwreck.
minimum age of stokers and trimmers, medical
examination of young persons at sea, seamen's
articles of agreement, and the marking of
weight of packages transported by vesseIs, are
also incorporated in the Canada Shipping Act.
An additional Inspector of Ships Tackle wilI
be appoint-ed in Vancouver, and new appointmients àre expected in Quebcc and Montreal.
A maritime session of the International Labour

Conference is to meet in Seattle early in June,
1946. At this conference it is probable that
additional conventions or recommandations of
particular interest to Canada will be put forward,!sad no doubt these will be considered in
the liglit of our general shipping polýicy..
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shahl this
report be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: At the next sitting
of the House.

LIVING CONDITIONS IN TOWN AND
COUNTRY
EDITORIAL COMMENT ON ADDRESS BY

ONTARIO MINISTER OF
AGRICULTURE
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators, before the Orders of the Day are called,
I should like to direct attention to an editorial
which appeared in the Ottawa Journal of last
Wednesday. It is as follows:
Back to the Cities?
For years we have had it dinned -into us that
what this country needs is more people on the
land. "Back to the farm" became *a slogan.
Now comes Ontario's Minister of Agriculture,
Mr. T. L. Kennedy, to -declare this cry all wrong,
saying that what we need is *a movement back
to the cities. If, says Mr. Kennedy, some 50,000
of Ontario's 192,000 farmers could be dispensed
with things would be better.
We wonder. For what Mr. Kennedy doesn't
tell, though it is pretty relevant to his case, is
what the 50,000 farmers lie would get rid of
wouild do when they got to the cities. Where,
and at what, would they work? Farmers are
customers. of the cities; their backbone. If,
then, there were fewer farmers,
people
on the land to buy the things which the city factories make, wouldn't there be less work in the
cities?
More unemployment, more crowding,
more slums?
Mr. Kennedy says that a lot of farmers
aren't much of farmers, anyway; that they
merely make a living.
That may be quite true. But what about the
thousands of city workers who barely break
even, and who have no opportunity to raise
a family in the healthful conditions associated
with the farm?

ifewer

The editorial continues:
He is probably right; but even if he is right,
isn't it still true that a man making a living
for himself and his family on -a plot of land is
less likely to be a State 'liability than a man in
the city who, during a depression (our young
planners for "full employment" will pardon us),
falIls out of work?
Mr. Kennedy seems to us to look at farming
as a sort of business, as an occupation merely
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

to make production more efficient and to make
money. But fa.rming, we suggest, is more than
that. It is, we think, a way of life; something
that goes to the roots of a nation, that is born
and exist in love of the soil, that is associated
with human dignity and ,independence.
It might be better, of course, if all our farmers could be efficient, with nothing but great

mechanized farms, or even great collective farms
-we think, however, that such a development,
even if it were possible would take something
from the fibre of our country: remove something from it that goes deep into our history.
At any 'rate, we are on the side of the farmer,
prefer the man who wrests an honest living from
the soil, maintaining his independence the while,
to the man who, working in the city, is perhaps
compelled to dwell in a slum.
That, honourable senators, is a splendid
editorial and I agree with it entirely. About
twenty-five years ago, when manufacturing
industry was fast reaching the point where in
a few months it could turn out sufficient goods
to supply the needs of a whole year, Henry
Ford suggested that industry should to a
certain extent be decentralized by establishing
small subsidiary factories in the country.
These would operate in the winter months
when work on the land is impossible, and
close down for the spring and summer months
when the employees can busy themselves on
the land. He put his suggestion into practice
by making available to his workers land within
convenient reach of Detroit. I have always
stressed the advantages of life on the farm,
in the belief that farm life would encourage
an increase of population which would provide
a better market for the manufacturing industries in our cities. I am therefore very glad
of this opportunity to make these brief
comments on this excellent editorial.
Some hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
CANADA'S NATIONAL FLAG
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT moved concurrence in the final report of the Joint
Committee of the Senate and House of Commons appointed to consider and report upon
a suitable design for a distinctive national
flag.
The motion was agreed to, and the report
was concurred in.
SENATE STANDING COMMITTEESTHEIR CONSTITUTION AND
FUNCTIONS
REPORT OF COMMITTEE
Hon. J. E. SINCLAIR moved concurrence

in the second report of the Special Committee
appointed to review the constitution and
functions of the Standing Committees of the
Senate.

DECEMBER 7,1945
He said: Honourable senators, the cominittee
devoted several sittings to consideration of the
matters deait with in this report, and 1 think
it might be well for me to explain briefly the
background from which we approached our
work.
Except for a few minor changes from time
to time the rules of the Senate have not been
revised since 1906. On the ether hand, the
rules of the flouse of Commons were revised
in 1927. Naturally this resulted in a considerable difference between the rules of the two
flouses relating both to private and publie
legisiation, and we have made the revisions
necessary te bring our rules into harmony with
those of the other Chamber.
In both Flouses it used to be the practice to
deal with public bills in Committee of the
Whole, but for the past fifteen years or more
it has 'been more usual for the Senate te refer
such bis to a standing committee. The
reason for this change was to allow parties
interested in the proposed legislation to present
their views, and also to enable the Senate
to secure information with regard to Government measures cither from the Ministers in
charge of them in the other flouse or from
their departmental efficials.
In the view of your committee, this practice
has now become a custom. While it was feit
at the outset that in view of the large number of rules of this flouse we could reduce
the nuinher of standing committees, on reconsideratien it was the consensus of opinion
that a reduction would net make for mure
efficient operation. It was feit, however, that
it would be beneficial te increase the number
of senaters on the smaller committees. May
1 now give this honourable flouse some details
of the amendments suggested by the cernmittee.
The first amendment is te Rule 78, which
provides for the standing committees. It was
suggested that this rule be amended in the
following manner:
That the number of senators composing the
Committee on Standing Orders be increased
from 9 te. 15;
That the number of senators composing the
Cemmittee on Banking and Commerce be
increased from 42 to 50;
That the designation of the Committee on
Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours be changed
te the Oommittee on Transport and Communications.
Because the Committee on Railways, Telegraphs a.nd, Harbours is les busy than it once
was, it was thought that this comnmittee should
handle all matters pertaining to transport and
communications, including radio, airways and
other related subjects.

385

Further proposais undier the amendment to
Rule 78 are:That the number of senators composing the
Cominittee on Miscellaneous Private Bis be
increased from 25 to 35;
That the designation of the Comrnittee on
Agriculture and Forestry be changed te the
Committee on Naturai Resources, and that the
membership of the committee be increased
frorn 9 te 40 senaters.
It was the view of the members of the
Special Committee that the Committee on
Agriculture and Forestry should cover fishing,
mining, and related industries, and consequently that its membership should be increased, se that ail interested senators could
attend its meetings.
There also are recommendationsThat the number of senators cempesing the
Committee on Immigration and Labeur be increased from 9 te 35;
That the designatien of the Cemmittee on
Commerce and Trade Relations of Canada be
changed te the Committee on. Canadian Trade
Relations, and that its membership be increased from 9 to 35 senaters;
That the number of senaters compesing the
Committee on Civil Service Administration be
increased from 9 te 25.
While the Committee on Civil Service Administration of this flouse has net functiened
te, any extent iD the past, having regard to the
possibility of such legislation ceming before us,
it was considered wise te continue the
committee.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: fias the committee ever
functioned?
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I am net aware that
it has.
Other propesed amendiments are:
That the, designation of the Committee on
Publie flealth and Inspection of Feods be
changed te the, Committee on Public lealth
and Welfare, and that the number of senators
cemposing -this committee be increased from.
9 to 35;
That the number of senators composing the
Committee on Publie Buildings and Groundz
be increasd from 9 te 15;
That the number of senators composing the
Committee on Finance be increaeed, from 35
te 50;
That the number of senators composing the
Cemmittee on Tourist Trafflo be increased
from 15 te 25; and

386

SENATE

That the membership of the Committee on
External Relations be increased from 25 to
35 senators.
I draw to attention the fact that no changes
are recommended with respect to the committees on the Library, the Printing of Parliament, Internal Economy and Contingent
Accounts, Debates and Reporting, Divorce,
or the Restaurant.
Your committee recommends that the
House of Commons be requested to unite
with the Senate in the appointment of a
joint Standing Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds. Honourable senators will
recall that the committee of this House presided over by the honourable senator from
Rockcliffe (Hon. Mrs. Wilson) has functioned
every session, particularly during the summer
season. Recommendations for the improvement of buildings and grounds made by that
committee have been carried out by the
Federal District Commission, and I think the
result has been a general improvement of
surroundings.
However, it was felt that a
joint committee might be more effective than
a committee of one House.
Further, your committee
proposes
an
amendment to Senate Rule 107, whereby the
period of publication of notices for private
bills will be reduced from five weeks to four.
This will bring the Senate rule into harmony
with a similar rule of the House of Commons
which has been in effect since 1927. Because
of the difference in the rules of the two
Houses there has been confusion on the part
of those promoting legislation. It was thought
wise, therefore, to have these rules harmonize.
A third amendment reduces the delay from
five weeks to two weeks from the date of
mailing a notice to a Provincial Secretary,
the Clerk of a County Council or municipal
corporation, before a petition for a private
bill can be considered by the Standing Orders
Committee. This amendment will bring the
Senate rule into harmony with the House of
Commons rule.
The fourth amendment repeals Rule 109,
which requires that an applicant for a private
bill to construct a toll bridge must give notice
of the rates to be charged. Since the creation
of the Board of Transport Commissioners this
provision has been unnecessary.
The fifth amendment provides a new Rule
109 designed to overcome undue delays on
the part of promoters of private bills in
proceeding with their measures before committees.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR.

The sixth amendment repeals Rule 110 with
respect to the time limit for the presenting of
petitions and private bills to the Senate. The
new Rule 110 will be in harmony with the
House of Commons rule, and is intended to
avoid existing misunderstanding and confusion due to a difference in the time limit.
The seventh amendment repeals Rule 111,
which requires the Committee on Standing
Orders to report on each petition for a private
bill. Under the proposed new Rule 111, which
conforms to the procedure in the other House,
the examiner of petitions will report direct
to the Senate when petitions for private bills
comply with the rules. If this amendment
is adopted the Committee on Standing Orders
will be called to meet only when there is
non-compliance with the rules or a doubt in
the mind of the examiner as to the sufficiency
of the notice. The present procedure causes
considerable delay whenever, during an adjournment of the Senate. the examiner of petitions
-the Chief Clerk of Committees-finds that a
bill does not conform wholly to a rule, for he
has to wait until the Senate resumes, which
may be two weeks or longer, before a meeting
of the committee can be called. The amendment would simply bring the procedure for
handling these petitions into line with the
procedure that has long been followed with
respect to petitions for divorce. When a petition for divorce is received, it goes to the
Chief Clerk of Committees, who examines it
to see whether it complies with the rules;
and any petition that is out of order is sent
on to the committee.
That procedure bas
proved very satisfactory in dealing with
divorce petitions, and I think it would expedite
the handling of petitions for private bills in
general, while net weakening any of the
safeguards.
The eighth amendment merely adds the
words "or the examiner of petitions" to Rule
113, which amendment would follow as a consequence of the adoption of the proposed
amendment to Rule 111.
The ninth amendment also is consequential.
The tenth and eleventh amendments would
bring the provisions of Rule 134 into line with
the practice.
The twelfth amendment, which is to Rule
136, is the same as the proposed amendment
to Rule 107, whereby the period of publication of the notices will be reduced from five
to four weeks, and the Senate rule would thus
be brought into harmony with a similar rule
of the House of Commons.

DECEMBER 7, 1945
The thirteenth amendmeiit brings the time
lirait for filing petitions for bills of divorce
into barmony with the time limit in the House
of Commons. The variation between the time
limits in the two Houses bas led to confusion
and misunderstanding. The time limit in the
other flouse is six weeks, whereas iii this
flouse it is sixty days. Some petitions that
were acceptable under our rule bave been too
late under the Gommons' mile, ande's a resuit
the petitioners have had to pay a fine of one
or two hundred dollars. It is feit that confusion can be avoided hy bringing the rules
of the two flouses into harmony.
In conclusion I should like, on hehalf of the
committee, to express thanks to the Clerk of
the Senate, the Law Cierk and the Chief
Clerk of Committees for their valuable
assistance in explaining to the Special Coinmittee the practice and procedure under the
rules governing standing commitees, particularly as to the bandling of private bis.
Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, I arn sure I speak for
the House as a whole in expressing appreciation of the work done by the honourable gentleman from Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair) and
the other members of the special Committee,
and of their careful attention to the matter
referred to them. It might be suggested that
the membersbip of the proposed committees is
ton large. I would, however, emphasize what
the honourable gentleman said as to the great
volume of work done in the committees.
Attention bas often been called to the fact
that every senator bas the right to attend al
committee meetings, and to take part in the
discussions, though he cannot vote in any
committee of which hoe is not a member. It
would seem to me that the increased size of
committees will* make it possible for ail hionourabie senators to participate to a greater
degree than ever in the work done by the
respective committees.
Wlien the honourable gentleman was speaking, I was reminded that someone had asked
me whether notices of committee meetings
could not be publish-ed in the Senate Minutes
at least a day in advance, s0 that ail honourable senators would be kept informed of these
meetings. I understand that practice is foliowed in the other flouse, but I have had no
opportunity of ascertaining whether it would
be helpful bore. 0f course, notices of comnmittee meetings are always posted on the
board in the corridor downstairs.
I wish again to express thanks to the
Spocial Committee, and especially to its chairman, the bonourable senator from Queen's

(Hon. Mr. Sinclair), for the careful and
efficient manner in which the order of reference was dealt with.
The motion was agreed to, and the report
was concurred in.

the honourable leader of the Government to
the discomfort caused by a draught from the

I understand that the session is expected to

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I will endeavour
to do so.
INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANIZATION-PROTECTION OF WORKERS

Canada on the same basis as Canad.ian companies, is a simple one. The memorandum
from, the Superintendent of Insurance is as
follows:
Part VIII, sections 115 to 144, and the second
schedule, apply te British companies; the schedule sets forth the classes of assets which may be
vested in trust in a Canadian trust comjiany by
a British company for the purpose of securing
its Canadian policyholders.
When the Act was passed, the classes of securities which might be so vested in a trustee corresponded to the classes of investment which
Canadian companies were authorized te make
under Section 60.
In 1934, by Chapter 45, an addition was made
to the classes permitted te Canadian companies
(see 'Section 60 (1) (b) (i-c)), but by what I
believe was an oversight, no corresponding addition was made te the classes permitted te be
vested in trustees by British companies. The
amendment now before Parliament will bring
the two groups of companies again into line in
this respect.
The ciass of security added by the amendment
is the debentures or debenture stock of any corporation which ýaTe fully secured by a statutory
charge upon real estate of the corporation, provided the security has a ten-year record of continuous payment of interest in full immediately
preceding the date of investment; bonds of such
a corporation secured by pledge te a trustee of
such debentures or debenture stock are also
made eligible for vesting with trustees.
The whole purpose of the bill, as I see it,
is to bring the two classes of companies into
line as to investments which are to be made
in Canada.
TF.c motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

CONSIDERED IN COM'MITTEE

The Senate proceeded to the consideration
of the second report of the Committee on
Immigration and Labour.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall the
bill be read the third tirne?

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
Honourable
senators, in the absence of the honourable
senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock),
I would move that this report be concurred in.
The motion was agreed to.
CANADIAN AND BRITISH INSURANCE
COMPANIES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON moved
the second reading of Bill PS, an Act to amend
the Canadian and British Insurance Companies
Act, 1932.
He said: Honourable members, I'have asked
the honourable senator from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris) to explain this bill.
Hon. J. W. de B. FARRIS: Honourable
senators, this bill, which provides for putting
British insurance companies operating in
Hon. Mr. QUINN.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, with leave of the Senate, I would move
third reading now.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Honourable senators,
is there any urgent reason why this bill should
be read Ithe third tirne now?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If any honourable member so desires, the bill can go to
committee.
I gave an explanation of the
bill to the honourable leader opposite. It is
not absolutely necessary to give the bill third
reading now, but I am anxious that it proceed as far as possible.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators, I suggest that the bill go to committee.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: To the
mxittee on Banking and Commerce?

Corn-

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable members.
may I suggest that we consider the bill in
Conmittee of the Whole?

DECEMBER 10, 1945

389

Hon. Mr. HARDY: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The honourable gentleman fromn Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris)
gave a clear and accurate explanation of the
purpose of the bill. It simply permits British
companies to invest their Canadian funds ini
the samne kind, of securities that Canadian
companies are allowed to invest in. The next
bill to be considered deals with American
companies, and has similar provisions.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: Why should we
nlot pass the bill now?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: If somýe honourable senators wish to discuss it, why nlot let the bill
go to Committee of the Whole now?

This aniendment will make 'avai'lable to British companies for the purpose of vesting assets in
trust as securi-ty for Canadie.n poiyhldr a
elase of security in which Canadianecompanies are
permitted -to invest under pa.rag.raph (b) of eubsection one of isection 60. The sub-paragraph
inserted recognizes -aetatutory chaTge iipon assets
and a record of continuous payment of interest
on -bhe obligitions secured.thereby as equivalent
to the forma of security set forth in the pre-

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honaurable senators, Bill Q8 is the same type of bill as this
one. Would honourable senators agree to give
that bill second reading and then refer both
bis to Committee of the Whole?

I do.not see any objection ta the bill.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: May I point out to
my bonourable frîend from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) that this is nlot a case of
a Canadian corporation conforming to a law
of Great Britain or any other country. It is
quite the reverse. It is ta put British campanies on the same basis as Canadian campanies in the matter of making investments.
Hlon. Mr. LEGER: Do thse words '<reai
estate" in the bill mean real estate in Canada?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Yes. This provision is
the saine as the one that pertains to investments by Canadian companie

Hon. Mr. CALDER:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. HARDY: Honourable senators,
I think it is a very good suggestion to refer
bis of this kind to Committee -of the Whole.
The practice has been very much neglected
in this House. In Committee of the Whole
the bis could be disposed of in a very
few minutes, thus avoiding delay.
Hon. Mr. ROEBIJCK: Honourabie senators,
I have no very clear idea as tu whether this
bill is a wise one or not, but I do know that
when you commence mailkeying with ruies
affectîng insurance companies you are getting
into a matter of considerable importance. If
we are to model our Canadian law upan
British lawHon. Mr. FARRIS: This is the opposite
to what you are suggesting.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: -or some other
law, I cannot see where it is going to end.
I think this bill iiu important enough te receive
somne consideration, and it should not be
given second and third reading in one night.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I move that
the Senate go into committee on the bill.
-The motion was agreed to, and the Senate
went inta committee on the bill.

The bill itself provides as follows:
The debentures, debenture stock or other

real estate or upon plant and equîpmnent of such
,corporation, used in the -transaction of its business: Provided intere»t in full shali have been

Hon. Mr. LEGER: It simply means that a
British compa-ny that owns real estate here
may issue securities on the basis of that real
estate?

Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, no. If a company
owns an apartment, it may issue debentures

secured by a mortgage on the apartment, and
the British company can buy such debentures
provided the interest has been paid for the
preceding ten years.
lIn the province of Manitoba that practice
is not common, but it is in other parts cf
Canada. For instance, a mortgage is aecured
in the name of the Royal Trust, the National
Trust, or soma other trust company. If
debentures are issued against thiat mortgage,
a Canadian company is allowed ýto buy those
debenýtures. This bill permits British companies ta do likewise.

EXPORT CREDITS INSURANCE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. WISHART
McL. ROBERTSON
moved the second reading of Bill 217, an Act
to amend the Export Credits Insurance Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the Export
Credits Insurance Act, which this bill seeks
to amend, was passed in 1944. Part I of the
Act established a corporation to engage in
the insurance of commercial export credits.
Part II permitted the Governor in Council,
for the purpose of facilitating and developing
trade between Canada and any other country,
to authorize the Minister of Finance to enter
into agreements with foreign governments or
their agencies, to provide them with credits,
or to guarantee credits provided to them by
others in Canada.
The purpose of the measure before us is to
increase from $100,000,000 to $750,000,000 the
amount which the Government may lend to
other governments or their agencies under
Part II of the Export Credits Insurance Act.
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

No alteration is proposed in the amount of
the guarantees which the Government may
give under Part I of the Act-that is $200,000,000-or in the amount of business which
the Insurance Corporation established by Part
I is authorized to do. The proposed amendment is required to give the Government
sufficient authority to make loans to allied
governments in the next year or two, in order
to enable them to purchase supplies in
Canada. It is not the purpose of this amendment to provide funds for making loans to
the United Kingdom or the sterling area in
general. This matter will be dealt with by
another agreement, which will be submitted
at the next session of Parliament.
The bulk of the money provided under this
bill will be for loans to our allies in Western
Europe, the U.S.S.R., China and the Netherlands East Indies. Among the loans already
arranged for, and those contemplated should
this measure pass, are the following:

DECEMBER 10, 1945

4. We are not charging allied goveruments
a premium covering the risk we are assuming
during the period of reconstruction.
We Iend at an interest rate based on the
cost to the Canadian Government of borrowing for a period equal to the average duration
of the credit we are providing, plus a fraction
of one per cent to cover the cost of borrowing
other than interest. As the cost to Canada
of money varies- with the time of the boan,
so do the interest rates vary. I arn advised
that the net varies frorn about 2-9 per cent
to 3-1 per cent.
5. We ask for repayment over a series of
years, commencing as soon as the borrowing
country feels it would bie possible, and extcnding lu some cases for periods as long as thirty
years.
6. We inquire about the nature and scale
of the purchases to be made by the countries
receiving the credits iu order to sc how they
fit lu with the supply position lu Canada, to
ensure that our own essential requirements in
that respect are not iu danger.
7. We are asking borrowing countries to
purchase part of their requirements in Canada for cash; the actual proportion depending
on the circumestances, but normally b eing in
the neighbourhood of one-fifth or one-sixth.
One allied country did not have the foreigu
exchange to enable it to buy lu cash, so lu
that case the cash requirement was waived
I am not sure at the moment which coutit
it was.
S. It has not been our policy to ask for
commercial or other concessions as a consideration or a condition of these boans. We
regard them as standing on their own feet. In
one or two cases we have taken the opportunity of suggesting excbange of the most
favoured-nation privileges lu commercial
matters to develop our future trade.
Duriug the consideration of this bll lu
committee, the honourable senator from St.
Jean Baptiste (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) asked a
very poluted question about future trade
relations. I arn advised that diuring the negotiations a suggestion was made to France. This
is the pertinent paragraph of the letter of the
Mluister of Finance:
At this time when 'Canada will be assietîug
France to increase substantially ite importe
from 'Canada for the purposes of -reconstructbion,
and when the 'Canadian Goverument hopes to
see an inerease in the exporte from France to'
Canada, it seeme *boýbe appropriate to suggest
that -Canada ýand France ight agýree to extend
to one another most-favoured-uation treatment
in commercial policy. iSuch action wouid, I
think, impress upon -the people both of FranCe
aud of Canada our intention to develop future
trade betwèen the two countries on a znutually
advantageous baeis.

The relevant passage fromn the reply of the
representatives of the French Government je
as follows:
As regards your suggestionThat ie, the suggestion of the Minister of
Finance.
--- oncerning the most-favoured-nati<m clause,
c
thie je a question w.hich in due course wi'll be
dicsedbetween the representatives of our
countries, but lu conformity with the general
principlee included in -the lend-leaee master
-agreement, which le well known to you, and 1,hat
France has signed, I eau now assure you that
the French Government will collaborate with
the Canadian Gover.nment in concerted action te
gliminate ail forme of discriniintoryîtreatment
in international commerce and to 1the reductico
of tariffs -and other trade barriere.
Now, honourable senators, it cannot be
denýied that, in entering into, credit arrangements such as these on the scale contemplated,
we are taking some risk; but beariug in mind
Canada's position among the allie& nations
and the fact that export tradeý is of such vital
importance to hier economy, I submit that we
should give favourable consideration to this
bill. We are interested in, this not only as a
humanitarian measure which will contribute
to the general re-establishmcnt and reconstruction of the varlous countries of the
world, particularly those with which we have
been allied, but also as au instrument which
may well have a very defluite effect on our
present and future economy.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I should like
to ask the honourable leader of the Government a question. Without specifying any
particular country, suppose Canada sets up a
credit of $25,000,000, to be expended on the
purchase of Canadian goods, would) the country receiving the credit be free to spend part
of it on purchases fromn other countries?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The arrangement
contemplates ouly the purchase of goode in
'Canada. But I understaud there is under
consideration. a request hy one or two countries to purchase some of our surplus war
assets in Europe. That is the exception rather
than the rule, because mostly the goods are
needced for reconstruction or for immediate
use.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Would it not
bie a sounder policy for Canada ta require
in the trea.ty or agreement that the borrowing
country expend, the entire $25,000,000 in
Canada?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The Minister
assured me that that was the general policy.
1 might say to the honourable senator from
Aima (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) that-not only

392

the amount of the credit, but in some cases
cash, will be spent in Canada in excess of the
credit.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
set forth in the agreement?

But will it be

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: So he said.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I do not expect that anyone will oppose
this legislation, because Canada is in a difficult
position. The British Government bas just
concluded .an agreement with the United
States for a loan of $3,750,000,000, plus a
balance of about $700,000,000 on lend-lease
account. On the basis of population, as compared with United States, Canada would lend
about $350,000,000. Conversely, in relation to
the loan of $650,000,000 covered by this blil, the
United States would lend $8,800,000,000. I am
dioubtful that the United States would lend
anything like that amount. I have not yet
seen a statement from the Minister of Finance,
but I am worried about this legislation in that
I have as yet seen no statement on how the
Ninth Victory Loan of $2,000,000,000 was taken
up-how much was sold to corporations and
how much to individuals. Further, I should
like to know how much was new money and
how much was reconversion.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: It was announced by
the Minister a short time ago that $1,000,200,000 had come from private subscribers.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: How
represents reconversion?

much

of that

Hon'. Mr. CRERAR: May I ask my honourable friend what he means by "reconversion"?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: If I may, I will explain
it by making a personal reference. A lady in
whom I am very much interested asked me if
she shouldi make an investment in the 8th
Victory Loan. This lady happens to be my
wife. She said that she had $500 to invest.
I advised her to invest it in the loan. I then
went out of town for a week or two. When
I returned she said she had invested $1,800.
I said, "Where did you get the other $1,300"?
Her answer was: "You don't know all about
Victory loans. I made a profit by converting
my old loan of $1,300, and I added another
$500 to the $1,300". That incident illustrates
what I mean by "reconversion".
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: In that case the earlier
bonds were sold?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, they were taken
over by the Government.
Hon. Mr. HARDY:
Canada?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

By

the

Bank

of

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I do not know. I am not
familiar with the secrets of my wife's business.
I know that she invested $1,800 in the loan.
and put only $500 of new money into it. Now
I should like to know how much of the
$2,000,000,000 was new money and how much
was made up of old loans reconverted.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Do not the public
buy the loan?
Hon. Mr. HAIG:

I do not know.

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: I know that I
sold some bonds to the bank.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: If the bank buys them
no new money is brought in. In this borrowing
business we are gradually reaching the bottom
of the barrel. Reports for October of this
year show that our level of industrial activity
is back to that of 1942. We are backing up.
The loan to France of $242,000,000 represents
a huge amount of money. Before the war
Canada's trade with that country was not muen
more than $25,000,000 a year. France was a
very small buyer of the products we had to sell.
After the last war we made a loan to Roumania
of $25,000,000.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
it.

And we lost

Hon. Mr. HAIG: We lost it all. We made
a loan to Greece. and it is gone too. I am not
sure that loans of that kind do us any good.
Hon. Mr. HARDY:

Not a bit.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I will not go quite as far
as my honourable friend, but I will go a long
way with him. If we are making this loan
to try to put the French people back on their
feet I am satisfied, but only if we can afford
such a contribution.
There is no use our
making a contribution.to put some other part
of the world on its feet if we are going to
ruin ourselves in doing it. I would point out
to the Government that the barrel from which
it draws the money is not inexhaustible. When
a denand is made at the next session for a
reduction in taxes, the Government will have
interest payments on these borrowings to meet.
I do not know what the proposed loan to
Great Britain will be; but if it is proportionate
to the United States loan, it will approximate
8350.000.000-and no one here is going to vote
against it. The buyer-country may put up
20 per cent of its own money on purchases
made in Canada, but the profit will not be
very large. At the present time Canada has
very little to sell in the way of wheat, cattle.
hogs and machinery.
I aum not opposed to this legislation; I shall
vote for it; but I want to warn the people of
this country that we are drifting into large

DECEMBER 10, 1945
financial commitmnents that somne day will have
to be met. At $25,000,000 a year it will take
France -a long time to pay back this boan
together witb the mnterest on it.
Hon. THOMAS VIEN:- Honourable senators,
with much of what the bonourable gentleman
(Hon. Mr. Haig) bas said I entirely agree. I,
too, believe that we should be prudent and
careful in making boans to other countries;
but like my bonourable friend, I realize that
in our post-war policy we must make provision
for contributions to aid in the reconstruction
of world trade.
In my opinion the boan of 8250,000,000 to
France, to be refunded over a period of years
at a higher rate of interest than Canada is
obbiged to pay, is probably one of tbe safest
loans we could make. France, before the war,
had an excess of exports over imports
amouating to $800,000,000 a year. Her gold
reserves were, I think, second only to those
of the United Kingdom and the United States.
We know that economically the French
colonial empire is exceptionalby welb balanced,
and that France will be one of the first
countries of the world to recover hier former
high position. If France, aided by bier colonial
empire, is unable to repay tbis Ioan we are
talking to little purpose, for di.saster shal
have overtaken the economy of the world.
Canada must start somewhere to fulfil bier
avowed intention of bebping in world reconstruction, and I know of no safer way to
start than by advaacing thîs money to France
to enable bier to purchase from us the things
sbe needs.
The honourable senator bas suggested that
Canada bas very ittle to seli. The appreheasion that we bave nothint to sell is Bomnewbat futile, for if we have nothing to seli,
tbe money loaned is not going to be expended,
because the purpose of the advance is to
finance purchases in Canada. I repeat, apart
from the United States and Great Britain I
know of no country to wbicb. we could lead
money more safely. During tbe war France
passed througb a great ordeal. But I believe that she will work out bier own salvation and wilI sbortly re-assume bier former
position and will carry out bier uadertakings
with us as webl as every other country in the
world. The majority of our people, I believe,
appreciate what the United Kingdom. suffered during the war, and will strongly favour
extending financ.ial assistance to that country
so that she may regain lier former proud
asceadancy. I do not hesitate to say that
witbin a reasonably short period of years the
United Xingdom will have repaid the Joan
and met tbe iaterest and sinking fuad.

393

If I may be permitted to say so, there are
certain limitations with respect to boans to
the United Kingdom. In 1932 Great Britain
entered into the Ottawa Agreements with
Canada. These agreements were. supposed to
be reciprocal. Custom, duties were frozen so
as to give Great Britain and the British
dominions preferential treatment on the Canadian market. We agreed that in our commercial agreements with other countries we
would~ not disturb that preferential treatment.
That meant that if a certain conmodity carried 30 per cent ad valoremi duty Britain and
the other dominions would get a fifty per cent
advantage by reason of the preference. We
shall not be permitted to disturb that preferential treatment. If under our trade agreements
with other countries it sbould become necessary to reduce the duty, we could not reduce
it to less than 1à per cent, and British gioods
would then go on the free iist in order to
retain their preferential position over the intermediate tariff. We could go no further because.
under the Ottawa agreement, the 15 per cent
in favour of Great Britain must not be disturbed. Therefore, there was a horizontal
freezing of the etistomns tariff, and this action
was to be reciprocal.
Well, since the war and even since V-J Day
there bas been built up in the world what is
called the sterling bloc. We ail have heard
about this recently. It was agreed that we
would not disturb the preference given to
Britain, and this agreement was to he reciprocal. But Belgium, bas become part of
the sterling bloc, as have Greece, Syria, Iran,
Palestine, Egypt and recently the Netherlands
East ladies. Canadian goods can no longer
be shipped to thr>se markets without an un.port licence, and the sterling controller in
each of the respective countries is refusing to
grant such a licence. This is not reciprocal
treatmnent. When the Ottawa agreements were
entered into we gave to the United Kingdom
certain specific and definite advantages on
the Canadian market, and it was clearly understood that we were to have certain specifie
and definite advanýtages on the British market
and in other countries. But now the reciprocal principle of those agreements is being
disturbed, since Canadian goods can ne longer
be shipped to the United Kingdom. It is not
rnerely a tariff wall that bas been erected
against themn; it is a complete embargo. I
say that is a brazen violation of the Ottawa
agreements.
If on the Canadian market we cannot give
any other country an advantage which would
disturb the preference granted to Britain, if
we cannot impose a duty on goods imported
free under B3ritish preferential agreements, it
would seem that Canadian produets should

:94

SENATE

enter into the United Kingdom and the
sterling territories as freely as they did when
the agreements were made. I realize that the
war caused a considerable upheaval, and that
the United Kingdom needs United States and
Canadian dollars. We have been supplying
Canadian dollars to the United Kingdom in
large amounts, and we do not complain. We
have contributed graciously. Mr. Churchill
himself referred to our contribution as a
massive one. It has been massive not only
in men and materials of war, but also in
financial assistance. I am very proud that
our country, Canada, was in a position to
make such a contribution to the United Kingdom during the war. I must confess, however,
I did not expect that right after the conclusion
of the war not only would United Kingdom
markets be closed to Canadian products, but
that other markets to which we had reasonably
free admission woulid come within the tentacles
of Great Britain, and that by the establishment
of the sterling bloc we would be prevented
from trading on those markets.
I, therefore, agree with the honourable
leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig), and would
suggest to him that when we are dealing
with the loan to Great BritainHon. Mr. HAIG: My honourable friend is
not discussing the matter to which I referred.
He is dealing with the English loan, and that
is not before us just now.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: No. I was referring to
what my honourable friend said.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I simply said that there
was some other money that we would have
to take care of. If my honourable friend
had been at the committee the other day he
would have had his question answered by
the Minister of Trade and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: I am not referring to
what the Minister of Trade and Commerce
said. We are dealing with a bill under which
the Government seeks power to increase our
loans to various countries.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: But the British boan is
not covered by this bill.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: If my honourable friend
will possess his soul in patience he will see
that I am agreeing with him. But I am
stating reasons that qualify my agreement.
Although the British loan is not directly
involved here, my honourable friend suggested
that if the United States found it advisable
and expedient to advance four billion four
hundred million dollars to Britain, a proportionate contribution by Canada would be some
three hund-red million dollars.
Hon. Mr. VIEN.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Three hundred and fifty
million dollars.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: I am referring to that
remark by my honourable friend. I agree
that we should stud.y carefully the demands
for advanees of all kinds, and I arn suggesting
that if Britain is in great need of United
States and Canadian dollars, Canada is in
great need; of foreign markets. Our national
debt before the war was about two billion
dollars. When all these matters have been
attended to it will probably be fifteen or
seventeen or eighteen billions.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: About twenty billions.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Well, let us say twenty
billions. I wanted to be conservative for once.
My friend is more liberal in this: he says
twenty billions. How are we, with a population of twelve millions, going to carry such
a load if foreign markets are closed to our
products? How is Canada going to fare if it
is jammed between the sterling bloc, the
United States dollar territory and the rouble
area? We are not linked up with the pound
sterling, the United States dollar or the rouble,
and if we are to survive we shall have to work
out our own salvation in the markets of the
world. It seemed to me that on this occasion
we should state the facts bluntly and look at
them squarely.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Now that the war is
over we should consider Canadian interests.
The British Commonwealth of Nations is
spread all over the world. So extensive is the
Commonwealth that we have boasted the
sun never sets on the British flag. We are
proud of that. But every part of the Commonwealth is supposed to look after its own
interests. If Canadians do not look after
Canada's interests, I should like to know who
will do so. The duty of looking after Canad'a's
interests is one that we owe to our children,
to the whole country and to the Empire itself.
If we neglect to look after Canadian interests
we weaken the Commonwealth. If in years
gone by Canadians had not paidi proper attention to their own interests, we never should
have been able to make the massive contribution we did make in men, materials and money
to the United Kingdom ond the United
Nations.
I say, therefore, that the warning' uttered
by the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig) is most welcome and timely. But I do
not know if he has gone far enough. I think
I have gone a few steps farther in suggesting,
with all kindness towards the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth of

DECEMBER 10, 1945
Nations, that we should now begin to consider
Canadian interests first, second and ail the
time.
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators, I should flot like to consent
by a sulent vote to the very large amount
asked for under this bill, because it does scem
to me that, on their face, the loans are bad
business. Lt seems to me quite clear that no
careful credit manager would pass such loans
on their merits as loans, with the expectation
of their being paid back and being good loans
from the point of view of the lender.
Staring us in the face is the fact that shortly
after the last war we made advances of this
kind to Rumania and other countries, and not
one single dollar was paid back. Far be it
fImm me to prophesy that any of the countries
who will take advantage of this legisiation
wiIl flot pay back their loans; but 1 do say
it is bad business. Ncvertheless I am prepared
to vote for this measure on the ground that
humanity is more important than good business. I wish it to be understood, however,
that I shall do so with my eyes open, otherwise I should feel.that I was not discharging
xny responsibility as a member of this
Chaniber.
Canada does owe some duty to the world
at large, and the money to be advanced will
bû used for clothes, food and the other necessaries of life to relieve the dire distress of
mien, women and children in the borrowing
,countries. That really is the direct purpose
of the proposed boans-to enable those countries to re-establish themselves and to give
sustenance to their people.
But aside from the humanitarian standpoint
we muvst have regard to how these boans will
affect our Canadian. life. My mind goes back
to the hungry thirties, when thousands of our
people, lacking the necessaries of ife, were
unable to secure jobs. Yet the natural
resources of Canada were a.s great then as they
are now, and just as avaliable to man's hand.
We had ample supplies in our warehouseff and
intelligent maapower to produce more of the
goods needed in our homes and places of
business. But in- some jug-handled way our
people were at that time prevented from converting our va.st naturai resources into food
and, clothing, and had very littie purchasing
power, and s0 during those dreary years they
struggied and suffered.. Then came war.
Canada withdrew fromn producetion lines
thousandis of lier young, healthy and. vigorous
men for military service abroad. She threw
into the boiling cauldron. of war, arinaments
and food and ciothing to the value of tweive
billions of dollars. Those goods were sent
across the seas s fast as ships were avail-

able. But while we were doing that our homes
were better suppiied than they h-ad ever been;
we were better fed, better clothed and better
housed.
It is a strange iphenomenon that by engaging in the destructive processes of war we are
able to give to our people a greater quantity
of the things they need. To my mind it
shows how little wc know of the fundlamentals
of the society which we are supposed to govern.
At last the war is9 over, and unemployment,
to put it mildly, is now -a stark reality in this
country. The time may be not far distant
when some-let us 'hope flot alI-of the, evils
that befeli us in, 1930 and succeeding: years
may againi be upon us. Then all the goods6 we
required were stored. in our warehouses, but
our people had been so robbed of their puxchasing power as to be no longer able to procure those things which they themselves had
produced. That same picture is preeenting
itself to us today. In order to ease the transition from war to peace, we passed social legislation that will tend to maintain purchasing
power by enabling -the houseiwife to buy
needed commodiities. This legislation in my
judgment wili serve humnanity in a double
eense: it will help -the people of the borrowing
countries, and it wiil have a êtimulating effect
on industry and employment in our Gwn
country.
I intend to vote for this measure but, as
I have said, I shahl do so with eyes wide
open, realizing that much of the loans may
not be paid back, but willing too trust the
countries to which the Minister of Finance
will extend these credits, and regarding the
measure rather as a piece of humanitarian
legisiation thaný sound business.
Hon. GERALD G. MeGEER: Ho-nourable
senators, wjth. much of what the last speaker
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) has said I think we can
ail agree, but there are other things that must
come to our minds as we rev-iew what is proposed by this bill. Today $750,000,000 is flot
very m-uch money, but it was an impressive
amount back in the days when hund-reds of
thousands of Canadians were unable to find
jobs in a country where jobs were actually
more numerous than. the workers to do them.
Today we are advancing $750,000,000 to
Belgium, Holland, the Netheriands East
Indies, Russia, and Czechoslivakia. lIn addition we are putting several hundred million
dollars into the Brettonl Woods agreement.
We are aiso proposing, according to the press,
to advance a billion and a haif dollars to
Great Britain. Apparexitly we are finding no
great difflculty in making these enormous
coxumitînents.

I wonder if we have altogether forgotten
the huge boans that were made ta European
countries after the last war. We lent a considerable amount of money to Rumania. How
much did the United States lend to Germany?
Billions of dollars. How mucli did the United
States lead ta South American countries?
Hundreds of millions of dollars. Honourable
members will probably recali a congressional
investigation whieh diselosed the conditions
of affairs surrounding the then loaning polîcy
of the United States. That policy was for
the very same purpose tha.t these foreign
loans are designed for, namely, to stimulate
foreign trade. The boans were largely promoted by international financiers aperating in
New York and other places, in co-aperatioýn
with exparting companies.
What happened in the wake of these enarmous boans ta foreign countries, made flot
only by the United States but also by Britain?
Have we already forgotten that during the
pre-war years a large part of the most
valuable commodities of aur foreign trade
was taken from this country ta build the very
armaments with whieh we were subsequently
attacked? Yes, we boasted. and rightly Sa,
of aur enormaus minerai production. We exported aur nickel, aur asbestos, aur copper,
aur lead and a great many of aur other
commodities, including pulpwood and food
supplies. These went directly ta the countries
that precipitated the last war. I am flot sure
that we are amply protected against a reýpetition of that kind of foreign trade, because
there is nothing humanitarian about Canadian
exports being financed for shipment abroad
if again they are ta be used ta build up foreign
armaments. There is same indication in the
debates in another place that the boan agreements will contain certain powers for supervising and controlling the nature of the purchases by the borrowing countries; but we
in this House are asked ta pass upon the loans
without ever having an oppartunity ta peruse
the agreements. 1 have neyer seen them laid
on my desk.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:

Hear, hear.

They might be
Hon. Mr. MeGEER:
available. With proper investigation of these
matters we might have been able ta add somne
of the securities tbat were sa hopelessly lacking in the programme of foreign trade carried
on following the last war.
From tbe standpoint of aur relations with the
different countries I ar n ot sure that these
agreements are altogether advantageous. For
instance, 1 flndý it rather difficult ta, understand why we should be lending $65,000,000
ta the Netherlands East Indies. I find it hard
Hon. Mr. McGEER.

ta appreciate why we should advance $242,000,000 ta France. If the boans are ta be
repaid, we must take back from those countries in one way or another the equivalent of
what we are going ta sbip ta them. We migh-t
in time attain a fair balance of trade, but I
should like ta knaw just how $242,000,000, the
amount of the boan ta France, was arrivedi at.
My information is that the boans ta the various
countries provide for cash expenditures in
Canada. But is there anything to prevent a
country from purchasing goods in Canada and
taking themn out of the country and selling
thema in campetition with the C-anadian producer? Do these agreements give any guarantee that the price level is to be maintained
an any basis co-related ta the levelýs under
iVieh these oans are being advanced? The-re
may be sueh a provision, bot I do nat know
of it.
1 do know that much of the export trade
which Canada enjoyed in the past was bult
up nat only an war itscîf, but on the preparatians for war which continued with ever
increasing intensity up until 1914. And it
began again almast at the moment the Treaty
of Versailles was signed.
Ona hesitates today ta oppose any form
of co-aperatian in the world of international
affairs, but it does seem that we in Canada
and the people throughout the British Empire,
wlio have borne the terrifie burdens of the
past, would do well ta look ta the future with
the greatest care and caution. Failure ta avoid
the nîistakes of the past may easily cause us
ta again squander a large portion of aur enarmous heritage of wealth, and ta meet with
greater disaster ourselves. In the dying days
of Parliament we are asked, ta pass in a few
minutes on mare thýan one billion dollars of
commitments for fareiga boans. If we do sa,
are we gaiag ta exceed the limita of aur
financial powers? Are we gaing ta put ahl aur
eggs into the basket of foreign trade, or are
we gaing ta think in terms of building up in
this country, which is capable of supporting
millions where thousands are living today, an
enarmaus national home for aur own people?
Some Han. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: With this gigantie
foreign trade programme before us, I ask:
Where is the programme for aur cities, aur
provinces and for the development of aur
tourist trade, which is the finest kind of
foreign trade any country ever enjoyed.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. MeGEER: We are plunging into,
the vortex of foreign . trade that produced
disaster in the past. Even with very limited
information on these huge commitments ane

DECEMBER 10, 1945
hesitares to oppose them because of the hope
for world improvement, the need, for which at
this moment cannot ha dejied.
In considering this enormous programme we
should flot ovarlook the tremandous change
that has taken place in our financial and
econornie thinking. Back in the hungry 30's
when some of us ini the other place suggested
that some money should be spent to eliminate
level crossings and to prepare defences for
Canada's $35,000,000,000 of devaloped wealth,
we were told there was no money available.
Ever since I was knee high to a grasshopper
f have been in public lifa, listening to financial arguments in cities, provinces and
dominions, and 1 have always been led to
balieve that the sound financial system was
one in which your exports exceeded your
imports, thereby giving you a favourabla
balance of trade. Thus countrias with an
unfavourable balance of trade were forced
to hand over their gold, and the more gold
you secured the greater your internai buying
power and improvements.
We have beau told that Canada was a
young country; that she had neither the years
nor the capacity required to produce, develop
and accumulate the wealth to build railways,
highways, schools. hospitals, cities and industries. But now, in addition to meeting our
appalling financial obligations resulting from
the recent war, we are invited to shovel out
millions of dollars, yes billions, as gifts to
countries wh*ich we used to think had vast
stores of accumulated wealth.
This discussion is not going to end with
the closing of this session of Parliament.
Wa must lay the foundation for a saner
administration of our foreign trade and our
internai economy. I think it was the Rigbt
Honourable Winston Churchill, leader of the
Conservative Party in England, who said it
was a mistake evan for England to depend
too much upon foreign trade. He said that
foreign trade must neyer ha anything more
than the spilling over of the surplus of a
country's internal production. England is in
a very dillarent position from Canada. I bave
always beau of the opinion that the. Dominion
made the mistake of trying to follow too
closely economic theories that appliad to a
country such as Euglaud, with a large population and limitad rasources. Canada, in contrast, bas a small population and tremendous
resources.
I propose to gîva this measure my support.
I hope that, out of the situation confronting
us will corne the kind of thinking that will

put us to work to buîld a Dominion of Canada whicb will be able to make an enormous
contribution to the whole world.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourabla senators, some mattars ralated to this measure
bave already recaivad consideration in committea. I arn prepared to comply with the
feelings of honourable sanators in regard to
sending the bill itself to a committee.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Is there any explanation why France is to gat $242,000,000?
Hon. Mýr. ROBERTS ON: I have no particular information as to the amount.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: I notice the rates of
interest vary fromt 21 par cent to 3 per cent.
I amn assuming that the variation is due to a
differanca in the terms of the boans.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It was so stated
by the Minister. It reprasants a fraction of 1
par cent for the cost of raising the money,
over and aboya the actual interast.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: If we can give foreign
boans at that rate wby do we charge the Harbour Commissioners 5 par cent?
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Honourabla senators,

NATIONAL EMERGENCY TRANSITIONAL POWERS BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON
moved the second raading of Bill 15, an Act
to confer certain transitional powers upon tbe
Govarnor in Council during the national
emargancy arîsing out of the war.
Ha said: I have askad the honourable senator from Vancouver South MHon. Mr. Farris)
to explain this bill.

398

SENATE

Hon. J. W. de B. FARRIS: Honourable
senators, it was several weeks ago when my
honourable friend first suggested that I
explain this bil. I agreed to do so before I
read it. After I had the original draft of the
bill I was somewhat concerned. In fact, I
almost felt that my honourable friend had
asked me to explain it in order to keep me
quiet. However, the measure inu its present
shape presents none of the difficulties that I
saw in the original draft.
The bill is entitled, "An Act to confer certain transitional powers upon the Governor in
Council during the national emergency arising out of the war." I have divided consideration of it into four headings. Under the first
I suggest that we acquaint ourselves with the
nature and scope of the bill.
The scheme of this bill involves, first, a
provision to terminate the War Measures Act.
Secondly, section four authorizes the Government to continue the orders and regulations
made under that Act. In the third place, it
bestows very wide powers upon the Governor in Council. That is done by section 2,
and I propose at a later stage of my examination of the bill to read to the Senate the
provisions of that section.
In considering the nature and scope of this
bill I think it is well for honourable members
to understand that as a result of the last
election the Government of this country received a definite mandate to carry on its
post-war programme. The bill, as I follow it,
contains the basic powers to enable the Government -to do that. I think it is at least
two months since the bill in its original form
was introduced in another place. It has been
before Parliament ever since, and it has been
discussed and radically amended. It has a
basic relation to the powers of the Government to carry on its post-war programme,
and was introduced in the first session of
Parliament after the election. As I see it, in
those cireumstances the duty of the Senate
with respect to the bill is very definite and
restricted. The Senate should not retard passage of the bill in any way, or obstruct or
limit the powers that the Government has
asked Parliament to give it. The duty of
this House in considering a bill of this kind
in the circumstances that I have m'entioned
is to offer constructive criticism, if that may
be made, and to go no further.
The second heading for consideration is
the constitutional aspect of the bill. There
is no question, honourable senators, that this
measure definitely and extensively invades
the powers normally exercised by the provinces under section 92 of the British North
America Act, and more particularly in conHon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

nection with property and civil rights.~ The
bill, as I have already said, terminates, the
War Measures Act. From a speech made by
the Minister of Justice in another place I
understand that it is the Government's present policy to divide emergencies into two
classes-war and post-war-and that in so doing it is carrying out a recommendation made
by the Canadian Bar Association. Honourable senators will recall that when the War
Charities Bill was before us last week there
was a rather full discussion on the question
of the Dominion's powers to enact war and
post-war measures in times of emergency. The
discussion was participated in particularly by
the legal members, who I suppose are best
qualified to deal with such a matter. I was
among those privileged to participate.
At
that time reference was made to the case of
the Fort Frances Pulp and Paper Company
versus the Manitoba Free Press, an action
having to do with a dispute that arose between certain pulp and paper companies and
the Paper Controller some two or three years
after the last war. In that case the Privy
Council laid down a definite proposition which
is applicable to our consideration of the present question. It was this, that the general
provisions of section 91 empowering the Dominion to make laws for the peace, order and
good government of Canada must of necessity
in case of a grave national emergency confer
very wide powers upon the federal Parliament.
I take it that when we consider this question,
divorced from ail political aspects, there is not
a single honourable member who will not agree
that Canada's post-war emergency arising
out of its international problems is almost as
grave as was the war emergency itself. There
can be no doubt in our minds that as a
matter of practical government it would be
almost impossible at this time to leave inany
of the matters referred to in section 2 of the
bill to the casual and disjointed administration of the provinces, as would happen in
normal times. That cannot be donc. I think
we are in agreement that there is a grave
post-war emergency which fully satisfies the
requirements laid down' by the Privy Council
and so confers jurisdiction upon the Dominion.
That brings us to the third heading for
consideration. It is one thing to say there is
an emergency; it is another to decide what
powers should be taken away from the provinces and conferred upon the Dominion in
order to deal with that emergency. I would
ask honourable senators to consider the regulations and orders in council passed under
the War Measures Act. I have not checked
up to flnd out how many hundreds or thousands
of these regulations and orders in council

DFECEMBEe 10, 1945
have been passed in the last six years. The
number is very large. While it might be worthwhule on a political platforrn to criticize the
Government, for passing so many orders, I feel
that wvhen we look at the matter seriously we
recognize that most of thern were necessary
and appropriate. Now we corne to, this position. TPhe ,War Measures Act is to be terrminated and a new Act is to take its place,
but rnany of these orders and regulations are
still operative and haveï not been completely
fulfilled. How are you going to bridge the gap?
The orders in counicil that have not beenl
fulfilled must be continued. This presenits
sorne difflculty. The original bill provided that
Parliarnent should declare holus-bolus, if I
rnay use that expression, that ail these regula
tions and orders i couneil should be validated
and continued i force. Well, that was asking
a lot of Farliament, because, it was flot practicable to have ail these, regulations and orders
printed and~placed before hoth Houses. If
they all hadi been prinited, there is not a
chance i the world that they could have
been studied and understood. before Christmas.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Will the honourable
gentleman permit a question?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Is there anything in
this bill that restricts the power of the Governor i Council to pass as rnany orders in
èouncil as before? As I read it, the bill
gives the Governor in Council even more power
tîhan he had under the War Measures Act.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I shaîl corne to, that
in a minute. I have arranged rny argument
in what I hope is a rather logical sequence,
and I do not want to omit any of the points
that I think should be dealt with.
I amn dealing first with the Orders in Council and the regulat-ions actively operating on
the day when this new rneasure replaces the
War Measures Act. What are you going to
do with all those past Orders in Council?
You cannot drop thern and start de novo;
you would have confusion worse confounded.
It was first suggested that Parliarnent should
more or less sight unseen give all these past
Orders in Coundil validity for the dumation of
the new measure.
Exception was taken to that suggestion, and
I can understand- the justification for it. Any
member of this or the other House miglit
have said, "Well, that is a large ordier, that is
asking a great deal of Parliamen.t." So a
compromise was reached which. seems to me
to be rather a sensible plan. In effeot Parliament said, "Ail right, the Government has
47704-27

39U

pa.ssed these Orders in Council. We as a
Parliarnent will not take the responsibility
of passing them over again because we have
not seen thern; but the Government that has
passed themn will be given the power and the
responsibility of continuing these Orders in
Council so far as it rnay be necessary to do
so." That is wh'at is provided by section 4.
I do flot want to, labour that, honourable
members, but I say some method had to, he
adopted for giving continuity to legisiation.
Because that is what these Orders in Council
are; they are a form of legisiation necessary
under the emergency conditions that have
existed. And so if we are to. bridge the gap
and, carry these regulations over some provis ion must be made. That has been done
by saying, "The Governrnent shall accept
responsibility now and for the future-mark
you, future only so far as this new Act continues--of reinstating or giving continuity of
operation to so many of the Orders in Counicil
and regulations now existing as they may
consider necessary to provide for this con,
tin-uity of operation." That is sensible; I do
not know of any 'better system.
The next thing we have to consider-this
deals somewhat with what my honourable
friend from L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Léger) has
juat asked-refers to the new powers under
this bill. They are very widie; so wide that I
think we should know exactiy what they are,
and I arn going to caîl your attention to them.
They are found in this section 2:
2. (1) The Governor in Cour&eil may do and
authorize sucli acts and thinge, andl make f rom
time to time sucli orders -and iregulations, as lie
may, bY Tesson of the contin-ued existence of the
national, emergency .arising out of -the war
'against Germany snd Japan, deem necessaTy or
-advisahle for -the purpose of
(a) pr-oviding for and maintaining the sried
forces of Canada during the occupation of enemy
territory and demobilization and providing for
the rehabilitation of members thereof,I do not know how we could do less than
give the Governrnent that power.
Hon Mr. LEGER: There is no objection to
that.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: In fact I arn not sure
tha-t rny honourable friend will object to any
of the subdivisions of the section.
Hon. Mr. LEGER. I arn not so sure.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: (Reading)
ý(b) facilitating the readjustment of industry
-and commerce ito the requirements ci the coInmuaity in time of peace,
What are you goîng to do about that,
would you cut it down?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK:

REVISED EflITION

I should like to

400

SENATE

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Could I put it into
plainer language? "Facilitating"-my honourable friend knows what that means.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Could you put it
into more obscure language?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: "Facilitating the readjustment of industry." I take it that that is
plain enough. If my honourable friend asks
me, "How are you going to facilitate it?" I
would say that a year after the facilitations
have taken place you could look back at them
and find what they are; but I should think
they can only be ascertained from time to
time as occasion arises.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: It is not clear
what the requirements may be.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I do not know what
the requilrements may be; but I do know
it means power is left in the Government
so that whatever exigencies may arise they
can use it to facilitate the readjustment of
industry. I have not the slightest doubt that
that is a mighty good thing for Canada.
An Hon. SENATOR:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Let me repeat that
paragraph:
(b)' facilitating the readjustment of industry
and commerce to the requirements of the conmunity in time of peace,
This is the next paragraph:
(c) mainitaining, controlling and regulating
supplies and services, prices, transportation, use
and occupation of property, rentals, employment salaries and wages to ensure economic
stability and an orderly transition 'to conditions
of peace;
My honourable friend from L'Acadie says:
"Is not that as wide a power as the Government had under the War Measures Act, or
even wider? I say it is equally wide, and I
cannot believe that any honourable senator
-including
my honourable friend from
L'Acadie-lias any doubt that the necessities
for the exercise of that ýpower are just as
great to-day as they have been at any time
in the last five years.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: The only objection I
would have there is to "use and occupation
of property and rentals." And I am not a
landlord.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: What would my honourable friend suggest?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I would cut that out
entirely. I think the country would be better
for it.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I should think that was
one of the most essential provisions in this
bill.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK.

Hon. Mr. LEGER: I do not agree with my
honourable friend; that is all.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: The next provision is
this:
(d) assisting the relief of suffering and the
restoration and distribution of essential supplies
and services in any part of His Majesty's dominions or in foreign countries that are in grave
distress as the result of the war;
Unless some point is raised, I would assume
there is no question about that.
(e) continuing or discontinuing in an orderly
manner, as the emergency permits, measures
adopted during and by ýreason of the war.
I hope, honourable senators, that the accent
by Parliament, and particularly by the Government, will be on the word "discontinuing."
Those powers, as I have said, are wide
It will be recalled that in the original bill
there were other provisions in this section that
were very disturbing. They are not there now.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:

Why?

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Well, I am not a
mind-reader. I understand there were some
sections about deportation and matters of
that kind. I suspect they were put in by
departmental officers rather than by members
of the Government.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
in the bill?

Was that the only change

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I have not analyzed
all of them. My honourable friend has both
bills before him.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I suggest to my honourable friend that that is not the real basis.
The answer to my question is that the
provinces objected to the wide powers contained in the original bill.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS:
provinces did.

I

understood

the

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: And public opinion.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I do not know about
publie opinion, but I know the provinces did.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I do not know what
my honourable friend implies by public
opinion.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I did not say anything
about public opinion. I was answering the
interjection of my honourable friend from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck). I asked
the honourable gentleman whether at the
recent Dominion-provincial conference the
provinces did not insist that drastic amendments should be made to the original bill.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I do not know about
drastic amendiments.

DECEMBER 10, 1945
Hon. Mr. COPP: Has a report been published of what took place ini the conférence?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It was published -in the
press.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: My information is that
the provinces took exception to saine parts
of this bill. I do not know whether those parts
have been eliminated or not. I take it that
the provinces were objecting to the invasion
of provincial rights. So far as they were
objecting on that broad principle, I ar n ot
entirely in sympathy with thexn. Generally
speaking, I have the strongest views on the
maintenance of the powers coniferred upon the
provinces by the British North America Act;
but in the present period and in the immediate
emergency confronting us, I arn not at all
sure that the provinces have weil taken their
point when they say, "We. abject to the invasion of provincial rights." If in the provision
I arn going to deal with in a moment there is
any suggestion of permanent interference with
the provisions of section 92 of the, British
North America Act, then I say I arn one
hundred per cent in agreemenit with the provinces. We do not know exactly what the
ministers of the various provinces said, because
what leaks out in the newspapers can-not ha
regarded as authentie. But I want to put it
to tha honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig) and to other members that Parliament,
including this House, bas in connection with
this bill to do one of two things. Either it
must restrict toý a minimum the powers to
be conferrad on the Government and hope
that those powars so restricted wili, be wide
anough, and if they are not that the Government wiIl caîl Parliament into special session
to confer additional powars; or, in the alternative, Parliament must say, "We are going
to niake the powers that we confar on the
Govarnmant as wide as wa think will. be
sufficiant te covar every emergancy ýthat may
arise, and than reiy on threa things: first, the
good sanse of the Government, that they
will flot abuse these powars; secondly, the
short period for which these powers are givan
is very short; thirdly, tha provisions
-it
of thîs bill by which Parliament can annul
any action that the Governmant takes. The
bill provides that orders in council passed by
the Govern.ment, and reportae& te Parliament
within a opecifled time, may ha annulled by
a rasolution of the two Houses.
I wish to caîl to tha attention cf honourable sanators, a very important amendmant
mada in committea of tha other place. When
the bill was submittad by the Ministar of
Justice in its second draft formn it contained
the provision that either House could annul
47704-27J

401

by resolution any order iii council passed by
the Govarnmanýt. I should have thought that
was a logical provision and that the bill should
have remainad in that form. However, in comnmnittae it was decided otharwise; and the
change is vary important in relation- te the
recognition of the powers cf the Sanate. By the
change in the form. of tha bill as presented by
Mr. St. Laurent, the other buse has declared,
it bas se much confidence in the Government as to the exarcise of their wide powers
that, by a selfo-denying ordnance, it bas deprived itsalf of the power, alone, te repeal
any order in council. An ordar ini council
can be repealed only by the joint action of
both Housas. To my mnd. this is very significant. In the first place, it is an avidience
hy the oth-er Chamnber of its confidence in
the discretion of the Government; in tha
second place, it is a ramarkabla tributa te
the Senata.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. iFARRIS: It is the declared
opinion cf the Commons that any action on
its .part must be concurrad in by tha Sanata.
I arn sure, honourable sanators, that this
House is duly appreciative cf the action taken
in cemmittea in another place, and will, not
in any way rapudiata the recognition cf the
fact that ne rasolution by tha other House
can be effective unless it bas the concurrence
of the Senate as well.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Will the honourable senator please tell me what section contains the
provision te which hae bas just referred?
Hon. Mr. FARIRIS: It is Section 2, subsection 3:
Evary order in council, made under this Act
shail ha laid before Parliament within flfteen
days af.tar it bas been madle if Parliamant is
then sitting, or if P-ariament la not then sitting,
within fiftaen days aftar the commencement of
the next ensuing session thereofWhen Mr. St. Laurent brought the bill in
it contained the words, "if the Senate or"'.
Now it reado as follows:
-if 'the Senate and bouse of Commons within
the period of forty days, beginning with the day
on whieh ýany such order in council ie laid before
Parliament and excluding any time during which
Parliament le dissolved or prorogued or during
which both the Sonate and the bouse of Commens are a.djournad for more than four days,
resolve that it ha annulladThat means that if the Senata and the
House of Commons bath resolve that an
order in coun-cil is te be annullad, it shahl
cease te have effect, but without prejudice te
previeus operations.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. VIEN: In what particular does
this section add any powers to Parliament,
since Parliament has the power to repeal the
whole Act?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: That is true, but Parliament acts by means of legislation, which
requires the introduction, and the first, second
and third readings of a bill in both Houses,
and the assent by His Majesty, or his representative the Governor General. The bill provides that annulment can be effected simply
by a joint resolution of both Houses. I repeat that when Mr. St. Laurent brought Bill
15 into the other place it provided that either
House could by resolution annul an order in
council. Apparently the members of the other
Chamber were not satisfied to entrust to
themselves alone the responsibility of annulling
orders in counéil, and they have now insisted
that the resolution to be effective must also
pass the Senate.
Honourable senators, the one further question in regard to this bill that should be considered is its duration. I call the attention
of honourable senators to the recital of the
bill. It is a transitional bill. There is no
label of permanency about it. It is a bill to
get us from a wartime emergency into a postwar emergency, and from that into a normal
peace-time period. How long that will take
no one knows. This bill provides for one
year and possibly longerHon. Mr. LEGER: Possibly two years.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: -if the House is not
sitting when the time is up.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: It will possibly last two
years.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: No, that would be impossible.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: If Parliament met in
December, 1947 it would last two years.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Yes, but let us be
realistic about these things. The Government of the country must have the estimates
passed, and they are not going to juggle them
to extend the term of the bill. If the Government want to extend the life of the bill
they must assume that they have the power
of the House of Commons behind them. If
there was an election on somebody might
want to make a speechHon. Mr. LEGER: Either I do not understand the section or it is worded in such a
way as to be very confusing.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I do not think it is
confusing at all. Let me read it to my
honourable friend:
Hon. Mr. FARRIS.

Subjeet as hereinafter provided, this Act shal]

Hon. Mr. LEGER:
period there.

We have

a definite

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Is there any trouble
about that?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: No.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: And then:
-if parliament meets during November or December, one thousand nine hundred and fortysixMy honourable friend will see the purpose
of that provision, because some decision bas
to be made for the future.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: It does not state what
would happen if Parliament met before that
date.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Those are the times in
which it naturally would be necessary for
Parliament to make provision for the future.
These matters should be dealt with on a realistic basis. If Parliament is not sitting within
a month or two of the expiry of this bill it
is carried over until such time as Parliament
is sitting.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: That is reasonable.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Let me read further:
-if Parliament does not so meet it shall expire
on the 15th day ýafter Parliament first meets
during 'the year one thousand nine hundred and
fo-rty-sevenOf course under the British North America
Act a new Parliament must be sitting within
a year of the termination of the previous
Parliament. There are other practical necessities, the greatest of which is the thirty-first
day of March.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: This year we met in
September.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Yes, we met in September this year, but provisional estimates
were passed to carry us over. To start with
we can assume that the Government are carrying on intelligently and that when the session
is called Parliament will be behind them. I
can see no reason for my honourable friend
raising the objection.
So far we have been dealing with the termi
of this bill, and the provision that the bill
will terminate when Parliament is in session
at the end of 1946. If Parliament is not in
session the bill will terminate fifteen days
after Parliament does meet in the following
year. We can assume under those circumstances that Parliament would meet well
before the 31st of March in order to get the
estimates through.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon.' WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, in response to the
specific request of the honourable gentleman
from Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duff), and for the
general information of honourable members,
I should like to make a statement, based on
the best information that I have been able
to secure up to the present moment, as to
the legislation that is likely to come before

us.
I will deal first with legisliation now in the
other place, and which will be presented for
our consideration. It comprises: the Supply
bill; amendments to the National Housing
Act, 1944; an amendment to the Senate and
House of Commons Act to provide an allowance for sessional expenses; the Bretton
Woods ratification agreement; an agreement
with the Province of Alberta to amend the
agreement entered into with that province
under the authority of the Dominion-Provincial Taxation Agreement Act, 1942; a bill
to amend the Veterans' Land Act 1942; a bill
to provide rehabilitation allowances to unemployed veterans; four bills-arising out of
budget resolutions-to amend, respectively,
the Income War Tax Act, the Excess Profits
Tax Act, the Dominion Succession Duty Act
and the Special War Revenue Act; a resolution confirming the action of the Prime Minister of Great Britairi, the President of the
United States and the Prime Minister of
Canada, with respect to the atomie bomb.
As far as our own House is concerned this
is the situation. On our Order Paper today
there are two bills which have been returned
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

from the House of Commons with certain
amendments; also an item for consideration

of the amendments made by the Banking and
Commerce Committee to the Department of
Reconstruction and Supply Bill. I hope we
may be able to pass this bill today, and so

faciliýtate progress.
Other legislation now
before the Senate or its committees includes:
the National Emergency Powers Bill; the
War Appropriation Bill, and the Export
Credits Insurance Bill. We are arranging for
a meeting of the
evening to further
priation Bill, and
will be a meeting
merce Committee

of the Banking and Comto deal with the Export

National Emergency Powers Bill second reading today, it is my intention to refer it also
to that committee. If the committee could
dispose of those bills tomorrow morning, we
might be able to give them third reading at
the afternoon sitting, thus cleaning up our
Order Paper preparatory to the reception of
whatever legislation may come to us from
the House of Commons. The only other matter awaiting our consideration is the current
resolution in respect to the atomic bomb
agreement.
That, I hope, affords my honourable friend
from Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duff) the information which he asked for yesterday.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: I would call the attention of the honourable leader of the Government to an important meeting of the Internal
Economy Committee tomorrow morning at
11.30.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Honourable senators, I
appreciate the information which the honourable leader of the Government has given us.
We are still up in the air as to what may
happen to the legislation still before the other
House. I suppose we shall have to "wait and
see." It does seem to me that if all the
legislation the honourable leader has enumerated is yet to corne to us from the other
Chamber, we shall have to stay here over the
New Year to get through the work of the
session, and that it would be well for us to
order our Christmas turkey dinner here.
INCOME AND EXCESS PROFITS

The Senate proceeded to the consideration
of the third report of the Special Committee
appointed to examine into the provisions and
workings of the Income War Tax Act and
the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940.

That particular rule is part of the British
North America Act of 1875, otherwise known,
as the Parliament of Canad, Act. Assuming
t.he interpretation of the rule is correct, the
,cornmittee cannot possibly sit cLuring the
intervening two months. This is a regrettable
situation, for if that portion of the comnmittee's report dealing with special sittings
cannot be passed the other sections are of no
value. 1 would therefore beg leave to withdraw the report.
In conclusion, I wish to say that if the
rules of this honourable Senate and its coinmittees are under the control of the British
North America Act, it is time the Parliamenit
of Canada excrcised the right to amend its
own constitution, as South Africa, Australia
and New Zealand have doue.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: With the consent of the
House, may I say a word on this subject?

for the section so ýrepealed.

Hon, W. D. EULER: Honourable senators,
the report of the Speciai Committee on Incorne Tax was submitted by me to the Senate
iast week. As honourable senators will rcmember, that report contained a request that the
committee be permitted to continue after
prorogation.
Whule I gave the reasons for that request
when the report was prescnted, I might review
them bricfly now. The committee has a very
large field to cover, and if it cannot function
during the two months or more of the recess
it wiil be quite impossible for it to make
any recommendations to the Governint in
time to be incorporated in the Budget of 1946.
This would resuit in the work of the committee being projectcd into 1947.
When I presentcd the report of the coinmittee, an honourable senator pointed out
that according to parliamcntary practice ahl
committees are dissolved when Parliament
prorogues, and therefore cannot ait between
sessions. As that limitation apparently applies
to both the House of Commous and the
Senate, the committee would have no authority
until it was re-appointed at the euauiug
session. Further, it was stated that a proposai
that the committee sit, or that it be authorized
by the House to ait after -prorogation, would
be an invasion of the Royal prorogative. To
my non-legal mind such an interpretation
seems rather theoreticai and technical-I
might say unprogressive and impractical, and
certainly not in conformity with the muchtalked-of principles of democracy. Whîle it
is contrary to the ruies of the Senate to prolong or continue committees after prorogation,
thcy can ait after adjournment.-a distinction
which docs not appeal to me: and since our
committee rules are made by the Senate,
I sec no reason why this House could not
revise, modify or suspend those rules.
I took occasion to consuit the Law Clerk
of the Senate about this matter, and hie has
submittcd a rather lengthy memorandum
which I ahail now read in part. It says:
Mýay's Parliamentar>' Practice 13th edition
at pýage Z6 say:-

SENATE
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I am only making a suggestion. Like the honourable gentleman from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler), I think this Tax
Committee is rendering a real service to the
country. Perhaps I am influenced in my view
by the considerable time that I have spent
at the committee's meetings. It seems to me
that it would have been very helpful to the
Government to have an interim report made
by the committee shortly after the opening of
the next session. If the committee does no
work between sessions it will be impossible
for it to make a report at that time, and
therefore any recommendations it might make
could not be given effect to until a year later.
To be of use to the Government the committee's interim report should be made shortly
after the next session begins. I do not know
whether the honourable leader of the Government in this Chamber would care to represent
to his colleagues in the Cabinet the desirability of passing an order in council converting
the committee into a Royal Commission after
prorogation.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: This is the first
time I have heard such a suggestion. If
representations are made to me on behalf of
the Committee I shall be only too happy to
pass them on.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable senators,
it seems to me that the point raised by the
honourable leader on this side (Hon. Mr.
Haig) should not be passed over lightly. The
revising of our tax structure is an exceedingly
important matter, and unless the committee
can make a report early next session we all
know what will happen. I am strongly inclined
to the view that it would be a good thing if
some means were agreed upon for continuing
the investigation by a commission or some
other body, if it cannot be continued by a
committee of the Senate. Various organizations and people are eager to give evidence.
Even if after prorogation nothing were done
beyond recording their evidence, that would
expedite matters to some extent at least. I
should think that before we prorogue we should
give a good deal of consideration to the
desirability of having the inquiry continue
between sessions.
Hon. Mr. EULER: If I may speak a second
time, I would add that there is another
difficulty. The mere fact that the committee
itself cannot function means that the experts
whom we have retained will find it practically
impossible to carry on the work they otherwrise could have done between sessions. That
is especially so since the request that we made
Hon. Mr. EULER.

for funds, which are absolutely necessary if
these officials are to carry on, has not yet been
granted.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Question.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it your
pleasure, honourable senators that the honourable gentleman from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) be allowed to withdraw the report?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Carried.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, for the benefit of some honourable
members who have raised a question on this
matter, I wish to state that the Banking and

to be present when these amendments were
being discussed and inasmuch as they have a
direct bearing upon the Minister's powers to
renegotiate war contracts I made it a point as

minds.
Hon. Mr. MeRAE: Honourable senators,
I do not wish this occasion to, pass without
expressing for myself, and I amn sure for every
member of the committee, appreciation of the~
excellent service rendered by the three legal
members who originally discussed the bill in
this House (Hon. Mr. Hayden, Hon. Mr.
Campbell and Hon. Mr. Bench), and by my
honourabie colleagýue frorn Vancouver South
(Ho>n. Mr. Farris), who in committee adjusted
the latter part of the bill. They devoted a
great deal of time to this matter and gave it
very serious consideration. I neyer before knew
of so muoli legal advice being given for nothing.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: I arn sure we ail are
deeply grateful to them for the active interest
they took i this bill.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Free advice is usually
bad advice.
Hon. Mr. MeRAE: Not this time.
The motion w.as agreed to, and the amendments were concurred in.
NATIONAL EMERGENCY TRANSITIONAL POWERS BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the adj ourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Robertson for the second reading of Bill 15,
an Act to confer certain transitional. powers
upon the Governor in Council during the
national ernergency arising out of the War.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, Bill 15 is probably the best-known bill
that lias corne frorn the other place this
session.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Would rny honourable
friend leave out the word "known" and
describe it as the best bill?
Hon. Mr.! HAIG: I sirnply say that it is
the best-known bill. I do not thinkany other
measure of this session was more thoroughly
discussed in the other House. The bill bas
had a strange history. In its original f orrn
47704-28
EEnIED

407

it was strongly criticized by an honourable
member of another place a day or two before
the Dominion-Provincial Conference was held.
According to press reports-Il arn going by
nothing else, for I have no secret information-representations made by some of the
provincial premiers restlted in certain modiâfications or changes in the bill. Be that as it
may, frorn the standpoint of suitabilâty the
bill is much better than the one originally
proposed.
Last evening I listened with a great deal
of pleasure to the address of the honourable
senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris). Not being an authority on constitutional law, I shall not venture to express any
opinion on the constitutionality of the bill,
but I admit that he seerned to make out a
fairly good case in that respect. What worries me is not the bill itself but the sentiment
behind it. There is apparently in the Ottawa
area a determination to continue ail wartime
controls into peacetirne. I appreciate the
honourable gentleman's statement that the
operation of the bill is limîted to a maximum
of two years; but 1 arn disturbed that it
sbould be thouglit necessary to introduce such
a drastic measure. I amn persuaded that a
lot of government officiais in Ottawa think
they are not only the Government of Canada,
but also the House of Commons and the
Senate, rather than servants of the people.
The sooner they get that notion out of their
heads, unquestionahly the better it will be
for thern and for 'Canada.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I shahl deal with this
aspect a little more in detail when I discus
section 2, but I feel that that sentiment la
implicit in the bull. As Canadians we readily
admit that some of these officiais, many of
them as dolhar-a-year men, rendered a great
national service during the war; but we do not
believe in bureaucra;tic government. It does
not matter how -able one of these officiais may
be, lie is not answerable to the people. Responsibility to the electorate is the underlying
principlie of dernocratic government. The
people should be ýat liberty to make their own
mistakes-and they make them througb their
elected representatives. Someone *may say to
me, "Ail right, rny dear Haig, but you are
not an elected representative of the people."
I reply, "Yes, I amn. I was elected to this
House because the government in power at
the time a Senate vacancy oecurred in Manitoba saw fit, wisely or unwisely, to appoint
me to this Chamber." I go home and in discussion with the people of my province-and
I may afdr, of several. other provinces--get
their opinions on questions that are, upperEDMTIN

most in their minds. In judging those opinions
I ar nfot influenced by reflecting how they
may affect me politically, but how they will
affect the country as a whole. This feeling of
detachment is, I submait, a very important
factor in deaiing with public questions.
I corne nuw to the erincipal section of the
bill, section 2, which. confers certain powers
on the Governýor in Council. Paragraph (a)
provides for the maintenance of aur armed
forces during the occupation of enemy territory. This is necessary. I do nlot sec any
occasion for the next paragraph:
(b) Facilitating the .readjustment of industry
,and commerce to the requirements of the community in time of peýace.
Industry itseif will take care of its rcadjustment from war to peace. The Government
rnay facilitate that readjustment, but that is
one of the purposes of the bill we psased a
few minutes ago. This paragraph may flot do
any barma, but I tbink it is supcrfluous.
The really operative paragraph is (c):
Maintaining, controlling .and regui.ating supplies and services, prices, transportation, use and
occupation of property, rentals, employment,
salaries and wages to ensure economi e t'ability
and an orderly transition to conditions of peace.
Wc as members of the Senate are here
because certain of aur provinces declined to
enter Confederation unless they were given
representation in this Blouse out of proportion
to their population or wealth. There is littie
doubt that the Maritime Provinces would
neyer have corne into Confederation but for
the provision in the British North Arnerica
Act that thcy shouid have one-third of the
represèntation in this Blouse, a proportion
which by subsequent agreement was reduced
to one-quarter. They have one-tenth of the
mcrnbcrship of the Blouse of Commons, and
if their representation was strictiy on a population basis they would not enjoy even that
proportion. A perusal of the Confederation
debates discioses that the province of Qucbec
agreed ta Confederation, much more readily
when it was conceded one-third of the, representation in the Senate-since by agreemnent
rcduced ta one-quarter. In fact ail the
provinces insisted on a second Chamber in
whicha there would not 'be the disparity that
would resuit fromn a strict application of
representation by population. I subrnit that
this paragraph is an interference with provincial
riglits. 1 was giad the honourabie senator
from L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Léger) questioned
the continued contrai of property and rentais.
On rentai contrai I ar n ot speaking for my
.party, but strictiy for myscif. The contrai
of rents bas been one of the chief causes of
aur housing shortage.
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Blear, hear.
Bon. Mr'. HAIG: I diefy any peýrson ta dis&
prove my statement. The erection of houses
by aur srnaii builders is a kind of semispeculation and semi-occupational job. They
build houses te, seil, and if they cannot seli
thcy rent thcm. The minute you put on
rentai contrais you stop the building of small
speculative dwcliings. True, it may be said
that those cngaged in building construction
could nlot get supplies. That is a mistaken
idea. They could get supplies until the contrais went into effect. Then the trouble started,
and the srnall builder cither modificd his
plans or abandoned. thern altagether. The
reason was obvious. Why wouid any man
undertake speculative building when the supply
of materiais becarne scarcer and scarcer and
prices rase higher and higher, and he was
faced with the addit.ional drawback of
incfficien.t labour? As a resuit, during the war
the average cost of building rose about 25
per cent. Irnrediately the housing and rentai
contrais wcnt into aperation real estate values
increased, and anybody that knew anything
about housing immediateiy said; "My house
is now worth $1,000 or $1,500 more.' Client
after client came ta me and said, "I want ta
seli ry house. What shahl I ask for it?" I
said. "Put up yaur price by $1,000 or $1,500,
and you wiil get it." What happened nfter
rentai contrai? You couid flot put a tenant
out under six rnunths, and later yau could
flot put him out et ail. This simply aggravatcd
conditions, and to-day we have one of the
rnost acute housing shortages in the history
of the country.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Right!
Hon. Mr. HAIG: We have been stampeded
naw into adopting a Governrnent housing
sceere. I have discussed that before and I
wiil flot repeat my rernarks. If there was
ever an invasion, of property rights yau have
it in this paragraph. In rny opinion nlot ane
of the housing and rentai contrais cen be
justified as a war emergency mýeasure. The
war did flot destray or deamege any bouses in
Canada. If this were Englend, where so rneny
buildings bave been destrayed, I could understand this law.
May I say a ward about salaries and wages?
Weges of organized labour have been steedily
rising. Orders in coýuncil did flot stop increases in wages, but oniy restricted the incarne of the white-coiiar man.
An Hon. SENATOR:

Blear, hear.

Haon. Mr. HAIG: Contrais prevented an
inerjase in,. salaries ta people such as teechers.
When it wes suggested thet seiary contrais be

4MX

DECEMBER 11, 1945
removed, it was said, "Oh, we wili have inflation.." I can tell you that with 200,000
unemployed people in Canada we will not
have inflation very much longer.
Section 2, paragrapli (c) of the bill makes
use of the words, "to ensure econornic
stabulity". I do not grasp the meaning-of
those words. The next phrase is, "and an
orderly transition to conditions of peace".

Hon. Mr. BENCH: From our experiences
in the last warHon. Mr. HAIG: The last war did not
creaite that problern. Unfortunately 1 arn old
enough to rernember the last war.

Hon. Mr. LEGER: Nobody understands
that.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I cannot appreciate what
transition has to take place. The manufacturing output of Canada for the rnonth of
October, 1944 was back te the 1942 level.
Transition is taking place of its own accord.
Now we are lending 8600,000,000 or $650,000,000 to Europe, and for a ' while there, will be
a certain demand. But when that dernand
is filled what wiil happen? I think -we wil
have a transition to pence without any act
of Parliarnent.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Would the honourable
gentleman be in favour of releasing ail the
controls and letting inflation run wild?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, I would not. I will
deal with that matter when I corne to paragraph (e).
Hon. Mr. BENCH: My onily reason for
asking is that rny honourable friend appears
to be dissecting paragrapli (c) and criticizing
it pieceineai.
Hon. Mr. HAIG : Yes, I arn.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: In order to get the ful
effect of the clause it muet be read as a
whole. ARl these various controis are required
for the purpose of ensuring economie stability
and an orderly transition to conditions oi
peace.
'Hon. Mr. HAIG: My contention is that
these controls should have nothing to do
with property. I maintain that they shouid
have nothing to do with rentais, because the
cure is worse than the disease.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Surely the control of
rentals is an elernent in the cost of living.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, but when you put on
controis you cut off supply.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Why include salaries
in the controis?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, why are salaries
controiied? There are plenty of people te
take the jobs, and the only controls necessary
are those that will keep wages frorn going
too low. In rny opinion they are nut likeiy
to go too higli.
47704-28à

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I apologize. I did flot
mean to direct that remark to my honourable
friend.
I can sce the necessity for paragrapli (c) of
the section. I entirely agree with comments
of the hoxiourahle senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) in -regard to it.
I appreciated very mucîh the closing wosrds
of the honourahle senator from VancouverBurrard (Hon. Mr. McGeer) when lie said we
muet stand up and flght to rid ourselves of
controls and regulations. I arn trying to do
that in a srnall and humble way today. While
I arn willing to vote for this bill, I may say
quite candidly that a large number of its provisions are not necessary. One can easily
understand why the Governrnent is reluctant
to give up the controLs-ift is mucli more convenient to pass an order in councîl than to
pass an act of Parliarnent.
If we do flot stand up now and fight against
regulation and -regirnentation another party
rnay corne into control in another place, who
will say to us: "You passed regulations in days
gone by, why do you refuse to do so now?"
I do not believe at ail in the principles of
one of the parties in this country which 18
now clamouring for regirnentation. We should
carry out our own policy, and it should not be
one of regimentation and control.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. S. A. HAYDEN: Honourable senators,
there are one or two items of interest in this
bill which I think should have the attention
of honourable senators in cornrittee.
Section 5 of the bill, purports to provide
that the war against Gerrnany and Japan
shall for the purposes of the War Measures
Act be deemed no longer to exist as of January 1, 1946. This section is very çarefully
worded. I think it, is irnportant for us to
know why the section is worded as it is,
because it does not purport to say that the
state of war is at an end. As honourable
senators know, when Canada entered this war
it was by virtue, first, of a proclamation
declaring an apprehended state of war. This
was fuhlowed by an ernergency meeting of
Parliarnent at which. a resolution was passed

Some Hon. SENATORS:

Oh, oh!

Hon. Mr. BENCH: That was a solar plexus
biow.

410

SENATE

authorizing the declaration of war, and subsequently by a proclamation by the Governor in
Council declaring war. That proclamation by
the Governor in Council declaring that a
state of war existed as of September 10,
1939, was not passed under the provisions of
the War Measures Act, but rather, by virtue
of a certain provision of the Act, such
proclamation made the provisions of the
Act operative. That proclamation is still outstanding, and there are many contracts in
existence, containing various provisions as to
terms, dates, and the rights of the parties to
the contracts. I would assume from the provisions of paragraph 5 that such contracts are
not to be dealt with by virtue of the powers
contained in this bill. I think the Government's attitude in this respect should be
clarified.
I would point out further that while the
bill «in its present form, is .much better than
it was in its earlier form, I arn still not satisfied as to its effect. It will be observed
that orders in council and administrators'
orders passed. under the War Measures Act
remain in force after the lst of January, 1946,
under the provisions of this bill. They continue in force only if the Governor in Council passes an order making them effective.
For instance some of the orders in council
affecting the Foreign Exchange Control Board
come into force and effect under authority of
this bill. Yet, in the orders passed during the
war by the Foreign Exchange Control Board
provisions are to be found which take away
every vestige of civil liberty ·that we enjoy.
This is no reflection on the administration
of the Foreign Exchange Control Board; but
we find in the orders authority for taking a
person into some kind of custody, detaining
him, taking him before an examiner, refusing
him counsel, examining him under oath and
subsequently laying a charge against him, and
then, on the trial, reading evidence which
was taken in that ex parte way, for the purpose of convicting him.
While extraordinary procedures of that kind
may be entirely justifiable in war-time, I
wonder how far we should go in approving of
them in peace-time. In committee it might be
advisable to consider whether it would not
be in the best interests of Canada to provide
under this bill some sort of blanket investigatory powers, whereby some of the civil
liberties of the subject would be restored and
at the same time necessary controls would be
maintained by continuing certain war-time
orders in full force and effect, but minus their
objectionable features.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN.

On the question of what is meant in section
2 (1) (c) by giving the Governor in Council
power to authorize acts for maintaining, controlling and regulating the use and occupation
of property, I find myself in the same position
as the honourable gentleman who spoke last
(Hon. Mr. Haig). For the life of me I cannot
comprehend what authority the federal
Government needs for maintaining, controlling
and regulating use and occupation of property,
when rentals are also separately mentioned in
this subsection. So I think soma clarification
of this matter is needed. In closing I wish
ta state that I intend to support passage of
the bill.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I desire to supplement the view that
bas been so well expressed by my honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. Haig). He, however, did
not touch on ceiling prices, and that is a
matter that I particularly want to speak about.
I know the argument of the Government is
that if you increase ceiling prices you run the
risk of inflation; but a large class of goods
manufactured in this country could be removed
from under the price ceiling with very little
effect on the cost of living. As honourable
senators know, I have been in business since
my very young days, first with smaller private
enterprises and later with large industrial concerns, with which I am still closely associated.
So I am aware of the difficulties in carrying on
business under the various eontrols. For
instance, the cost of coal has advanced 47 per
cent, and the cost of labour also bas increased.
Yet, although in the past few years one industry after another bas advised the Government
of the assistance that business would' receive
from the lifting of controls, the Government
has seen fit to keep them in effect. The policy
as enunciated has been increased production
and revenue, and I have no objection to this;
but I do not see how the maximum that
,business men would like to reach can be
attained if these controls are to remain.
My leader touched on the position of the
white-collar class. One of Canada's largest
industries, with which I am connected, handled
a billion dollars' worth of war contracts, and
I have some knowledge of the strenuous work
that the white-collar class, which includes
skilled engineers and architects, did during
the six long years of war. Under the controls
that we had in the past and which the Government wishes to perpetuate, the salaries of
these people cannot be raised. I do not agree
with the argument that if salaries were no
longer frozen we might have inflation. Last
year when the famous Family Allowances Bill
was going through I sat here and heard one
honourable senator after another extol the

DECEMBER 11, 1945
mnany virtues of that measure. The outstanding argument wa-s that it would increase
pui'chasing power. I agreed with that argur
ment then, and I say now that it bas proved
to, have been right. But I do flot find that
the Governinent às greatly alarmed about the
danger of inflation arising from increaeeL purchasing power derived from payments made
under the Family Allowances Act. Then why
flot remove the control that freezes salaries?
Why should these white-collar men who have
woTked

so hard during the past six years not

be given the subetantial* increases in salary
to which they are entitled? ,
Hon. Mr. DIJFF: Hear, he-ar.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I recognize
that there have te be somne controls--controls
of certain prices of exchange, and so on;
but I do object to this bill: the powers that
it confers upon the Governor ini Council are
too sweeping, too wide. 1 do not suppose
that we can do anything about it at this late
date, especially since it was modified before
being sent here from another place.
- Like my leader, I listen to a grest many
people in different walks of 11f e, and I wa.nt
to say that the public will flot be, satisfied
with the controls authorized by this bill. The
people much prefer the. Atlantic Charter,
which was conceived by that great Presiden.t,
the late Mr. Rooseve'lt, and by that outstanding British statesman, the Right HonourThe people of
able Winston Churchill.
Canada are tired, of controls and are longing
for freedom. To put it in a nutshell, th-ey are
saying: "Keep the controls that are necessary
to prevent inflation, but do not go beyond
that." I read in the press that our powerful
and friendly neighbour to the south has re~moved aIl controls with the exception of
those on: rubber and sugar; but here we are
now proposing to put into effect substantially
the samne controls that we had under the War
Measures Act.
I was tremendously impressed last night by
what was said about the prime importance of
Canlada's domestic trade. But the fact is
that our manufacturers, wholesalers -and
retailers are hobbled by controls and excessive
taxation. I know that reference to the excess
war profits tax is noV germane to this bill,
and I will say nothing more theni that it
greatly restricts expansion of business.
For the reasons that I have endeavoured to
expound I do flot like the bill, but I suppose
we shahl have Vo, vote for it. Surely, however,
at a very early date the Government will
remove the price ceiling insofar as it is possible to do so, and will lift the restrictions

411

on salary increases so that the white-collar
classes can be given a fair remunerationi for
their work.
Everyone knows that Canada must have
export trade, and it is not necessary for me
to say anything about that. I want to, emphasize the importance of developing our domestic trade, and to, point out that we are going
to have a difficult time doing this, not only
because of coxupetition between businesses,
of the saine kind in Canada but also because
of comipetition from, the United States.
I should like to join witb my honourable
leader and say to, the experts-possibly I may
be permitted. te say it to the members of the
Government as well: "Cast -off this warmindedness and let us get down te, peace,
prosperity and expansion."
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators, I wish te saY just a few words.
To begin with, permit me to compliment the
honourable senator from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris) on hie excellent presentation of this subject. 1 was particularly unpressed by the closing paragraph of, his
speech, wherein hie cxpressed the reluctance
hie felt in approving the type of legislation
which is before us. In that reluctance I
heartily share.
The bold statements which are made have
not at alI convinced; me of the necessity for
continuing these controls. It is fairly clear
to, my mind that had the civil servants and
perhaps those who are bossing them really
desired it, the war controls would have been
abolished by this time. The onus of proof
that these extraordinary powers are necessary
is on them, and to my mind they have so far
not discharged that onus., It may be that
some controls are still advisable, but if so
they are few and very unimportant. We went
through the war of 1914-18 without any legislation of this kind, and while we had, some
inflation we survived it.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: It corrected itself.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUOK: Yee, of course it
dià. The trouble is that when you plug one
hole you cause another ont te, open up. As
soon as you control one condition, another
one breaks out in a different place.
In the early part of his speech, the hon-

ourable gentleman from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris> made this statement:
As I e it, in 4thoee circumetances the duty
of the -Senate with respect to the bill is very
definite and reetricted. The Senate ehculd noît
retard passage cf the bila in any ws.y, or

oh-

struet or jimit the powers that the Government

has asked Barliament to give iî. The duty of
this Hlouse in considering a bill cf -thie kind in

412

SENATE

the circumstanoes that I have mentioned is to
offer constructive criticism, if that may be
made, and to go no further.
I see no such duty resting upon this House.
It may be that in the circumstances it is
necessary that we pass this bill. Indeed, I
do not see how we can help ourselves; but I
submit it is not incumbent on us to give
powers to the Government simply because
we are asked to do so.
I am making these few disjointed remarks
only for one purpose. I give notice that should
a similar bill come before us one year from
now I shall feel even less disposed to vote
for it than I do now. I shall require the
strictest proof of the necessity for such powers
before consenting again to their continuance.
Furthermore,.it should be thoroughly understood that we are granting the present extension only because of the peculiar circumstances in which we are placed, and that we
do nfot expect the Government to use the
powers simply because they are available.
An Hon. SENATOR: That is right.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: One pleasant feature
of this situation has been the disappearance up
to date of certain of the controllers and their
controls.
Some of the controllers have disappeared
"unwept, unhonoured and unsung." The country was glad to get rid of them. We can say
to the controllers who remain: "The nicest
thing you can do is to bow yourselves out and
bid us goodbye."
Some Hon. MEMBERS: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. RUPERT DAVIES: Honourable
senators, I want to align myself with those
honourable senators who are opposed to this
bill in principle, but who by force of circumstances or by reason of the position so well
explained last night by the honourable senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris)
are going to vote for it.
In my judgment the bill is very conflicting.
Paragraph (b) of section 2 is said to be for
the purpose of:
facilitating the readjustment of industry and
commerce to the requirements of the community
in time of peace.
I do not think that maintaining control of
salaries and wages is helping to facilitate
"the readjustment of industry and commerce."
There are two reasons why I do not like
these controls. One is that they are to be continued for another year; I think six months
would have been ample. The other is that
during the war years control was established
over wages, and certain standards were set up
for various districts. This control is still in
effect. As an instance let me cite a business
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK.

that I know something about-the newspaper
business. The standard of wages or salaries
allowed to editors, reporters, linotype operators and pressmen in Kingston, Brantford or
St. Catharines is somewhat lower than that
allowed in, say, Hamilton, Toronto, London,
and even Windsor. A newspaper publisher at
Windsor can offer to a newspaper employee
at Kingston, Brantford or St. Catharinesadmittedly more or less irregularly-inducements amounting to an increase of about $10
a week; but the publisher of a newspaper in
these three cities cannot even offer an increase
of $5 a week to hold an employee. I do not
think that the continuance of a control of that
character is facilitating the bringing back of
commerce and industry to a peacetime basis.
We are sick and tire.d of these controls; they
are disrupting the newspaper business aIl over
the country.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: I think it is time to
discontinue them. If we have to submit to
these conditions for another year I do not
know what we are going to do. You will find
every newspaper office short of help, and the
men do not want to work overtime. Why
should they? The result is great difficulty in
getting out the newspaper on time. I must
confess I am sorry that we are asked to continue these controls for another year. I should
have been more willing to vote for an extension of six months. I do not contemplate with
any pleasure being controlled for another year.
Nor do I contemplate with any pleasure
the continued power which is given to the
selective service group. Of course I know
that now an advertisement can be put in a
newspaper without having to channel it
through selective service, and so delay its
appearance for three or four days or a week,
no matter how urgent the advertisement may
be. But even now, for some strange reason
which I do not understand, if you desire to
advertise for a certain type of help, you have
to take your advertisement into a selective
service office to be stamped. The only reason
I can see for this procedure is that the man
wielding the stamp may continue to be paid
a salary.
I intend to support the bill, but with
reservations.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Does not my
honourable friend think we could very wehl
do away with selective service?
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: I should be glad to do
away with it tomorrow.
An Hon. SENATOR: How about today?
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time, on division.

THIRD READING

Honourable senators, with leave of the Senate, I should like
to move the third reading of this bill now.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
I amn supporting this bil, but there are two
*or three features about it that 1 think should,
be clearly understood. The suggestion made
by the honourable senator from VancouverBurrard (Hon. Mr. McGeer) relating ta aur
public expenditures impressed me very much.
There is a question ini my mind as to how
far we should go in our effort, which in the
aggregate wiil not be great, to send our creit
abroad. This bill increases the credit by
$650,000,000 and we should ail realize that
borrowings to that extent will be required. I
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

414

SENATE

am not sure that the bill provides that the
money shall all be spent in Canada. The
intention is that the money shall be utilized
for the purchase of Canadian equipment and
commodities of that type, but I would feel
more confident in my support of the bill if we
had a little more information as to what will
be purchased. Apparently the question has not
yet been decided. I should not expect the
Government to provide commodities that we
require in Canada and that are in short supply,
such as farm products, including wheat and
beef. In view of Canada's obligations, the
extent to which we can finance exports at the
present time is, in the aggregate, going to be
very limited.
I am going to support the bill because I
think it will help to bridge over the decrease
in next year's exports, but I think we shall find
that $650,000,000 will not go very far. Certainly we cannot continue this method indefinitely, and we must work out a more substantial plan. On the question of repayment, I was
deeply impressed by the suggestions of the
honourable senator from Vancouver-Burrard
(Hon. Mr. McGeer) as to the expenditure of
money at home.
There is nothing more that I wish to say,
except to again remind the House and the
country that the producers have to be paid
and that, therefore, this measure means we
must borrow an additional $650,000,000, which
will be added to the already heavy burden
our people are carrying.
The motion was agreed, to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.

He said: Honourable senators, the committee have in obedience to the order of
reference of the 27th of November, 1945,
examined, this bill and now beg leave to report
the same without any amendments.
THIRD READING

The Hon,. the SPEAKER: When shall the
bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, with leave of the Senate, I would move
third reading now. In doing so I wish to give
honourable senators an undertaking that should
they desire to discuss in committee or in the
Hon. Mr. McRAE.

House any matter arising out of this appropriation, they may do so when we are dealing with
the supply bill, which has yet to reach us.
Hon. Mr. ýLEGER: Honourable senators,
I am not going to move an amendment or ask
for a vote, but I wish to call attention to subsection (a) of section 2, which authorizes the
expenditure of money for:
the security, ýdefence, peace, order and welfare
of Canada.
The word "welfare" seems to import something new. The wording in section 91 of the
British North Americâ Act is "peace, order and
good government." I do not. think "good
government," and "welfare" are synonymous,
and I should like to know the reason for the
change. The substitution of the word for the
well-known and well-understood phrase seems
to be yet another encroachment on provincial
rights! Personally I should prefer the use
of the phrase "good government."
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.

INFANT MORTALITY
DISCUSSION

Hon. VINCENT DUPUIS rose in accordance with the following notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate
to the desirability of establishing a national
organization in co-operation with all the provincial governments, whose functions would be to
help mothers, to develop infant health -and te
reduce to its minimum infant mortality.

DECEMBER 12, 1M4
He said: For saime time past, lionourable
senators, I have followed. with close attention the progress made by the Canadian
Mothercraft Society, established in Toronto
somne fourteen years ago. The work of this
society is of national importance and should
arouse the interest of every patriotic citizen.
I was so convinced. of this fact that I thought
the matter should be brought to the attention
of the Government for immediate action.
Since my appointment ta this honourable
bodyr I have had to decide whether or flot
the Senate was a proper place in which to
discuss this important subi ect; and if I may
digress from my topic for a moment, I would
say_ that I now feel in duty bound to bring
this vital question to the attention of honourable senators, of the Government and of the
country at large.
In somne quarters we hear it said that the
Senate, because its members are, appointed for
life, constitute an irresponsible body from
which no good can came. That is the indictment. Let us examine this accusation in the
light of sound 'logic. Members of the Canaddan judiciary are in the samne category as
senators, since they too hold office for life.
Yet who would dare to suggest that they are
irresponsible. Far fromn itl The members of
that distinguished, body have acquired an
enviable reputation for ability and integrity.
Further, it is acknowledged that Canadla's
judicial system is one of the best in the
civilized world. This may well be attributed
to the fact that the members of our judiciary
are appointed for life, which leaves thexu free
to arrive at decisions with the utmost impartlality and to exercise an in.dependjence of
judgment flot otherwise attainable.
Now permit me ta turn the spotlight towarde
our Christian clergy. Its mexubers too are
appointed for life: "sacerdos in eternum" How
can we, in justice to all, have the temerity to
say that these men have flot played a very
essential part in the building up of their respective communities? Let me speak of the deeds
of our own priests from personai knowledge.
It ýwill suffice to mention just a few aspects of
what the French clergy have done for Canadians of French origin. Among our most
distinguished pioneers the clergy are to be
found in large nunihers. During the early
period~ of New France they were missionariee
and martyrs--yes, heroes whose naines now
adiorn the best-loved pages of our national
history. Could it possibly be said that because
they were appointed for life they were irresponsible? Where would we be today if it were
not for the heroic deede of our humble priests
who, without complaint have always remained

415

with their parishioners through good fortune
and ili, encouraging and sustaining themn by
advîce and good example.
During the dark days which followed the
oonquest, it was the clergy who helped aur
ancestors through hardship and adrversity. To
these so-called irresponsible men should go a
very large measure of credit for the attainment and success of our ethnical group in
this country. Somne people may think otherwise, but as far as I am concerned I shahl
ever be grateful to them.
I could go ta other fields to prove the
futility of the assertion that appointient for
life means irresponsibility and -that life tenure
necessarily annihilates a sense of responsibility; but I thinýk what I have said is quite
sufficient. What this honourable body has
done in the past would suffice ta support the
contention 'that appointment -for life does not
breed irresponsibility; but sometimes it is
better ta go outside one's own clan to convine one's opponents.
May I return now ta my main topic, snd
submit ta honourable senators that àt is our
duty, and the duty of every citizen iniCanada,
ta see that life is maintained and preserved,
and that infant rnortality is reduced ta the
absolute minimum. I have introduced this
subi ect during the last days of the session
because it cames under provincial jurisdiction
and might be an'important item in, the programme of the recently assembled DominionProvincial Conference.
Now I desire to give brief resu*mé of the
movement known the world over as Mothercraft. The Mothercraft Society was founided
in New Zealand in 1907 by Dr. Truby King,
afterwards Sir Truby King. Dr. King, who
was ta become one of the greatest benefactors
of humnanity, was alarmed by the infant mortality in his country. As a scientiat. of great
experience in another field, he undert-ook to
save the lives of the rising generations. In
the solution of this problem, it was his good
fortune ta have the close collaboration of the
wife of the then Governor-General of New
Zealand, a daughter of aur one-time GovernorGeneral, Lord Dufferin. In the early days of
the society, infant mortaiity -i New Zealand
was 88-8 per thousand live births. The success of Dr. King's venture, in spite of in-r
numerable difficulties, is indicated by New
Zealand's present infant mortality rate of
28-7 per thousand live births, which is the
lowest in the world.
The effect of this great achievement soon
spread ta other nations of the British Commonwealth. The honour of extending this
humanitarian movement ta Canada goes ta

416

SENATE

the very distinguished philanthropist, the late
Irving E. Robertson of Toronto, who was
encouraged and sustained by his distinguished
wife, who, when be died, became his immediate successor in that national endeavour. To
give you a more accurate description of -the
movement in Canada, allow me to quote from
a lecture which Mrs. Robertson delivered before the Ottawa Women's Club on November
30, 1944:
My husband, who was a Canadian newspaperman, was deeply interested in health, and in
maternal .and child caire. My New Zealand
nursing friends were establishing Mothercraft
in various parts of the world, h'aving been
loaned in response to requests from groups who
were often wi-th some knowledge of Mothercraft
in their country of origin and did not want to
be deprived of it in new homes. In each case
when Mothercraft was established the results
were apparent. My husband wanted to know
what it was in Motheroraft that brought such
resul.ts, and why it was so different to other
hea.lth agencies. He spent fou-r years investigating, not only in the British Commonwealth, but
in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland and
Germany, and satisfied himself that Motherer.aft
was the best of all, and was something Canada
should have. The faet that Mothercraft took
mother and child itogether was an important
factor.
It wasn't the teaching, but the legislation and
the organization that interested him. In 1931
he founded the Canadian society with the approval of the then Minister of Health, the Jate
Dr. John M. Robb. As a medical man, Dr.
Robb investigated for himself thoroughly Truby
King's teachings; he too felt that this was a
field that shoulid he open to Canadi-an nurses.
For the first year Dr. Robb watched every
mother and baby that was admitted to the
at .the
Mothercraft hospital, and was
results.
We have gone on progressing, and now have
our own hospital ;and headquarters with administrative and advice rooms. Up -to date over
300 well-baby nurses and fifty-odd post-graduate
nurses have received training. The students are
drawn from coast to coast, and parents from ail
parts of Canada have written, for nurses or
advice.
This movement is now urgenýtly needed,
and the Canadian nation is conscientiously
bound to adopt it. With our modern scientific development, there is no longer any excuse for leaving the up-building of Canadian
families to the haphazard methods of the
past. A nation is to be judged by the way
the family. its nucleus, looks after itself. It
is now admitted that the expectant mother is
in duty bound to follow a strict dietetic
regime if she desires, as she surely must, to
give birth to a healthy and normal baby.
And this new being has an inherent right to
require of those who are responsible for his
care that they shall adopt correct scientific
methods to see that be is well nourished and
is brought up in a proper atmosphere. AIlamazed

Hon. Mr. DUPUIS.

though the infant is unable ta express himself, it is as if he were telling his parents:
"The best way to prove your love is ta see
that I get proper maternal care, with suitable
food and clothing, pure water, exercise, rest
and sleep, and that I am kept clean and warm
and form regular habits. You must look after
these things for me, because I have the right
to live and become a healthy child with the
opportuniity of developing into a successful
citizen, who in turn will repay you a hundredfold with gratitude, filial love and solicitude."
Indeed, honourable senators, the child has an
inalienable right to be helped not only by
his parents but also by us, for it is our duty
to collaborate in the enactment of legislation
to safeguard the child's welfare.
Permit me, honourable senators, to quote
statisties on infant mortality in Canada. ln
1940 there were 240,000 children born alive;
in the same year 13,783 died under one year
of age, and 17,092 under five years of age.
Hon. Mr. QUINN:
the whole of Canada?

Are these figures for

Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: Yes, for the whole
country. When you look upon the dead body
of a little baby you think of the great loss
the parents have suffered. Every time a child
does not grow up to play its part as a citizen,
the country too suffers a loss. Think of the
great loss that is represented by the death
in one year of 17,000 children under five years
of age! Millions of dollars are spent to induce
people to come to Canada from other countries
-I am not objecting to that-and every credit
is due to those who in years gone by have
journeyed here from abroad and have become
good citizens. But surely there is no more
worthy way in which we can spend our money
than in protecting the health of our Canadian
children.
Statistics for the period 1931 to 1940 show
a loss of 159,000 children under one year of
age. During the ten years from 1935 to 1945
we lost upwards of 60,000 infant childrenmore than the population of this country in
1760, when France ceded Canada to England.
These figures must bring home to us how
seriously infant mortality may affect potential
increase of population when we reflect that
the descendants of the 60,000 people who in
the eighteenth century lived on the shores of
the St. Lawrence river from the Great Lakes
to the sea, and on the shores of the Richelieu
river, now number some 7,000,000; approximately 3,500,000 in Canada and the same
number in the United States.

The honourabie senators from VancouverBurrard (Hon. Mr. McGeer) and Parkdaie
(Hon. Mr. Murdock) expressed some doubts
with respect to my statement as to the
gold reserves availabie in the United States.
ln answering their doubts I1 am disposed
to deal with coid facts, at least in part.
The honourable gentleman from, VancouverBurrard stateýd that. according to the calculations he had macde, fromn bank or Governiment
reports, the United States might have a reserve
of $20,000,000ý,000, and that its outstanding
currency was 827,000,000,00D. I tbink that is
about right. Forty per cent of $27,000,000,000
wouid be $10,800,000,000. This weuld ha the
gold reserve nccessary for a coverage of 40 per
cent. It is a well-knewn fact that Congress
during the past year reduced the coverage
from 40 per cent to 25 per cent, it being felt
that the Government was not in a position to
maintain the biglier rate. As a matter of fact
-and again I must quote without the bookI believe the United States goid reserve at the
present time is a little less than sufficient to
give a coverage of 40l per cent, but not se low
as was anticipated at that time, the drain on
the reserves having somewbat let up in, the
interval.
In addition to the currency coverage of
$10,800,000,000 the United States has severai
other commitments. For instance. under the
Bretton Woods agreements the United States
treasury would have to contribute $1,300,000,000. 1 believe a committee of Congress is

aiready trying to ascertain the full ext-cnt of
the country's commitments. Whether the geid
rsreis $10,000,000,000 or $3,000,000,000 after
ail the commitments are deducted is net
reaiiy pertinent to the question, and I have

eniy deait with it because some honourabIe
member wondered whether my statement was

even approximateiy correct.
I might say to the honourabie senator from
Parkdaie in repiy to bis statement about the
guarding of the gold in the Kentucky vauits
that that gold does not have -te be moved
out to meet payments. It is earmarked and
tiien it is no longer availabIe for reserve
purposes.

With the indulgence of the House I wish
to deai for a few minutes with the subject
Hon. Mr. MeRAE.

of silver which was introduced by the honourabie senator froma Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert). The question of silver is one that

merits a much more thoýrough inquiry than
we can give it at this timOa.
Silver, whicb is one of our preciu 'ruetais,
is as dead as a doornail in this country. There
18 net a single silver miii in Canada operating
today. When I use the words "silver miii"
I mean a miii wbese large percentage of production is silver. The iast miii to operate
was the one at Mayo, on the Stuart River in
thc' Yukon territery. That milI was operated
for many years by the Alaska-Juneau people,
and tbree or four years ago it was ciosed up
entireiy. Tbey couid net make money on
thirty-five cent silver. As you know, silver
ivent to practicaiiy an ail-time iow. As a
resuit the Mayo miii soid its equipment for

junk and abandoned the property.

Today

the scenic roads ieading up the mountains te
the mines are traveiled only by cariboo, eik
and an occasionai grizzly bear.
The situation in Canada with respect to
silver has changed witb the price rise in the
United States from thirty-five to seventy-one
cents. It is said that even now the Maye
mine is attraeting attention because better
prices are hoped for in Canada. Certainly at
thirty-five or even at forty cents silver mining is not profitable.
Our silver today is
aImost exciusiveiy a by-product of base
matais. and some of it is in the guid bricks
which reach the Mint.
The henourabie senator from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert) referred to the Amnerican price
of silver, and quated the figure of seventyone cents. That price, plus ten per cent
excbange, makes our price seventy-eigbt cents

an ounce. The honeurabie senator stated also
that the price in London was eîghty-tbree

cents, and that the Bank of India in Bombay
quoted $1.31 an ounce. My information on
this unusuai deveiopment is that tbe people
of the Far East want hard meney, and tbey
are prepared te pay that price for silver rather
ýthan take their own paper currency. I tbink
the same situation exists in Europe, because
the price of silver there bas substantiaily
advanced.
The disappearance of silver in the United

States and the remarkabie decline in accuimuiated

from

3,200,000,000

to

Lambert), is most remarkable.

DECEMBER 12, 1945
The silver production ini Canada i 1940
was 23,000,000 ounces, and in 1944, 13,000,000
ounces; and I assume from a commereial
report just to hand that we will have about
the saine production this year as ini 1944. As
I have stated, ail this silver production cornes
as a by-produét of other metals.
I think there is a very good reason for our
domestic requirements of silver advancing to
7,660,000 ounces, as sta-ted by the honourable
senator front Ottawa. Unless the control prevents those interested in the silvar industry
from stocking up onl silver, they would indeed
be blind and negiectful of a gweat opportunity
if they did flot buy forty-cent silver at this
time. I would mortgage my shirt for th-at
purpose.
In fact, I do not mind telling
honourable senators that 'I tried the other
day to buy a thousand ounces of silver, but
was advised that no silver was available in
either Montrea1I or Ottawa.
My bankers
informed me that even the Mint was short of
silver. The question is, where is the silver
that we produce going?
I could speak more authoritatively on this
phase of the subject had my questions which
have stood on the Order Paper for some days
been answered.
I 'believe they are very
simple, and should be answered 'by Teferring
to the records. I suggest that this domestic
increase to seven and a haîf million ounces
has been accounted for by purchases of peopie in the silver manufaoturing business.
Maybe some people have been able to gamble
in silver, but I do not thînk there is much fear
of that. I believe it is true that some of the
big mines have been holding back their silver.
Why should they selI silver at forty cents in
Canada when the price i the United States
is seventy-eight cents, and there is a reasonable certainty that it will soon reach one
dollar?
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: May I ask the
honourable senator what was the low spot
of sîlver in Canada?
Hon. Mr. McRAE: About thirty-five cents
an ounce.
If silver should go to one dollar in the United
States, as I believe it almost certainly will,
that means that our mines would get $1.10 an
ounce for their silver. I do not think the
control of silver is going to last very long at
forty cents an ounce when there are prospects
of selling it across the lime at $1.10.
May I quota some figures that I have
received direct from the Mint, and which are
rathar surprising? I may say that at first,
with silver at forty cents, I faared it might
go across the line and be melted down. But
I do not think there is much danger of

419

that now, because I have information from
the Mint that our fifty-cent piece contains only
12 cents worth of silver at forty cents an ounce.
They tell me we would not have to change
the fineness of our silver until the price exceeded $1.681 cents an ounce. There is great
profit to, the Government in buying fortycent silver here for minting. I understand
that they use about two and a half million
ounces annually.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Approximately four
million ounces.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: If we take that much
silver at forty cents an ounce as agamnst the
approximate American price of eighty cents
it would amount to $1,600,000. That seemns
like a lot of money.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT- That figure is
correct.

Hon. Mr. McRAE: I submit to honourable
senators that our mines are now loaded down
with taxes, and that any further gouging out
of something like this sum from our base
metal mines that produce silver, and from
gold mines that also produce silver, would add
so much more to the tax burden. The situation is very similar to, that of 1940 when, if I
ramember correctly the axcess minting charges
on gold showed a profit to the Government of
81,200,000, and of 1944, when they showed a
profit of about M60,000. These sums added to
all the excessive taxes the mines are paying
just go to increase the burden.,
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: May I interrupt
my honourable friand to say that hae should
not overlook the fact that the price of silver
paid by the Mint during the past two weeks
is highar than it was earlier in the year. It is
a well known fact that the price of silver
for ail of the smaller producers, outside of
the big five who supply the local industries,
is seventy-one cents in New York. Under
those circumstances I would expect the smaller
mines to commence operation again. It should
be definitely appreciated that the situation in
respect of silver is much better now than it
was when we startad this discussion a f ew
weeks ago.
Hon. Mr. MeRAE: I believe it is a little
better for the small mines, but as I see the
picture-ahnd if my questions on the Oider
Paper had been answered I would have the
fàcts--the big mines, which were pernmitted to
export, allowed the little mines, to the extent
of their total production, to "carry the bag"
so to speak.
The honourable sanator's question contains
a suggestion, and in replying to it I must say

420

SENATE

that I am not go.ing to deal as kindly with
the Wartime Prices and Trade Board as he
did. As I see it, their action in this matter
is entirely unjustifiable. In my opinion they
know very little about silver. As a matter of
fact, I have a letter here from the manager
of the British Columbia and Yukon Mining
Association saying that in an interview the
Chairman of the Wartime Prices and Trade
Board did not indicate very much knowledge
about silver-and bis latest report to the
association rather confirmed this observation.
I do suggest, honourable senators, that this
trifling with one of our mineral resources by
refusing to grant export permits for silver is
another outstanding instance of price control
which should not prevail.
It has been said that removal of the control of silver would disturb our internal economy. That in my opinion is absurd. We
do not eat silver. Any internal econory we
have in silver must refer to the manufacture
of silver, and I do not think we are interested
at this time in cheap silver for manufacturers.
Silver, in any event, is a luxury and can be
allowed to take care of itself. The people
who buy silver have the money to pay for
it. But let us not strangle one of our natural
resources, as we are doing at 'the present
time. I can say to you that for the last ten
years no prospector would stop to drive his
pick into a silver ledge, because there would
be no market for such a mine. There is no
opportunity today for people to take advantage of our silver development as long as
export restrictions remain on the product.
The article published in the Ottawa Journal,
quoted by my honourable friend, says, in
brief, that the small mines will be able to
export all their product but the larger mines
will have to provide domestic requirements.
Is that approximately correct?

about this matter as my words might indicate,
because when silver rises to a dollar in the
United States-that is $1.10 in our moneythe top will blow off this wartime control so
far as silver is concerned. I have no personaI
interest in silver and know very little about
it, but the situation is fairly clear to all of us.
I think we can look forward to this control
being eliminated.
I often wonder how many other controls
are outstanding. The other day I saw a
Wartime Prices and Trade Board list of
controls still iip effect, and silver was not
mentioned at all. In the eyes of the officials
silver mining is apparently a forgotten industry-and well it might be, for it is in the
doldrums.
We have an opportunity of opening up for
our silver producers a market where they can
sell their products at United States prices.
There are a good many silver prospects
throughout Canada. If silver mining can be
expanded it might easily produce an annual
export business of $25,000,000, which is about
what it was twenty-five years ago. That is
more than the exports we are likely to send to
France, and under the bill we passed to-day,
we voted France a credit of $242,000,000.
The committee which I hope will be appointed early next session to consider the
development of our mineral reserves will have
a full opportunity to study the silver question. I trust that before that committee gets
to work the noose will have been taken off
the neck of this strangled industry, so that
it will have a chance to prosper again.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at
3 p.m.

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Up to 50 per cent
of the silver production.

THE SENATE

Hon. Mr. McRAE: And the gold mines
have to provide 50 per cent of such silver
as is in gold bricks, which of necessity corne
to the Mint. The working out of that will
present quite a problem. It will require a
great deal of work to check up on all the
little mines and see that they get 71 cents
for their silver.
The restriction, on silver exports is simply
one more of those hidden controls which,
judging by the reception accorded to certain
remarks made here yesterday, are so unpopular in this House. The development of
this natural resource should be encouraged,
but control retards it. I am not as worried

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, I might say that in order to facilitate
the business of the House these bil, whith
have not yet formally corne before us, were
taken up in the Finance Committee, where
they were explained, by departmental officiais
and carefully discussed. It was probably due
to oversiglit on my part that this statement
was not macle earlier, and I thank the honourable senator froîm L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Leger)
for calling the matter to our attention. This
bill and the three others which are based on
the budget are not being treated with the
indiifference th-at our action hore this afternoon miglit indicate.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Honourable senators,
for purposes of the record, may I suggest that
the Succession Duty Bill woulcl undoubtedly
meet with the approval of every honourable
member, because it eliminates some of the
hardeirips that occur under the present law
when there are two successions within, say, a
year or two years. Under this bull, in such
circumstances, only a percentage of the estate
passing on the second succession will be subj ect to Dominion succession duty tax. This
is certainly a step in -the right direction.
The Bill was passed-.

Hlon. G. P. CAMPBELL: Honourable senators, this bill and the other taxation bis

us in the dying days of the session in the
expectation th-at the Senate wihl pass them
hurriedly and without giving them consideration. I feel. that if we are to thoroughly
analyse these bis we should devote several
days to the work. I must say that I have not
had an opportunîty of considering as carefully as I should like to do thii particular bill
and the other taxation bilis.
We have said on former occasions: "Thýis
is the hast time we will expedite the passing of
mensures sent over to us on the eve of prorogation." I wouhd reniind honourable mem-

SENATE
bers that probably this is not the last time we
shall be confronted with this dilemma, and it
seems to me that we should take a definite
stand against a continuation of the practice.
I know it is the wish of honouýrable senators
to get home as quickly as possible, but I feel
that we might well give further consideration
to some of these bills, particularly the bill
amending the Income War Tax Act, which I
believe is still in the other House. I would
ask our honourable leader to see whether on
a future occasion it is not possible to cut
down debate in another place so that similar
legislation may reach us at least two or three
weeks before the end of the session.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Probably that is
wishful thinking, but we can always hope for
better results,
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I can assure my
honourable friend that I shall be only too
happy to do everything in my power to cut
down debate in the other place.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. SALTER A. HAYDEN: I may say,
honourable members, that in anticipation of
this bill reaching us a copy of it was submitted to the Committee on Finance -and was
examined at its meeting this mo-rning. There
was a good attendance, and I am sure a number of the senators now present are familiar
with the purposes which this amending bill
seeks to serve. One of the amendments relates
to insurance premiums. At present insurance premiums paid to a Canadian insurance
company from a source outside of Canada
may be taxed in the outside jurisdiction, in
addition to being taxed in Canada. The
amendment in such case provides that the tax
payable in Canada shall be reduced by the
amount of the tax payable in the outside

jurisdiction.

Another amendment reduces the tax on
dressed furs from 25 per cent to 10 per cent.
There is also provision for application of the

8 per cent sales tax. This requires sorne change
in the definitions 'and the bringing back into
the statute of persons who repair and remodel

Those are the main purposes of the bill.
There are no omnibus sections seeking to
confer general powers in order to deal with
some particular case. I can only say that I
heartily-approve of the amendments and the
form of the bill.
Hon. W. D. EULER: Honourable senators,
had I been a member of the Finance Committee I should have said in Committee
what I am about to say now. iMy remarks
are prompted by what the honourable senator from Toronto has just said in reference
to the tax on insurance premiums.
I was amazed a few days ago to learn on
the very best authority that the tax on insurance premiums paid by Canadian insurance
companies is 3 per cent, whereas the tax
paid by American companies operating in
this country is only 2 per cent.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: The premium tax
on mutual companies operating in Canada
is 3 per cent; on stock companies it is 2 per
cent .
Hon. Mr. EULER: I accept the correction.
However, British marine insurance companies
operating in Canada pay no tax on premiums
whatsoever.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN:

That is right.

Hon. Mr. EULER: I wish to call the
attention of the Government to the unfairness of this anomaly.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I was delighted to
what the member for Toronto (Hon.
Campbell) had to say. Had he been

NATIONAL EMERGENCY TRANSITIONAL POWERS BILL
REPORT 0F COMMITTEE

Hon. ELIE BEAUREGARD presented and
moved concurrence in the report of the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce on
Bill 15, an Act to confer certain transitionai
powers upon the Governor in Council during
the national emergency arising out of the war.
fie said: fionourable senators, the comnmittee 'have> examined this bill and now beg
leave to report saine with amendîments.
Hon. SALTER A. HAYDEN: Honourable
senators, before -this report is axlopted, I shouid
like to explain my position with respect to, it.
At the second reading stage I coneluded my
remarks hy saying that in the main I would
support the bill. That is stili my position.
flowever, there are one or two features of the
bill as it cornes before us now upon which I
shouid like to comment.
The bill provides that for a period of a year
certain powers may be exercised for the purpose of dealing with the emergency situation
arising out of the war. In addition, it
authorizes the continuance in force, on order
of the Governor in Council, of regulations
and orders passeif under the War Measures
Act. Under that authority it is now proposed
to continue in some blanket form ail the
orders and regulations passed under the War
Measures Act which are in for-ce at the time
the Governor in Council issues the order.
The effect is that while any order made by
the Governor in Council under Bill 15 can be
cancelled by resolution of this flouse, or an
independent resolution of the other piace, the
only way this flouse or the other could deal
with orders passed under the War Measures
Act, re-enacted or continued, by virtue of this
substitution, wouid be by a blanket resolution to cancel them ail. Otherwise, we should
have to deai with them 'by means of bis. For
instance, if at the next session of Parliament
it should be the desire of this flouse to cancel
the rentais control order, it would be nccessary
to introduce a bill to that effect and have it
concurred ini by the other flouse. There are
two uines of procedure which may be follýowed.

42i

First, any orders passed from the time this
bill cornes into force, can be cancelled by
resolution of either House.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, that, has been
changed.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: fias that section been
amended?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, it was ameiided in
the flouse of Commons.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: There are two methods
of procedure: One by resolution of this flouse
dealing with a speciflo order; the other by a
bill passed by both flouses. There would be
no way in which we couid deal by resolution with any particular order under the War
Measures Act.
-I was of opinion that the authority to
bring any order under the War Measures Act
into force should be derived from the bill,
for dealing with the emergency arising out of
the war. Apparently, however, that procedure
was thought to irrvolve 'too much work on the
part of the Government in trying to segregate
and analyze the various orders. So for the
present, though in a somewhat eritical frame
of mind, I arn prepared to accept the situation,
and to make no objection to that phase of the
bill.
Now I shouid like to offer one or two
observations with respect to the powers of
investigation under the bill. I have flot been
satisfied with the explanations given from
time to time in justification of some of the
extraordinary powers conferred in wartime,
and which may now be continued by virtue of
orders passed under the War Measures Act.
One explanation for the giving of these wide
and extraordinary powers of the Wartime
Prices and Trade Board is that without them
it could flot function.
Let me take just a moment to explain the
procedure. If the officiais, under the War
Measures Act, wish to see whether a merchant
bas heen observing price ceilings, an auditor
goes into that man's office, checks his records
to ascertain basic-period prices, and then checks
his invoices to see whether or flot he has been
conforming to those prices. There is nothing
new in that procedure, so far as it goes; we
have had it ever since the Income War Tax
Act came into force. A large corporation
makes its returns and in due course an auditor
goes in to examine the books. The system has
worked out very weli, and no special powers
were required for its continuýnce. Under the
stock transfer provisions the samething happens, as it does under the excise and the customs provisions. A similar course is adopted
in the provincial field. For instance, the

424

. SENATE

contributions under the Workmen's Compensation Act are based on a percentage of the
payroll, and auditors go in to see whether a
contractor has been paying his proper share
or not. But there is said to be some similarity
between that procedure and the procedure of
the Wartime Prices and Trade Board or some
other agency which, clothed with extraordinary power, can seize an individual, examine
him without his being allowed to obtain any
advice, prefer a charge against him, take down
his statement, and afterwards use it in evidence against him in order to secure a conviction. How there can be any relation between these two methods is beyond my ability
to understand.
It seems that we are so anxious to maintain
our reputation for fair dealing that in trials
now going on outside Canada we see to it
that ordinary peace-time privileges are granted
to war criminals. We bend over backwards
to see that accused men in Europe are
protected by all the ordinary rights of peacetime. Yet we are prepared to have citizens
of our own country remain subject in peacetime to extraordinary wartime provisions, in
order that certain organizations may function
properly. I do not think that any of these
extraordinary powers are necessary or advisable or desirable. The civil liberty of the
subject is a thing of great value. It was not
easily won, and it should not be easily
surrendered.
It is no answer to say that these extraordinary powers are required in order to get
after crooks. Under our law every accused
person is presumed to be innocent until he is
proved guilty, and it is not our duty or
function to support arbitrary orders because
officials say, "Oh well, they will enable us to
get after crooks." The purpose of legislation
of the kind we are dealing with now is to
regulate the conduct of businesses and of
people, and we must presume that they are
observing the law until we have evidence to
the contrary.
Then there is the other strange statement
that the public of Canada bas acquired a
psychological respect for these drastic orders,
and that if we amend them even slightly, so
as to make them harmonize with our conception of -liberty, we are going to weaken
respect for the law. I never heard a more
ridiculous argument in my life. I have too
high a regard for the intelligence of our people
to be influenced by any such contention.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN.

While in the main I am not satisfied with the
amendments that have been made, I am willing
to agree to concurrence in the report, and to
wait and see what happens.
The motion was agreed to, and the report
was concurred in.

CANADA'S SILVER SUPPLY
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. McRAE inquired of the Government:
1. What amount of silver ie .bei.ng held, in
Canadýaat present b'y the Dominion Government
and by priva-te companies, and for what purpose
la it proposed to be -used?
2. How much new Canadian silver was used
in Canada during 1944 and 1945 for -the minting
of coins and what price wae paid per ounce to
the .pro<:hicere?
3. What are the esti.mated requiremiente of
ailver for minting cf Os.nadian coins during
1940, and what are -the estimated requirements
for other pur1,oses in Canada during 1946, and
for whatpurpoee will it -be used?
4. What reaeon le there fer the sudden advance in Canadian consumption of silver during
the.past year? enmsocoprtnsri5. What are thnaecfcrrainoridividuals 40 whom. licences tbo expert silver have
-been isued, wi-th the amount of silver exported
under each licence last year and in 1945 up to
the latest date available?
6. What, if any, limit le impôsed on olIver
prchases by companies using eilver in rtheir
business?
7. Has -&ny silver been sold -in Canada -te corporations or individuals net requiring silver in
their business? If so, to, whom snd how niuoh?
8. According te press Teporte the major silver
refineries wxil supply approximately -50 per cent
cf -their output fer 1946 f or domestie requiremente. Will this, -plus, one-haff of the silver
by-product fromn the gold mines, provide suffident for domestic requirements?
9. If -the answer ie no, ithen how le it proposed
te. give the small. eilver producers the expert
price for ailtheir production as reported in the
10. What is the estimated. silver production
for the year 1945?

425

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The answer to
the honourable gentleman's inquiry is au
follows:
1. At October 31, 1945, the Royal Canadian
Mint held 1,000,556-19 ounces of silver. This
includes silver in process of coinage and refining operations.
2. 1944, 2,456,021-39 ounces; 1945 (to Oct.
31), 1,719,54826 ounces. Forty cents per
ounce for silver purchased in the open market,
38-6 cents per ounce for silver oontained, ini
gold deposited at the Mint.
3. It la difficuit to estimate the requirements
for silver for the Mint, as coinage demande
vary from yeaT to year. It is believed that
the requiremients for silver for coinage in. 1946
In
wdll not be less than that used ini 1M4.
addition 500,000 te 750,000 ounces will be
required for medals to be struck for the
Department of National Defence.
3. By agreement with the major refiners
the Wartime Prices and Trade Board has
arranged for half of their production, exclusive of requirements by the Royal Canadian Mint, up to a maximum of 4,80,000
ounces to be reserved for domestic requiremnents. The actual domestic allocation on
this basis la expected to be approximately
4,150,000 ounces. Domestic requirementa for
other than coinage purposes are chiefly in the
manufacture of sterling silver jewellery, flatware and hollow-ware, anodes for silver plating,
silver nitrate for the photographic and chemical
industry, alloys9 for brazing, bearing metals
and photographic engravera plates, and silver
wire for jewellery and other uses.
4. During the war years jewellery, hollowware and flat-ware manufacturers were denied
the use of tin, nickel and copper and, ss a
resuit, they turned to silver to, meet their
ineeds. While the restrictions on nickel and
copper have been removed, those on tin still
remain and the manufacturera have continued
to use silver. The main increase has been
in the production of sterling silver and anodes
for silver-plating, both of which items are
used almost exclusively in the manufacture
of jewellery, hollow-ware and fiat-ware.
5. It is contrary to departmental regulatiens and not in keeping with government
policy te release intimate details conoerning
the personal business of individuals and firmai.
The following permits were issued in 1944
and 1945:

SENATE

6. During the war years and to date there
bave been no quantity restrictions imposed en
the purchase of silver by users. During 1946,
a de6inite proportion of the total production
of the major refiners lias been reserved for
domestic users at the Canadian price ceîling.
(See Question 3 above.) These users will in
general be entitled to share in the domnestic
allocation in proportion to their purchases of
refined silver during the calendar year 1945.
7. There have been no sales of silver by
primary producers to corporations or individuals who do not, use silver in their business. No data is available as to subsequent
sales made by these companies.
8. The domnestic allocation described in the
answer to Question 3 above will be Iess than
the purchases of refined siver made during
1945 by Canadian lîsers. This totalled approximately 6,100,000 ounces, exclusive of takings
by the Royal Canadian Mint. The quantity
of refined silver guaranteed to Canadian users
et the domestic ceiling price is felt to be
reasonable.
9. Production of silver by smnall independent
producers who export their silver in concentrates or have it refined on a customs basis
at a Canadian reflnery, is not included in the
estirneted production of 8,300,000 ounces for
1946. Sucli production fromn small independent
mine operators wiIl be exported, with the
understending that the full export price, less
reflning charges, will be paid to the operators
originally producing the silver.
10. The estimated refined silver production
for 1945 is 10,500,000 troy ounces.

doos not meet until late in March it will be
very difficuit for, thiem to make a report
before the preparation of the next budget.
Hion. Mr. ROBERTSON.

There is other equally important work that
I am,. quite sure the Sen;ate can do very
effectively.
I understand the Dominion-Provincial Con,~
ference is to, reassemble in January, but now
that Ministers have the advantage of parlia-

mentary assistants. it bas occurred to me that
Parliament might be called together hy the
end of January. This would give members
of the other place an opportunity to waste
a month or six weeks on the Speech from
the Throne-as they usually do; then they
would he able to get down to business. In
the meantime we would have an opportunity
of carrying on our committee work.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The best information I have is that the new session will open
cither late in February or early in March.
Hoýn. Mr. McRAE: It is too badl.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Has the bonourable
senator considered that in certain quarters it
might he thought very desirehie that this committee should not report its flndings too soon?
Hon. Mr. MeRAE: I bad not. looked at it
in that way. As a matter of fact the members
of our Income Tax Committee have heen
working very diligently et night in the hope
of makinýg some progress, but unfortunately
they ran up ageinst the constitution-al issue,
which completely 'shut off ehl efforts to make
progress during the recess. I arn sure this
suspension of the committee's activities ilh
bc very disappointing to the public, because
it had heen genierally expected that the comnmittee's work would hring ahout a long overdue simplification of our income tax law.
Hon. W. D. EULER: Following the remark
of my honoureble friend to the left (Hon. Mr.
Hardy), maybe what I amn about to state will
give an opportunity of testing what he seemas
to have in bis mmnd. I have sent out notices
for a meeting of the Income Tex Cemmittee
tomorrow morning et 10.30, for the purpose
of getting the opinion of the members as to
whether w-e should esk the Government for an
Order in counicil constituting a Royal Commission to take the place of the committee and
continue its work during the recess.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
of my suggestion.

I arn glad you took notice

Hon. Mr. McRAE: If the Royal Commission
were to he composed of members of the
Incorne Tex Committee, excellent resuits might
ensue.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS:

Thet is the idea.

INTERNAL ECONOMY COMMITTEE
PARLIAM&ENTARY REPORTERS, SENATEREPORT CONCURRED IN

The Senate proceeded te the onsideration
of the fifth report of the Standing Committee
on Internai Economy and Contingent Accounts.
Hon. Mr. WHITE moved that the report
be concurred i.
Hon. Sir ALLEN AY'LESWORTH: Honourable senators, the motion asks us to approve
a report of the Civil Service Commission.
I cannot approve the heading, "Parliamentary
reporters, Senate", or the expression in the
body of the report: "the salaries of the
pariiamentary reporters and the pariiamentary
reporters, Senate." I shouid think ail parliamentary reporters are on the same footing. I
do not understand why there should be a
distinction.
But that is nlot aitogether what I wanted to
speak about. In the newspapers it is customary to speak of members of Parliainent and
members of the Senate. At any rate a Ieading
Toronto morning newspaper of today's date
made use of that expression in se many words.
A few years ago a bull came to us from the
other House in which there was identicaiiy
the same phrase-members of Parliament and
members of the Senate. We corrected it in
commitee Afterwards the draftsman of the
bill, an officer in one of the departments here,
said that the phrase was inadvertent. If
attention is not cailed, to this sort of thing it
will become nlot oniy inadvertent but deliberate. This report conveys by implication the
same ides. Lt does seem to me that since this
phrasing appears in an officiai report te the
Senate, Rome notice ought to be taken of the
apparent notion that there is a difference
between members of the Senate and members
of Parliament.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: Honourable senators,
when today I saw this report of the Civil
Service Commission my thought was that after
cipariiamentary reporters" the words "House
of Comnmons" shouid have been inserted, because the Order i Couneil appiies to parlismentary reporters in the other House, as to
whom it became effective from the lst of Juiy,
1944. The purpose of the committee in bringing the discrimination te the notice of the
Civil Service Commission is to put the
pariiamentar reporters of the Senate on the
same saiary Basis as those of the other House.
The motion was agreed te.

DOMINION-AJJBERTA SUPPLEMENTARY TAXATION
AGREEMENT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON
moved the second reading of Bill 218, an Act
to authorize the Minister of Finance, with the
approval of the Governor inCouncil, to enter
into an agreement with the Province of
Alberta ta amend the agreement entered into
with that province under the authority of
the Dominion-Provinocial Taxation Agreement
Act, 1942.
He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable member for -Lethbridge to
explain this bill.
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN: Honourable
senators, I am happy to speak ta this measure
because, if for no oyther reason, it bringe to
light the fact that & successfui attempt has
been madie to do something toward rehiabilitating the credit of the province of Alberta.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: If it were not for
that, the bill would not be, befoire the Senate
today. In my expianation of the bill I wish
to give honourabie senators somie of the background of the agreements made with certain
provinces, and then to explain the, simple
provisions of the bull itself.
The purpose of this bil is ta authorize the
Minister of Finance to enter into, an agreement with the province, of Alberta te amend
the agreemnent made with that province under
the Dominion-Provincial Taxation Agreement
Act, 1942. The effeet of the amendment ta
the agreement wilI be to provide greater compensation ta the province.
I shall now briefly explain why tliis amend-

ment is considered necessary. Honourable
members wili recail the financial arrangements
made between the Dominion and the provinces
in 1941-42. The proposais were outlined by
the Minister of Finance in the Budget Speech
of April 29, 1941. He said at that'lime that
ýeach year for the duration of the war the
Dominion wouid pay ta any province which,
with its niunicipalities, tem-porarily vacated the
personai income tax and corporation tax filds,
either:
(a) The revenues Thich the province and ita

munielpalities actuailly obr1-aiued f rom thee
eources during -the fiscal year ending neoarest ta

December 31, 1940 (the tax receipta option); or

(b) the coat of the net debt service acitually
paid by the province during the fiscal yea-r
endîng nearest to Decemnber 31, 1940 (not inelud-

428

SENATE

ing contributions to the sinking fund) less the
revenue obtained from succession duties during
that period (the net debt service option).
The payments were to be augmente4, by appropriate fiscal need- subsidiies where it could
be shown they were necessary.
The Dominion then negotiated with ail the
provinces, and under the authority of the
Dominion-Provincial Taxation Agreement Act,
1942, signed agreements with each of them.
Alberta chose the tax receipts option, and did
not receive any fiscal need subsidy. The choice
of the tax receipts option, and the consequent
failure to receive a fiscal need subsidy, resulte-d
from th.e fact that Alberta was then paying
enly hallf of the contractual rate of interest on
fis outstanding indebtedness.
I now refer to a development which took
place early this year, when Alberta indicated
that she proposed te refund her outstanding
mndebtedness. Representatives from that province approached the Dominion te sc what
assistance would be given. In a letter dated
March 3, 1945, tablcd in the other Huse,
the Minister of Finance said that to justify
Dominion co-operatien the plan would have
to bo fair and equitable and such as to fully
restore the credit of the province. To achieve
this objective it was fundamental that the
plan should contain the following condit.ions:
(a) the province of Alberta must rocognize its
liabilitv for the amount of iinpaid interest;
and (b) it mýust recegnize the hâghcr interest
rates which some provincial bonds carry to
ýtheir maturity, or to the time when callable,
as compared with the rate of interest to ho
borne by the new refunding bonds. If these
two conditioos were complied with the Dominion indicated that it would ce-operate on
the basis of .treating the province in the same
way as it would have been treated had it
neyver defaulted on its honded indebtedness.
This arrangement would involve a revision
of the financial relations betveen the Dominion and the province of Alberta in two respects. First, the taxation agreement would
ho reývised and the province weuld ho allowed
to accept the deht service option rather than
the tnx receipts option as the basis of the
compensation by the Dominion to the province for havinýg given up income and corporation taxes during the war. The result would
he that during the currency of the agreement
the province would receive $5,827,793.94 annually instead of the $4,080,860.64 now being
received, an increase of $1,746,933.30. In, the
second place, bascd on the facts disclesed in
the 1937 report of the Bank of Canada relating to the financial condition nf the three
prairie provinces, a special fiscal need subsidy of $600000 wvould be paid te the prevHon. Mr. BUCHANAN.

ince of Alberta for the four fiscal years prier
te the coming into force of the taxation
agreement, or a total of $2,640,000.
Alberta then proceeded with its debt reerganizatien programme, and on, the 17th of
May, 1945, the Minister of Finance made an
announcement in the press to the effeet that
this programme appeared te comply with the
principles outlined in bis letter of March 3,
1945.
To carry eut, the debt reorganization programme the province required a substantial
ameun-t te provide for defaulted interest. It
weuld net have been possible for the province
te proceed with the plan unless the Dominion
was prepared to make the additional compensation payable in the event of the taxation agreement being amended in the manner
I have outlined. As Parliament was net in
session on June 7, 1945, an erder in council
was passed under the War Measures Act,
authorizing the Deminion te give the province additional financial assistance.
With tbe assurance ef this assistance the
province in July made its effer te its bondholders, and last October, 77 per cent of the
bondholders having agreed, the plan was declarod effective. The Dominion thon paid to,
the province the difference hetween the
ameunt actually paid te the province under
the agreement and the amount the province
would have received had the amendcd agreement been in effeet from the heginning. The
ameunt paid was $9,387,733.20, which represents the sum of $1,746,933.30 for each of four
fiscal years since the tax agreements came
into effeet, plus the sumn of 8600,000 for each
of the four years before the tax agreements
came into effect.
The bill befere the House is a simple one
and gives statutery effeet to the arrangement
I have eutlined.
The motion was agreed te, and the Bill vas

VETERANS' LAND

BILL

SECOND ]READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill 233, an Act te amend the
Veterans' Land Act, 1942.

])ECEMBER 13, 1945
He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable senator fromn Rockeliffe (Hon.
Mrs. Wilson),to explain this bill.
Hon. CAIRINE R. WILSON: Honourable
senators, Bill 233 is an amendmnent to the
Veterans' Land Act passed in 1942, and has
received the unanimous approval of a select
comrnittee on Veterans Affaire in the other
House.
The amendment provides for a littie more
flexibiity as regards the construction of buildings, and increases to $6,000 the amount
allowed for the purchase of property, including
a $1,200 allowance for stock and equipment.
There has flot been any great eagerness on
the part of returning veterans to take advantage of the provisions for settling on the
land, but it, is expected that by the end of
1946 about 35,000 ex-service men will be estalilished on the land under this Act. The provisions of the Act apphy also to those who wish
to engage lu flshing operations.
It may be said that a number of the young
returned men who miglit have been expected
to go on the land are taking advantages of
provisions which enable themn to attend agricultural colheges. It may be that more qualifled farmers will take advantage of the privileges offered under this Act than present
figures would indicate.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
I do flot wish to use the words "I tohd you so",
but when this bill came before us two or three
years ago it was said that the maximum
amount that could be granted was $4,800. The
honourable member for St. Jean Baptiste (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien) and I objected strenuously
at that time on the ground that no veteran
would be justifled lu going on to land that
could be bought at that figure. I arn very
pleased to see that the amount has at last
been increased to 86,000--but I arn not sure
yet that it is high enough. In Manitoba and
I tbink also in Saskatchewan and Alberta, there
has been a very good systemn adopted in connecti:on with the buying of land. The test
to which returned men are put lu order to
establish théir abîlity as farmers is very commendable, and the severity of the test is
perhaps the reason why the number of men
taking up land is lower than expected.
After the last war the scheme for returning
men to the lanid was well intentioned, but there
was no proper examination of applics.nts. I
re-call very well an incident concerning two
young men who served in the army as stretcherbearers. They were together in the saine unit
through four and a haif years of war. They
shept in the samne dugout and they worked side
by sie on the firing lime, bringing back the

429

sick and wounded. When they were demobilized they said they wanted to go farming
together, and they bought half a section of
land in Manitoba. Well, they were on the
land, three months, and they have not spoken
to each other since. Neither hadi had, any
farming experience. I amn speaking whereof
I know, because they came to see me and, I
acted as arbitrator between them. Their case
was one of the most pitiable I have ever witnessed-. It was too 'bad that these two young
veterans were allowed to go on the land.
In our province a good many re-turneL men
have failed to make good on farine. In a
large number of cases it is said that the land
was not of high quality, but moat of the grief
bas been caused by the inexperience of the
men and, especially among those who have
married overseas, of their wives.
The honourable senator fromn Rockcliffe
(Hon. Mrs. Wilson) referred to the courses lu
agriculture. There is a large class of young
men taking the regular course in agriculturenot the short course-at our university this
year. I cannot help thinking of one of these
students. He flew over Germany forty-eight
times in a Lancaster. With bis cap on hie
looks about his real age, which is twenty-four,
but when lie is bareheaded you would take
him to be sixty-five, for there is no more hair
on bis bead than there is on this paper. The
other night at- a show hie was sitting in front
of two young girl students from the home
economies class. One said to the other: "That
fellow is taking the agricultural course at the
college, and bie muet be sixty if he is a day."
The other young men who were with him
enjoyed tbe joke very -mucli.
These agricultural courses are doing a lot
of good in our province, and I believe in Saskatchewan and Alberta as well. Most of the
returned men takint the course at Winnipeg
have a keen desire to become good fariners.
I know tbat, because some of thei have
visited at my home. After the hast war a good
many veterans seemed to think there was
money to be ma&l quickhy out of land that
couhd lie got unde-r the setthement scbeme of
those days. I arn not sure that the present
scheme wilh be successful, but I admit to the
bonourabhe senator froin Rockchiffe that it is
better thaji its predecessor. I hope that in
the.long run this one will justify itsehf. There
is lots of room ini the West, and no doubt in
other parts of Canada, for young men who are
ambitious to make good on the land.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
although the maximum that may be advanced
to a veteran is 86,000, the average wihl possibly be about $5,000. On that basis, if 35,000
men take advantage of the Act, as the hion-

off the debt than try to coileet it. The

with it. Despite the best intentions a good
many of the young men who take up farms
under this Act will not be successfui. Let
us not be carried away by any ideas to the
contrary.
Hon. W. RUPERT DAVIES: Honourable
senators, I should like to ask the honourabie
senator from Rockcliffe (Hon. Mrs. Wilson)
if she can tell us what percentage of the
35,000 who have appiied for farms are first

college.

grants. I say that because I have a son who
is planninýg to be a scienýtific farmer, and hie
told me hie would flot he eligihle for the
grant if hie took the educational benefits.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is correct.
Hon. Mrs. WILSON: I imagine that ail]
who take the college course will be treated
in the samne way. They will have whatever
advantages arise from the course, but I doubt
if they wili be able to dlaima the farmi grant

between the Dominion and some of the provinces whereby certain provincial Crown lande
will be available for settlement under this Act.
I also understand that the Department of
Mines and Resources bas made it possible
for veterans who came from Indian reserves
to obtain land within the reserves.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: It seems to me that
the Government is going at this thing in the
wrong way. The young men best qualified
to make a success of farniing will be those
who take a course at an agricultural coilege.
Why sbouid the Government say: "If you
take a course in agriculture we will pay your
tuition fees and certain other expenses while
you are a student, but we wiil rtot help you
to get a farm after you finish the course"?
Hon. Mr. McRAE.

Surely it is only reasonable to assume that
the young men who qualify themscîves to
farm in a scientifie way are most likely to
make a success on the land. We ail know
sometbing about the problems that arose after
the last war because so many of the veteran-s
who took up land under the soldiers' settiement seheme had no experience or speciai
training. I wish the Act could be changed

$6.000 farms.

Hon. THOMAS VIEN: Honourabie senators, the bill to provide benefits for veterans
has been the subjeet of careful study in both
Huses of Parliament. The grants made available bad to be me-asured in ternis of a certain
relativity to this counltry's resources. These
grants may be divided into tbree categories.
First, there are the pay and aliowances payable to the veteran, and extending over a
certain period after bis demobilization. Then
there are grants for his re-estabiishment in
civil life. Thirdly, there are grants to provide
for his vocationai training. A veteran, however, must choose between the vocational training and the grant of money provided for his
establishment in farming or in business. A
young man desirous of getting a land grant
under this Act may first attend a course at
an agriculturai coilege, but at bis own expense.
The bonourabie senator from. Kingston (Hon.
Mr. Davies) suggests that the veteran wbo

increases bis prospects of becoming a successfui farmer and should, therefore, be entitled
to the benefits of a land settlement. That

a'ouid entail a duplication of benefits, and we
3houid proceed with caution in that direction.
I believe the Act amended by this bill,

is extremely generous. The amounts involved
are aiready enormous.
There is another point to which I shouid
like to refer. I have recently been advised
that when a veteran chooses to take vocationaI
training, the amount computed against the
grant, to which hie is entitied in that regard
includes not oniy the cost of the training,
but also a certain charge for overhead and
administration. I doubt wbether that was the
intention of those wbo drafted the legisiation
and of the legislators who passed. it. The
Department shouid flot charge administration
and other costs against the amount made
availabie to the veteran who eleets to take

for ten years meets his obligations-which I
may say are very modest-then the Government will forego $2,300 out of the $6,000. That
is the present ceiling of the obligation he is
permitted to undertake. So I look forward to
this venture-because it is a venture-with a
considerable degree of hopefulness.
Of course. over and above all the safeguards you may provide, there are certain
unforeseen factors to be overcome.
For
nstance, no one kniows what the price of
[arm products may be five or ten years from
now, nor all the economie conditions that
largrly govern the success of the individual
farmer. But we have to assume that agriculture in this country will have a fair chance
of success in the future, and I feel certain
that the majority of those who take advantage
of the Veterans' Land Act will be well satisfied with their venture.
As to whether or not war veterans should
be asked to attend agricultural schools to
acquire a technical knowledge of agriculture,
I anticipate that many of them will do so
voluntarily; but it must be borne in mind
that many returning men who take advantage
of this legislation will be the sons of farmers
or young fellows from villages, and familiar
with farm practice. In any case the bank
clerk or the school teacher, or anyone else who
bas had no agricultural experience, and who
wishes to take advantage of the Act, must
qualify himself and satisfy the board that he
is likely to become at least a moderately
successful farmer.
I think. therefore, we can accept the bill
without any question. The principal amendment raising the ceiling to $6,000 simply puts
into statutory form what was made effective
by order in council two years ago, when the
administration of the Act was still under my
supervision.
As I glance hastily at the other provisions
I find they are all of a reasonable nature, and
I think we can accept them as being valuable
in improving the position of our service men.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: May I ask the honourable senator if under the increased grant
the repayments are for two-thirds, the same
as they were under the $4,800 grant?
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: My recollection is
that they are the same. That is to say, the
repayments are made over the same period
of years as when the ceiling was $4,800.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: When the figure was
$4,800 the veteran was obliged to repay to
the Director of the Veterans' Land Act twothirds of that amount. May I ask if it is
now two-thirds of $6,000.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Yes, that is my recollection.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR.

I overlooked mentioning that these amendments were considered by the Veterans'
Affairs committee of the other House, and
were unanimously agreed upon by that committee.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Would the honourable
senator say if the amount of the grant providing for vocational training is intended to
include part of the administrative cost of the
Department? For instance, if a returned man
is entitled to a grant of $400 for vocational
training, is it intended that that amount
should be used exclusively .to cover disbursements to the school, or is part of it to be
applied to certain other expenses incurred by
the department?
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I speak without a
complete knowledge of that point, but my
understanding is that a returned man may
utilize some of his war services grant to take
a course, for instance, in an agricultural school,
without in any way impairing his rights under
the Veterans' Land Act. I do not think
anything beyond the cost of his training would
be chargeable against the grant.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: That was my understanding when the Act was before the other House,
but I am advised by a veteran that the Department paid $115 to the school and charged
$300 against bis grant.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I have no certain
knowledge on the matter, but I am greatly
surprised to hear of such a case.
Hon. Mrs. WILSON: Expenditures of that
nature should come under the Veterans' Rehabilitation Act.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, the next bill to be dealt with is Bill
240, concerning veterans' rehabilitation.
It
might be helpful if both Bill 233 and Bill 240
were sent to the Committee on Banking and
Commerce, where specific consideration could
be given to questions asked by honourable
senators.
The motion was agreed to and the Bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved that the
bill be referred to the Standing Committee

DECEMBER 13, 1945
He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the bonourable senator from Rockcliffe (Hon.
Mrs. Wilson) to, explain this bihl.
Hon. CAIRINE R. WILSON: Honourable
senators, the purpose of this 'bill is to place on
the statute books measures wbich by order in
council have been in force since 1940. The
advantages extended to the returned mean have
been Qtudied by a select committee of the
House of Conunons dealing with Veterans'
Affairs, and have been made more flexible
than they were as originally drafted.
In 1930 there were as many as 30,000 unemployed veterane of the Firet Great War, 90
per cent of wbom were found to be witho'ut
special ekilîs. In an effort to prevent a recurrence of this situation. special, allowances bave
been made for training the veteran. Tbe
measures I bave referred to provide a montbhy
payment of $50 to single men and $70 to
married men as out-of-work benefits; veterans
alea receive certain benefits while awaiting
returns frose their businesses, including farming. A tbird benefit is a monthhy payment of
$60 for single men and $80 for married men,
with ahlowances for children. Thie applies ta
veterans who are temporarily incapacitated
or to those wbo are talring either university
or vocational training. The veteran wbo completes fifteen weeks in. insurable employment
will be given credit under tbe Unemployment
Insurance Act for the entire term of hie
service in the armed forces.
I do not think admeinistration costs were
ever properly cbarged against a veteran. There
may be some amendment .neceesary, as in the
agricultural colleges the cost of living je much
less than in tbe universities. In this way the
veteran may be able ýto eave a certain amount
during an agricultural course.
The motion was agreed to and tbe Bill was
read the second time.

INCOME WAR TAXÈ BILL
FlIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 234, an Act to amend the
Income War Tax Act.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall the
bill be read the second time?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, I move the second reýading now. I have
ýasked the honourable gentleman fromr Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Campbell) to explain the bill.
Hon. 'G. P. -CAMPBELL:- This bil in its
draft form was before the Banking and Commerce Committee this mýorning. In the interval 'the bill bas been amended in the other
Ilouse, so it will be necessary to again refer
it to the Banking and Commerce Committee
in order that the amendments may be
considered.
This bill, generalhy speaking, may be termed
a measure ta reduce income, tax and ta clarify
certain sections of the present Act.
Subseetion 1 of section 1 deals with contractual annuities. At the present time, annuities are taxable both as to capital and incarne
content. Recently representations were made
to the Ives Royal Commission asking that
annuities should be taxed as to income content
only. When explaining the bill before aur
committee this morning the Deputy Minister
for Taxation exphained that in Enghand annuities bac! always been taxed, aoc! that,
although several Royal Commissions bac!
considered tbe question of relieving annuities
from. taxation, no action bac! been taken.
This subsection pro'vides that only the
interest content shaîl be taxable until euch
time as the capital bas been entirely repaid.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: There is a formula to
cover tbat.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBEjLL: Yes. When the
capital bas been entirely repaid the total
annuity is taxable.
Subsection 2 of section 1 deals with annuities
under a will or trust. This again is relieving
legislation. It provides tbat only tbe interest
shahl be treated as income and that capital
distributed by way of fixed periodic payments
shaîl not be taxed. The onue is on tbe recipient or the trustee to show wbat ie capital.
Section 2 deals with income derived from.
tbe operations of shipping and aircraft corUnder reciprocal arrangements
porations.
between various countries, the ilicome' from
the operation of sbips owned or operated by

434

SENATE

non-resident persons or corporations has been
exempt from income tax. This section now
places aircraft in the same position as shipping.
Paragraph (y) of subsection 3 of this section
merely changes the wording of the Act by
which limited dividend housing corporations
are free from tax.
Section 3 of the bill clarifies the law respecting superannuation or pension funds. At
present pensions are not taxed. This amendment provides that all pensions shall be taxed,
but there is a saving clause providing that
superannuation or pension funds now in force
shall be free of tax.

The Act as it formerly stood extended to
oil and mineral companies the right to deduct
from their taxable income a certain portion
of the amount spent on development to the
end of 1945. The bill extends this benefit to
the end of 1946. This feature also was explained before the committee.
The provision which allowed the deduction
of medical expenses lias been extended to
permit the executors of the estate of a deceased person to pay medical costs and deduct
them from the income earned in the previous
year.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Will the honourable
senator please tell us what effect this has on
civil servants?

Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: The amount has
not been changed. It is worked out on a
percentage basis.
Part XVIII dealing with private companies
is perhaps the most interesting amendment to
the Act. The adoption in the bill of some of
the recommendations made by the Ives Commission enables a closely-held corporation,
with fifty shareholders or less, to distribute
income accumulated up to the end of 1938
on the basis of a payment of tax by the corporation in accordance with the rates and
schedules laid down in the Act. Evidence
given before the Ives Commission by many
people and institutions from all across Canada
clearly indicated that if a person died leaving
a closely-held corporation in which there was
a large accumulated income that had to be
distributed, the high rates of income tax
and succession duties madp it impossible for
the estate to pay both imposts. The Commission recommended that relief be given
against that hardship, and any closely held
corporation having fifty shareholders or less
may hereafter take advantage of the procedure provided in this bill. The rates of tax
commence at 15 per cent and run up to 33 per
cent, the tax being calculated on the amount
distributable to any individual shareholder.
If, for instance, there was $100,000 of accumulated income distributable to four shareholders
in equal amounts, each shareholder would receive $25,000, and the rate of tax imposed
would be at the $25,000 level and not the

Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: There is no provision in the Act concerning civil servants.
The pension schemes referred to are arrangements set up between employer and employee;
and in certain instances labour unions may
create pension funds and enjoy the benefit of
tax deductions if payments from union dues
are specifically made to such funds.
To
answer the question of the honourable leader
opposite, I should say this Act does not affect
the position of civil servants.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: That matter would
be dealt with under the Civil Service Superannuation Act.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Am I correct in the
understanding that to be tax exempt a pension
must arise from a fund that either the
employer or the employee has established for
that purpose?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: That is right. Provision is also made to increase to $900 the
amount of the contribution by employee or
employer. That is to say, an employee who
makes an annual contribution of $900 may
deduct that amount from his taxable income,
and the employer may do likewise. Provision
is also made for payments on acount of past
services.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Is my honourable friend
unable to answer the question concerning
civil servants? It is my opinion that their
pensions are tax free.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I cannot specifically
answer the question of the honourable leader
opposite at the moment, but I will get the
information for him. It is my opinion that this
does not change the position of civil servants.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: We will get the information in committee.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL. Yes.
lion. Mr. CAMPBELL.

Hon. Mr. MOLLOY:

To what amount?

$100.000 level.
The only other part of the bill I need mention is section 9, which attempts to clarify
the rates of tax on incomes up to $3,000 in
1945, and up to $3,600 in 1946 and thereafter,
where the taxpayer is in receipt of family
allowances. Fixed percentages worked out for
the various amounts of income are set forth
in a table.
I do net think I need comment upon anything else at this stage. but I shall be glad
to answer any questions.

DECEMBER 14, 1945
Hon. Mr. PATERSON:- May I ask the
honourable gentleman if the amendments
made in another place are of any importance?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I may say that
the amendments were not before the committee, but I understand they contain nothing
of any substance.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senstors, I move that this bill be referred to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce. It will perbaps be rccalled that previous bis of a like character have been
referred to the Committee on Finance. However, at its sitting this morning the Banking
and Commierce Committee had an opportunity to give some consideration to this
measure before it reached the Senate, and I
arn suggesting. that further consideration had
better be given by the same committee.
The motion was agreed to.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I move the

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Is the bill before us? It

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I was going to
ask the honourable senator from QueensLunenburg (Hon,. Mr. Kinley) to axplaîn the
bill, and after it bas been given second readiing
I shahl move that it be referred to the Committea on Banking and Commerce, which is
meeting after the Senate rises. By that time
the bill will perhaps bave been distributed.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I rise ta a point of order.
I do not think we should go on until the bill
is cistributed. I arn greathy handicappad
because I know notbing whatever about the
bill.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I have a copy.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: But the rest of us also
wouhd like to have copies.

â

Hon. Mr. HARDY: I quite agree with the
point taken by the honourable leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Haig).
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Copies have just
arrived ànd are now being distributed. Will
the honourable gentleman be agraeable to
our going ahead with the explanation now?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I arn advised
that what is being distributed is a copy of
the bill as rend the first time in the other
House.
Hon. JOHN J. KINLEY: Honourable
senators, the measure now before the House
for second reading, an Act to amend the
National Housing Act, comprises in the main
ainendments to the Nation-al Housing Act,
19414, which we are tohd were necessary to
clarify the law or conditions that were not
entirely clear when the Act was put through
last year. The amendiments do not affect the
principle of the 1944 legislation. Thare is,
therefore, no outstanding principhe to the
bill itsalf. Soma of the amendments now
proposed were made effective under the War
Measuras Act, before Parliament assembled.
The amendments may be grouped under
four genaral headings. First, there, are minor
verbal changes which are necessary to charify
the intent of certain sections of the Act. Most
of thasa were made effective by Order in
Council P.C. 302, dstad January 18, 1945.
The amendiments in the next group were
made effective by P.C. 5794, datàed August 30,
1945. Thase were required to provide for largescale emergency operations in the field. of
rentai. housing.
The amendments in the third group relate
to appropriation sections. These are in the
nature of clarification, rather than of modification. Certain rigid restrictions of operation
under the Act which were not originalhy
intended are remnoved by the enlargement of
tha appropriation under Part II. At present
there is in Part II an appropriation of 850,000,000 to cover boans, losses and guarantees in
respect of renbaI bousing projects. This is
considered insufficient, and the appropriation
-bas been increased, to 8150,000,000. In addition, -authority is gîvan to guarantee invastmants up to 8125,000,000, whicb is an estimated limit of life insurance companies'
investments undar the Acet. Undier Part V of
the Act there is a provision to appropriate
85,000,000 to provide a specifie surn for housing
research and community planning.
One proposed amendment arises out of hegishation creating the Central Mortgaga and
Housing Corporation. It has the affect of par-

SENATE
mitting the delegation of certain powers of the
Minister of Finance under the Act to the new
corporation, when it is set up.
I think it is apparent to us all, especially
those connected with industry, that at the
present time the whole activity of housing is
controlled and limited by a general scarcity
of skilled labour and a great shortage of
building materials. In so far as what may bè
termed "low-rental bouses" are concerned, the
high prevailing costs make the situation difficult. In fact all three elements combinedlabour, building materials and high pricescause delay and high cost of construction, so
that while there is an urgent need for more
bouses, and this legislation makes more money
and facilities available, the problem is, after
all, a physical problem, with a call for productive labour and for construction materials.
The shortage of bouses, though unfortunate,
is a natural condition arising largely out of
the war. For five years the country bas been
centring its efforts on war production, and the
building of private bouses was not only
neglected because of war necessity, but to
some extent was actually prevented by State
control. We are told the same conditions, only
more accentuated, prevail in the United States
and in Australia.
Then again we in Canada are strong advocates of freedom for the individual. In this
country a man's bouse is his castle, and the
authorities are very loath, even in wartime, to
put on controls which would compulsorily
make housing accommodation available. While
in some countries billeting is a regular method
of making housing available, it is not invoked
in Canada-I say this for purposes of comparison-so we can face the difficulties more
cheerfully.
The other day the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) introduced Bill 23. the purpose of which is to set
up the operating machinery necessary for the
proper functioning not only of measures now
upon the Statute Books relating to the National
Housing Act, 1944, but the amendments contained in the bill now before the House for
second reading. The most important of these
amendments relate to the rental housing sections of the Act, and I should perhaps attempt
to explain what is intended. The National
Housing Act of 1944 contains three sections
relating to rental housing. Section 8 makes it
possible for an individual to borrow money
from a lending institution-that is an insurance
company or a trust and loan company-at an
interest rate of 4.1 per cent for twenty years.
in order to construct a bouse or an apartment
block for rental purposes. This is ordinary
commercial rental accommodation. The GovHon. Mr. KINLEY.

ernment participates with the lending company
by putting up 25 per cent of each loan at 3
per cent, thus enabling the lending company
t1 earn about 5 per cent on its share of each
joint loan.
The provisions for the second type of rental
project are to be found in section 9 of the
Act. Under this section the Government stands
ready to advance up to 90 per cent to a limiteddividend housing corporation. The conditions
require that the rents shall be as low as
possible. that the accommodation shall be
rented to families of low income, and that the
company shall not pay dividends of more than
5 per cent.
The provision for the third type of rental
accommodation is found in section 11 of the
Act. This section authorizes a life insurance
company, subject to the jurisdiction of Parliament, to invest 5 per cent of its Canadian
assets in rental housing projects. This was
not previously permitted. In order to encourage the life insurance companies to go
into the housing business, and to safeguard the
policyholder's funds, the Government stands
ready to guarantee a net return of 2½ per cent
per annum.
It is necessary to give this brief description
of the rental housing provisions of the Act in
order to explain the effect of these amxendments.
In the summer of 1945 the life insurance
companies expressed a willingness to help meet
the need foc rental housing by undertaking
projects of the kind provided for in the Housing Act. They preferred, however, to organize
subsidiary housing companies owned by all
the principal insurance companies, and to act
througi then jointly rather than separately.
The Government agreed, and one of the
amendments makes possible the formation of
what are known as "institutional housing corporations" and "institutional holding companies," owned by life insurance companies.
The life insurance companies also agreed to
build low rental bouses and to limit the profits
of their subsidiaries to 5 per cent. This means
that the institutional housing corporations and
holding companies can qualify as limited-dividend companies and become eligible for Government loans up to 90 per cent of the value
of the projects.
These amendments therefore make possible
a very interesting type of housing development in Canada. Across the border in the
United States companies like the Metropolitan
Life Insurance Company have already undertaken large housing projects with considerable
success. The Housing Act of 1944 permitted
Canadian companies to do likewise, and gave
a limited guarantee of earnings. The present
bill goes even further and it is my

DECEMBER 14, 1945
understanding that if present plans mature the
Canadian life insurance industry, with Government encouragement, wili soon be embarkmng
on a housîng programme quite unprecedented
iu this country. With tens of thousands of
men being discharged from the forces every
month, there can be no doubt of the need for
ail the rentai accommodation that can be
constructed during the coming year. I have no
hesitation, therefore, in endorsing one of the
chief underlying purposes of this bill.
There. bas beeu some comment on and a
littie criticism. about the Goverumerat dealing
with lending institutions sud insurauýce comnpanies in carryiug out the purposes of this
legisiation. It is a great qualification for s
personl to know his business, aud Can-adian
finjancial organizations are successful because
they are under experienced and efficient manngament. They can therefore be expected to
give the best service. They psy the Goverument 3 per cent for ý portion of the money
needed, which is supplemented by their own
funds, and the borrawer pays 4J per cent par
annum. This meaus between oue per cent
sud two par cent for administration and such
profit as succassful management may maka
possible. 1 think everyone will admit that
no govarumant couid administer national
iiousing at s0 iow a eost or do it so well
sud keep the percentage of loss so low. The
financial institutions of Canada have in the
last decade rendered outstanding service, sud
in the field of finance Canada is in a stroug
position. I think the co-.operation of the
Goverumeut with efficient privata industry is
the best kind of co-operatoin for the carrying out of such an enterprise as national
housing.
In, conclusion, may I add that, as we ail
know, more bouses are .urgently needed at
the present time. This proposed legisiation
providas more ways sud meaus to go ahead
with the lob, sud those wbo assuma responsibility for carrying out its purposes m-ay be
expeoted to use their resourcas to bring about
the desirçd riesults as specdýily -as possible.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Were any ameudments
made ;iu the othar Huse?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I think just oua; but
it wns not of any importance.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I notice that section 11,
paragrapli (6), provides:

reset of a joint loan ehall nlot axeeed. a rate
of feur iand one-haîf per centu-m par annum calculated eami-aunually and no other charge lu

ha satisfactory, but there is a littie joker in
the concludiug words:

I should like to know what body is authorized
to make those regulations, and is it the intention, to incresase the rate of interest by
regul-ation?

friena will turn to page tan, Section 27, I
think hae will find 5 par cent refarrad to.
Hon. Mr. LEGEJI: Section 27 bas the same
wording. I think we should bave sometbing

Hon. Mr. HOWARD: It is going to be refarred to committae.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I rise to ask tbe
honourable leader of the Goverument to refar
the bill to committea, sud not to attempt second sud tbird raadiug today.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Honourable senators,
as the honourable sonator (Hon. Mr. Legar)
bas just stated, the provisions of this bill
are highly techuical and should be aonsidered
in committea. Howevar, hae has asked a question about Section 11, which raads as follows:
The rate of interest payable by the borrowar
in respect of a joi'nt, losu shahI not axaaed a
rate of four sud one-haîf par ceutum par annllm
calculated samni-anuual-ly sud no other charge in
respect of the issu shalh be payable by the
borrower excapt as xnay be au-tborized by -reguistion.
I wish t0 point out that the administration
of the bill wilh ba under the control of the
Central Housiug Corporation, a corporation
set up by a bill alraady passed by this bouse.
Hou. Mr. LEGER: I presumae the rate of
iutarest may ha chauged by regulation?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: No. There may be
somne service charge for a deed and items of
that sort.
Hou. Mr. LEGER: Wa will get the explanation in committea.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: May I deal with the
question of the 4ý par cent interast rate? The
retu-ru f0 the companias is 5 par cent, bacause
they get 25 par cent of the mouey from the
Govarumaut at 3 par cent. The returu to the
company eau readily be datermined by caîctilation. The 5 par cent referred to in section
27 of the bili appears in anothar section of the
Act, and the only amandmntt is the addition
of tbe words "au affective rate", refarring to
the bank guarantees in Part IV. We eau deal
with this in committee.

438

SENATE

The explanation in the bill is this:
According to the Government actuaries the
calculation cf "simple interest" is extremely
cumbersome in the case of instalment Joans particularly those involving monthly instalments.
The effect of the change is te provide for an
effective rate of interest of five per cent per
annum.
This is under section 27, guaranteeing Home
Improvement Loans to the bank.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The explanation of the
interest rate by my honourable friend is perhaps not as clear as it might be. If he refers
again to the Act, I think he will 'find that 41
per cent is what is charged the borrower, and
the regulatory part largely refers to the
provision now being inserted requiring payment of one-twelfth of the municipal tax rate
per month when the contract is on a monthly
basis. The five per cent effective rate of
interest refers to the maximum the lending
company can earn by reason of borrowing
from the Government at 3 per cent and
lending at 41 per cent.
There is not much criticism of the regulations concerning the lending of money to
corporations in that way. The practice has
been in effect for some time, and many of
the companies like it. The larger life insurance companies have been lending money in
this way for some vears. I presume this
system of financing during the last three, four
or five years makes these amendments necessary. My fundamental objection to tbe Act
is that it permits the Government. to build
bouses. If they were building decent houses
I would not mind.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: The Government is
not building these houses.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Under this
Government can build houses.

Act the

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: My friend is aware of
the fact tbat they have set upHon. Mr. HAIG: They have set up Crown
companies.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: No, no. A company
has been set up under the name of National
Housing Enterprises, or soma similar name.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
like that.

Yes, a name something

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: And various insurance
companies contribute to this organization.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Under what regulations
are these heuses being built? An honourable
senator from Montreal asked in committee the
other dayHon. Mr. HAYDEN: You are now referring
to the wartime housing.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: No; I am referring te
provisions of this bill.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN:

No, no.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: As far as the bill goes, at
the present time I fail to sec that it is of any
assistance to the building of houses. Whether
it passes or net the same number of houses
will be built. All the Government bas te do
to increase house building is to stop grabbing
all the material for the second-class houses
that are now being built. Without some such
action this bill is absolutely useless.
I share the view expressed by the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell) as to taxation bills coming late to this
House, but there is no earthly reason why this
bill should not have been before us two
months ago. Even at this late date we do not
get the bill as amended. I do net know what
the amendments are, and how I can go to
committee and discuss' them intelligently is
more than I can sec. The taxation provisions
come down under the Budget and we are
reasonably familiar with them, but this bill
is different. I can make no contribution to
the consideration of this question because I
have net had an opportunity to study the bill.
I may ba asked why I did net study it when
it was first introduced in the other House.
My answer is that it was introduced only
thrce days ago. I protest against that actionHon. Mr. HAYDEN:

Do you protest again?

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I protest the late introduction of this bill in the other place. First
of all the members over there take seven
weeks to discuss the Speech frem the Throne
and from three te five weeks te discuss the
War Appropriation bills; then in the last two
weeks of the session they pass on the most
vital legislation of all. This bill is an extremely
important one, and should be carefully studied
both here and in the other Chamber. If this
lieuse is going to make any contribution
towards sound legislation, it must insist on the
earlier introduction of bills of a vital nature.
There are rules in the other place te control
the length of speeches. We shall be meeting
again at the end of FebruaryHon. Mr. EULER:

iMaybe.

Hon. Mr. ýHAIG: -and we shall be lucky
if we are out of here by Labour Day. I predict that the next session will ba the most
strenuous that the members of ti Commons
have known in many years. Why do they net
send some of the work over to us? If they
want to make speeches for their electors,

DECEMBER 14, 1945
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: With the last few
remarks of the honourable leader opposite I do
nlot violently disagree. While I have no personal. knowledge of the detaiIs of the measure
under consideration, my general impression is
that the activities of the Government under
this bill, directly or indirectly, are not concerned with the actual house-building, but
rather with facilitating the building of houses
by lending money to individuels, through
corporations specifically set up for the purpose.
My general impression is that the actuel
building of governmnent houses is done under
either Wartime Housing or the Veterens Affairs
Department. I wish to say to the honourable gentleman from L'Acadie (Hon. Mr.
Léger) that if the House secs fit te pass the
motion for second reading, I shail move thal
the bill be referred to the Standing Oommittee
on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I amn agreeable.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: The only change ini
section 27 is really the addition of the word
"effective". The rate must not exceed an
effective rate of 5 per cent.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: But what doés it mean?
It means what 1 said, that you cannot pay a
bigher rate than that.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: That is right.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
RE1"ERRED TO COMMITT1EE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved that the
bill be referred to the Standing Committee on

The motion was agreed to.

of the country, as they have'been throughout,

of memibers at sittings of the Chamber and
of the committees, the Senate does not have
to take second place. I have no desire that

While I could move second reading now, and
honourable senators would perhaps be agreeable to the motion, I arn suggesting that
second reading be given at the next sitting.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Honourable senators,
I also have no desire to be offensive, but it
occurs to me that a distinction is beîng made

EElisS D IOTION4

SENATE

ing a richly deserved compliment to two
honourable members of this Chamber. In
moving the resolution to set up a special committee to consider the Income War Tax Act
and the Excess Profits Tax Act, the honourable gentleman, from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Campbell) rendered a valuable service to the
country, and as a member of the committee
I say candidly that his earnest participation in
the proceedings at the various sittings has had
much ta do with the effective work that has
been done. The committee has made a real
contribution to the study and underst-anding
of many details of the Income War Tax Act.
As most honourable senators are aware, that
is the only statute the committee has so far
been studying.
The other member whom I wish to compliment is the Chairman, the honourable gentleman froa Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler). I am
unable to agree with some of his theories, but
I want to pay a tribute ta him for presiding
over our sittings with m.arked ability and
efficiency. Personally, I have found it very
pleasant to serve on the committee, and one
important reason for this has been my complete confidence that -the Chairman would see
that I, in common with all other members,
got a square deal in the proceedings.
Someone may ask why I am making these
remarks. I do so because too often in this
House we fail to give recognition when some
of our colleagues in a quiet, unobtrusive way
render especially valuable public service, and
I do not want to let the good work done in
this, instance go unnoticed. That work is another example of what the Senate can do on
behalf of the people.
Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, I should like to join in
the well-merited tribute that has just been
voiced by the honourable leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Haig). A short time ago I took
occasion to say how greatly we all appreciated
the work donc this session by the Divorce
Committee, whose members were required to
give a great deal of time ta the duties imposed upon them. I should hope that the
services rendered by the Special Committee
on the Income War Tax Act and the Excess
Profits Tax Act may be typical of an increased usefulness of the Senate in various
fields. While I am a member of the committee, the new responsibilities placed upon
me, and the fact that I am not yet familiar
with them, made it impossible for me ta attend the meetings as often as I should have
liked. I desire to express to the mover of
the resolution (Hon. Mr. Campbell) and the
Chairman of the committee (Hon. Mr. Euler),
and to those associated with them, my perlion. Ir.

IAIG.

sonal appreciation of the splendid work the
committee has done.

Hon. W. D. EULER:

Honourable sena-

tors, following the excellent example of my
leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson), who assigns the
explanation of certain bills ta various members, I am going ta call upon the mover of

the resolution (Hon. Mr. Campbell) ta respond

ta the kind words ta which we have just
listened. While my name was not mentioned
first, before I take my seat I want ta express
my own thanks ta both leaders for their
appreciation of the committee's work.
Hon. G. P. CAMPBELL:
Honourable
senators, I am sure we all realize now why the
honourable gentleman frorn Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler) makes such a good chairman.
He passes the work over ta others and tells
thern to carry on.
Some Hon. SENATORS:
Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I wish ta express
sincere thanks for the kind remarks that have
been made by the honourable leader of the
House (Hon. Mr. Robertson) and the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig).
I
feel that the committee. because of the untiring efforts of its members, has made some
progress towards analyzing certain provisions
of the Income War Tax Act. The committee's
task is perhaps as heavy as any that has ever
been undertaken by a committee of Parliament. I am confident that those who have
appeared to make representations realize that
the members of the committee have had a
good deal of experience in business and professional life. With the assistance of those
representations and of constructive suggestions
frorn departmental officials we may be able
early next session to bring in a report which
will prove helpful to the Government, and to
the Department of National Revenue in
particular.
The motion was agreed to, and the report
was concurred in.

The Hon. the -SPEAKER: Hoinourable senators, since the notice of motion of the honourable gentleman from Vancouver-Burrard was
placed on the Order Paper I have had an
opportunity of considering very carefully the
eff ect of the motion upon legisiation that might
reach us from the other Chamber, and I have
reached the conclusion that it cannot be
proceeded with. The procedure to be followed
is clearly set forth in the Rules of the Senate.
Rule 1 reade:
In all cases flot provided for hereinafter, or
by sessional or other orders, the etanading oTders,
rules, usages and formes of proceedîng of -the
Lorda House of the Imperial Parliament, ini
force for the tiine being, shall be fol.lowed, so
far as -they can be applied to the proceedings of
the Senate or any committee thereof.
This is an anticipatory motion, because its
acceptance would undoubtedily bar further
consideration of an important measure which
is now before the Senate. On this point 1
quote Redlich, Volume 3, page 221:
The so,-oalled "rule against 'antii ion" ha@
never been embodied in any of - e standing
orders of the Bouse, but -4e part of the common
iaw or usage of the House. There is some
obscurity about its origin and about the precise

edition, of May's "Parliamen.tary Practice" in
whith there is any express reference to It
appesas to be that of 1871 but -it is evident from
Mr. Speaker Denison's ruiings that the.-ru-e had
been recognized and actedl ipon for many yeare
before that date. After that date the application
of the rule was developed and formulated by -a
large nýumber of successive mulinga from, the
chair.
This is borne out by Denison's Decisions
(Blackmore Edition) at page 216:
A motion cannot be proposed which an-ticipates discussion on a snatter which is already
appointed for consideration by the Hous.
Further authority will be found in Peel's
Decisions (Blackmore Edition), where at page
99 it is stated:
A -motion which anticipates a bill before the
House, or a motion the whole subjeet of which
is covered by the clauses of a -billon the paper,
is out of order.
A reference to anticipatory motions will be
found in May, l3th Edition, et page 272, in
these words:
A matter al-ready appoin.ted for consideration
by the Ilouse cannot 'be anticipated by an
emendmnent, whi-le -a notice of motion as -long as
it remains upon -the paper, whether for -a specified day or not, prevents its subjeot-matter Ïbeing
discussed by means ofan .amendiment to a motion
or a motion for the ýadjournaient of the Bouse
. . . In determining, however, whether a discussion ie out of order on the ground of anticipation the Speaker must have rega-rd to the
probability nf the matter anticipated being

As 1 have alrendy stated, the bill which is
now before the Senate deels with the subject-

I must therefore declare the motion out of

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON: I
would more second reading now.
Honourable senators will recall that the
report of the Bretton Woods Agreements Conference was referred to the Senate Committee
The Hon. the SPEAKER.

on Commerce and Trade Relations of Canada,
and that a large number of honourable members heard the discussion on the bill now
before this House.
Jn order to provide
additional information for honourable senators
who were not in committee, and for the general benefit of all, I will ask the honourable
senator from Toronto (lion. Mr. Hayden) ta
explain this bill.
Hon. S. A. HAYDEN: Honourable senators, it can be seen by the volume of the
documents before us that it bas taken a great
many words to incorporate the proposais and
agreements reached at the Bretton Woods
Conference into a pattern for working out
sone more satisfactory me'thod in the economie field by which all naztions of the world
not only can carry on their own domestic
economies, but also can maintain international rclationships on a basis which recognize that the duty of a nation does not end
at its own border, but entails obligations and
responsibilities to the other countries of the
world.
At the risk of taking a little time, may I
preface my remarks in relation to the two
agreements by a few- words indicating the
experiences of the various countries and why
at last a commendable effort is being made
to work out some satisfactory method for
enabling the countries of the world to live in
soe measure of decency, comfort and barmony? After the last war we conceived Hie
idea, so far as our allies were concerned, that
when we had gained the victory and restored
the national status of the various countries
that were overrun we hiad performed a great
and lasting service to those particular countries; then we patted them on the back and
thought little about their cronomic situation
and did nothing except provide measures of
relief from tine to time in a selfish or selfinterested sort of way, in order to restore the
development of our own economies. We really
engaged in what arounted to a battle for the
survival of the fittest.
As a result of that struggle. what are called
bilateral agreements were inade betwreen various countries for the purpose of promoting
trade to their own mutual advantage and the
disadvantage of other nations of the world.
Restrictions were placed on imports from certain cotntries, and currency depreciation and
other devices were adopted for the purpose
of stimulating the export trade of a particular
country. 1 have heard it said that these distressful methods of trying to maintain, revive
or restore a nation's economy are very contagious, since it is just as easy to teach bad
habits to nations as to teach them to

DECEMBER 14, 1945
individuals. Certainly a series of bad habits
were developed internationally, and culminated largely ici the disaster of the second World
War.
Now that this war is over, we are attempting to proceed into the peace period on the
basis worked out during the war, when we
co-ordinated our interests and focussed them
on the goal of victory and peace. It becomes
more and more apparent that as the overriding and im-perilling motive, of safety and
survival moves away from the sce.e there
tomes in its olace a national self-interest that
makes us think in terms of ourselves, and, in
everything we do, of what good it will be to
us. We fail to, recognize that we have obligations, and that lasting peace is dépendent
upon the economie soundness of other countries in the world. It has been said that
today the throb of the war drum anywhere
in the world, is heard everywhere in the
world. May 1 also say that economic cond-itions in any part of the world sooner or later
have their effect eve-rywhere else in the world,
and lead ultimately to a situation similar to
that through which we have just. passed.
The mindis of the various nations have been
un-ited in an effort to work, out some plan or
pattern by which the overrun countries could
be provided with relief, and their economies
could be reconstructed and restored in such a
way as to re-establish and secure international
trade upon some sound basis which will assure
to ail the world a decent measure of comfort
and security.
This bill authorizes the Governor ini Couneil
to ratify -two agreements on behaif of the
people of Canada. One of these agreements
relates to the. International 'Monetary Fund
and the othe-r provides for an International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
In differentiating between the two agreements
may I say that although I have devoted
considerable time to an attempt to understand
the provisions respecting the functions and the
safeguards presented in these agreements,
I arn not y.et fully acquainted nor completely
satisfied with them. I arn satisfied, however,
to approve of the agreements on the basîs of
past experience, for I know that the methods
pursued and the plans brought into being
from the end of the lasit war d-own to the
heginning of the recent war have flot produeed
the results we would have wished them to
produce. From past experience we know
the various roada we should flot travel if we
want security and peace; on. the other hand,
if we travel the roads which are open ta, us
irnder these agreements and the other plans
in the over-alI pattern, we may eventually
reach the goal we wish to attain. I do not

think we have any option in the matter. We
can only turn back for guidance, and then,
in the light of experience, look ahead and try
to work out something which we believe will
in some measure lead to greater international
understandàng and security.
These agreements are designed to that end.
Take, for instance, the International 'Monetary
Fund. The Fund is an organization set up ta
provide a means whereby member nations
under certain specified conditions may obtain
short-term credit accommodation to finance
their purchas:es from abroad. As Lord Keynes
put it when he was discussing this matter,
the Fund is intended, not as daily food or
sustenance for us or for any other country,
but as an iron ration. The agreements for the
International Monetary Fund have four
purposes:
1. To provide permanent rnachineiry for consultation and collaboration on international
monetary matters.
In other words ta provide a forum where the
member nations *may meet ta, discuss international problems that arise from time ta
time.
2. To promote exehange stability between the
currencies of the variaus inember nations, end
ta avoid competitive exchange depreciation.
3. To assist in the elimination of foreigu exchange xestrictions which hamper wort1i trade.
4. To provide means whereby member natione
may Dbtain ehortterm credite and correct maladjustments in their balances of international
payrnents..
The only alternative ta providing a means
whereby a country may obtain short-term
credits to adjust its international balances
would be a reduction in the standard of living
in that country, a reduction in its currency in
terms of other currencies so, as ta stimulate
trade and try to recover the position that
liad been lost, or a restriction upon imports.
These are things that feed upon themselves
and get steadily worse. The only way in
which we can have the kind of international
situation we want is by maintaining a very
high level in the aggregate of international
trade. We say that Canada cannot be truly
prosperous except by maintaîning a very high
level of national incarne. These agreements
apply that doctrine internationally.
The mnbers of the International Monetary
Fund will be those amang the forty-faur
United Nations who execute or ratify the
agreements before the 31st of December this
year. The principal amount of the fund is
8-8 billion dollars, of which Canada's contribution is 300 million dollars. Canada's contribution, like that of the other memnbers, is
ta be made up of 25 per cent in gold an& the

SENATE
balance in national currency. Our currency
will be valued for that purpose in relation
to United States dollars as of July, 1944, if I
remember rightly. So 25 per cent of the
whole fund will be made up of gold, and the
balance will be in the currencies of the member
nations.
A country which requires a short-term credit
may apply to the fund. If the need is apparent
a short-term credit may be provided, but
there are limitations as to the amount which
a nation may draw from the fund in any
particular currency in a year. I think the
limitation is 25 per cent. The purpose of that,
I suppose, is to prevent a run on the bank.
At least once a year member nations who
have been leaning on the fund and whose international assets have increased will be required
to redeem their position.
The difference between the International
Monetary Fund and the Bank for Reconstruction and Development is mainly this: the
bank is designed to provide long-term credits;
the fund is designed to provide short-term
credits. It is hoped that the two will be
complementary. For instance, a nation which
has a loan from the bank may be able to
call upon the resources of the fund when a
payment of interest or principal has to be
made to the bank.
There are many safeguarding provisions in
the fund. Without going into particular cases
-I am not prepared to do that, and anyone
who wants the information may get it by
reading the agreements-it should be sufficient
for me to tell you that there are many
safeguards to insure a proper administration
of the fund. May I also tell you that while
the member nations who join in this fund
undertake not to indulge in adverse international practices, such as restricting imports,
refusing import licences, depreciating their
currency for purposes of encouraging export
trade, and so on, there is a provision that
member nations which have been through the
stress and strain of the war may be permitted to adopt restrictive measures in relation to their currencies, and so forth, for a
transitional period which the fund may regard
as being reasonable in the circumstances.
Then there is a provision under which a
member may withdraw from the fund by
simply sending in a resignation. When a member withdraws, an accounting will be made
and there will be a refund of the amount to
which the member is entitled.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN:
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN.

Yes.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The explanatory
note opposite the first page of the bill says:
The Governor in Council is authorized to fix
the par value of the Canadian dollar for the
purposes of the Agreement for the International
Monetary Fund.
Would the Governor in Council be authorized to fix the value of the Canadian dollar
on a par with the American dollar?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Yes. Initially the particular member nation may establish the par
value of its currency in relation to United States
dollars. There are some limitations on that
which would prevent any unreasonable course
in relation to such valuation being taken, but
generally speaking there is the broad affirmative provision that the nation itself which has
contributed its quota in its own currency may
determine the par value in relation to United
States dollars.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Or could we remove
Il per cent off the American dollar?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I suppose that if the
Government of Canada thought it wise, in the
interests of our domestic economy and our
international trade relationships, to have the
Canadian dollar on terms of parity with the
United States dollar, it would have power
under this agreement to value Canada's currency contribution at par in relation to United
States dollars.
There is also provision under which the par
value may be changed from time to time, and
again I think a member nation may make a
change to the extent of 10 per cent without
the concurrence of the Fund. Any further
changes have to be reported to the Fund, and
its concurrence must be obtained.
Procceding to the other phases, the organization itself provides for a Board of Governors and a chairman. The Board of Governors is made up of one representative and one
alternate appointed by each member-nation.
Then, functioning under the Board of Governors, there

are

executive

directors with

the

powers provided for in the agreement and
such other powers as may be delegated to
them by the Board of Governors. Of these
executive directors five are appointed by the
five members who make the largest contributions under the quotas provided. Honourable senators will find the quotas set out at
the end of the agreement. They are: Canada
S300,000,000, the United States $2,750,000,N0.

the United Kingdom

$1,300,000,000, Russia

S1,200,000,000, and so forth.
Honourable
members will see that on the basis of the five
largest contributors executive directors would
be appointed by the United States. the lTnited
Kingdom, and Russia-and there are several

DECEMBER 14, 1945
member-countries in the $400,000,000 class. So
on that basis the five appointments would be
exhausted before Canada would be reached.
But five more directors are elected by those
members who are not entitled to appoint.
In addition, there are two directors at large,
appointed under a somewhat intricate formula
that I would not even attempt to analyse.
There is also to be a managing director. The
principal office of the Fund is to be located
in the territory of the member-nation making
the largest contribution to the Fund. As to
voting, each country is given an initial 250
votes, plus one vote for each part of its quota
equivalent to 100,000 United States dollars.
This agreement is designed to provide an
insurance fund whereby, when an emergency
arises with respect to a particular membernation in relation to its international trade,
and the currency of some other country is
suddenly needed to balance a surplus of imports
over exports, the Fund, after having satisfied
itself that the member-nation has no other
means of getting that accommodation at once,
will advance the money with the 25 per cent
limitation which I have referred to.
As far as I can see, no one can tell accurately
how this agreement will work out, but
a meeting place where the various countries
of the world can discuss their international
problems is something very valuable in itself.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Secondly, it is important to have an insurance fund contributed by
the various countries of the world, out of
which emergency situations can be dealt with
on a short-term credit basis so as to prevent
an undue disturbance of the economies of the
member-countries. Otherwise those countries
would have to adopt the restrictive measures
that I have referred to, and to resort to those
other practices which feed upon themselves
and grow ultimately into the deplorable situation we had before the war. The object of
the international fund is to provide for multilateral rather than bilateral agreements between nations. Canada, for instance, will be
able to carry on trade with many countries
instead of restricting its dealings to particular
countries.
With that rather bare and cursory development of the International Monetary Fund
and the effect of the agreement, may I tell
you-and I hope more briefly-the, effect of
the agreement with relation to the establishment of an International Bank of Reconstruction and Development. As I said before, the
International Bank is designed to provide
long-term credit. I think people in other

44f

countries have not been so critical of the
bank as they have been of the fund, because
they understand the meaning of and have
more confidence in a bank. This bank is to
have a capital of $10,000,000,000. Canada's
obligation or quota is $325,000,000.
The
quotas are termed subscriptions. Canada and
the other member nations will make a contribution of 20 per cent to what is called the
direct loan function of the bank. The other
80 per cent remains as a sort of uncalled
capital, and it will only be called on if and
to the extent that the bank suffers losses
through the loans that it makes. Then you
would have what amounts to an assessment
to the extent of the commitment you have
made for this other 80 per cent. The way the
subscription works out is this. Two per cent
of Canada's contribution is payable in gold
or United States dollars within sixty days of
the commencement of the bank's operations.
Then 8 per cent in Canadian currency is to
be called within one year, and. another 10
per cent is to be called thereafter, if and
when needed for the purposes of what is
called the direct loan aspect of the bank.
Now, if all that 20 per cent were paid Canada
would have contributed $65,000,000; her quota
is $325,000,000. This 20 per cent may go
direct to long-term loans or accommodation
to other member-nations for the purpose of
some specified project. Provision is made
whereby the bank may have the benefit of
technical and scientific advice as to the value,
purpose and character of -the project, which
must ba one that will in some way contribute
to international relationships and trade. In
other words, the loan will- not be made for
purely local reasons which do not benefit the
flow of international trade. So much for the
direct loans.
There are two other ways in which the bank
may acquire money. It may borrow money and
re-loan it, or it may guarantee loans that are
made by private investment sources. The
uncalled capital, Canada's 80 per cent contribution and that of the other member nations,
is a bulwark to support the bank in respect
of moneys it has borrowed and re-loaned or on
loans it has guaranteed and in connection with
which there is a loss.
There are safeguards provided with respect
to these loans. For instance, if the bank
borrowed money on the market in the currency of a particular country, it must have
the approval of that country before it can
lend that currency to another member country.
Notwithstanding the fact that you have these
checks and safeguards, losses are possible.
If a member nation has any other reasonable method of procuring the accommodation

446

SENATE

it seeks from the bank in the form of a long
term credit, it must exhaust that method
before the bank will advance the money.
The organization behind the bank is in most
particulars exactly the same as that behind
the fund. The bank has a Board of Governors who are elected; the executive directors
are appointed. The voting provisions are the
same as those of the Monetary Fund.
Hon. Mr. NICOL: Will all the moneys
subscribed go to the bank and to the fund
in American dollars?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: No. That is one of
the virtues of the bill as it affects Canada.
There will be many currencies involved.
Every member nation is obligated to contribute in gold 25 per cent of its quota, or 10
per cent of its gold reserve, whichever is the
less. The balance of its contribution is made
in its own currency, but on a par value established initially by that country in relation to
United States dollars. Therefore, you will
have an international monetary fund that is
made up of many currencies. That is regarded
as a virtue which will enable a freer movement of international trade as between the
various member nations. In that way you
have an insurance fund to take care of
emergency situations, and provisions for longterm credit.
I would regard the bank itself as being in
the nature of a safety device, in the same
way that the monetary fund is an insurance
fund. I look upon the bank as existing to
promote as best it can international dealings
among the member nations. Where there is
not available some reasonable basis for financing a specific project or a long-term credit
which a particular member country may require, the bank steps in and takes up the
slack. The value of these two organizations
lies in the result that international trade as
between two countries does net have to cease
because one country may temporarily run
short of currency with which to pay off balances it may owe by reason of international
trade.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Am I correct in assuming
that the maximum liability incurred by
Canada under this agreement is its $300,000,000 .quota to the fund, and its $325,000,000
share in the bank?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: That is right. But
if at any particular time you had to liquidate
the Monetary Fund, for instance, you must
remember that-unless there were complete
world bankruptcy-Canada would get her
share of the many currencies in the fund although she might not get back the full amount
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN.

of gold she put in, or much in the way of
Canadian dollars.* So it cannot be said that
our loss would be $625,000,000. That is the
amount we are committed to in the quota,
but it is net the amount we initially contribute. We contribute $325,000,000 to the fund
and $32,500,000 to the bank; then we may be
called upon for another $32,500,000. That represents the extent of our contributions to
the bank until such time as it suffers loss
and makes an assessment. If Canada made
a loan directly to a particular country, and
there was default, she would suffer the entire
loss; but, by virtue of the many members of
the fund, when the bank makes a loss, it is
automatically shared proportionately by all
the member nations who contributed. There
is a spreading of the risk. The same spread
applies if the bank guarantees loans, or borrows money and re-lends it. These liabilities
are spread the entire length and breadth of
the membership nations, and there is protection to the extent of the contributions made.
The bill provides for no further comýmitments
by Canada to the fund.
There are many other provisions in connection with the method by which the bank
is to function and safeguard the use of
moneys. However, on this occasion I do net
think it is necessary to explain them.
May I, in conclusion, appear te rush in
where angels fear to tread. There has been
some objection in another place to this fund.
It has been suggested 'that it involves a revival of the gold standard, and that all the
ills humanity has borne in the last ten or
fifteen years have been attributable to the
gold standard and to the nations adhering to
that standard. Be that as it may, I think
some of the so-called evils or difficulties that
developed from a rigid adherence to the gold
standard do net exist under these agreements.
It is true that a great portion of the
Monetary Fund is gold belonging to the subseribers, and a great deal of currency moneys
are valued in relation to the United States
dollar. But, that does net mean that you
have a rigid gold standard. For instance, a
rigid gold standard of valuation is net imposed
on the domestic economy of Canada from the
outside; rather, we have a combination of the
vîrtues of goid as an international basis for
adjustment of balances, and at the same time
we have the currencies of the various nations
of the world established in the fund and in
the bank on some recognized basis of value.
This provides a little of that flexibility which
it is said the gold standard does net provide.
There is the further advantage to Canada
that she is a gold-producing country and will
develop and increase her own gold production

DECEMBER 14, 1945
because certainly in international exchange
gold speaks a universal language.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: May I ask the honourable member whether Canada could contribute her whole quota in gold, if she had the
means to do it, and thereby avoid the
exchange?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I do not think that
is possible. There is no provision in the bill
for doing so.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: The agreements only
call for 2 per cent in gold.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Two per cent in
gold to the bank and 25 per cent to the fund.
0f course we can sell our gold anywhere in
the world and acquire various currencies, but
there must be some purpose under the agreement for providing the gold limitations.
Whether it is just the "gold" bug-bear I am
not in a position to say. In any event,
for international trading purposes the initial
desire was to get all currencies in on some
basis of value in relation to United States
dollars.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: What does the
honourable senator mean by "in relation to
United States dollars"?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I thought I explained
that point to the honourable gentleman when
I was asked about par value. For instance,
Canada's currency contribution to the Monetary Fund is 75 per cent of her quota. You
must have some measuring-stick for the Canadian currency put into that fund. The measuring stick adopted is that we put a par value on
our currency and then relate it to United
States dollars. That is to say, if it takes $1.10
in Canadian currency to equal one United
States dollar, that is the parity in establishing
the value, and on that basis our contribution
in Canadian currency would have to be sufficient to produce, if it were converted into
United States dollars, 75 per cent of
$300,000,000.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I point out
to the honourable senator that the explanatory note says the Governor in Council shall
have ihe right to fix the par value of the
Canadian dollar.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN:
That is the effect
of what I am saying.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Why then cannot
the value of the Canadian dollar be fixed at
the same rate as the American dollar?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: That is a question
of Government policy on which any statement
I might make would mean nothing. There

447

are reasons why countries from time to time
prefer to have their currencies depreciated a
bit. One of the difficulties that developed
throughout the years and interfered most in
the battle for international trade was the
continued competitive depreciation of currencies. If we depreciated the Canadian dollar
it would be an invitation to the United States
to spend more of their dollars in Canada.
Export trade would be developed within
certain limitations because fewer United States
dollars - could buy more Canadian exports.
But why the Governor in Council might fix
the value of the Canadian dollar at $1.10, or at
a $1.02 in relation to the United States dollars
I could not say. I am not in a position to sug.
gest what value may be fixed because it has
not yet been stated.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: May I ask the
honourable senator a question? Assuming
that this whole arrangement is for the purpose of encouraging foreign trade, and that
we have a ten per cent advantage through
the depreciation of our currency in relation
to United States currency, can you see any
way of making this bank and this arrangement successful without in some way controlling tariffs so as to prevent countries from
equalizing our exchange by putting a tariff
on our goods?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I am glad the honourable gentleman brought that up, because
that is one of the points these agreements are
designed to cover. Part of the policy behind
this whole plan is that there must be conferences in relation to international trade
practices. As a matter of fact, we have
recently received a White Paper containing
certain ideas and plans of the United States
in relation to international trade practices,
and Canada among other countries is invited
to a conference with the United States on
that very subject.
If this scheme is to take shape and live, a
good many changes will have to be made
and a lot of the ideas and practices that we
have had in the past will have to be scrapped.
It may be that when this plan is fully developed such a thing as a sterling bloc will not
be practic'ble. It may be that empire trade
and the British preference as we know them
now will also not be practicable. We are
binding ourselves to get together to try to
achieve international co-ordination of policies
and practices, so as to make them work for
the greatest good of all the nations. It is a
worthy object at which we are aiming. When
we look back we see nothing to give us any
guidance except a lot of signs which say, "Do
not pass this way again unless you want to

SENATE
go on to another disaster." So we must go
forward.
Canada is in the position of being really a
creditor nation. The United States, of course,
is definitely a creditor nation. Yet after the
last war the United States behaved like a
debtor nation. That is, it wanted people to
buy its surplus products, but it was not willing to buy the products of other countries. A
creditor nation cannot behave in that way
and be prosperous for any great length of
time. Sooner or later such behaviour precipitates international squabbles and ultimately
war. The nations that are not able to trade
with you because they have nothing to offer
in return for your goods will get together
with those who economically are their brothers
under the skin, and will enter into agreements
to erect economie barriers against you, and
inevitably in time you will get to the kind of
situation we had in 1939. It is experience
that has led to the agreements that are now
before us.
The point I was coming to when I got off
on a little digression was that Canada will be
in an excellent position under these agreements if they work out. We must hope and
pray that they will work out, because we do
not know of any alternative except a goingback to a narrow nationalistic existence, with
its bilateral agreements for the depreciation
of currencies and so on. We know that if we
return to that kind of thing it will be only a
matter of time before we are in great trouble
again. But if these agreements are carried
out we can increase our production of gold.
which may be used from time to time as a
means of acquiring currencies from the fund
or of redeeming our surplus currency in the
fund. There are limitations on the amount
of currencies you may acquire, just as there
are on the amount of your currency that can
be in the fund at any time. As I recall, if
your currency reaches 200 per cent of your
quota a stop order is put on you until you
redeem some of it. I must confess that T
know very little about this subject, but I
have found it very fascinating. I do feel that
the agreements will mean much for Canada
if they work 'out.
May I give one other illustration to show
what the alternative to these agreements is?
We know that in the recent war the United
Kingdom reached a position where it no longer
had the means with which to acquire certain
things it needed to maintain its existence and
prosecute the war successfully. In Canada we
had some of those things, and we were very
anxious that the British war effort should
succeed. Therefore, we established a policy
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN.

of mutual aid. At the same time the United
States entered into a lend-lease arrangement
with Britain. Mutual aid and lend-lease were
substituted for currencies and gold and trading
in goods and industrial balances. The issue
was so great that we said to the United
Kingdom: "We know that your whole industrial economy is directed to the prosecution of the war, and that in consequence
you have not the means to buy from us in
the ordinary way the things you need, nor
the industrial capacity to make and export
goods in exchange for our goods, so we will
give you mutual aid."
We devised mutual aid and lend-lease in
war-time because we had the urge to protect
our way of life and our culture. Now in
neacetime the search is for some means that
will permit that same flow of trade between
member nations as, during the war, there was
between Canada and the United States on the
one hand and Great Britain on the otherthat flow of trade which is so necessary for
every country, the receiving as well as the
exporting country. To that end the best
brains of the United Nations have worked out
a plan, of which the Bretton Woods agreements are a part. We cannot tell whether
the plan will be successful until it has been
in operation for some time. It will be supplemented by various other measures, such as
our export credits insurance legislation, under
which we have authorized an increase of
S650,000,000 in loans and guaranteed advances.
Quite apart from these agreements, we are
also having conferences with the United
Kingdom designed to stimulate that flow of
goods which will provide the employment
necessary to maintain a decent standard of
comfort and living for the peoples of the
world. I think the incentive or urge of al]
those who planned these agreements may be
stated in two words-full employment. The
whole scheme is devoted to the end of
achieving full employment in all countries.
Surely we can hope that these agreements,
which have so laudable and so necessary an
objective, will lead to better understanding
so that, notwithstanding their differences, the
nations may unite and in peace work together
as harmoniously as they did in war.
For these reasons I must give my wholehearted support to the agreements.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I ask the honourable
gentleman how many nations have already
approved of the agreements?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Great Britain and the
United States. We expect that after tomorrow
Canada will be added to the list.

449

DECEMBER 14, 1945
Hon. Mr. HAIG: From certain remarks that
you made I gather that the United States may
withdraw at any time if it wishes.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Oh yes, any member
may withdraw.
Hon. Mr. HAIG- Honourabie senators, I
have not had time to look at this bill at ail,
and in order that I may have some opportunity to study it I think I ought to adjourn
the debate until Monday. It is not fair tc
expect anyone to discuss now a bill of this
kind which was placed on our desks oniy a
few minutes ago. I w111 therefore move,
seconded by the honourable gentleman from
Pembroke (Hon. Mr. White), that the debate
be adjourned until Monday.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: I object to that.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: I should like to
move an amendmnent, that we vote on the
bill to-night.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is not an amendment. If you are flot in favour of my motion
you need only vote against it.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, it has been moved by Honourable
Senator -Haig, seconded by Honourable Senator White, that the debate be adjourned
until Monday. Ail in favour of the motion
please say Content.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Content.

The Hon. the SPEAKER:
please say Non-content.

Ail opposed

Some Hon. SENATORS:- Non-content.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: In my opinion,
the Non-contents have it.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Mr. Speaker, I ask for a
division. I will explain why I do so. Year
after year it has been the practice to send
important measures to us just 'before the end
of a session. A bill like this shouid not be
dumped on our-doorstep only about twentyfour hours before the time proposed for prorogation.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The motion
hefore the House is not debatable.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Haig was negatived:
Contents, 9; non-contents, 28.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The motion
before the House now is for the second reading
of the bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

THIRD READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall the
bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I move that the
bill he now re.d the third time.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators. I have a right to, prDtest against this
motion, and I do. This is the rnost important
bill that hms corne before the Senate this session. It is most unfair to submit it to us for
approval at 8 o'clock on the night before prorogation. It is absolutely unthinkable that
the Government should ask that the bill be
now read the third time, and but for the rules
being suépended it would not be attempted.
The bill should be studiýed further hefore we
pass it. I must say quite candidly that it is
indecent to hasten legisiation of this important character through the House on the second
hast night of the session. During this session
many sittings have lasted not more than
lifteen or twenty minutes and until the lat
week or two the practice bas been to adi ourn
from Thursday night until Tuesday niglit
because so biltle legisiation reached us from the
other House. Again I protest at this attempt
to rush legisiation through at the last minute.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourabie senators, after consultation with my honourable
friend and okther senators, in order to expedýite
our business so far as hay in my power, I
moved that the report upon which this bill la
based be referred to the Committee on Trade
and Commerce, so that we might be given as
much information as possible on the subjeotmabter of the proposed legishation. The meeting of the committee was attended by a large
number of senators, inchuding -the honourable
leader opposite, and an expert gave us a full
explan&tion of the Bretton Woods agreement.
If my honourable friend had suggested that
the debate be adj ourned until tomnorrow I
wouhd have no objection, but as I understood
his motion it was that the debate he resumed
next Monday. It follows that the bill, the
subject-matter of which has been so thoroughly explained, miglit not be passed. Then
Canada, which bas taken a very prommnent part in the international negotiations
leading up to the Bretton Woods agreement,
would be placed in the position -of having
faihed to ratify thbe agreement, and consequently could not give effect to its
commitments.
In general I agree wlth every word my lionourable friend lias said about legislation reaching the Senate towards the end, of the session.
So far as I could I have donc my best to avol'd
what seem-s to be the inevitable courQe of

450

SENATE

events. I suppose the mere fact that ultimately the session nears its end means that
some legislation must come ,to us from the
other louse at the last moment. It should
not be beyond the wit of man te work out
some arrangement by which there could be a
better division of the sessional work; but se
far as this particular bill is concerned, I know
nothing more that I could have done to facilitate its reaching this House at an earlier date.
Had any honourable senator suggested to
me that it was desirable, I should have been
happy to have arranged for a continuation of
the meetings of ithe Committee on Commerce
and Trade Relations of Canada. While technically, as my honourable friend might point
out, the bill was not before the committee,
the subject-matter could have been considered at even greater length, and for the
advantage of honourable senators we could
have had two, three or more meetings. It
may bc my fault that this was not done.
I would point out that Parliament may prorogue tomorrow, and even if this bill is disposed of tonight we have still two or three
other important measures te deal with. However, if my honourable friend wishes to adjourn further consideration of this bill until
tomorrow, I personally would have no objection, but I certainly should not like te be
placed in the position of inconveniencing
those senators who have made arrangements
ta return te their homes-arrangements of
which my honourable friend has spoken to me
on behalf of various members. All I want te
do, se far as in the circumstances is consistent with reasonable consideration of the
measures before us, is te expedite the business
of the House and meet the convenience of
honourable senators.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: If I may be allowed te
speak again, I would say that I have no complaint against the honourable leader of the
Government. During the whole session he has
been most kind te me and bas in every way
possible done his best te furnish me and
other members on this side of the House
with any desired information. But apparently whatever Government may be in office,
it is the practice of the House of Commons
te hold back important legislation until near
the end of the session. It is a very disappointing practice. I admit that Mr. Rasminsky attended two sittings of the committee and gave us a full exposition of the
agreement. But we did not have the bill
before us. Se far as I am concerned, I must
say that it will be impossible for me te complete my stud.y of this bill by 11 o'clock
tomorrow. Then other important pieces of
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

legislation will come before the Senate for
consideration. The only way in which I can
make my protest is by asking adjournment
of the motion for third reading of the bill.
Hon. THOMAS VIEN: Honourable senators, we have on many occasions voiced objections similar te those which we have just
heard from the honourable leader opposite.
We all are averse te legislation reaching us
in the dying days of the session, when bonourable senators cannot give it adequate consideration. But I would suggest this particular case is what I may term a classic
exception te the general rule. The Bretton
Woods agreement is the outcome of the international conference which took place in July,
1944.
I do not believe that the subjectmatter of any legislation before Parliament
has ever received such world-wide publicity
as has the Bretton Woods agreement. In
Canada the agreement itself was published
as a White Book and distributed throughout
the country. When the resolution was introduced in the other House,. the Senate, according te its usual practice, submitted a copy of
the bill te a committee, where its salient featurcs were fully gone into. I doubt if any
piece of legislation was more fully studied
both in the House of Commons and in the
Senate. Part and parcel of this international
agreement is that it must be ratified by the
various member-nations before the 31st of
December. We all know that the intention is
te prorogue Parliament tomorrow. I do not
believe a day or even two days' further discussion would add much more te our understanding of this bill. Undoubtedly an adjournment until Monday would cause considerable
personal inconvenience te honourable senators, many of whom have already made their
railway reservations and may find it difficult
te change them. In common with the honourable leader opposite, I wish that important
legislation were not sent te us from the other
House in the dying days of the session, when
it is difficult te give it adequate consideration; but I do not believe that objection
applies in the present instance.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Question!

WISHART
Hon.
mox cd the second reading of Bill 243, an, Act
to amend the Senate and House of Commons
Act.
Ho said: Honýourable senators will recaîl
that on Octoher 12. in response to a question
asked about a notice of motion appearing on
the Order Paper in another place in relation
to the payment of allowances to members of
the House of Commons, I answered in part
as follows:
The whole matter of an allowance for members of Parliament for expenses incidenýtai to the
discharge of their duties bas beeù un-de-r consideration by the Goveroment, but the only dccision reached up to the present is that indicated
by the notice f the proposed resolution in the
other place.
I should ike to remind honourable senators that betwoen September 13 and October
3 dte Sente was in recess During that period

DECEMBER 15, 1945
it was necessary for me to visit Halifax in
connection with some personal business, and
as my return to Ottawa was delayed I did
flot arrive here until after the Prime Minister
had left for Europe-a trip that turned out
to be longer than had been anticipatedand therefore I had no opportunity of
discussing the matter with him.
Furtber,
it will be recalled that immedýiately following
the departure of the Prime Minister the acting Prime Minister was absent from Ottawa
in cannection with Victory Loan campaigns.
It is naturai that legisiation having to do
with the Senate-and this bill refers to both
flouses--sbould be discussed witih me in my
officiai. capacity as Government leader in this
flouse. When inquiry was made about the
notice of motion to wbîch I have referred, I at
different times suggested a discussion of the
matter as it affected this honourable 'body. But
nothing could be done until the retura of the
Prime Minister.
On the return of the Prime Minister, when.
I discussed the matter with him, hie expressed
the view that immediate consideration would
be impossible because of other more pressing
questions. In due course, however, the matter
was considered with the result that the notice
of motion was changed fromn its original form
to the one before us today.
This unfortunate chain of circumstances,
and tbe lapse of two montha following the
original notice of motion, bas been poin.ted
to in some quarters as indicating a definite
desire to discriminate between the two flouses
of Parliament. The suggestion that the second
notice of motion is the resuit of some tbreatened action by this bonourable body is absolutely without foundation, and is, I think, a
reflection upon honourable members of this
flouse.
1 should like ta refer to, the three pertinent
points in connection witb the bill now before
us. First, there is tbe question of the increase
in the allowance to members of Parliament
as a whole. Second, there is the fact that the
amount of this allowance is the samne for
members of bath flouses.. Thirdly, the latter
part of the bill specifically states that the
allowance paid ta members of the Senate shall
be deemed to be taxable income.
On the first point, bonlourable senators,
I should like to express my opinion that it
is not unreasonable that members of Parliament shauld be paid an additionai allowance
for expenses. 0f course, the passing of such
an allowance is always a somewhat difficult

one, because the matter must be initiated and
voted upon by those who, are directly
concerned.
One of the priceless characteristies of our
publie life, is, I think, the rigid honesty with
which the mnembers of the iegislative bodiesof this country have discharged their duties.
In fact, this is Sa generally true that in the
whole history of our country one can hardly
recaîl a single exception. Among the members of Parliament and other legislative bodies,
as amang the people of ahl other groups,
there are of caurse varying degrees of need;
but 1 believe there is growing up a more or
less universal desire that no persan shail be
precluded from serving as a representative
of the people because financially bie cannat
afford ta du so, and further, that so far as
reasonably possible such representative should
be placed in an independent position for the
discharge of bis duties.
Some flan. SENATORS: flear, bear.
flan. Mr. ROBERTSON: I cannot undertake ta, say wbether tbe additional alowance
proposed in this bill is toa large or too smali,
but I do say that anything whicb is done ta
strengthen the independence of members of
legisiative bodies, and which mnakes it possible
for any persan, no matter how humble bis circumstances, ta serve the country in helping
ta make its iaws, is a step in the right
direction.
Some flan. SENATORS: flear, bear.
flan. Mr. ROBERTSON: Wbetber tbe time
is right f or taking such a step wili always be
a question. I recaîl that years ago, wben the
Legisiature of Nova S:cotia increased the
indemnities of its members, the element of
time always entered into the argument: it was
contended, and witb some merit, that the
increase should not be made at that particular
time. I bave no doubt that sucb an argument
can be advanced now. But there is tbis ta be
said in repiy, that wbiie ail of aur people may
not have enjoyed reiatively the financial
benefits that flowed from the increased
economia activity incidentai ta the war effort,
yet if everything is taken into consideration
honourable members will, I tbin-k, agree that
there was neyer a period in tbe history -of
any country during wbich the national income
was as fairly and equitably distributed as it
bas been in Canada during recent years. I
do not deny that there are exceptions, discriminations which we as legisiators should

454

SENATE

endeavour to remove; but, broad and long,
I believe my statement holds good.
So while it may be argued that this time
or that time is better suited to action than
another, on the whole I believe honourable
senators will agree with my general proposition that it is desirable that we should do
everything in our power to prevent anyone
being debarred by reason of his financial position from becoming a member of one of our
legislative Chambers. Further, as far as is
reasonably possible, every 'legislator sh' uld
be placed in an absolutely independent position. I submit, therefore, that in view of the
general condition as respects the distribution
of our national income the present is as
acceptable a time as we are ever likely to
encounter to increase sessional indemnities.
On the genera.l principle of equality between
the two Houses, I suppose it would always
be difficult to establish on a strict mathematical basis the extent to which an increased
indemnity or financial return was deserved.
There are bound to be great differences of
opinion as respects need, which of course
must vary with individual circumstances. I
know nothing of the financial position of
honourable senators-indeed I bave great difficulty in determining my own; from time to
time-but I submit that not only in this but
in the other Chamber there are bound to be
differences of opinion on the question of need.
There are also bound to be differences of
opinion as to the contribution that individual
members of Parliament make in the discharge
of their duties. This is inevitable. I know of
no yardstick by which you could determine
those two factors on any mathematical basis.
It bas been suggested in some quarters that
because of the small amount of legislation
originating in this House, due largely to
circumstances arising out of the war, the
number of our sitting days in relation to those
of the other Chamber was not as great as
in normal times, and that this disparity
constitutes a reason why there should be
discrimination between the two Houses in
respect to the subject-matter of this bill. But
we and the country as a whole should realize
that, after all, this is just a passing phase. It
is my hope that the increasing business of the
country will be reflected in the business of
Parliament, and that this difference will
gradually disappear. At Confederation the
two branches of Parliament were placed on an
equality, and that principle bas been continued down to the present day. If, therefore,
at any particular period there has been less
legislative activity in this House than in the
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

other, that d*oes not in any way affect the
general principle of equality. I subscribe then
to the proposition that the financial return
to members of Parliament should be increased,
and that the tradition of equality of both
Houses should be maintained.
If any honourable members feels that there
is a different opinion in the country, I would
remind him that in this House there is an
intense desire to serve Canada. I can say that
in the short period that I have been Government leade-r here I have never run into
trouble when I suggested that the Senate
should meet; my trouble bas always arisen
when I suggested an adjournment. I reaffirm
what I said a few minutes ago, that bearing in
mind the increase in governmental activities
which the logic of circumstances is bringing
about, and' the increased number of important
international questions that are before us, there
will in the days ahead' be ample business to
tax the time and energies of every member
of Parliament, whether in this or in the other
House; and it should not be beyond the
wit of man to devise some better division of
legislative work, su that the Senate may in
fuller measure assune its responsibilities and
duties for the greater benefit of the country as
a whole.
Now I should like to draw the attention of
honourable senators to the provisions of the
bill. cummencing with line 9:
In addition to the expenses provided for in
subsection one of this section, each member of
the Senate and House of Commons shall be paid
an allowance for expenses, incidental to the .discharge of his duties as a member, at the rate of
two thousand dollars per annum for the period
during which he is a member. This allowance
shall be paid at the end of each calendar year
and shall be subject to a deduction equal to
one-half of the deductions, if any, from the
member's sessional allowances in respect of nonattendance at sittings of the House of which he
is a member during such year.
If the bill stopped at that point the $2,000
to be paid to both members of the Senate
and of the House of Commons would be nontaxable under the Income Tax Act. But the
bill proceeds:
In the case of Ministers of the Crown, of the
Lea.der of the Opposition in the House of Commons, and of members of the SenateHon. Mr. LEGER: I do not wish to interrupt the honourable gentleman, but I think
ho meant that if the bill stopped there the
$2,000 would be taxable.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No, under the
first part of the paragraph it would be nontaxable.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR:
be viewed as expenses.

The amount would

DECEMBER là, 1945
lion. Mr. ROBERTSON: If the bill stopped
there the arnount would be considered expenses.
flan. Mr. LEGER: That 18 right.
lon. Mr. ROBERTSONý
The provision
in the bill that makes the' proposed arnount
taxable, which is aur prirnary concern as it
relates to members of the Senate, is as follows:
-the arnount of such. allowance paid shail be
deemed te be taxable incarne.
As I have said, honourable senators, I do
flot think it unreasonable to, expect that legislation affecting the members of this bonourable body should nat be conternplated without
at least an expression of opinion by the one
member of this honourable body who is
also a member of the Government. The
Government rnay seek ta secure views on
proposed legislation frorn any source they see
fit, and do not depend entirely upon those
expressed by me. However, the provision
ini the last part of paragrapli (4) of section 1
as it affects the members of the Senate,
corresponds exactly with the opinion I expressed, believing it ta be the opinion af the
vast rnajority of the members of this House.
Some Hon. SENATORS: flear, hear.
Hlon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It represented my
best judgment as ta the desire of the members
of this honourable-body. If I was wron. rny
judgment was at fauit. I cornmend ta, honaurable senators the favourable consideration
of this bill.
flan. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: flonourable senators I regret that in rising ta appose
this bill I rnust differ with several of my
friends whose ability and judgment I have
always respected, and I ask the honourable
leader opposite ta forgive me if I seern ta be
usurping his priority in the debate.
Ilon. Mr. HAIG: Leave kranted.
flan. Mr. LAMBERT: I arn opposed ta
thjs bill on two grounds; first, that the tax
exemption feature is distasteful and repugnant,
and secondly, that the bill as it affects the
unity of Parliarnent is in-vidiaus in character.
Wbat 1 have ta say today 1 say as a member
of Parliament rather than as a member of the
Senate. Whether honourable senators recagnize it or nat, their responsibility for the acts
of Parliament as a whole is as great as that
of the members in the other place. We must
realize that we are just as responsible for this
bill in ail its particulars as are the member's
of the other flouse who voted an it yesterday.
If the tax exemption feature of this bill means
anytbing, it means t hat within the confines
of Parliament-which should maintain its

45à

unity in every respect-there will be established a privileged class on the basis of
dollars and cents.
I wauld have no abjection, ta a proposed
general advance in Parliamentary indemnifies, or ta a provision whereby legitimate
expenses af members of Parliament would be
regarded as deductible items ia their an-nual
incarne tax returns. Why no, such provision
was made is something I cannot understand.
The decision ta base this legislation upon an
amendment ta the Senate and flouse of
Commons Act instead of ta the Incarne Tax
Act, represents the bane of my main contention against the bill. As a member of
Parliament, I resent being called upon ta
approve a proposaI whicb, if adopted, will
for a long tirne to corne be a subi ect af
recrimination between members of the two
bouses of Parliarnent as they seek ta escape
responsîbility before the bar af public opinion
in this country. Already there have been
open recriminations, as is evidenced by the
caustie comments and opinions that have been
circulated through these halls by very eminent gentlemen from the other place witbin
the last twenty-four hours. Sa I say that
dragons' teeth are being sown here today, and
before long honourable senators will have full
opportunity ta recagnîze the character of the
crop which will be produced.
I came now ta the second broad ground of
rny objection. Apart altogether from objections that I bhave made ta the tax exemption
feature, I arn opposed ta the bill hecause of
the disservice done ta this country by vtOhat I
think is the prerneditated introduction of an
invidious distinction between the tw. flouses
af the Canadian Parliament. If this bill dues
not represent a technical breach *of the Act of
Confederation, it certainly violates the spirit
af it. A casual reading of the discussions
which preceded Confederation, or of the hanguage of the Act itself, does not admit of any
difference in status between members of the
Senate and the members of the flouse of
Cammons. Yet witliout any consultation,
formal or informal, between representatives of
the two flouses, a resolution was suddenly
placed on the Order Paper of the other place
as a sort (Yfkite ta test flot only the reaction
af the Senate, 'but opinion in the country.
The leader of -the Goverament in this Chamber (fln. Mr. Robertson) as well as the then
acting Prime Minister, stated that the resolution that went on the Order Paper on Navcrnber 13 represented onhy the Governm-,nt's
decision up ta that titne. Therefore, can anyone take any other view than thait the sudden
%as
pmnsting of t-hat resolution on Novernber 13 w
for the purpose af saunding opinion?

456

SENATE

It is true that no action was taken on the
resolution until the Prime Minister returned
from the United Kingdom. Then there was a
thorough lobby of the Senate members to
ascertain their opinions on the matter. But
the point is, if one may change a figure of
speech by going from kites to bombs, that
the bomb was dropped before any effort was
made to control or limit the effect of its
impact. I think, therefore, that the metho,d
adopted in the introduction of this matter
was most unfortunate; and while the bill now
before us represents a modification of the proposal contained in the original objectionable
resolution, it does not overcome or even offset
the invidiousness of its beginnings.
Much has been said about pre-election
pledges and understandings. These remarks
almost lead me to believe or imagine that I
supported and worked for the return of the
present Government on the issue of giving
myself and the successful members of the
other place an increased indemnity. Well, all
I have to say on that point at this time is
that in the recent general election the public
were not aware of that issue, and J for one
never heard it mentioned.
My concern for the Senate in this whole
matter is due to my definite conviction that
a second chamber characterized by industry,
imdependence and integrity of judgment is of
greater importance to the life of this country today than it has been at any other time
or period in our history. I believe that at
this moment and until Canada emerges into
a more settled post-war economy, this branch
of Parliament is the on'ly real guardian of
democratie rights and. civil liberties as this
country bas known them since Confederation.
Amendments recently made by our standing
committees to a whole series of bills which
have come over to us containing clauses of
questionable validity, to say the least, surely
must have given honourable senators a glimpse
of the reactionary trend of certain administrative and legislative ideas of these times.
I should like to refer to an aspect of this
situation which to my knowledge has not been
deait with in the other House or outside of
it. That is. the interests of the Provinces,
which in many ways represent our chief
reason for existence. Let no one think that
this bill, if it is adopted will bu overlooked
by different provincial governments and legislatures of this country. They will want to
know, for one thing, if the bill represents the
first, if rather surreptitious, step toward
Senate reform. They, as well as we, have a
definite right to know that. At the DominionProvincial Conference of 1927, held in Ottawa,
Lbe subject of Senate reform was discussed
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT.

under a separate item on the agenda. The
question airose in consequence of a resolution
passed in the other House in March, 1925,
demanding a measure of Senate reform. What
happened at that time? The Official Précis
cf Discussion contains the following official
record of what iappened:
It may be stated that the question of abolition had not a single backer in the conference.
A comparatively smali body of opinion favoured
some change which might bring the Upper Chamber more closely in contact with -the electorate,
though this was regaýrded as ýat variance with
the British system of Government on which the
Canadian system is based . . . Throughout the
discussion the right of the provinces to be consulted on such an important matter as this was
frequently emphasized. While there was a strong
body of opinion in favour of any reforms which
might strengthen the general machinery of Parliament, there was no 'attempt on the part of ýany
speaker to minimize the value of a second
Chamber.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I may say, honourable
senators, that I happened te attend that conference. and I do net think that discussion
lasted more than three-quarters of an heur.
The proposal got short shrift.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT:
The honourable
senator bas given his personal recollection of
what occurred at the conference. The basis
of my information is the printed record.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: He agrees with yeu.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: No. According to
the official record, a whole day was taken up
with the discussion on that subject.
Hon. Mr. NICOL: I was at the conference,
and I do net remember the subject being
discussed at ail.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: If honourable senators have any doubt regarding the point of
view of the provinces aIt tbat time, J would
refer them to page 10 of the Official Précis of
the Discussions from Novemiber 3 to 10, 1927.
My point is that since that time no reference was made te any change in the status of
the Senate by any Dominion Government
until the present invidious situation was
creaitd by the resolution
presented in
the other House.
So far as I am aware,
no reference to the advisability of such a
step was made at either of the two recent
sessions of the Dominion-Provincial Conference. In the light of these circumstances it
seems to me to be in order te suggest that
this subject should be discussed at the January meeting of the provincial premiers with
representatives of the Federal Government.
I was much interested in noting the remarks
on this question of the leader of the third
party in the other place. In accepting his
tax-exempt increase, and approving of a tax-

DECEMBER 15, 1945
able increase for tbe Senate, be took some
pains to make clear tbat the welh-known
policy of bis party regarding Senate reform
etili stood. This is the gentleman wbo for
some tinie bas been publicly advocating abolition of the Senate. Judging fromi bis words
yesterday, hie evidenthy helieves in baving bis
cake and eating it too. He also said that the
Senate is an anomohy in these modern times,
and ealhed upon the Primýe Minister to proceed in tbe very near future witb bis long
promised measure of Senate reform.
If Senate reformn is being broacbed tbrough
tbis bill, why flot say so? I for one sbaîl be
ahl for a measure of reform, properly introduaced and executed througb ýamendments to
tbe tritish Nortb America Act; but I arn
strongly opposed to temporizing expedients as
an excuse for overd-ie reform in tbe working
miachiraery of botb flouses of Parliament.
(My opposition to this bill rnay be interpreted as an invitation on rny part to proceed
witb reform tbrougb tbe front door of tbese
buildings and not by tbe rear porcb entrance.
I bave been advised by tbe constitutional
experts of this Chamber that this bill is not
susceptible of amendment hecause we cannot
initiate a money bill; so, in expressing my
opposition I bave no alternative but to say,
1 shahl vote against tbis measure.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
I had not intended t-o enter the discussion,
but tbe words of -tbe bonourable leader of tbe
flouse compel me to do so.
Tbere is considerable clamour in the press
against any increase in indemnities, on the
ground, first, thbat this is not tbe proper time
to make tbe increase; and, secondly, tbat
should it be made it shouldi be subjeet to
income tax. Tbere is also tbe criticismn among
tbe people that we ought not to increase our
own indemnities until salary and wage controls
are released. Witb that criticism I agree
entirely; but I would point out that the
Senate has nothing to do witb tbe continuation of tbose controls. We are also told
that tbe public generally are in favour of
increased sessional indemnities, but tbat members of the other flouse should not exempt
their increase from income tax. Unhike
the honourable gentleman frorn Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert), I arn not disturhed
because the Senate is being treated differently
frorn tbe Bouse of Gommons. I arn happy to
say that some time ago the bonourable leader
of the flouse tahked tbe wbole situation over
witb me. I tohd birn: "I do not know wbat
our party will do wben tbe bill cornes before
us, but I do not want any tax-free indemnity
increase to apply to members of tbe Senate-"

457

An lion. SENATOR: flear, bear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: "-and personally 1 shall
vote against the bill if it makes any such
proposai." 1 have not met a single senator
either on my own side or on the other side
who does flot whole-heartedily share that
view. Let me add that the leader of the
Government-I arn glad bie is not in lis seat
at the moment-before hie asked for my
opinion stated bis own, with which 1 expressed ýmy entire agreernent. 1 think the
public are entitled to know that this meeting
took place shortly after the resolution appeared
on the Order Paper of the flouse of Commons.
The first question to my mind boils d'own
to this fine point: Shahl we reject the bill?
My answer is an unqualified No.
An 1-on. SENATOR: flear, hear.
lion. Mr. HIAIG: The second question is:
Sbould we insist on the Commons making
their increased indemnity subject to incarne
tax. That is a very bard question to, decide.
My bonourable friend from Ottawa .(Hon.
Mr. Lambert)-I appreciate bis bonesty of
purpose-thinks that tbis discrimination is
unfair to the Senate as a co-partner in the
Parliament of Canada. I do not bold that
view. I think tbe Commons are wrong; but
if tbey are willing to take their increased indemnity tax free, that is up to them.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: In two or tbree years'
time they will have to satisfy their ehectors
that they did tbe rigbt thing in exempting
their $2.000 from income tax. I do not think
tbey can satisfy them. But tbat is tbeir
business, flot mine.
lion. Mr. LAMBERT: Does my honourable friend know of any instance in our parliamentary history in whicb the members of
Pither Chamber bave entirely diasociated
thiemselves from responsibility for 1egislation?
lion. Mr. HAIG: No, I am not dissociating myself fromn responsibility. I say quite
candidly that if the position were reversed and
I were a member of the other House, I would
bave to object to the increased indemnities
of senators being made tax free, because the
electors bave it in tbeir power to criticize and
punish members of the Commons for doing
anything contrary to, public opinion. Tbat
difference between the membersbip of the two
Houses is fundamental. We senators are bere
because, in order to make federation feasible,
it was essential to provide for a second

what their population might be, and on the
same basis, one-third to each of the provinces
of Quebec and Ontario. That was done so
that the Senate might be the protector of
provincial rights. There is no doubt about
that. Of course, as I stated yesterday, the
proportion has been changed to one-quarter in
order to give the Western provinces similar
representation. Some day Western Canada
may have half the membership of the House
of Commons. What will Ontario, Quebec,
and the Maritime provinces say then? They
will rely on this Chamber for the protection
of their rights as provinces. That to my mind
is fondamental.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I am persuaded that no
provincial conference would for a moment
consider any change in the basis of Senate
representation.
Hon. Mr. LEGER:

That is right.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: If I were again in a
provincial legislature I would never think of
changing the basis of representation in the
Senate, because only on this Chamber can we
rely for protection of provincial rights.
I can quite understand why persons who are
paying very heavy personal income taxes dislike the tax-free feature of this bill. I speak
with some personal feeling, for I may say that
the increase to me will not be very large. But,
as the Prime Minister and the leader of the
official Opposition said in the other House, if
we are to get men of character and ability
to enfer public life, whether in this House
or the other, there must be available to them
a reasonable indemnity. As a matter of fact,
even with the increased indemnity we in this
House shall be getting only about $600
more than we received in 1938. In the lower
brackets our income tax, as I have many
times stated in this House, is altogether too
heavy.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It is also very heavy in
the high income tax brackets. Before the
recent amendments to the Inceome War Tax
Act a man with an income of a million dollars had to pay an income tax that left him
a balance of about $60,000. Do not misunderstand me. That is plenty for any man to
live on. But the difficulty is this: it means
Where is no capital for investmen-t in new
nterprises.
However, I do not want to discuss taxation.
Personally I wish the Commons had not
exempted their increased indemnity from
income tax. But the responSibility does not rest
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

on the shoulders of John T. Haig or any
other member of this Chamiber. We are willing
to be taxed, and we intend to tax ourselves.
Within the last two or three weeks people have
telephoned and have written me urging that
this is the time when the Senate can make
history by resisting the tax-free feature of this
legislation.
My honourable
friend from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) thinks they are
right, but I do not agree entirely with him.
If this House instead of the other, had promoted the bill. and it contained the tax-free
feature, I would fight it just as bitterly as
my honourable friend. We would have control over it then, and we would be taxing ourselves. However, the responsibility for this
bill rests on the members of the House of
Commons.
I am in favour of increased sessional indemnities; in fact I would have gone higher than
this bill goes. If we are going to attract the
right people to Parliament while they are
still active, we must properly compensate
them. How can a doctor, a lawyer. or a businessman of 45 to 50 years of age afford to come
to Ottawa as a member of Parliament and
pay taxes et the present rates? A first-class
farmer could net afford, to become a member
of Parliament.
Honourable members, I intend te vote in
favour of this bill, and I have asked all honourable senators on this side of the House
to do so.
Hon THOMAS A. CRERAR: The view
expressed by the honourable leader opposite,
if I understand it correctly, is that since the
House of Commons, by design or otherwise,
bas exempted its members from taxation under
this bill. it is the affair of that body and of
no concern to this House. I cannot in any
way agree with that theory.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Under our constitution legislation must be enacted by Parliament, and the responsibility of the Senate
for such enactment is equal with that of the
House of Commons. If good laws are made, we,
as members of Parliament. can claim equal
credit with the members of the Commons;
if the laws are bad, we cannot wash our hands
of them and say that the responsibility is
not ours. I should be very sorry indeed if
there was any acceptance in this Chamber
of the viewpoint expressed by the honourable
leader opposite.
The unfortunate controversy over this question bas come, in my humble opinion, froin a
failure on the part of the Government to
fully recognize the well-established responsibility of the Senate in the making of our

DECEMBER 15, 1945
laws. The bill before us is one ta amend
the Senate and H-ouse of Commons Act. By
reason of the very titie and the contents of
the bill, the Senate has an even more direct
interest ini it, if possible, than i any other
item of legisiation. I submit that the manner
in which the -resolution was first placed before
the Bouse of Commons on the l3th of
Navember was unfortunate.
Before any
resolution indicating what was intended ta
he done had been placekl on the Order Paper
in the other House, the whole question should
have been the subi ect of conference between
representatives of bath Bouses. That is the
practice with respect to the Library of Parliament and the supervision of the restaurant.
There was no good reason why such a meeting could flot have been held on this question.
May I say that if the bill had corne ta this
Bouse based on the resolution as originally
introduced in the Bouse of Commons, it
would have been overwSiflmingly defeated.
Originally, there were two obj ectionable
features: first, there was open and unashamed
discrimination as between members of Parliament; and second, there was the exemption
from income tax on the additional amount
proposed. If I assessed the opinion of hioncurable senators corrcctly, their position very
definitely was that there should be no discrimination as between the two houses of
Parliament and that there should be no incarne
tax exemption.
There -is in some places, and amnong certain
individuals, a complete misconception as ta
the place the Senýate occupies i the Parliament of Canada. Some individuals throughout the country, sorne newspapers and even
saine members ini the other place, quite openly
advocate the abolition of the Senate.
Bon. Mr. LEGER: Thcy rnight as well
argue for the abolition of Confederation.
Han. Mr. CRERAR: They refer to it as
the fifth wheel ta the coach, anid say that it
is a refuge for infirm, aid men. Such statements corme from. abysmal ignorance or prejudice, or bath.
Sorne Bon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Bon. Mr. CRERAR: Any persan who has
made even the mast elementary study of the
constitution of aur country, and certainly
those who have studied the events leading up
ta Confederation, can. came to no ather conclusion than this: that if the Senate had not
been set up ini the constitution, as it was, the
confederation of the different provinces which
formn the Dominion of Canada today would
have been impossible.

Hon. Mr. LEGER: The honourable senator je absolutely correct.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: If at sarne time in the
future, action were taken ta abalish the Senate
of Canada, it would, I fear, lead ta the breaking Up of this Confederation, which in the
space of seventy odd years has, made us a fully
modern etate. Therefore, honourable gentlemen, ýwe cannot escape our share of responsibility for legislation passed by Parliament.
While the discrimination shown in this
measure as first introduced has not been removed entirely, as far as that feature is concemned 1 would be .prepared ta accept the
bill b-efore us. But, I am not prepared ta
accept responsibility for the exemption from
incarne tax of the allowance to members of
the Bouse of Commons. If members of Parliarnent are entitlcd ta an increase in their
total remuneration, which I believe they ait,
the measure should be presented in a less objectionable manner. It rnay be assumed, I
think, that the -allowance for expenses of
$2,000 is provided in this way ta enable argument, anaemic though it rnay be, ta be mnade
against any complaint that this allowance is
a violation of the salaries control order still
in effect. Frankly, I do not like, this way of
doing it. It would have been better ta have
said franly, "We are going ta increase the
indemnities of members of Parliament to
86,000, and tax thern."
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: As the honourable
senator knows, there is a provision for the
raising of salaries in private industry.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: The remark of the
honourable senator frorn Queens-Lunenberg
(Bon. Mr. Kinley) strengthens my argument
that there should have been a straight increase
of indernnity to members of Parliament. I
would noV have oppoeed giving members of
Parliament the right to dlaim exemptions
against incarne tax for legitimate expenses
incurred in connectian. with their work when
such claim was siipported hy a proper declaration, and under a ceiling fixed by law. There
has neyer been, and cannot be, complete
equality in the remuneration received by
members of Parliament. A member who is
within a few hours travelling time of Ottawa
is in a much more favourable position, so
far as expenses are concemned, than a member
frose the Maritime provinces or theprovinces
of Western Canada, and that is true whether
hie is a member of the Senate or of the Bouse
of Commons. Sa far as I arn aware, senators
must have a place ta sleep when they corne
to Ottawa, and they must consume food. While
here they have al the expenses that a member
of the Commons has. The only possible

160

SENATE

difference is that a member of the Commons,
by reason of being an elected representative
and having to keep in touch with his constituency, may have certain expenses which a
senator does not have. But under my suggestion these expenses could have been taken
care of. At the end of the year members of
Parliament could make a declaration of their
expenses within the limit provided, and claim
a deduction on their income tax returns. That
would have been fair in general and as between
individuals. At any rate, in my judgment,
that would have been a much fairer thing
than giving a blanket allowance of $2,000 for
expenses and saying to members of the Senate, "You pay taxes on the allowance,"
but to members of the House of Commons,
"Yeu are exempt from taxes on it."
The honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert) stated that we have no power
to amend this bill. I think that is correct.
If the Senate had that power I unhesitatingly
say that in my judgment it would have been
our duty to have amended the taxation
feature of the bill. But as we have net that
power, we must either accept the bill or reject
it. I am bound to say that if it comes to a
vote I am going to vote against the measure
for the reasons I have stated. I recognize
that I am differing with members in both
Houses who have been colleagues of mine.
However, I think this is a case where every
man must do as bis own conscience indicates,
and certainly on that basis I conceive it to be
my duty to oppose the bill.
Hon. JACOB NICOL: Honourable senators, I came here with the intention of voting
against this bill, but as the leaders on both
sides were speaking I recalled what I had
heard one evening when sitting in tne senators'
gallery in the other House. This very subject
of indemnities came up and the Prime Minister promised that if his Government was
returned he would see to it that sessional
indemnities were increased. The then Leader
of the Opposition, who is not in Parliament
at the present time, expressed himself as
favouring an increase. As I recall, he spoke
to this effect: "I am not speaking on behalf
of myself, for I do not intend te return te
In any event I have certain
Parliament.
means and do not need the indemnity, but I
recognize that most members cannot afford to
serve their country for the indemnity that is
now paid." The leader of the third party
said much the same thing. So as I see it a
promise was made that the indemnities would
be increased, and I think we all recognize
that in order to do their work in an efficient
manner the members must be given a larger
allowance. I do not like the way in which
Hon. Mr. CRERAR.

the bill was brought before Parliament. I
have hardly ever seen a piece of legislation
introduced so awkwardly.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. NICOL: For that and other
reasons I had intended to vote against the
bill. The manner in which it was introduced
has placed every one of us in a very invidious
position. We are being criticized all over the
country; people are suggesting that if senators have had a change of mind on this matter
it is because the increased indemnity has been
made applicable to them. I do not like that.
I believe it would have been much better te
have dropped this bill, which got off to such
a bad start, and brought in another later on.
There are other salaries or indemnities
which should have been adjusted before those
of members of Parliament. I know a great
many of the judges in my own province and
other provinces. During the forty years their
salaries have been raised twice, but I could
tell you of judges in Montreal, Quebec and
other districts whose net compensation today,
on account of taxation, is less than it was
before the increases were made. Do honourable senators not think it would have been a
good move on the part of Parliament to
adjust the salaries of judges before increasing
sessional indemnities?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. NICOL: Besides. there is nothing
to preclude members of Parliament from continuing their ordinary business or occupation.
Most of us are engaged in some kind of business, from which we receive revenues, but
judges are sworn not to participate in any
remunerative work aside from their official
duties. Actually there are judges whose compensation amounts to about $5,000 a year,
and the law precludes them from earning even
an adiditional dollar. In view of that situation I should have liked to vote against this
bill.
Further, we know from statistics that
2,600,000 of the taxpayers who pay for the
upkeep of Parliament are earning less than
$1,200 a year. In face of that fact we cannot
say there is a great need for members of
Parliament to increase their own indemnities.
Many other arguments could be made against
the bill. But I recognize the fact, which has
been referred to, that some members of each
House cannot fulfil their duties properly
because the present indemnity is too low to
meet necessary expenses. If I correctly understood the honourable senator from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) he feels it would not be
logical te support this bill. But sometimes
you have to do things which strictly are

DEGEMBER 15, 1945
flot logical. I arn going to force myseif, Sa
to speak, to vote for the bill, because I know
the increased indemnity is needed by rnany
members of Parliament and 1 would flot
want any action of mine to deprive them of
it. I thinik the people should be informed
that for the large majority of members in
bath flouses the increase wilI mean very littie.
Most of it wiII go back to the Minister of
Finance. We shahl be receiving with one
hand and paying out with the other. But
I would not by my vote prevent the payment
of this allowance to those who need it.
I have flot been as assiduous in attending
the sittings of this flouse as perhaps I shouhd
have been, but I have observed that some of
my coiheagues are doing splendid work. I arn
experienced enough to know that that necessitates much reading and studyr, and rnaking
ready for the morrow. If I we*re to attempt
to do work of that kind I wouhd
need files,'
documents, books, flansards of past sessions,
and so on. No man can discuss parliamentary
affaire intelhigently and fuhly without reading
flot onhy the current flansards fromn day to
day, so as ta know what is said in both
flouses, but also a number of leading newspapers, in o>rdier to keep in touch with publie
opinion. All this means a great deal of work,
and I couhd nDot undertake it, as my col-'
leagues have, without a secretary. Instead of
this bill ta increase the indernnity, I shauld
have much preferred one to provide members
in both flouses with secretarial assistance.
I notice that in other countries senýators
and members of the lower flouse are alhowed
secretarjes. flere the lack of secretarial help
is a great disadvantage to members, and personally I find that unless I provide my own
assistance I ar n ot equipped to discuss with
logic and intelligenoe the bills which corne
before us. This situation imposes on rnembers an expense which they shouhd flot be
expected to bear.
Although I do. fot like the manner in which
this bill was brougbt forward, I think the country wouhd be better served if I voted for it,
and I intensi to do so.
flan. T. D. BOUCflARD: flonourable senators, I arn not in favour of the discriminjtian
which this bull nmkes between meinhers of the
Senate and members of the flouse of Coinm'ons; rnuch less arn I in favour of discrimination between legishators and the common
people. I believe that ail Canadians, legislators and public alike, should be on an.
equal footing in regard to, incone, tax. I do
flot sea why it should not be feasible to raise
the indiemnity to $6,00O and allow meinbers
of Pariarnent the saine privilege as that

1461

enjoyed by the judiciary of dýeducting frorn
their incarne tax return expenses incurred in
the performance of their officiai duties. By
this means we would do away wîth the discrimination 'to whicb I have directed the
attention of honourable menmbers.
Some flon. SENATORS: Question!
flan, W. RUPERT DAVIES: flonourabie
senators, last evening I re-read the writ of
summons cailing me ta this honourabie body.
I find I was appointed:
"Foýrthe purpoe of obtaining your ýadvice -and
assistance in ail weighty and arduous affaira."
This bill is a weighty and arduous affair, for
undoubtedly it is giving many of us a great
dýeal of worry and trouble. In making up rny
mind I tried ta look at ail sides of -the question. I bava decided te support the bill. If
the increased indemn-ities ta members of the
Senate had been free of incarne tax, I would
have opposedi the bill.
flan. Mr. HlAIG: flear, hear.
flon. Mr. DAVIES: I cannot convince
niysehïf tbat I bave a rigbt ta refuse ta the
elected, representatives of the people sometbing
which they bave votedi ta thernselves by a
mai arity of two hund-ed and forty-five ta twù.
Apparently the Gemmons were quite content
ta vote themselves this increased indemnity
free of iýncarne tax; and there is some argument in support of their action. They, and
of course senators too, do incur substantial
expenses in their representative capacity. If
an industrial corporation, large or small, sends
eue of its executives on a business trip Iasting
six weeks or even two. rontbs he bas an
expense allowance, and it. is not liable to
taxation. I canna t see any great difference
between the two cases.
Sa far as the discrimination between the
two flouses is concerned, I think it very
largelýy disappearecI when the increased indemnity was extended ta rnembers of the Senate.
I want ta assaciate myseif with those hionourable members who bave said that the increased indemnity is flot to mnuceh.
The
Dominion of Canada can welh afford ta pay
its members of Parliament even mare than
they wilh receive with this alhowance, for, as
the Prime Minister said when sponsoring the
resolution which preceded this bill:
We are now legislating for an expendýiture of
betweeni five and six -billion dollarsa a yea.r. It
is a very great -repnsbihity and neede aul the
men of the best braenn4ihat we cari fttraet to
this j'Ob.
Reference bas been made ta the probable
effect of this measure on aur provincial legishatures. It is quite passible that tbey will
increase their sessional indemnities. At the

SENATE
sarne time they may try to make them fre.e
of incorne tax. Since the Commons have
exempted their increase frorn income tax,
they will have great difficulty in refusing
similar relief to the members of the provincial legislatures. I well remember when
the indemnity in the Ontario legislature was
last increased. Only one member, the late
Hartley Dewart, opposed the bill.
If members of Parliament are entitled tu
an increased indemnity-and it seems to be
generally conceded that they are-then I think
the Government should give very serious consideration to granting an increase in the
salaries of our senior civil servants. I have
been tremendously impressed with the ability
and knowledge of Deputy Ministers and other
senior civil servants who come before our
committees to give information on the subject-matter of the bills under consideration.
I am sure that in private enterprise many of
them would be drawing two or three times as
much as they receive by way of their official
salaries. I am glad to express my appreciation
of these very able men. 'In every instance where
I have seen them assisting our committees they
have shown a complete grasp of their job
I hope that the exemption from income
tax of the increased indemnity to members
of the other House will so impress the Minister of Finance that he will take steps to
remove the controls from salaries and wages,
and that in the next budget he will very considerably increase the income tax exemptions
of both single. and married men.
I shall vote for the bill.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Question!

Hon. A. N. McLEAN: Honourable senators, I believe the eyes of the people of Canada
are on the Senate this morning. Whether we
realize it or not, we are making history right
now in this Chamber, and what is done today
will be referred to many times in the years to
come.
My objection to this bill is that the $2,000
granted members of another place is free frorm
income tax. I sincerely believe that such an
exemption is wrong in principle. If the increase in question were even greater than it
is I would favour it, provided it was taxable,
although I believe the timing is bad. If this
exemption for members were part of a general
programme to raise exemptions on other
classes of citizens, and to raise salary ceilings
on the white-collared classes, it would not be
objectionable. But such does not appear to be
the case. Citizens of one particular class are
being singled out and given a preferred tax
position.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES.

Time and again I have stated publicly and
in the press that in my opinion tax exemptions of those who now come within the low
brackets should be raised. Just recently I
appeared before a committee of this House
advocating increased exemptions for those
who are at the lower rungs of the economie
ladder. I believe that three-quarters of the
people of Canada do not earn $2,000 a year.
I think a mistake was made years ago when
the Government of the day failed to arrange
with the Income Tax Department to allow
out-of-pocket expenses to members of Parliament living away frorn home. Take our
charitable gifts, for instance; the Income Tax
Department has a system covering what is
deductible for charitable purposes, and it
seems to work quite smoothly. This system
could have been applied to out-of-pocket
expenses of members. It was not done.
Certainly the method now proposed is not
the way to rectify the situation. To allow
everv member of the House of Commons a
flat $2,000 tax-free under the name of
expenses is to my mind unfair and unjust.
Under this bill members living nearby will
be allowed the same amount of so-called taxfree expenses as those who live in British
Columbia, on the Prairies or in the Maritimes.
What business man among honourable senators would- give a commercial traveller the
same expense account whether he stayed
home, made trips to a nearby town, or went to
Vancouver? A business run along such lines
would end in bankruptcy.
The proposed increase is unfair in another
respect. To a member whose total income
is $12,000 or $15,000 this proposed tax-free
increase is as good as a raise of $6,000 or
$7,000; whereas to the member whose total
income is $4,000 or $5,000, it would be about
half as much.
Now take our white-collared class throughout the country. I was speaking to a high
bank official not long ago. The bank this
official serves is prosperous, but he told me
the directors could do little or nothing for
their country managers by way of increases,
as salaries had been frozen now for several
years. In the meantime there had been a
substantial increase in the family obligations
of these managers, many of whom had gone
steadýily into debt, mortgaging their life insurance, and so on. This is a concrete example
of people who are quite willing to pay all
taxes but find it most difficult, if not impossible, to get a raise at all.
If Parliament feels that circumstances still
demand that single people be taxed at $660
and married persons at $1,200 per year, this
is no time to give tax-free increases to any-

DECEMBER 15, 194546.
one. No one in the low brackets of taxable
income can live decently and psy for the
necessities of life. The taxing of people down
to an impoverished standard of living should
have no place in Canada. Since one of the
duties of this House 'is to protect, the most
lowly citizen, it should. not. lose the opportunity it now bas to vote against a tax-free
increase which would permit a certain privileged group to escape its fair share of tax
responsibility and leave the low income group
in practically the same position as formerly,
and subject to excessive taxation.
The Government is required to collect a
certain total in taxes, and if one group fails
to contribute its fair share of thýat total, the
burden that fails on the remainder of the
people will be that much greater. If those
who are charged with the responsibility of
tnaking the laws avail themnselves of waysan
means to, obtain substantial. relief from taxation, the result 'will be that they will have a
much less sympathetie attitude towards the
rest of the citizens of this country who are
still being taxed to an extent as great as or
greater than any other people in the world.
May 1 for -a moment refer to the judicîary,
a fine class of citizens who have found the
burden of income tax very heavy? At the
time of Confederation judges' salaries were
exempt from income taxes. Early acte setting up the judiciary stipulated, and, rîghtly so,
that our judges shouki' be set apart and should,
receive salaries sufflciently large to make them
financially independent. Since their job was
to dispense justice, the judges were not permitted to engage in business of any kind.
The high and honourable position judges are
expected to maintain in society carnies with
it many obligations and demande financial
independence. However, our judiciary today
have not nearly as nauch net income as they
had at the time of Confederation. The purchasing power of the dollar has gone down
in the intervenîng years, and the judges are
now as heavily taxed as other citizens. Since
Confederation this country has become more
wealthy, and the judges should be the first
tc3 receive consideration in the matter of increased income benefits.
I can see no good reason why any members of Parliament should be placed lu a preferred position with respect to income taxes.
While 1 am in favour of an even greater in,
crease than has been suggested, 1 am against
the tax exemption feature contained in this
bll.

Hon. Mr. LEGER: And a merry Christmas.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators I thank thie honourable leader of the
Government and members of the Holuse for
this expression of kindness. I may say that
I am not eager to be reminded of the years
as they slip by. I have enjoyed working in the
Senate of which I have been a member now
for somewhat more than tan years, and I am
a better Canadian for having been here and
having met such fine people.
ATOMIC ENERGY
APPROVAL OF DECLARATION

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
Eonourable senators, I would ask ýthat we
revert now to Motion No. 1. I desire to
move the resolution standing in rny name, and
I would ask the 'honourable gentleman from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) to speak
to it.

Hon. A. W. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators, the resolution before us is to this effect:
That ,it be Resolved,-That it is expedient that
the Houses of Paýrliament do approve the Agreed
Hon. Mr. HARDY.

Declaration en Atomic Energy signed by the
President of the United States, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the Prime
Minister of Canada, at Washington, on 15th
November, 1945, and that this House do approve
the same.
I may say that the resolution is being
moved in both Houses. In the other place
the motion will be made by the Right Honourable the Prime Minister. One would
naturally expect that our discussion here would
be postponed until he had spoken, since he
bas played so large a part in the subject
moatter of the resolution. I understand, however, that he is quite satisfied that we proceed
now; otherwise I should consider it discourteous for me to speak before he does on
a matter with which he personally has had
so much to do and about which he is so
thoroughly informed.
Just here may I pause to say that I am
very proud of the part Canada has played
with respect to atomic energy. I am also very
preud of our own Prime Minister's role as
one of the Big Three in the discussions on
this most important subject. His associates
were, as everyone knows, the Prime Minister
of Great Britain and the President of the
United States.
Honourable senators, the first thought that
runs through one's mind in approaching the
subject of atomie energy is one of sincere
thankfulness for the protection that was
afforded us, our country and our allies during
the terrible war that bas just closed. We used
the atomic bomb with terrifie effect on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Perhaps it would net
be entirely out of place if we asked forgiveness for the barbarity that we then displayed, although it must be borne in mind
that the use of the bomb brought the war
between the Allies and Japan to a sudden
conclusion and in all probability caused
fewer deaths than would have resulted from
a head-on attack against the Japanese island.
Strange to say, the very vileness of the
Axis powers proved their undoing; it was,
so to speak, the instrument that deprived
them of the advantage of this murderous
weapon. The secret of atomie fission was
discovered by Dr. Liza Meitner, a Jewess,
while working at the Kaiser Wilhem Institute
in Berlin, Germany. In 1039 she fled across
the German border into Denmark, where she
met Dr. Otto Frisch, also a Jew, who had
been dismissed from the University of Hamburg. These two despised Jews continued
their research at the experimental station in
Copenhagen and transmitted the results of
their investigations to associates in the United
States.

DECEMBER 15, 1945

It is reported that in 1934 Professer
Enrico Fermi, an Italian pbysicist, was within
2/1000 of an inch of the discovery of the
secret of atomic fission. He used tinfoil 3/1000
of an inch ini tbickness. Had hie used tinfoil
i/1000 of an inch ln thickness he would have
discovered the secret five years ahead of the
scientists of the United Nations. In ahl probability that knowledge would have led te the
discovery of atomie explosives, the subject
of this resolution. When Mussolini adopted
the Nazi "racial" laws Professer Fermi went
te the United States, where he was one of the
key scientists of the War Department working
on the development of atomic explosives. Had
these European scientiste remained at home
and made the results of their researches available to Germany a.nd Italy, the probability ie
that they alnne would have enabled our
enemies te develop the atomie bomb ahead of
us. 1 mention these facts because 1 think it
would be well te bear themn ini mid later on
when we take up the problem. of the .refugees.
The resolution says it is expedient that we
do approve the deciaration. This declaration,
one of the mest important documents ini world
hlstory, shoulýd be read te y-ou, I think. It is
as follows:
ATOMIO ENERGY
AGREED DECLARATION' BY THE PRESIDENT
0F TIHE UNITED STATES, THrE PRIME
MINISTER 0F THrE UNITED KINGDOM,
AND THE PRIME MINISTER 0F CANADA

The President of the United States, the Prime
Minieter of the United Kingdom and the Prime
Minister of Canada, have issued the following
statemeit:
1. Wfe recognize that the application of recent
scientific disceveries te the methods and practice of war has placed at the disposal of mankind means of destruction hitherto unknown,
against which there can be ne adequate military
defence, and in 'the employment of whioh ne
single nation eau in f act have a monopoly.
2. We desire te emphaaize that the reaponsibility for devising means te ensure that the
new disoveries shahl be used for the benefit of
mankind, instead of as a means of destruction,
resta not on our nations alone, but upon the
whole civilized world. Nevertheless, the progress
that we have mnade in 'the developmient and use
of atomic energy dem.ands that we take an
initiative in the matter, and we bave accordingly
met together te consider the possibility of
international action:(a) To prevent the use of atomie energy for
destructive purposes,
(b)To promete the use of recent and future
advances in - scientifie knowledge, particularly
in the utilizatien ef atomic energy, for peaceful
and hDmanitariafl ends.
3. We are aware that the only complete
protection for the civilized world f rom the
destructive use of scientific knowledge hies in
the prevention of war. No system of safeguards
that can be devised will of itself provide an
againet production .of
effeoitive guarantee
atomie weapons by a nation bent on aggremon.
47704-311

Wb

Nor can we ignore the possibility of the development of other weapons, or of new methods of
warfare, whieh Inay constitute as great a threat
to civilization as the miljtary use of atomic
energy.
4. Representing as we do, the three.countries
whjch pessess the knowledge essential to the
use of atomic energy, we declare at the outset
our willingness, as a first contribution, te proceed with the exchange of fundamental scientifie
information and the interchange of scientists
and scientific literature for peaceful ends with
any nation that will ful]y reciprocate.
.5. We believe that the fruits of *scientific
research should be made available to ail nations,
and that freedom of investigation and free interchange of ideas are essential to the progress of
knowledge. In pursuance of this policy, the basic
scientific information essential1 to the development of atomic eniergy for peaoeful purposes
bas already been made available to, the world.
It is our intention that ail f urther informat'on
of this character that may become available
from time te time shall be similarly treated.
We trust that other nations will adopt the
saine .policy, thereby creating an atmosphere
of reciprocal confidence in which political agreement and co-operation will fiourish.
6. We have considered the question of the
disclosure of detailed information concerning
the practical industrial application of atomic
energy. The military exploitation of atomic
energy depends, in large part, uýpon -the saine
methods and processes as would be required for
industrial us-es.
We are not convineed that the spreading of
the specialiked information regarding the practical application of atomic energy, before it* is
possible to devise effective, reci-procal, and
enforceable safeguards acceptable to all nations,
would contribuýte to a constructive solution of
the problem of the atomic bomb. On the contrary we think it migbt have the opposite effect.
We are, however, prepared to shai e, on a reciprocal basis wi.th others of the United Nations,
detailed information concerning the practical
industrial application of atomie energy just as
soon as effective enforceable safeguards against
its use foi destructive purposes can be devised,
7. In erder to attain the most effective means
of entirely eliminating the use of atomic energy
for destructive purposes and pronioting its
widest use for industrial and humanitarian
purposes, ve are of the opinion that at the
earliest practicable date a Commission should
be set up under the United Nations Organizatien to prepare recomniendations for submission
to the Organization.
The Commission sbould be instructed to
proceed with the utmost dispatch and sbould
be authorized te submit recommendations £rom
time to time dealing with separate phases of its
work.
In particular the Commission should. make
specifie proposais:
(a) For extending between ail nations the
exchange of basic scientîfic information for
peaceful ends,
(b) Fer control of atomie energy te, the
extent necessary te ensure its use only for
peaceful purposes,
(c) For the elimination from national armaments of atomic wea.pons and of ahl other major
weapons adaptable to maso destruction,
(d) For effective &a.feguards by way of
inspection and other means to protect complying
states againet the hasards of violations and
evasiofa..

466

SENATE

8. The work of the Commission should proceed
by separate stages, the successful completion
of each one of which will develop the necessary
confidence of the world before the next stage
is undertaken. Specifically it is considered that
the Commission might well devote its attention
first to the wide exchange of scientists and
scientific information, and as a second stage to
the development of full knowledge concerning
natural resources of raw materials.
9. Faced with the terrible realities of the
application of science to destruction, every
nation will realize more urgently than before
the overwhelming need to maintain the rule
of law among nations and to banish the scourge
of war from the earth. This can only be brought
about by giving whole-hearted support to the
United Nations Organization, and by consolidating and extending its authority, thus
creating conditions of mutual trust in which all
peoples will be free te devote themselves te the
arts of peace. It is our firm resolve te work
without reservation te achieve these ends.
Honourable members, no words of mine
could greatly add te that statement, which is
magnificient net only in its phraseology but
also in its concept.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Nevertheless, I
think I should point out some of the high
spots of the document, and, with your very
kind indulgence,
make sane
comments
thereon. Honourable senators will observe
that the declaration says there is no adequate
military defence to the atomic bomb. General MacNaughton, in a statement made in
Detroit on the 5th of October :ast, said:
Counter measures to the atomie bomb are
already in sight.
This statement is rather comforting, but
with every respect te General MacNaughton
as a very great scientist, I am bold enough
te assert that when atomie bombs commence
falling the only known defence is ito be somewhere else. The only other escape is te make
sure that they do net fall.
Honourable senators wiil have observed
also tiat the declaration says:
Responsibility rests not on our nations alone
but upon the whole civilized world.
It is also comforting to feel that the responsibili'ty for seeing that the bombs do net fall
is net ours alone, but is a world responsibility-a world problem. Of course Canada
must play her part.
Very much writing of a fanciful character
has been indulged in by newspapers and, magazines on the subject of atomic bombs and
atomic energy. All that one needs is a pencil
and paper and a lively imagination, and in the
present state of knowledge one may produce
concepts of great beauty or great horror, as
his mood dictates. But notwithstanding the
highfaluting articles that have been written,
Hon. Mr. ]ROEBUCK.

the fact is that up ta date atomic energy has in
a practical way been derived only from uranium, U-235, when transmuted into the new element, plutonium. Now, the source of uranium is
pitchblende, and at the present time the known
deposits of pitchblende are in the Great Bear
Lake area, which is part of the Northwest
Territories of Canada, and in the Belgian
Congo. For the experimental work 'that she
was carrying on during the war Germany
received ber pitcbblende from Czechoslovakia.
Before the war Russia was manufacturing
radium from pitchblende secured at some point
in ber vast territories.
I think it should be pointed out that prospecting for pitchblende has only just begun.
No one can tell in what part of the world new
deposits may be found, and the possibility of
secrecy after discovery is something that cannet be entirely discounted. That is why the
declaration says that maintenance of control
over the vital materials at their source and
over their manufacture into explosives is a
world responsibility.
At this point let me issue a warning-if I
may call it such. It is most important that
we realize the folly of attempting ta rely upon
secrecy.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: There are no fundamental secrets about the atomic bomb. The
Government made public the only fundamental
discovery when it told of the conversion of
radium inito plutonium. The secret that
remains--if there be any-is not something
that you can write down on a piece of paper
and deliver in an envelope. According te President Truman's statement at a press conference
on the 8th of October last, the secret consists
in what be termed the "industrial know-how."
He said' that Great Britain had spent $100,000,000 on scientific research before she handed
over the task te the United States. The
United States has spent 32,000,000,000 in
developing the atomic bomb. Canada bas
spent $25,000,000, of which $15,000,000 went
into the construction of the atomic plant at
Chalk River.
This is the cost of engineering knowledge;
of putting the different parts together; of
finding the resources of men and material and
the plant capacity necessary ta comýpletion of
the work. But, honourable senators the eipenditure of money is but incidental te tte
solution of this problem. The key ta success
in this development lay in the accumulated
scientific knowledge and industrial skill of the
past one hundred and fifty years-all culminating in this miracle of the atomic bomb.

DECEMBER 15, 1M4
One of the universities in the United States
bas sent me a number of reports from
scientista in varions States of the Union, and
they ail agree that others can follow the path
which we bIazed. It is only a question af how
soan; that is ail1. I notice that some.of those
scîentists put the tîme at two or tbree years,
others at ten, and oChers again at twenty years.
My expectation is that if we try ta hoid the
secret and so stimnulate research among other
nations, it will not be long before those
nations wili have armed tbemselves with thîs
terribly destructive weapon.
1 would ask honourabie senators to observe
that the declaration states:
Qrepared ta share, on a ýreciprocal
We are -.
basis with others cf the United Nations, detaiied information concerning the praotioal- àndustrial application of atomic energy just as
soan as effective enforceahle iafeguards against
it. use for destructive purposes eau be devised.
In spite of tha>t declaration there are some
among us unkind enougb ta say that the Big
Three of atomic knowiedge-and we are one
of them-are retaining this so-called "secret"
in order ta use it as a diplomatie blackjack
in deaiing with otber nations. 0f course, I
need flot point out ta honourable members
thiat any such suspicion is entirely unfounded.
The atomic bomb in its present bande is not
even a tbreat. We ail are genuîneiy hopeful
that atomic energy may neyer again be used in
war. But I am ready ta admit that the threat
ta use an atomic bomb is a very* powerful
argument. Lt proved so with Japan, where its
use brought the war in the Pacifie ta a sudden
conclusion.
Lt was the fear that Germany would solve
tbe probleni of .atomic energy before we could
defeat ber that drove the scientists of tbe
ailied nations on in their herculean efforts to
get there firat. This fear of what May happen
ta the world may brîng the nations together
la an effort ta control atomic explosives.
Stark fear may force themn ta surrender sufficient of their prized sovereignty ta allow
inspection of sources of supply and cantrol of
the production and manufacture cf these lethai
weapons.
Let no one underestimate the fearful power
of tbe atomîc bomb. Accounts of its awful
destruction in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are
tragic repetitions of the history of Sodom and
Gomorrah. But the overwbelmîng destructiveness of the first crude atamie bomb is no
measure of its future possibilitiqs. I can say
deflnitely that if in future atamie warfare be
permitted, -more bombs, bigger and better
bambs, will surely fall. The iesult of a large
scale release of atomic energy is too frightful
ta contemplate.

467,

Let me read what the Prime Minister of
Great Britain said recently to the House of
Commons 'n England when deaiing wit-h the
probiem of the contrai and management of
atamie bombs and the protection of the worid
against their destruction, 1 quote:
The atomic bomb ie here, present in the
world; it is the danger that hangs over every
one of us and over al1 the people of 'the world.
The United Nations Organasation ie here,
present in the world; it was born aimost at the
same 'time as the atemie bomb; it is -the hope
of the worid.
The first step in the creation of the Ujnited
Nations Organization was the Dumbarton
Oaks Conference, where the United States
and Great Britain roughed out what later
became the United Nations Charter. The
second step was the San Francisco Canference,
where the United Nations Chaeter was drawn
up and signed. The third step in the development af this world organization is the first
Session of the General Assem'bly, which will
t'ake place in January next year, and where
stepa will he taken, successfully, I hope, ta
organize the management and contrai of this
frightful power, the development and use of
atomic energy.
The problem with wivhîh we are faccd is
neot alane the elimination. of atomic energy
as an instrument of destruction. The devilish
ingenuity of science has given us problems ini
other fields. In tihe first place, there are the
racket bombs. The very crude designs usedin the late war, knawn as the V-1 and V-2,
have greater possibilities in the future. Second-,
there is a more fiendish. poisonous gas. Hanourable senators may have noticed recen-t
references in the newspapers to, gasses discavered in the course of production in Germiany,
and intended to permeate any maisk. We
muet not forget the posýsibility of the spreading of diseuse or the poisaning of foad. These
are just a few of the bright l-ittie ideas ihat
might intrigue the fancy of some future Nazi.
The probiem facing Canada and. the warld
at large is that cf creating a world apprapriate to the existence of such terrible
weapons. It is aur respansibility ta establish
the rule of civilized law rather -than af the law
of the jungle. Our on'iy safety lies in developing 'the United Nations organization inta an
effective world-government capable of enforcing an inspection of sources of vital material,
and-of controlling the manufacture of lethal
weapans in ail parts cf the world. May I
quote again the words of the Prime Minister
of Great Britain? Speaking of the United
Nations and possible development along the
lines I have mentioned, hÀe said:
There is the instrument which if &Ilnations
resolve to use it, cau eetab]iah l~e rule of law
and prevent war.

CONSOLIDATION AND REVISION 0F
STATUTES
MOTION
Hon. THOMAS VIEN moved:
That in the opinion of the Senate, it ýis expedient that the G'overn'ment should. introduce a
measure te previde for the consolidation and
revisien of the Statutes of Cndi
iwo
the fact that sinco the lait cnaoldation aiewof
vision in 1927 a great number of statutes have
been enacteti, and amentiments madie, and the
abundance of these enactments .and ameud-mente
has rentioreti references thereto and tbe interpre-tation thereof difficult.
He said: Honourable senatons. the motion
wbich stands in my naime on the Order Papen
lion. Mr. ROEBUCÇ.

is for the purpose of hringing tu the attention
of tho Government the expediency of h-aving
anoth-er revision of the Statutes of Canada.
Beforc andi since Confederation the statutes
have been consolidated and revised evecr'
'twenty years or so. There was a rev'ision in
1866, in 1886, in 1906, and the latest, in 1927.
Therefore, if the next one is tu be made witih;n

revision and consolidation?
Hon. Mr. VIE N: The Govornor in Council
-appoints a Royal Commission. The revisioýn
and consolidation takes about two or three
years. In 1927 it occupieti throe or four years.
During the first war a considenable number
statutes werc pasýseti, and oîliers were
and it was thoughit advisahle
te revise and consolidate tbem. Sir Charles
Fitzpatrick, wbo in 1924 had netired from tbe
of Lieutenant-Governor of Quebec, wras
appointeti chairman of the commission. I
tliink the revision and consolidation wbicb I
amn sug-gesting will net involve as mucb werk
a:; was necessany on the last occasion, because
in most Government departmnents there is a
group of solicitors who keep the departmental
legislation amendeti and consolidatoti te date.
a revision involves is obvious, but I
should perhaps explain what is meant hy
consolidation. It means that statutes rendered
obsolete by subsequent enactments are enumenated in an index, and that the statutes in
eifeet, arc presonîtd in their amendeti form.
Hon. Mn. BENCH: Would the lionourable
gentleman informi us whether or net sucb a
commission is empowered only te make a
consolidation of the statutcs Or does it aIse
have aîithority te revise and improve tbeir
wording?
Hon. Mr. VIEN: The commission is empowered both to revise and tu consolidate. It
may suggest elimination or clarification of
pbraseology se as te make the statutes casier
of interpretation. Its report is submitted te

DECEMBER 17, 1945
Parliament, and if this report is accepted a
bill is introduced to, give effect to the etatutes
as so revised and consolidated.
Hon. A. C. HARDY: I am éntirely -in sympathy with the motion of the honourable
senator. The fact that our statutes have not
been reviseci or consolidated for nearly twentyý
years makes it miSt important that this work
should not be delayed mitich longer. I do
mot think there is a member o! this House
wbo mamy times during the session 1.s not
confused when a bill is introduced to amend
an Act already amended. These amendments
have so mamy ramifications that unless ome is
well versed in reading and interpreting statutes
-that is, a lawyer of the calibre of our honourable friend from St. Catharines (Hon. Mr.
Bench)-he finds it well-nigh impossible to
understand the effeat of the ameuding bill.
More than fi! ty years9 aga I had something
to dowith the consolidation of the Statutes of
Ontario, and I have never' since ceased ta
wonder how the human minci can untangle
statutes that are amendied alinost ad, infinitum.
The bonourable senator from De Lorimer
(Hon. Mr. Vien) suggests that the next revision
will mot take as much time as the former ones
did, but I have . some d'oubt about this. In
view of ail the amenciments that have been
macle sînce 1927, there is bound ta be much
confusion. While, as he saya, a gooci mny
existing Acta coulId be ddspensed with now,
I believe that the revising commission would
feel inclined ta let the consolidation u along
fox two or tbree years until various laws pertaiming to the war period, and perbaps even
to the im«jediate post-war reconstruction
period, become obsolete and cati be dtropped
entirely.
.It is vitaily important that we should soon
have another revision of the statutes. Perhaps the best exemple cf the need for it is
the d-ifficulty many bonourable maembers must
have experienced time and time again wben
looking at a bill and finding that it is intended
te, ameind an Act which bas already been
ameuded so many times that, in order ta
ascertain wbat the Act said in the first place,
it was necesary to engage in a great deal. of
research. I am strongly in sympathy with the
motion, and I bope that representationa will
be made to the proper autbority-whicb, I
suppose, is the Department of Justice-to have
this great work undertaken as early as possible.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: With the indulgence o!
the Senate 1 should! like to male a suggestion
arising ont of the remarks of the honourable
senetor who bas just taken bis seat. It is that
a bill whose object ie the amendment of i
statute should- not refer ta certain words
coming after certain other words in-euch-and-

4

such a lime of such-and-such a section, but
shoulci simply provide that the section be
repealed and a new one substituteci. Andi on
the opposite page of the bill there should be
an explanatory note giving the text of the old
section and~ stating the purport of the amendment. In the other House there is a rule
requiring an explanatory note for every proposeci amendment, but we know that, the rule
bas been honoured more in the hreach than
in the observance, for we continually receive
bis bearing no explanatoi'y note. It seemas to
me that if the section to be amended were
repealed, and the revised section enacted in.
its place, the intelligibility of the stathutes
would be greatly enhanced.

On the Orders of the Day:
Ho.WISHART MeL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, I should like to take this
opportunity of drawing attention to the fact
that today is the seventy-first birtbday of
the Prime Minîster. I am unable to say from
personal experience wbether or net anyone
who has reached that age desires to be reminded of it, but I think 'bonourable members
111
w agree with me that some public notice
of the occasion would be fitting.
The Rigbt Honourable. W. 'L. Mackenzie
King has been the leader of one of the major
parties of Canada for a long time, and throughout the greater part of that period he bas
occupied the high position of Prime Minister. Differences of opinion as to policy,
wbich inevitably arise from time to time, do
not in any way detract from the fact that
he has played a great role in the public life
of not only this country but the world.
History, I have no doubt will record that he
was one of the prime factors in the graduaIor perhaps relatively rapid-increase in this
country's international stature and prestige.
The peculiar characteristics which be possesses to such a marked degree accrm to have
beeu particularly evid-ent in Canada's relations with other countries. In hfis own personality he has typified the part that Canada
bas played and, I believe, is destined to, play
iii the future as an exponent of good will
towards ail peoples.
His own desires and the efflux o! time
make it inevitable that soon-how soon 1 do

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon, C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I certainly deem it botb an honour
and a -privilege to be afforded this opportunity of expressing for myseif and for ail those
wibem I represent on this side of the House
our warmest congratulations to the Prime
Minister, the Right Hon. W. L. Mackenzie
King, on bis seventy-flrst birthday. May we
share tbe hope. so fittingly expressed by the
honourable leader of tbe Government, that
for many years to corne the right bonourable
gentleman will be spared. te continue as
Prime Minister while bis party remains in
power.
I quite agree with my bonourable friend
opposite that the Prime Minister's career bas
been both long and distinguisbed. Tbis is
not an easy country to govern. He bas been
Primo Minister longer than any of bis predecessors and during bis regime our national
development bas been remnrkable. Not only
is be very bigbly esteemed in Canada; be is
well known in international affairs and
regarded as a world leader.
A cultured gentleman, the Prime Minister
bas always been fair in dealing witb political
questions that corne before Parliament, and
bis well-deserved reputation as an autbority
on domestic and world-wide questions will
always assure bim a prominent place in the
history of the Dominion.
I sincerely trust that, since bis bealtb continues te be excellent. be will not tbink of
retiring into private life. but will attend the
Peace Conference, wbere bis knowledge of
international affairs and bis mature judgment
will bc reoognized and appreciated.
Hon A. C. HARDY: Honourable senators,
the senator from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Harmer) is the only member on tbis side of the
Houso who outranks me in seniority. I believe I have known Mr. King fairly intimately
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

for a longer period than anyone else in this
House. I go back to the time, no less than
fift.v-four vears ago-and in tbe circumstances
I sbould ratber like to, bide my own agewben at the age of seventeen be took up the
work that be bas continued down tbrougb ahl
these decades. During bis college career i
Toronto be devoed bimself largely to slum
research, a study wbich be followed up in
Cbicago, ultimately becoming one of the best
known industrial research workers on tbe
North American continent. I mention this
side of Mr. King's career te make known that
bis public life did not begin witb bis entry
into, Parliament.
Hon. CAIRINE R. WILSON: I too arn
rapidly approacbing seniority in tbe SenateHon. Mr. HARDY: Neyer!,

Never!

Hon. Mrs. WILSON: -and I skould like to
endorse wbat bas been said by the leaders on
both sides of the House, and by the boneurable senator from Leeds (Hon. Mr. Hardly).
We cannet but marvel tbat one man bas

worthy to be paid for ber services. IV took
a very long time for hier to acquire that status.
It was only after mnany protests that she was

it bas become manifest, from statements of the
British, the American and the Canadian «overnmen-ts, that the United Kinedom needs immnediate asisistance to facilitate its purchases of
essential Canadýian supplies and services, and as
it is expedient to provide Canadian dollars to
meet this dem'and, the Government of Canada
shou]d introduce aýmeasure to provide for the
redemption of the Canýadian securities held ini
the United Kingdom and to, provide fur.ther for
making the proceeds of the -redemption thereof
avai1ab1e for the purchase of Canaidian goods
and services by the United K4ngdom, or, otherwise, to provide tha.t ýany further credit to bie

interests in rhe United Kingdom or elsewhere.
0f course, honourable senators, it is not
customary te speak on a notice of motion, but
in view of the probability of early prorogation,
1 ask your indulgence while I implement
briefly the rernarks which I had ocasio(n to
make the other day. Reports have ap'peared
in the press ùhat shortly Canada will make
the United Kingdomn a loan of $L500.000.000

we sh.ould, when making loans, provide for the
protection of Canadian interests. If 'there ;s

APPROPRIATION
PRELIMINAR{Y

BILL No. 6

DISCUSSION

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, it is hoped that sufficient
progress will be made in the other bouse ta
permit of Royal Assent some time to-day.
I have suggested to the acting leader opposite
that business might be facilitated if at this
time I were to, make a brief statement with
regard to Bill 244, based on the Main Estimates, which. has yet ta corne from the other
House. Later the bill could be further discussed on second reading or in Committee of
the Whole.
Honourable senators no doubt will recaîl
that at various times we have had two
appropriation buis before uis for the fiscal
year ending March 31, 1946. One covered
the war expenditures and demohilization
appropriation of $4.365.000.
The other bill
covered the estimates for ordinary Govern,
ment "services, the total of whieh for the
calendar year ending March 31, 1946, is
$1,023,621,000. Five-twelfths of this amount
was voted during the last session to cover the
months of April to August, inclusive, 1945. On
each of three subsequent occasions--in Si-tember, October and Novemiber--one.twelfth
of this total, less the statutory amounts, was
v~oted to provide for carrying on the ordinary
business of the country. Bill 244, which will
be presented to us in due course, is for a total
of $117,775 '292.34, whicha is the difference
betwccn the amount already voted and the
total estimates for the fiscal year. The bill
also asks for supplementary estimates of
$21,931,048, together with the power to raîse
a boan of $200,000,000 for public works and
goncral purposes.
Honourable senators, this appropriation in
exe-ss (if one billion dollars represents an
increase of approxirnately $300.000.000 over
iast ' ears app)ropriation. 1 am speaking in
round figures. Of that $300,000.000 roughily
$190.000.000 is rcpresented by family allowanees; an.d muîut of tlîe balance-as a matter
of fact. about 8102.000.000-arises chiefly out
of costs incidental te the war effort.
The more important items included in this
amount of $102,000,000 are:
Increase in ýiiterest on Public Debt
and other debt charges .........
$83,026,725
Increase in eost of administration
of Income I'ax and Excess Profits
Tax................3,211,744

Increase in Veterans Affairs for
the treatment andci
are of returned inembers of the Forces . .
12.395.655

DECEMBER 18, 1945
Out of the total appropriation of more than
one 'billion dollars for the Main Estimates,
a suma in excess of 860,000,000 is to ahl
intente and purposes uncontrollable. Items
making up this amount are:
Interest on Publie Debyt -and other
debt chiarges................. $390,085,000
37,000,000
European War Pensions (1914-18)
Goverument contribution 'to the

Subsidies and Specia] Comipens.a98,874,000
Provinces ...........
tion to the
4,400:000
Maritime Freight Rates Act ...
3,665,000
Sund.ry ether items ...............
$622,836,000
0f the remaining $400,000,000, about $190.000.000, as I have already pointed out, is
expected to be required for family allowances.
This leaves a balance of slightly more than
$200,000,000 to carry on the ordinary services of the Government. I will make a
brief reference to the requirements for the
varlous departmnents.
The estimates for the Department of
Agriculture show a net decrease of $3,963,0(10. This ie aecounted for principalIy by
a reduction of $3,665,000 in thie amount
necessary to meet commitments in connection
with wlîeat acreage reduction payments.
There is a decrease of $508,000 in the amount
for subsidies for cold storage warebouses,
sufficient being provided ondy to meet presenit
commitoients. I have reiference bore to, the
ordinary estimates as originally presented to
Parliament. But as a result of agreements
entered into, one of the larger items of the
supplementary estimates is a material increase
in the amount of subsidies paid for cold
storage warehouses.
For the Department of External Aif airs
there is an increase of W8,000 in departmental
administration, and of $336,000 in represeýntation abroad, to cover the increased activities
of our foreign service, including provision for
proposed new offices.
The Department of Finance 1 have already
referred to. The total of debt charges is
increased by $83,027,000--from $307,058,000 to.
$390,085,000.
Old age pensions show an increase of $1,960r700, and now stand at 333,487,000.
The Fisheries Department shows an increase
of 8119,200 for the Fisheries Research Board
of Canada, .to enable it to, continue its investigations and research undertaken thie year
in connection with fiqhf-ries problems.
47704-323

473

In the Labour Departrnent there is an
increase of 81,24,000 for administration of the
Unemployment Insurance Act of 1940.
The Department of National Health and
Welfare shows an increaee of 8192,493,000. This
is virtually aIl for the Family Allowance
Division, and includea 32,392,000 for admninistration expenses and 6190,000,000 for family
allowamnce payments authorized- under the
family allowance legielation.
The Post Office Departmnent shows an
increase totalling over $4,000,000, inçluding
83,128,000 for salaries and otiher expenses of
post offices throixghout the country, 8778,000
for railway mail service, $159,000 for air and
land mail services, and 8100,000 for the Audit
of Revenue Section.
In the Public Works Departmnent there is a
elight over-all net increase of 8176,000, wbich
incluika provision for certain long deferred
maintenance works.
The Department of Trade and Commerce
shows an over-alI net in-crease of 8679,000.
This 'includes 8219,000 for continuation of present programmes of the Commercial Intelligence Service, 8353,000 for the Statistics Service of the Dominion Bure-au of Statisýics, and
8237,000 to meet 'heavier demanda under the
Canada Grain Act.
The Transport Department shows a net
increase of 8340,000. This provides principally
for increased operation and maintenance
expenditures of the Civil Aviation and Radio
Divisions of the Depa.rtmnent's Air Service.
The Department of Veterans Affaire shows
an increase of $12,395,000 for its various services in connection with the treatment and
care of returned members of the Forces and
paymients to or for veterans and their dependents. The larger increases are: $4,040,000
for rehabilitation services, 84,527,000 for boapitalivation and treatreent, $2,350,000 for war
veterans allowances and 8767,000 for administration of Soldier Settlement and Veterans'
Land Act.
These figures refer primarily to the Main
Estimates as presented to Parliament ea.rlier
in the session.
As I have already indicated, supplcmentary
estimates total 821,931,048. These cover quite
a wide field. as bonourable members will observe on reference to, the details before them.
I am advised there are two main factors bearing on these supplementairies. One is the
necessity, now the war is over. of proceeding
witb long-deferred publie wcrks. The other
is the desira'bility cf restcring- to civil servants,
te some extent at least, statutory increases
which were suspended during the war.
In the estimates for the Department of
Agriculture I directed attention te an increase

474

SENATE

in respect of subsidies for the building of
cold storage warehouses under the Cold
Storage Act. Agreements have been ente.red
inte with variaus companies whicb have taken
advantage of this legisiation, and the suppleînentary estimates provide for approximately
$500,000 for this purpose.
The supplementary estimates aise include an.
item of $1,000,000 for additienal public works
in this city. The bill based on the estimates
centains a section empowering the Government
te borrow S200,000,000 to cover the crection of
necessary public works, and other expenses
whieh may arise between- now and next
session.
Hon, C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I arn sure we all are indebted to the
honeurable leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) for bis explanations of the
huge expenditures already made or that are
contcmplated. The figures are indeed staggering. Wbat is worrying not only Parliament
but the people is the ceuntry's debt, the bulk
cf which was incurred by reasen of unaveidable
expenditures during tbe war. No doubt within
a few months the debt will reach the large
total cf twenty billion dollars, and this will
net incitide the many millions of future
expenditures wbich tbe honourable leader
rnentioned.
We ail are prouil cf Canada's war effort, by
which I mean flot only wbat was done by our
armed forces, but the administration of alI
the activitic.s made necessary by a global war.
Generally spcaking, wbile bostilities lasted the
Gevernment bail the unanimous support cf
Parhiament, and rightly se. We on this side
cf tlte Senate differeil with the Government
on ore matter only, the rnanpower policy
But new thie war is over, and it certainly is
the respensibility and the duty of the gevernment te enforce rigid eccnomy.
1 ivas pleased to note from this merning's
paper the announcement by the Honourable
the Minister cf Labour tbat Selective Service
will be abolislied on January 1. That erganization performeil a useful function during the
war, but it is no longer requireil. Tbousands of
Selective Service employees are occupying
expensive buildings ahl acrcss the country 80
the discontinuance of their services should
effeet a great saving. But wby should tbe
Government stop there? During tbe war a
large number cf centrol boards and other
erganizations bad te be set up, but many of
thern are ne longer required, and I do net
tliink I arn exaggerating wben 1 say tbat the
services cf tens of tbousands of their employees
frem cne end cf the country te the other
could be dispensed with rnost advantageously.
Take the city cf Ottawa, with whicb the
beneurable senator frorn Leeds (Hon. Mr.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

Hardy) is more familiar tban I arn. I venture
te say tbat if one closed bis eyes and gave
an order te reduce personnel by 50 per cent,
the releaseil
ernployees would neyer be
misseil.
I realize tbe difficulty tbat any Government
bas after a great war in trytng te reduce tbe
many establishmnents that were esential wbile
tbe war was geing on. I had te deal witb
tbat difficulty-on a mucb srnaller scale, I
adrit-after the flrst Great War. Ministers
are se busy that they cannet attend te the
matter themselves. 1 sbould like te suggest
te tbe boneurable leader cf the Gevernent
tbat, say, twc men be clotheil witb autbority
te carry eut a fuît investigation cf all the
wartime contrels and departrnents still fanctiening-, te eliminate those ne longer essential
and te reduce rnaterially the staffs cf tbe
others.
Millions cf dollars coulil be saved
by action cf that kind. If sufficient autbority
for the investigaters cannot be obtaineil anywbere else, tbe provisions of Bill 15, the
famous Emergency Powers Bill, sbould be
ample fer the purpese. I bave in my band
tbe replies te the inquiries by the benourable senater from Bedford-Halifax (Hon. Mr.
Quinn) as te, the total number cf CWACs and
Wrens whe enlisteil during the war and the
number on strengtb new. The information
ta rather astenishing.
I give great credit te
the wvemen cf Canada for joining the Wemen's
Arrny Corps and Naval Service and for the
splendid wartime work that tbey diýd; but
surely, honourable senators, we have more
than reached tbe time when we cam get along
witbout tbe CWACs and Wrens. In my city
tbe CWACs live in palatial quarters, andl
naturally are boath te retire frem the service
and return te tbeir bernes, wbere I amn sure
tbey are urgently needed. The total enlistment of CWACs was 21,614. Their strength
on May 1 was 13,962, and on November 1 it
was still at the bigh figure cf 11,085. Up te
November 30 this branch of tbe service ceat
apprexirnately $32,420,280. 1 need net go inte
details of tbe cost cf barracks, housekeeping
appliances and living quarters, uniforms and
equiprnent and rations. Surely bere is an
oppertunity te econernize.
You bave already seen the answer te tbe
inquiry cf tbe benourable gentleman frein
Bedford-Halifax
(Hon. Mr. Quinn) with
respect te the Wrens, and I boe yeu will
pardon me for referring te it.
The tetal
enlistrnent of Wrens wvas 6,675. Today tbere
are still 4,893 on the strength. Wby do we
necil that number cf Wrens now? If these
two woenns services were demobilized certain permanent positions would bp availa hIe
fer a class cf returned men wbo weuld be

DECEMBER 18, 1945
glad to, fill them. I refer to the young lads
of seventeen and eighteen years of age who
joined the armed forces anid were not engaged in any particular work before enlistment.
At the time the naval estimates were before our committee I was unfortunately
unable to be present to discuss a question
raised as to the, construction of t.he Tribal Class
of destroyers at Halifax. The Deputy Minister,
Mr. W. G. Mills, in reply to a question said
that one of the Tribal Class of destroyers now
in commission cost $6,000,000. The saine type
of destroyer, according to bis staternent,
could bave been built in the United Kingdom
for $3.500.000. Please understand. honourable
senators, that I do flot pose as an authority
on naval construction. The views I arn about
to advance are based on information that I
ohtained when, a good many years aga, 1
was a member of the Monltreal Harbour
Commission. A Liberal governrnent was in
power at the time. The Honourable Mr.
Brodeur, Minister of Marine and Fisheries,
asked me, togetber with Sir Frederick Borden,
Minister of Militia, to aecompany him to England to try to induce tbe Vickers Company to
esteblish a shipbuiildinig plant at Montreal on
saine thirty-cigbt acres of land that the Ilarbour Commission bad just reclaimed from
tbe bed of tbe river. 1 arn very glad to say
that, largely througb the influence of tbat able
Min!ister, Mr. Brodeur, a contract was signed,
and this country has been benefited by thaving the Canadian Vickers operating here ever
since. At that tirne the question of constructing naval vessels wss thorougbly gonýe into.
The Vickers Company said it would be
impracticable to build naval vessels in Canada,
because the cost would be too higb, we having neither tbe mens nor the materials necessary for tbe purpose. As Naval Minister I
attended tbe Imperial Conferences of 1918
and 1921. The question of building naval
sbips in Canada was threshed out with the
Sea Lords. 1 also discussed the matter witb
chiose two famous men of the British Navy,
the late Admiral Beatty and the late Admirai
Jellicoe.
The former Minister of Naval Affairs, Mr.
Macdonald, announced the policy of the Government to have naval vessels built in Canada.
I have the highest regard for himn, and at this
point I pay my tribute to the development and expansion of the Canadian Navy
under his administration. Our young men
from the farms, factories and places of business were eager to enlist, and during the war
the total personnel reached 95,000. They
distinguished themselves ini every engagement
xith the enemy, and tbeir heroism and skill
won the admiration of their comnrades of the
British Navy.

I have always been interested in Canada
having a Navy. Since Sir Wilfrid Laurier
introduced the Navy Bill in 1911, our naval
service has had a ebeckered career; but now it
is established on a firm basis, and I arn pleased
to note that we are to have a permanent
naval force of 10,000 men.
But to corne back to the building of the
Tribal Class of destroyers. When in 1941 the
policy was first announced by the former
Minister I stated in tbis Chamber that it
would be a mistake for Canada to try to
construet destroyers of this large type, armed
as tbey are with four and six-inchi guns, antiaircraft guns and torpedoes. I suggested to
hîm that as cargo ships were very urgently
needed, we could build five of them for tbe
cost of one Tribal Clams destroyer. The
hýonourable leader of the Government will
correct me if I amn wrong, but I arn under the
impression that three or four more of this
class of destroyers are to be constructed. I do
hope the Government will cancel the contracts.
Most of tbe destroyers and cruisers bave been
either bought from the United Kingdom or
received from tbat country as a free gift. The
two destroyers that arrived on the Pacifie
Coast a few days ago. are much more modern
in their equipment than the Tribal destroyers
being built at Halifax, one of which, has
already been finished. For that reason and
for the sake of economy the Government
would be well advised to proceed no further
with the construction cf that class of vessel.
Many msillions of dollars could be saved there.
I corne now to the general picture. Canada
faces dlifficult times and the outlook is not
too bright, but 1 hope our people will display
the saine morale and will-power that they did
during tihe war. In wartime morale is essential, not alone for the armed forces, but for
each and every citizen. The high morale of
our people during the war greatly helped to
defeat both Germany and Japan.
But there is no high morale on the part
of our business people or of Canadians in
general to-day. Instead, there is apathy. One
commonly hears it said: "With aIl these
controls and taxes, what's the use?" Therefore
I hope that in the very near future the
Government will relax more controls and
still furtber reduce taxes. The unemployment situation is not good, at present, but I
do not blame the Government for that. In
the country as a whole the number of people
out of work is at least 200,000, and that number will increase, principally because of the
transition from wartime to, peacetime industry.
But the Government could stimulate trade and
encourage industry, large and small, by giving
business people cause to hope that they can

SENATE

make a fair return on their capital. 1 say
once again that as soon as possible the Government sheuld remove the ceiiing prices on
goods whose consumption does flot seriously
affect the cost of living or foreign exchange.
Also the income tax ought to be entirely
rernoved. If these things were doue a great
impetus wouid be given to trade and the
general development of the country. I have
neyer been one who believed that we could
have full ernployment in Canada. I arn by no0
means a pessimist, but if you want to succeed
in public life or in business or any other
career a sane optimism is not enough; you
rnust hav e also a sane regard for ecouomy
and mauy other things. If the Goverumeiit
adopted my suggestions, even in part, the
morale of the people would be strengthened,
their apathiy wouid disappear and they wcs'ld
once more have the courage and ambition to
mnake Canada greater.
Honourable senators know as well as I do
that no other country in the world offers the
same opportunities that Canada dees. As was
said last night at the birthday party te the
Prime Minister, the reputation and status of
Canada are highi throughout the world. I arn
in faveur of selected immigration. There are
many experts in European arts and crafts
who ceuld be admitted here to our great
advantage. And if my suggestions were put
into effeet capital also would flow into Canada.
I have spoken altogether too long, but I
should like to say a few more words. I very
much daubt thant they will be heeded, but 1
arn inspired to make them by a story I read
in a Toronto paper this morning to the effeet
that Parliament and the Government are considering making some changes in our parliamentary procedure to bring it into dloser conformity with that of the British Parliament.
As honeurable senators are aware, the Imperial House of Commons assigns a certain
number of days-usually about three-to the
debato on the Address in reply te the Speech
from the Throne, and the debate concludes
witbin the time set. Similarly, on other iîmportant subjeets-it may bo foreigo affairs, fer
instance-a lirnit of one or two days is fixed
for debato. But in this country whien the
Address is being considered, every honeurable
momber of another place feels tînt hie must
mako a speech; andl afterwards, at grcat cost
te the country, hie mails Hansard eut to ail
the v oters in bis censtituencv. When thecy
corne to the budget thcy appoint a coinmit toc composed of membors frQm each party.
This comirnittee goos theroughly into the
estimates and reports them te the Husc. I
for ene wouid very nsueb like ta sec that
systein ioaugurated here. No doubt there
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

weuid be a cry te higli Heaven that under
our democratie system such a practice would
neyer de. But here we are in the closing
heurs of the session, with supplementary estimates ruuning inte millions of dollars which
we have had nu uppertunity tu cunsider at
ail. The Main Estimates we have te a certain
extent considered in the Finance Cemmittee.
The. honourable leader of the Goveroment
toid me this merning that if honourable
members desired further details lie was quite
williug that the House should resolve it-self
inte Cemmittee of the Whoie for the purpese.
But the saine oid system has been feliowed
ever since I have been a member of either
House: everything is thrown at us in the
dying heurs of the session. It is net fair te
us, it is net fair te Parliament, and it is net
fair te tihe people of Canada. I do hiope that
some change will be made te remedy this unsatisfaetory state of affairs.
Hon. THOMAS A. CRERAR: 0f the statemnts made by my oid ceileague of former
days thero is eue that I agree with and oe
that I cannot agreo with. As te prooedure in
the ether House, I whoily share bis view. For
a good many yoars I have felt that members
in the Commons seemn unable te discipline
themnselves te an orderly consideration. of the
ail-important business that cames before them.
As my honaurable friend has said, days and
weeks are wasted in debate on matters that
sheuld ho disposed of within a reasonabie
lengtb of time. Thon with the approaching
end of the session there is a great urge te
got business through, and often important
legislation fails te receivo- adequaýte considoratien. I join my voire in the protest, made
in this Chamisor more than. once, against a
mnass of important legisiatien being sont here
in the closing days of the session wvhen it is
impossible te devote te it the tîme necesary
for thorough censideration.
I hope that
eventually some remedy will be found for
this unsatisfaetory state of affairs.
Tho, otîser staternent of my honaurable
friend whicb I sbould like te agroo svith, but
canoot, is that tise incarne tax slsouid ho
removed cntirely.
Hon. Mr, HARDY: I notieed at the time
thiat the hion-ourabie gentleman uscd the terin
incarne tax, but I knew lie iment the exeess
profits tax.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I thank, tIse
bonourable member for drawing my attention
te it . I intended ta say excess profits tax.
Han. Mr. CRERAR: Then I find myscîf
in the happy position of being able te agroo
with îssy bionourable friend on bath points.

DECEMBER 18, 1945
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: The excess profits tax
was a war measure, and with the disappearsuce of the war should be removed. There
was full justification for it during the warHon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Surely.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: -but now it should
be .repealed. I trust I shal nlot be misunderstood when I say that the economista of the
nineteenth century were, in my judgment
much abler men than the economists of the
twentieth century. I recali that one of them
said, "The power to tax is the power te destroy." That is a truismn we should ever bear
in mi. I have no hesitation in saying that
any considerable tax on the income of corporations is an unwise tax, because if we are to
have full development of the resources of
our country, with ail the employment that
cornes from such development, then it is the
part of wisdom. to offer every possible encouragement.
Any expectation of mucli tax reducýtion is
I fear too optimistic in the present state of
affairs, paxrticu1arly in view of our presen-t
expenditures and future commitmnents. No
one will dispute that we had to play our
part in the war. Rad we lost the war, within
a few years we should have been concerned
with far more terrible problems than any that
confronted us in the past five years. My
conviction on that point bas neyer wavered.
But we may as well face the fact that it has
been a tremendously costly business net only
in the mouetary sense but in the destruction
of other values which are of the very best
in our civilization. It is, I think, well to
examine our position and to take counsel with
ourselves as to what is the wisest course to
steer through ýthese difficulties.
I arn grateful to the honourable leader of
the Goverument for explaining how the increases in the current estimates arise. Hia
statement indicates that our total expenditures
for the fiscal year ending March next will be
well over five billion dollars. That is accounted
for roughly by the $3,365,000,000 set out
in the War Appropriation Bihl and the
$1,023,000,000 for various departmental expenditures as set out in the blue-covered
volume whîch I hold in my baud; and by
approximately $22,000,00 of the supplementary estimates and the additional 8650,000,000
under the Expert Credits Insuranoe Act. Let
me not be misunderstood; I take no exception
to this expenditure.
SAs by the end of the fiscal year the war
with Germany will have been over for almost
eleven months, and the war with Japan for
almost eight months,- $5,000,000,000 seems

a very large expenditure. Please uuderstaud,
honourable members, I am not criticiziug the
Goverumeut for the expenditure, for our ex-.
perience after the Great War endiug iu 1918
iu&lcated that the two years immediateIy
foliowing the cessation of war are ini soe
respects more expensive than the actual war
years. I caîl attention to these huge amounts,
not in the spirit of criticism, but to indicate
to honourable members that -the fluancial
problems ahead of -us- are vitally important.
I hear it said tbat in tbe normal coudition
incident to peace Canada wilh need to raise
by taxation between $1,750,000,000
and
82,000,000,000 a year. That is a very large
sumn of money, and unless we ýcan greatly
expand our export trade and find permanent
markets in ail corners of the world where our
products can be profitably disposed of, I do
not see how we are going to survive under this
tremendous burden.
In my humble judgment no problems fae.ing our people today are of more importance
than those which will arise out of public
finance, for if the country becomes unable to
meet its expenditures it will run into really
serious political troubles. So I hope that when
another session rolîs arouud the Goverument
will bring before Parliament a budget exhibiting as much economy as is reasonably
possible,
Hou. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Hear, hear..
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: -and I would add
that tbis whole problemn of public finance, of
taxes and expenditures, is one that could very
well engage much more of the attention of
this honourable House than it bas in the past.

After which the Honourable the Deputy of
the Governor General was pleased to close
the First Session of the Twentieth Parliainent
of Canada with the following Speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the Houae of Commons:
More than three months have elapeed since
the unconditional aurrender of Japan, following
'upon the unconditional surrender of Germany,
brought to an end a world war which has
lasted for six years. But peace throughout the
world had still to be. attained. We are now
passing through a period fraught with the
inevitable difficulties and dislocations of a time
of transition from war to peace. Efforts to
establish an enduring peace muet be the first
concern of all nations.
An essential step towards world peace is the
relief of human suffering occasioned by war
and the restoration of the countries physically
damaged by war. 'To that end, the further
appropriations you have made for international
relief and rehabilitation will be of the útnset
service.

Canada's determination to do her full part
in maintaining international peace and security
has been expressed by the unanimous approval
given by both House of Parliament to the
Charter of the United Nations. A delegation,
including members of both Houses, ia at present
in London attending the meetings of the
Preparatory Commission of the United Nations
Organization.
During October, after a brief conference at
Washington with the President of the United
States, my Prime Minister visited the United
Kingdom for discussion with members of the
British government and for consultation with
Canadian representatives in Europe. Shortly
thereafter the Prime Minister joined with the
Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in
conwersations with President Truman at Washington on the subject of atomie energy. Their
discussions resulted in an agreed Declaration.
The initiative was thereby taken in an international effort to prevent the use of atomie
energy for destructive purposes and te promote
The
its use for the benefit of mankind.
approval you have given the declaration will
further this initiative.
The visit to Ottawa of the Prime Minister
of Great Britain and his address to the
members of both Houses of Parliament were
deeply appreciated. The visit afforded opportunity for an expression of Canada's admiration for the spirit and resolution of the people
of Britain in meeting the difficulties and privations of this post-war period.
Efforts to stimulate the exansion of external
trade and the restoration of a world economy
have been intensified. These ende will be
greatly furthered by the vastly increased
appropriations you have made for export credits
to allied countries and by your approval of
Canadian participation in the International
Monetary Fund and the Bank of Reconstruction and Development. Negotiations are under
way to extend export credits to the United
Kingdom. Far-reaehing proposals on trade and
employment for consideration by an international conference have been advanced by the
United States government and are now before
you. My ministers welcome the presentation of
these proposals.
With your approval Canada became a
member of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The first meeting
of the new organization was held -in Quebec
City in the month of October.
In November, the Co-ordinating Committee
of the Dominion-Provincial Conference, which
includes the Premiers of all the Provinces,
devoted several days to a detailed and frank
exchange of views with my Prime Minister and
other of my ministers. A Dominiôn-Provincial
Economic Committee was set up by the Coordinating Committee to examine and report to
the participating governments upon the economie
factors affecting Dominion and Provincial proThe Co-ordinating
and relations.
posals
Committee will meet again early in the new
year. My ministers are resolved to continue
their utmost endeavours to reach an agreement
which will place the Federal Government and
the governments of all the provinces in a
financial position to discharge effectively their
several responsibilities.
The members of the armed forces serving
abroad have been returning to Canada as
rapidly

as transport facilities would

permit.

The release of men and women from the forces
is keeping pace with repatriation.

4U2

SENATE

Pending a decision as to the size of the
permanent defence
establishments, interim
arrangements have been made for continued
voluntary service ýin the armed forces of members of the three services who have the required
qua-lifications.
A special committee of the House of Commons,
has given close study to the various statutes
and orders relating to the care, rehabili-tation
and reestablishment of war veterans. On the
recommendation of the committee, a Veterans'
Rehabilitation Act has been enacted and amendments have been made to the War Service
Grants Act and the Veterang Land Act. The
Government intends to propose that the committee he reconstituted at the next session to
complete its examination of the measures which
are being consolidated into a Veterans' Charter.
Steady progress has been made with the
conversion of war industries to civilian production. Provision has been made for the amalgamation of the Department of Munitions and
Supply with the Department of Reconstruction.
The work of the Department of National War
Services is all but completed.
War restrictions are being removed as rapidly
as this can be accomplished without occasioning
inflation or other economic disturbances.
In order to make possible the continuance of
controls essential to the welfare of the people,
a measure has been enacted to permit the extenmÏon of certain specified emergency powers
during the period of transition from war to
peace.
To accelerate the construction of houses as
the supply of materials and the availability of
labour increase, amendments have been made to
the National Housing Act. Provision has also
been made for the establishment of a Central
Mortgage and Housing Corporation. Special
attention is being given to the provision of loweost housing for war veterans and to making
emergency shelter available during the present
shortage of permanent housing.

Provision has been made for increasing the
capital of Trans-Canada Air Lines to permit
of the expansion of our international air
services.
Members of the House of Commons:
I thank you for the financial provision you
have made for all essential services, as well .as
for expenditures arising out of the war and for
purposes of reconstruction.
The unprecedented response to the Ninth
Victory Loan was heartening evidence of the
determination of the Canadian people to
consolidate victory.
A measure of relief from the wartime burden
of taxation bas been a significant feature of the
session.

Ilonourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
My ministers were gratified at the approval
given to the proposal that Canada should
possess a distinctive national flag. At the next
session, they will propose that the Select Pommittee of both Houses be reconstituted in order
to complete the task of considering a suitable
design for a Canadian flag.
It affords me pleasure to state that a
snccessful beginning bas been made in the
planned development and beautification of
Canada's capital and its surrounding area as a
national memorial to commemorate the service
and sacrifice of Canadians in the war just
ended.
On taking leave of you at the close of this
momentous year, I pray that Providence may
continue to bless our country, and to guide the
nations of the world in their efforts to establish an enduring peace.
