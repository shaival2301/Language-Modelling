Ris Excellency was pleased to command the

that House heing come, with their Speaker,
His Excellency was pleased to open the FourLth
Session of the Nineteenth Parliament of
Canada with the following speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
As you enter upon your duties at the beginning of this new year you will be heartened
by the improved position of the United Nations.
In the first year of war, most of the countries
of Europe lost their freedom and became the
victims of Nazi occupation and oppression.
In the second year, Italy, already at war, joined
hier power with that of Germany in an effort to
seize new territories in Africa, as well as in
Europe. In the third year, Japan entered the
world confliet in the expectation of becoming
the master of the Orient. These actions dis72542-1

closed the pre-arranged. schedule of world
domination planned by the Axis powers. Each,
at the appointed time, sprang upon its unoffending neighbours.
During these years the nations which were
attacked, and others still enjoying frcedom,
were necessarily on the defensive. For three
years the free nations continued to gather
strength, at the same time affording such
mutual aid, one to the other, as opportunity
permitted.
In their attempt at world conquefit the forces
of aggression stili continue their campaiges
of terror and violence. The world scene, however, has vastly changed from what it was a
year ago. Enemy forces, everywhere, have been
halted hy stubborn and successf ni resistance.
In many parts of the world the Allied powers
have taken the offensive.
At Casablanca, in North Africa, a meeting,
unprecedented in history, has just been concluded between the Prime Minister of Great
Britain and the President of the United States.
During their conference they were in communication with the Premier of the Soviet
Union and the Generalissimo of China. At the
conference the leaders of Great Britain and the
United States, both military and civil, agreed
on a war plan for 1943 designed to maintain
the initiative in every theatre of war.
In the Western Hemisphere the peopies now
present a virtually united front against the
Axis powers.
The Government has maintained close relations with the nations with which Canada
is ,uniteci in the common struggle. Direct
diplomatie representation has strengthened our
relations with China and the Soviet Union,
and with the several Allied. governments now
temporarily resident in the United Kingdom.
The establishment of diplomatic missions to
nations of the Americas is broadening the
friendly relations hetween those countries and
Canada.
Our armed forces are on active service in
ahl parts of the world. Their strength has
been steadily increased. They are equipped
with the most modern and efficient weapons of
war. In actual combat they have served with
distinction and gallantry.
In the present year the progressive expansion
of the Navy will be continued. The Army
programmne will include the maintenance and
reinforcement of the overseas army of two
corps, and the maintenance of units and
formations required for the territorial and
coastal defence of Canada and other areas
in the Western Hemisphere. The Air Force
will continue its three-f nId activities of air
training, patrolling our coasts and coastal
waters, and sharing in aerial combat overseas.

KEVIBED EDITION

SENATE

2

Increased responsibilities will be assumed for
the maintenance of Canadian airmen and
Canadian squadrons serving abroad.
As an integral part of Canada's total war
effort, ships, aircraft, weapons, munitions and
other supplies . will continue to be provided,
not only for Canada's forces, but in vast
quantities as well for the forces of our fighting allies. In order to provide for the financing and for the allocation to the United
Nations of Canadian war production, a measure
which will make provision for the establishment of a Canadian War Supplies Allocation
Board will be submitted for your approval.
A joint committee represen.tative of the
Departments of Agriculture of Canada and the
United 'States bas been agreed upon to ceordinate the efforts of the two countries in
the production of food for the United Nations.
The innediate objeet of the United Nations
is the defeat of the Axis powers. Joint planning of operations on a world scale bas accompanied preparations for intensive warfare.
The United Nations also aim at rendering
aggression impossible in the future. Their
governments, in addition to planning jointly
for the prosecution of the war, have already
entered into consultation regarding post-war
problems. Achievement of their aims requires
the establishment of conditions under which

to do with the reorganization of the Canadian
National Railways. He also accompanied the
Prime Minister to the Imperial Conference in
1923, and was made an Imperial Privy Councillor. In October, 1925, he resigned as Minister
of Railways and Canals, and in February, 1926,
accepted the difficult position of Chairman of
the Tariff Advisory Board. He was summoned
'o the Senate in December, 1926.
His association with the Department of
Railways and Canals between 1907 and 1911
and again from 1923 to 1925, was during the
period in which the whole picture of Canadian
.ailway development underwent a great
avolutionary change, and Senator Graham was
given an opportunity that comes to few
Ministers of the Crown -to acquire a vast
knowledge of the potentialities of Canada. His
work brought him into contact with numerous
and varied interests in Canada as well as in
other parts of the world.
I have given only a bare outline of his great
public service. He will be remembered by
parliamentarians and other public men as an
able and just administrator, and by the public
for his great sense of humour and his kindly,
courteous manner, and as a Christian
gentleman.
With his usual adaptability lie immediately
found his place in this Chamber, taking an
active and effective part in debate. In the
chairmanship of the Railway Committee his
broad experience was of great value when
highly important matters were under discussion.
I have always felt that the training Mr.
Graham received in the journalistic field did
much to qualify him for the more arduous
and strenuous duties of his parliamentary life.
Personally I feel I have lost a truc and dear
friend. I am sure it is the desire of honourable members that an expression of our deepest
sympathy be conveyed to Mrs. Graham and
ber family in their great bereavement; also
that a similar expression of sympathy be
extended to Madame Parent and ber family
in their sad loss.
How sad te
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE:

of this Chamber, by reason of his long experience in both Houses and his perfect command
of both languages.
The Hon. George Parent has left a fine
record of public service, having become a member of the House of Commons' at an early
age. Our late colleague was a distinguished
member of the legal profession and his wise
counsel and advice made him eagerly sought
for on the directorate of financial and business
organizations.
Our late Speaker was naturally proud of his
native city and province, but he took the
broad view that his election ýto Parliament was
not only for the city he represented, but
also for the country as a whole. He was noted
for his tolerant viewpoint on all matters pertaining to the welfare of Canada. If we had
more men in public life taking the broad view
that he always took, Canada would have an
even greater unity than prevails at the present
time.
I may be permitted here to add a personal
note. I had the honour and privilege of being
with our late Speaker when he was a member
of the House of Commons, where he was
highly regarded, and our relationship was most
cordial. When he came to this House it was
a pleasure to renew that association. I feel
the deepest sorrow that my good friend the
late Speaker has so suddenly passed away.
On behalf of all honourable members on
this side of the House, I join with the honourable leader and senators on the other side in
expressing to Madame Parent and her family
our deepest sympathy.
The death of the Right Hon. George P.
Graham has removed from the public life of
Canada a most lovable character, a great
Canadian statesman and philanthropist. During his long and useful public career he made
a record that few public men have equalled.
Our late colleague also proved that he was an
able administrator, when he held from time
to time so many important portfolios in the
Government. Whatever he undertook to do
was always most efficiently done.
With particular regard to his work in this
Chamber, we all recall his many able speeches
to which we had the good fortune to listen,
and the able manner in which he presided as
Chairman of the Committee on Railways,
Telegraphs and Harbours.
Senator Graham was widely known throughMaking friends wherever he

His

friends were numberless and he had no enemies.
During his busy public career he also devoted
a great deal of his time and means to
charitable purposes, more particularly in the

years when be was President of tbe Victorian
Order of Nurses for Canada. Be was at al
times kind-hearted and ready ta render what
aid he could ta the poor and needy. Bis
memory, indeed, will long be .eherished.
I may say, honourable senators, that I had
tbe bonour of being born in Dundas County,
just a f ew miles from Morrisburg, and
aithough I did not meet George P. Graham
until be came ta Ottawa, I often heard bim
spoken of most favourabiy when I was quite
young. During tbe years 'he was in the
Senate aur friendsbip grew dloser and dloser,
and bis passing is ta me a matter of deep
personal regret. On behaîf of those on this
side of the Bouse I jain with the Leader
of the Senate and other banourabie members
in expressing deepest sympathy ta Mrs.
Graham and ber family.
Bon. FERNAND FAFARD (Translation):
Bopourable senators, those wbo bave known
Senator Parent, whose death occurred recently,
will cberish bis memory.
The son of a former Prime Minister of the
province of Quebec, the late Senatar Parent
bad inborn qualities as a public man and a
business man.
George Parent was scarceiy 25 years aid
wben he was elected a member of the Bouse
of Commons, where for a num-ber of years
be bad a brilliant career. Be was firm. in his
political beliefs, and would bave preferred ta
suifer defeat rather than disown bis palitical
principles.
As Speaker of the Senate he fulfiiled -bis
duties with the greatest dignity and witb a
fairness wbicb refleets credit on bis memory.
Those wba bave known bimi in this Bouse will
retain a very favourable recoliectian of him.
Apart from being an outstanding political
man, Senator Parent was a sbrewd business
man. Bis vision, bis industry and bis resourcefulness have brougbt bim mucb success in, the
business world, wbere be was fully trusted.
In his deatb the city of Quebec bais bast a
man of great initiative and a good Canadian.
On your behaîf, bonourable senatars, and in
the name of bis friende fram tbe province of
Quebec, I wish ta tender ta bis family, and
especially ta Madame Parent and ber twa
sons, Jacques and Simon, our beàrtfelt
sympatby.
Bon. A. B. COPP: Boinourable senators, at
the beginning of a session of Parliament we
are usually confranted wi'th two phases of life
hiere, one pleasant and one sad. In this Parliament, besides meeting oId colleagues again,
we have bad the pleasure of weicoming four
new members; and 1 want at this point ta
extend my congratulations ta those members
wbo bave recently been sentenced ta serve

life terme in this Chamber. I hope they may
live long and enjoy publie conifidénce to the
full.
May I especially offer my congratulations
to you, Mr. Speaker, on your accession to the
position which you naw hoîd. The Senate is
fortunate indeed in. having a gentleman of
your qualifications, experience and ability, to
preside over its deliberatione. As we look
back over the line of gentlemen who, have
preceded you in your higb office, we are impressed with an outstanding record of ability
and statesmansbip. I feel sure, sir, that you
will upbold the bigh traditions of your office
and that when you retire frorn it your record
will be quite equal ta thaýt of your predeceasors.
This naturally brings me ta the passing of
our late friend Senatar Parent. As has been
said, he discharged bis dutiee with such dignity, ability and impartiality as brought
honour not enly ta bimself, but also ta this
Huse.
I had the privilege of knowing Senator
Parent more or less intimately for something
like twenty-five years, biaving first sat with
him, for a short time, in the other Blouse. I
always found bim a congenial companion, and
equally proficient, in meeting friende socially
or debating with adversaries on the floor of
Parliament. I fully agree with ail that bas
been said about him.
Senator Parent came into publie service very
early in life, being, I think, twenty-five years
of age when be was first e4ected ta the House
of Commons. He served long, faithfully and
well. He hiad a large legai practice and was
associated with numerous business organizations. During the time he was with us he
served bis country well, doing what he believed ta be in its hest interests. I tbink'that
when we adjourned, a few menths ago, none
of us would have believed that he would be
among the first to go. He was stricken sudden.ly in a hotel in, the cîty of Montreal, and,
I believe, neyer regained consciousness--another proof of the oft-made statement that in
the midet of life we are in deatb. I join with
my friends in offering my sincere sympatby ta
his family, wbo have been sa sadly bereaved
by hýis sudden passing.
It is mucb harder for me te refer ta the
loss of my very dear friend Senator Graham.
I knew Senator Graham for a great many
years, first meeting him offlcially in 1907, wben
he entered the Bouse of Commons as Minister of Railways and, Canais in the Gavernment of Sir Wilfrid Laurier. From then on,
I met him from time ta time, but I hecame
,mare intimately acquainted witb hîm in 1921
and we have since been particularly close
friends.

SENATE
I do not know that I would attempt to say
anything about Senator Graham were it not
for the fact that ha left with me a message
which he asked me to convey to this Chamber.
As we separated in August last he bade me
good-bye in bis usual cheery manner; then he
said: "Copp, if I do not return next session,
will you convey to my friends and colleagues
on both sides of the House my sincere thanks
for the many kindly deeds they have done me
and the many kindly words they have spoken
of me?" At that time I realized. and I think
ho realized too, that bis health was not too
good, and that ha might not return. In conveying that message to you I may say that
I am sure it came from bis heart.
Sixteen years ago Senator Graham and I
came together as office mates in a room
upstairs, and during those sixteeen years no
person could have had a truer or more loyal
friend than I had in him. Looked back upon,
the period does not seem so long; but the
zlock ticks relentlessly away and suddenly we
realize that we are sixteen years older and
that the time may not be so far distant when
we shall be following the path taken by our
right honourable friend.
Senator Graham served this country in
various public capacities for upwards of fifty
years, and ha served it well. He was one of
nature's gentlemen. As we sat in the room
upstairs speaking of the stirring times througb
which ha had passed, I never heard him utter
an ill word of anybody, and I am sure he
never harboured an ill thought. That speaks
well for a man who bas gone through the
turmoil of political life.
It is needless for me to make any extended
remarks about Senator Graham. Many things
that he bas told me in confidence I cannot
mention; but as long as I live the memory of
my close association with him will be one of
the greatest pleasures and greatest assets of
my life. I remember reading some years ago
an oration delivered by the late Robert Ingersoll at the side of bis brother's grave. If I
remember correctly what he said in referring
to his brother, it was this: "If eiery person
for whom ha bas dono a kind act, or to whom
ha bas spoken a kind word, were bore to-day
and were to drop but a blossom on bis grave,
ha would sleep to-night beneath a wilderness
of flowers." As I stood in the funeral chapel
in Brockville a few weeks ago and as I saw the
remains of my friend lowered to the tomb, I
thought to myself that if ever there was a man
to whom those words would aptly and truthfully apply it was that man who was being
laid away in his last resting-place.
Hon. Mr. COPP.

Honourable senators, I want to join with
all of you in publicly expressing sympathy, as
I have already done privately, to Mrs. Graham
and her two granddaughters, of whom the late
Senator was so proud, and who were equally
proud of him. May the generous soul of
George Graham rest in peace!
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN: Honourable
senators, may I be permitted to say a few
words in tribute to our late colleague from
Brockville, not so much in terms relting to
his public life as with reference to the
occupation in which ha was engaged. I am
afraid that the country at large was not
generally acquainted with ie fact tîat the
late George Graham was a newspaperman
right up to the tinie of bis death. Those of
us who were in the newspaper business
throughout the coun.try had a great regard
for bim. To us he was known in that capacity
just as wel as he was known as a member of
goveroments and a member of the Senate.
The late Senator Graham began bis life in
the newspaper business. Like my friend and
colleague from Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies).
he started as the publisher of a weekly newspaper, and later became the editor of a daily
newspaper in his home city of Brockville. I
know from my acquaintance with him in this
Chamber that he was writing articles for that
paper up to within a few years of his dle.ath.
In his newspaper career, as in public life, ho
was alvays broad-mindcd and treated bis
political opponents kindly. Though he had
very strong vicws, I do not think ha ever
offendcd an opponent in the field of political
action or in the newspaper ha published.
Naturally those of us wbo are newspapermen
mourn his loss. and I feel that his relationship
to the newspaper profession should be mentioned at this time wlien we are paying
tributes to his memor-. My own acquaintance
with bim went back to the tme when he was
a member of the Ontario Legislature and I
was a aimemiber of the Press Gallery there. I
knew hlim
ifroni that time until his death. He
can be described as above eveirything els'e a
great hiuman personal-ity, gencrous to a fault,
a man w li
ioved to be in the company of his
friends and was aIlways doing good deeds and
making new friends whierever he moved. He
was not an extreme partisan; he was not
narrow. Tbough loyal ta lis party, he was
ahiays on the friendliest terms with bis
political opponants, who, I know, respected
him for his fairness and bis goodness.
Hon. C. B. HOWARD: Honourable senators,
Quebec is te only province in Canada divided
into canatorial constituencies.
The late

FEBRUARY 2, 1943
Speaker af tbis Senate, Han. George Parent,
representeci the divisian of Kennebec, wbicb
is in the Eastern Townships, and I desire ta,
express the regret af the citizenes af the
Eastern Tawnships at lis passing.
The Hon. George Parent was a Frenchspeaking Canadian, wbase father wss at ane
time Prime Minister af the province of
Quebec. George Parent was a wortby son
of a worthy f ather. H1e was a successful
business man. At one time bie awned the
second largest French-language newspaper in
North America. H1e was a director of the
pawer company of bis own city-the Quebec
Pawer Company-and also of the Southeru
Canada Power Campany, whose transmissian
lines cover the Eastern Townships. But in
my humble opinion Gearge Parent rendered
bis greatest service ta the community in the
rale he played as a French Canadian in
Canadian palities. 11e was not a narrawminded nationalist nor an isolationist. H1e
was proud af 'bis natianality, but was a
champian af racial equality and always considered it bis duty as a French Canadian ta
is
respect the ather fellow's viewpoint.
broad-mindedness was bis autstanding contribution ta the Eastern Tawnships. There
neyer was a time wben broad-minded men sucb
as George Parent were mare. badly needed;
and in these times it is exceptionally bard ta
replace them. On behaîf of tbe citizens af the
Eastern Townsbips and myself and my family
I join with honourable members who have
preceded me in tenderiug aur sympatby ta
Mrs. Parent and bier famlly.
Hon. A. C. HARDY : Honourable senatars,
nathing I cauld say bere to-nigbt would add
ta the stature or memory of George P. Graham,
who has so recently passed from amongst us,
and I shaîl nat itry ta add ta tbe very kind
and well-deserved words that bave been spoken
about bis career in Parliament. But I feel
I should be very remiss if I did not pay
tribute ta him as a late fellow-citizen of tbe
town af Brockville, where he lived for same
fifty years. 11e was not anly aour autstanding
citizen, but he was the best laved and most
widely knawn of ahl wba bave lived in
Brackville within tbe mnemory of the present
residefits of the tawn. 1 knew bim aver a
long periad, beginning as f ar back as some
eight or nine years befare hie entered Parliament. In 1898 hie 'was first elected ta the
Ontario Legisiature, where he was one af my
fatber's calleagues, and I well remnember meeting him there that year.
George Graham was a man of the most
generaus instincts. I do nat tbink be ever

fail-ed to contribute towards any of the civic
objectives we set for ourselves in the city of
Brockville. We ean hardsly realize that one
who was so eminent a fellow-citizen for so
many years has left us.
Hon. L. M. GOUIN: Honourable senators,
1 wish to add only a few words to the tributes
wbich have been so ably paid to our two
departed colleagues. 0f our late, Speaker, the
Hon. George Parent, it bas already been said
that he was successful not only in the practice
.of the legal profession, but also as a business
man. As Speaker of this Chamber bie was
dignified, impartial and mnost courteaus. His
bospitality was charming. May I say bere
thaýt we are ail conrvinced our newly appointed
Speaker will be a worthy successor of our late
colleague from Quebec.
Our late Speaker was a most cordial friend,
who was always trying to be cd service ta us.
Last session, after I bad referred to the
necessity of developing our relations with
Latin America-in which subi ect he took a
deep personal interest-be was always kind
enough ta inform me whenever he learned of
any significant fact concerning South America.
That kindness on bis part was a great
encouragement to me, and I feel it a duty
to express gratitude to-nigbt.
As to aur late colleague from Brockville,
the Right Hon. George P. Graham, I will say
only a few wards. 11e made a deep impression
upon me wben 1 had tbe bonour of entering
the Senate. For me be wss a living representative of the great epoch of Sir Wilfrid
Laurier; so I f elt a deep emotian when I
sbook bauds witb this survivar of the Laurier
regime. 1 also took very mucb ta heart any
remarks be might make ta me after I bad
participated in a debate. The doctrines of
Laurier bave always remained aur political
creed, and it gave me deep satisfaction ta
see that aur illustriaus friend from Brackville
laoked ta the younger generation ta continue
the great traditian ta wbich he bimself bad
contributed sa much. We sball neyer farget
aur late calleague's very remarkable qualities
as a statesman and aratar, a great Canadian
and one of tbe ablest and most distinguished
of aur public men.
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senatars,
as ane wha bas been a member of the Senate
far a number af years and knew the late
Gearge Graham befare hie came ta this Chamber, tbaugb not so intimately as from tbat
time an, I desire ta adid just a ward ar twa
in tribute ta bis memory. First, hawever,
may 1 congratulate the Speaker wba now
accupies the Chair whicb bas been vacated
by aur late esteemed calleague, Senator Parent.

SENATE
I did not know Senator Parent personally

until he came to this House.

He filled the

high office of Speaker of the Senate well,
in a dignified way and with credit to this
Chamber. In presiding over our debates he
was always fair and considerate to every
honourable member.
Coming now to the late Senator Graham,
may I say that I had for him a deep affection.
It has been said that
The evil that men do lives after them;
The good is oft interred with their bones.
I do not subscribe to that, for I think the
truth is rather the reverse. In any event, the
good that our late colleague Senator Graham
did will live after him.
I agree with all that has been said by the
honourable gentleman from Westmorland
(Hon. Mr. Copp) about Senator Graham. I
do not know that I have met in all the time
I have been a member of the Senate anyone
who had a more kindly disposition, or a
friendlier attitude towards all his fellowmembers, whether they sat on the left or the
right of the Speaker. Like Abou Ben Adhem,
the late Senator Graham might well have said:
I pray thee, then,
Write me as one that loves his fellow-men.

Hon. J. T. HAIG: Ronourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are called, I
rise to a question of privilege. In the province of Manitoba for the last three or four
weeks we have had temperatures as low as
46 degrees below zero. I fear that some of
that Western weather must have reached this
Chamber.
THE GOVERNOR

GENERAL'S SPEECH

ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate proceeded to the consideration
of His Excellency the Governor General's
Speech at the opening of the session.
Hon. P. R. Du TREMBLAY moved that an
Address be presented to His Excellency the
Governor General to offer the humble thanks
of this House to His Excellency for the
gra.cious Speech which he has been pleased
to make to both Houses of Parliament.
He said (Translation): Honourable senators,
I take pleasure in stating at the outset that I
very much appreciate the honour of being a
member of the Canadian Senate. This is the
highest legislative Chamber in our country,
Hon. Mr. BLACK.

and its members shoulder a great responsibility. I shall endeavour to be worthy of it.
I rely on your help and your kindness.
This House has an important duty to fulfil.
After the war it will be faced with a very
great task. To my mind, one of the funetions of the Senate should be that of a restraining body. It should be the House of
common sense and moderation. In these difficult and troublous times, when many people
look for something new and seem inclined to
adopt dangerous theories which are a departurc from whatever is good in democracy, this
House could help to avert many dangers.
The Senate can help to check subversive
ideas which might be implanted after the war.
We are already hearing something about them.
Such ideas often fail to prove a blessing for
the people. Many changes are being suggested; false hopes are entertained which
wnould in the end bring about nothing but
disappointment and frustration.
We should not forget that there is nothing
new under the sun. Ever since the beginning
of the world, many people have tried to put
into practice various theories, each one of
which would, they thought, bring about happiness, but each test has shown their impracticability. By nature, human beings have a
craving for changes; they pursue an ideal of
perfection. They never reach it, because perfection does not exIst on earth.
Since nothing is perfect in this world, we
ought to be satisfied with some degree of perfection. I believe that the economie system
we have in the Dominion and the provincial
spheres is capable of ensuring justice and
happiness to all classes of our society. The
democratie system affords to everyone the
hope of bettering his position through his industry; it stimulates the eagerness to work
through the reward of a reasonable gain; it
respects civil and religious rights. Of course
that system is not perfect; there are deficiencies and many imperfections, but such imperfections can be remedied and the deficiencies
can be made good. There are frequently
unfathomable injustices, but they can be
remedied.
I know of no other system which by its very
object and its flexibility is more calculated to
suppress abuses and promote useful reforms.
Our system of modified democratic government, if it were applied by men of goodwill,
could ensure to the Canadian people good
administration. The right-minded people of
Canada rely especially on the Senate for the
task of ensuring the triumph of sound demo-

FEBRUARY 2, 1943
cratic principles, ûhecking subversive ideas and
restraining dangerous theories which would
only speli disaster in this country.
The Hon. Joseph Raînville, my predecessor
in this House as the membar from Repentigny,
was a shrewd business -man. He played an
important part ini Canadian politics. I became
acquainted with him at the tima when he and
I were reading law at the University of
Montres-i. He sat in the Model Parls-ment, of
that period; hae was one of the Ministers, and
I also held a portfolio, which, of course, entailed no heavy rasponsibilities. Even during
that es-ny paniod, Mr. Rainville was noted for
his eloquence. He had a natural bant for
liking and helping his fellows. He was one
of the organizers of his party and I balieve
that at the close of his career he enjoyed the
friendship of aIl. His friends, who ware quita
numerous, will'keep a favourabla remembrance
of him. He was warin-heartad. He was fond
of the arts, espe-cially music. Be helped many
causes and a number of people. The demise
of Hon. Mr. Rainville is accordingly a great
loss.
I take much pleasure, Mr. Speaker, in congratulating you upon having been selected by
the Govarnmant to presida ovar the delibarations of this House. No one was bettar qualified .nor had a greater measure of experience
for the -high and honourabla office of Speaker
of the Senate. I hope that the performance
of your duties will afford y.ou nothing but
satisfaction. We know that your rulings will
ever ha the exemplification of right, justice and
fairness, and wc oiight to be pleased to have a
Speaker of your character. The Government
deserves our compliments for tliat appointment. You are succeeding a worthy Speaker,
Hon. Ge-orge Parent, who for more than a
quarter of a century played an outstanding
part in Parliament. Ha was one of the public
men who have hast sarved their fellow-citizens
and their country. Wa know, Mr. Speaker,
that you will maintain the samne traditions of
kindness and understanding as your predecessors, and I tender you my hest wishas.
The speech which Bis Excellency the Govarnor Ganerai raad in this honoiXrable Bouse
on January 28 last is a most comforting and
satisfying massage. It heralds meàsures which
will prove helpful to our country in many
fields. One of the main measures announced
is social insurance, which, provided the right
formula is found, gives us the hope of being
able to afford our people the protection thay
have a right to expact. We already have
several social mes-sures within Dominion jurisdiction, but the new project. will be much
more comprehensive.

9

I feel justifiad in saying that the social
security insurance project, protecting the
people of this country against fear and want,
is excellent, and that it is in pninciple acceptable to aIl; but what must ha found is the
method, the sound course to be followed in
reaching the desirad objective. It is important that the Canadian nation should ponder
this matter, so as to avoid mistakes. We are
all eagar to protect our fellow-citizens against
fear and destitution, and if this objective is
to ha reached, as mentioned in the Speech
from the Throne, it is essential that a national
plan be worked out to provide insurance
against the inavitabla affects of the principal
economic and social risks.
Wa alraady have in Canada social sacurity
measuras anacted hy tha Dominion Parliamient: unemployment insurance, old aga pensions, pensions for tha blýind and for disabled
soldiars. And there are provincial Acts providing against accidents and sickness, and
relating to hospital traatment, mothers' and
widows' aliowances and matcrnity assistance,
but the Donàilnion Government now wishas to
establish a social security plan for the entira
nation, and to this end it intends to work out
a complata national system of social insurance
which, in the words of the Speech from the
Throne, will constituta a charter of social
security for the whole of Canada.
The Government intends to racommand the
early appointment of a select cummittea to
inquire into and report upon the measures to
ha takan for the establ.ishment of social insuranca, as well as the means whareby -thay
could ba included in a nation-wida plan. That
committee will ha instructad to study such a
nation-wida system.
I balieve that such a racommendation on the
part of the Governmant is quite wisa, for
it is not sufficient to desira something useful;
the manner in which it can ha obtainad and
tha way to ms-ke it most useful must also ha
examined. You aIl know, honourable senators,
that in the field of social measures, the
provinces enjoy certain rights, and that consequantly it is imparative that a survey ha
made of what can ha accomplished and of the
manner in which it can be donc without
ancroaching upon thosa provincial rights.
It is of the utmost importance, in connection
with thosa post-war aconomic and social reconstruction plans for Canada, to establish s
system which shall meet the particular conditions axisting in this country. The idea is
not to copy schame-s which, although useful in
some other country, would be usaless in our

SENATE

University, in a remarkable talk on the plan
submitted to the British authorities by Sir
William Beveridge, should be heeded: to copy
this plan closely would be the wrong thing to
do. We can and must, according to Mr.
James, inaugurate a system adapted to the
peculiar conditions obtaining in our country.
Although we should find it advantageous to
adopt some points of this scheme, which
is a thorough and methodical study of the
whole subject, we could not, without running
the risk of serious mistakes, adopt it as a whole
Before going ahead we should make sure that
we are on solid ground.
It is of primary importance that our whole
population be secured against destitution and
that all able-bodied persons find steady and
reasonably-paid employment. The Gpvernment knows that unemployment must be
avoided so far as possible.
Our first duty is to secure employment for
our people. The discharge of this important
duty is bound to bear fruit. Work ensures
public contentment and happiness and carries
its own reward. Work is beneficial to man.
Idleness is degrading, and work, being in
accordance with a natural law, is indispensable
for a healthy population. We must fend off
the disastrous situation in which we found
ourselves a few years ago, when the available
jobs were not numerous enough to go around.
The Government realizes the extreme importance of considering means of finding work
for our men after the war, and every province,
city, town and industry must co-operate to
this end. The State should assist individuals
only when private enterprise fails to do so.
The Government is thoroughly conversant
with this situation, and the Speech from the
Throne states, among other things, that
nothing should be neglected to insure that
after the war the men and women of our
armed forces and war industries shal find
useful and remunerative employment; that
the Ministers are already studying international agreements and domestic measures
that would assure reasonable incomes to
primary producers and general employment
at the close of hostilities.
Honourable senators, the Speech from the
Throne proposes, among other things, that we
take the necessary steps to procure employment for everyone after the war. A committee
will be set up to consider the best means of
drafting a social security programme and a
national health insurance scheme.
In connection with the war, the Speech
from the Throne states that the Government
will see to the maintenance and reinforcement
of our two overseas army corps, at the same
Hon. Mr. Du TREMBLAY.

time insuring the maintenance of various units
and formations required for the territorial and
coastal defences of Canada and ather Western
territories; that the Air Force will pursue its
triple mission; that our naval strength will be
further increased. All these measures, forecast in the Speech from the Throne, are
praiseworthy.
Honourable senators, we must contribute to
the maintenance and the improvement of our
social welfare, of our standard of living. We
must have faith in the future of democracy.
In a recent statement the Vice-President of
the United States, Mr. Wallace, speaking on
post-war plans, described the great future that
he foresaw for his country: ho told us of an
America where everyone could become a
member of the middle class and enjoy all its
prerogatives.
Mr. Wallace is also the chairman of the
Economie War Board. Here is part of his
statement:
The spirit of competition will and must continue to b one of our main driving forces.
We can have full employment in this country
without destroying private initiative, private
capital, or private enterprise.
Government can and must accept the major
responsibilities for filling in whatever gaps
business leaves. The more private enterprise
succeeds in maintaining full employnent, the
less Government spending will be required.
Individual initiative and enterprise, and Government responsibility for the general welfare,
will continue to contribute jointly towards a
better life for our people.
Mr. Wallace scoffs at those who whisper
about the collectivization of American life
and the destruction of free enterprise. We
need, he adds, the driving force of self-interest
in order to produce as much work as
possible.
Businessmen will be encouraged to do what
competition has always tended to make them
do-to reduce prices as the costs fall, to increase
the level of sales and employnient, to use profit
only as an incentive to increase production er
to lower costs.
One of the war aims of the allied democracies
would be to give everyone the advantage of
enjoying the privileges heretofore reserved for
the middle classes.
Canada is also contemplating the adoption
of a vast reconstruction programme in its
effort to attain to a fuller economic life. As
early as the beginning of 1941 a select committee of the Federal Cabinet was appointed
to study the problem of post-war reconstruction. At a later date the responsibility of
studying and recommending definite measures
was vested in a reconstruction committee,
headed by Dr. F. Cyril James, Principal of
McGill University.
Dr. James gathered
around him representatives of labour and
industry, as well as members of university

FEBRUARY 2, 1943
faculties (Dr. R. C. Wallace, Principal of
Queen's University, and Mr. E. Montpetit, of
the University of Montreal).
This committee is to co-operate with other
Government agencies. There is also a parliamentary Reconstruction Committee, made up
of members of various political parties. The
Reconstruction Committee, under the chairmanship of Dr. James, has already done a
certain amount of adivisory and research work.
Among other problems this committee deals
with matters of a purely national character.
It is concerned with employment possibilities
in Canada, conservation and utilization of our
natural resources, development of publicly
financed construction projects, rehabilitation
of agriculture ands industry, problems vitally
affecting the future prosperity of Canada,
world economic structure, fiscal and financial
policies, external trade, etc. The two main
objects of this programme seem to be the
following: first, to secure employment for all
those who are employable or who desire work,
and, second, to maintain, as far as possible,
and in the measure in which total employment will permit, the basic tradition of free
enterprise and private initiative in our political and economic life. There is no reason
to doubt that the work of this committee will
be most interesting and really constructive.
Honourable senators, we must continue to
love and cherish the privileges enjoyed under
the democratic system. The present war is
waged to safeguard freedom and democracy.
Our democratic institutions deserve to be
guarded jealously. Consequently, we must be
loyal to them and give them the opportunity
of benefiting our population to the utmost.
(Text) Honourable senators, the paramount
question which to-day interests Canadians is
the winning of the war, and we all wish the
Government to take the most effective
measures ta this end. Within the last few
months fortune has favoured our armies and
those of our Allies, and the successes achieved
sa far are of a nature to give us assurance of
ultimate victory.
The magnificent Russian offensive has filled
us with admiration for the heroic soldiers who
have so stoutly resisted the Axis forces; and
our warm sympathy goes out to the people
of Russia for the fortitude with which they
have borne the calamities of war and invasion.
They have written a page of history that will
ranýk with the glorious traditions of their
forbears.
In Africa, the armies of Britain, the United
States, and the Free French, with a certain
number of Canadians, have won victories which
fill our hearts with pride. In Asia, the forces
72542-2j

of our good neighbours the Americans have
checked the Japanese advance and assumed
the offensive. We must thank God that at
last the conquering German, Italian and
Japanese armies have been checked, and we
are confident that in the near future our
Allied forces will defeat the enemy on all
fronts.
The civil population must be so organized
as ta sustain ta the utmost the morale of our
fighting men on land and sea and in the air.
I think I can affirm that our Government
has fulfilled its promise to do its best te win
the war. The magnitude of the war effort is
shown by the great number of men who have
enlisted in the armed forces; by the many
men and women engaged in numerous war
factories in, supplying our armed forces with
the necessary weapons, munitions and mechanized equipmenit; by the farmers producing the
necessary food of all kinds ta meet the needs
of our armed forces, and those of our Allies,
and the needs of the civil population; and
also by the colossal sums of money our people
have paid in taxes and in war loans, all of
which have been aver-subscribed.
We really can say to-day that Canadians
have generously responded ta 'our Government's appeals for funds ta ensure victory.
All Canadians desire ta win this war and so
end the terrorism in the countries overrun by
the Axis powers. Our aim, and that of our
Allies, is to assure freedom and justice throughout the world.
I think we can affirm that te this date our
country has achieved the greatest effort for
the war that could be accomplished. Our
programme has been fulfilled; the war objective that we had in view bas been reached.
The programme which was planned by our
Government for the year 1942-1943 is the
greatest effort that this country could undertake, bearing in mind our means in human
and material resources.
Our plan is composed of different parts and
each of these must be balanced so that it will
not interfere with the success of any of the
other parts. If our effort is ta be practical
and effective it must be well directed and
understood. According ta my view, our first
thought must be given ta the strength and
potentialities of our human and material resources and the best way in which they can be
utilized ta give the best results.
In framing this plan we must take into
account the needs of the civil population,
labour for agriculture and industry, voluntary
enlistment for our overseas forces, and men
for our home army. Our population is about
eleven million and a half, and of course we

SENATE
must take into consideration the many old
and young people who are not capable of
heavy work. The number of persons available is therefore limited.
The Covernment must see as far as possible
that the men or women required to carry out
each part of our programme are supplied. In
other words, our resources in men and material
must be so allocated that each part of our
plan works well and brings about a well
balanced and harmonized effort.
In this plan, as you know, all the parts are
important, and if one did not function
properly the others might be paralysed. If,
for instance, we had not food or ammunition
in sufficient quantity, our armed forces would
be handicapped to the extent of the deficiency.
All these factors must be well considered
and thought out. We must act quickly, but
not too quickly.
During the present struggle there bas been
a demand for a total war effort. To many this
meant putting every able-bodied man into the
armed forces. In other words, our effort was
measured by the number of men in uniform,
and particularly by the number of men overseas. The Prime Minister, however, had
realized the world-wide nature of the struggle
long before his crities had, and from the
outset be decided on a balanced war effort.
This meant, not a restricted effort, but rather
an effective one.
Now in recent months the general public
are appreciating what a balanced effort means
and what bad results would follow if any
particular part were allowed to get out of
balance. We appreciate more and more the
wisdom of the Prime Minister and of bis
colleagues in formulating a plan that would
assure to our armed forces munitions, fuel
and food. We realize more and more perhaps
that we need men on the farms, in the war
industries, in the mines, in the forests, as well
as men in uniform.
The plan of the Government must, I repeat,
be balanced and well considered beforehand,
in order to attain its objective. The Government must always have before it this thought:
"How many men or women can we dispose
of? What war materials or food can we
depend upon?" It is only after such a review
that it can act wisely.
We need so many men and women in
different places that it is a great task for
our Government to ensure that all is well
done. It must sec to it that our armed forces
are supplied with the necessary recruits and at
the same time that they have what is required
for fighting and for sustenance. It must sec
to the transport of all these goods; it must
think also of the needs of the civil population,
1on. Mr. Du TREMBLAY.

not only of Canada, but of some of our Allies
as well. So the Government must not in some
cases be too hasty in action.
The Government must keep within the
scope of what is possible if it wishes to retain
a balancedi effort. Otherwise, its aim may be
defeated.
I believe that the Government bas accomplished a great deal up to date. Its work bas
been widespread and effective. It bas given
to our Allies all the help that this country is
capable of, and I think we as Canadians
should be proud of what has been done to
further the war.
It is vital to preserve national unity in this
country, and this should be one of our objectives. The Government in its war effort seems
to have followed a line of conduct which, on
the whole, is the most effective and profitable
for this country and our Allies, while at the
same time maintaining national unity. For
the Government knows that with national
unity Canada will accomplish its utmost for
the successful prosecution of the war.
It is results that count, and the success
obtained in every province is most gratifying.
Facts speak for themselves.
Our Active
Army to-day, overseas and in Canada, is about
400,000, with a reserve of 200,000. According
to statistics, in December last the total enlistments in the Canadian forces were 732,000.
Our Navy, up to January 1, 1943, numbered
about 49,000 men and, 500 vessels. The Royal
Canadian Air Force bas an effective strength
of more than 150,000 men; the Royal Corps of
Cadets, 96,000. About 225,000 women work
directly or indirectly in war industries. Women
.in uniform, in the three services, number
about 20,000. There are 900,000 persons engaged in war industries, and 150,000 in essential war services; so that more than one million
Canadians are engaged in this war effort,
which compares favourably with that of any
other country.
The British Commonwealth Air Training
Scherne bas been considerably expanded. It
will cost $1,500,000,000, of which Canada will
pay half.
WVar production in 1942 amounted to
$2,600,000,000, and the maximum production
for 1943 is estimated at $3,700,000,000. Equipment and material delivered amounted to
3.00000000.
Metel, food, wood etc.. were
exported to the United States to the value of
31,500,000,000.
The value of munitions and
other material exported during the war of
1914-1918 amounted to $1,002,672,413.
In 1942 Canada exported 60 per cent of its
cheese production to Great Britain and 15 per
cent of its eggs. Great Britain bas also received 75 per cent of the pork inspected in
1942.

FEBRUARY 2, 1943

On the financial side Canada bas spent
40 per cent of its economic resources. It is
estimated that for the year ending the 31st
March, 1943, Canada will have spent $4,500,000,000 instead of $3,900,000,000 as estimated.
Actually Canada spends every day $12,330,000 or $391 for each man, woman and child
in the country. During the period from 1914
to 1920 Canada spent $1,670,406,000. This included the cost of war and demobilization.
From the beginning of this war to November
30, 1942, the war cost to Canada amounted
to 4 billion 776 million dollars.
The following figures are extracted from a
pamphlet issued by Wood, Gundy & Company,
dated January 7, 1943:
The Dominion's direct debt to-day (excluding
Treasury bills) is estimated at 7 billion 200
million dollars compared to 3 billion 417 millions
at December 31, 1939, before large-scale war
borrowing began.

The average interest rate payable on direct
and guaranteed debt is approximately 2-96 per
cent, whereas it was 3-63 per cent at December

31, 1939. Eighty per cent of this debt is payable in Canada only, whereas less than 65 per
cent was so payable at December 31, 1939. The

interest charges on this debt are approximately

237 millions, or 74 millions greater than the
interest charges of 163 million dollars three
years ago.

Money has been raised at an average rate

under 2-25 per cent, whereas interest rates in
the last war were 5-25 per cent. All war loans
in the period 1914-1918 were tax-free, whereas
the interest on war loans since that date is
subject to taxation.
I have tried to show that we have reason
to be pleased with the work accomplished by
the Government, and that we have made and
are making a great effort to win this war. I
am sure that if our Government continues this
gigantic effort, this country and our Allies
should be satisfied.

13

This war is being fought to keep our freedom and to save -democracy. Our democratie
system is worth fighting for and preserving;
therefore we must be truc to it and give it
an opportunity of operating at full efficiency.
Our country will progress provided we assure
a fair and adequate profit to capital and to
labour.
Honourable senators, I believe that we
should be pleased with the policy followed
by our Government during these hard times.
The measures forecast in the Speech from
the Throne by His Excellency the Governor
General should be helpful to this country and
aid in winning the war.
We must be thankful to God that so far
we have escaped the havoc of war in our land.
We can see victory ahead, but to attain it
we must continue our great effort. There are
still clouds in the sky, but they seem to be
less dark than a year ago. We must have
confidence, and carry on-always carry on.
In difficult circumstances we must always
show confidence and a cheerful face. I know
you all remember the beautiful old verse:
The inner side of every cloud
Is bright and shining,
And so, I turn my clouds about,
And always wear them inside out
To show the silver lining.

FEBRUARY 2, 1943 .15
Ta-day the 88 dailies wbich are members af
the Canadian Press bave a circulation of
2,364,844. Wben we roalize that the latest
available figures givo the number of homes
in Canada as 2,660,000, it is sean that aven
after allowing for some duplication thora are
fewer than baîf a million homes in this country
which- da not taka either an English or a
Frenchi daily newspapor.
Thora is a grawing tendency an the part
of those wha accupy hîgh and responsible
positions in this country ta expect the Press
ta use its colums-its news columns, by the
way-ta what the appetites of the people for
important announcements which ara ta bo
made over the air; also for some which are
not sa important.
Might I emphasize that the Press is still
a mighty factor in this land, and that the
daily newspapers with their two and a haîf
millions of circulation are still the mast
powerful and important medium through
wbich the thinking and responsible people of
Canada can be reacbed. I do nat for a
moment suggest that the nowspapars of Canada are flot willing and anxious ta ca-operate
with those in authority when important
annauncements are ta ha made ta the public,
particularly during war-time. I do say, howevar, and say emphatically, that it is most
unfair ta expect the nawspapers ta build up
the audience for a network evening broadcast
and thon expeet themn ta carry the contents
of that broadcast in their columns second-hand
the following day. And make no mistake:
unloas the daily Press carried the-se announcoments which bave been previously broadcast,
tbree-quarters of their effectiveness wauld ha
lost.
Migbt I suggast that in future the Press of
this country, wbicb, bas ca-operated so wholebeartedly in connection with victary loans and
other important national ondeavours, and
which will continua ta do so, should be treated
more fairly in this respect. Is it too much ta
ask that when important news develops it ho
givon ta the Press îmmediately, and not held
back ta make possible an avenîng or Sunday
broadcast?
There is another point of significancae ta
wh.ich I should lika ta refer this evening, if
I may ho permitted, and, that is, that for the
first timo in many years a Welshman, or
rathe-r, a Welsh Canadian, bas beon appointed
ta the Canadian Sonate. I hesitate ta raf or
ta, this, because the Welsh ta-day are a most
humble people, a people about whom little is
known. Tbey put up a valiant figbt for hundreds of years against the invaders of their
country, but eventually were forced ta capit-

ulate and retire ta their hi-ls and vaileys
beyond Offa's Dykes. Here they titi their soul,
raise their sheep, and mine their coal, but,
sad ta relate, since the decay of the fiannel
industry, many of them have ta send their
sons and daughýters inta England and ta countries across the seas in, order tha-t they may
make a living.
As 1 say, I hesitate ta refer ta the Principality of Wales, for I realize that it bas littlpta da with this Hause. I recolleet, however,
that a few years aga when the banourable
senatar from Peel (Hon. Mr. Marshall) was
occupying.the position which I arn accupying
ta-day, hie did a littie mild boasting about the
part which the Scotch hacl played in the
development of this country and, of the British
Empire. Let me baston ta say that I find no
fault with what the honourable senator from
Peel said on that occasion. He only paid
tribute where tribute was due, and ho was
really more modest an tbat occasion than ho
bas been on many other occasions when I have
had the pleasure of listening ta bim on, that
saine subject, wbicb is sa diear ta bis heart.
On that occasion the honourable senator reminded this House that Scotland bad given
aur beloved Queen. ta Fngland. I might
humbly remind this Hanse that Wales gave ta
England the most enlightened and progressive
dynasty whicb it bad had up ta thýat time:
its Tudor Kings and Queens. The first of these
kings, let us nut forget, was responsible for
John Cabot sailing from Bristol on bis epochmaking vtoyage of discovery ta North America
in 1497, when hae landed at Cape Breton.
Too, we Welshmen nover forget that our
represontativo at Runnymede was Llawellyn
the Great, who, despite the fact that hoe had
marriect King John's daughter, Joan, stoad
firm with the English barons in demanding
the King's signature on Magna Charta.
1 arii sure, bonourabla senatars, you will
realize that I refar with great diffidence ta
any exploits of the Wodsh. But the Welsh
Canadians ware sa pleasad when they learned
that a Welshman had again been appointed
ta the Canadian Sonate that I hope you will
forgive me if I trespass upon your patience
for a faw minutes longer ini making ana or twa
further references ta my own people. We
have been cheered recently by the annulling of
an unjust law, wbich did -not racognize the
Welsh language in Welsb courts, despite the
fact that thora are still in Wales 75,000 people
who speak. no English, and nearly a million
who speak English, but who dlaim Welsh as
their mother tangue. I regret that I am not
one of them. The Welsh people have been
refused a Secretary of State for Wales, but

16

SENATE

they are a patient people. They have waited
long years for all reforms, and some day
perhaps again their patience will be rewarded.
I am sure I do not need to remind any
honourable senators that Wales gave to the
British Empire in its time of stress and trial
David Lloyd George, who two or three weeks
ago celebrated his 80th birthday and who, I
am sure, we all hope will be spared to enjoy
many more years of health and happiness. It
may, however, be news to some of the members of this House to learn that the wife of
John Graves Simcoe, the first Governor of
Upper Canada, was the daughter of a Welshman; and also that David Thompson, one of
our earliest explorers and a map-maker for the
Northwest Company, was the son of a Welshman named Thomas. The father adopted the
Welsh style of ap-Thomas, but the son
Anglieized it to Thomas's son.
I would net for a moment suggest that anything the Welsh have donc for this country is
in any way comparable to what bas been done
towards the development of this great
Dominion by the Scotch pioneers-ancestors
of my own, by the way, on my mother's side.
Nevertheless, there are nearly 75,000 Welsh
people in this great Dominion. They are all
good citizens and come from a country which
in the Great War of 1914-tS had a most
honourable record of men enlisted in the
crmed services, and which, according to the
Welsh newspapers I rend, bas donc equally
well in ilis war. The exact figures, which I
tried to obtain, are not avaiable. Perhaps the
strength of the Welsh Guiards and the Weish
Fusiliers is one of the secret weapons of the
war.
Turning now to the Speech fron the Throne
and leaving for a few moments the references
to the Caablanca Conference and the part
Canada is playing in the great struggle for
freedom, I an sure that the social security
program outlined in the speecht wxas welcome
news to every senator in this Hiouse. It was,
I am confident, musie to the ears of every

citizen of Canada who was associated during
the depression of 1930-1935 with relief work.
I sat for six vears as a iember of a welfare
board, and for two vears of that six I was
chairman of the board. Our task was not an
easy one. We tried to deal in as sympathetic
a manner as possible with the needs of those
unfortunate men and women who were unable to carn a litving for themselves and their
families at that tinme. We also had to think

we were spending. It was a most difficult
and, at timcs. a beart-breaking task. I hope

sincerely that never again will honest, hardworking Canadians have to cone begging for
the bare necessities of life.
I am not an economist. I cannot explain
the whys and wherefores of the depression.
I merely know that it descended upon us, and
no government seemed able to cope with it.
It was net peculiar to Canada. As a matter
of fact, in the United States the situation
was as bad as. if not worse than, in this
country. Only those of us who have known
what it is to be poor can appreciate the
humiliation and the suffering which people
had to endure in the terrible years of the
depression. For that reason I am delighted
to know that the Government of this country
is preparing a nation-wide plan to provide
against what is referred to as "the inevitable
consequence of major economie and social

hazards.

I hope that when this plan is being prepared
this House will have ample opportunity to
discuss the details of it. In a land of plenty
such as Canada there should be no difficulty
in providing for everyone; and we can do
this, honourable senators, without regimenting and dragooning our citizens into a specialized way of life which may appeal to
doctrinaires, but which, I am sure, can have
no serions appeal to the practical business
man, the thrifty labouring man or the independent tillers of the soil who are the backbone of this country. It is all very well to
talk about spending litige sums of money when
the -xar is over. but one of the first duties
of any post-war goverament will be to give
industrv a chance to recover fron the result
of the severe war taxation.
Canada is a great country, a country where
a man can be free and independent.
If he
is willing to work hard and save hard, and
lelp to build this country, he should have no
fear of the future. Canada bas been made
great by the energy and ability of those who
bhilieve that eve ry man is entitled to the
rewards of his initiative, his ingenuity and
his industry.

SENATE

We have all been greatly heartened and
encouraged by the magnificent campaign of
the British and United States forces in North
Africa, a campaign which bas almost cleared
North Africa of the enemy. North Africa
since the historie Casablanca Conference of a
week or two ago, at which Premier Churchill
and President Roosevelt laid momentous
plans, bas become for us all a symbol of
victory.
The highlight of the war, however, a very
brilliant highiight, bas been the magnificent
stand of our Russian allies against the barbarie
hordes of the Axis powers. Never before
have se many of the free peoples of the earth
owed so much to so many of the free peoples
of the Soviet Republics. The heroic stand
of the war-weary Russian people at Stalingrad
and at Leningrad is a worthy subject for an
immortal epic, which I hope will be written
after the war is over.
The year 1943 will undoubtedly be the
decisive year of the war. Battles will be
fought in which the flower of the youth of this
country will be participating with the sane
daring, the same courage, and the same resolute determination which they showed at
Dieppe. Let us hope and pray that the great
majority will come back to us.
As we enter the New Year, the sun of
victory is rising. Let those of us who remain
here at home count neo sacrifice too great in
order that as a result of the efforts of the
United Nations and particularly of our own
soldiers, sailors and airmen, the close of the
year shall find the sun of victory high in the

the world.

GENERAL'S

SPEECH

ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
consideration of His Excellency the Governor
Hon. Mr. DAVIES.

General's Speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Du Tremblay for
an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE:
Honourable
senators, my first pleasant duty is to .convey
to the mover (Hon. Mr. Du Tremblay) and
to the seconder (Hon. Mr. Davies) of the
Address my very heartiest congratulations.
They both acquitted themselves in a most
creditable manner. I could not agree, of
course, with everything they said; but in the
main their addresses were able, well delivered
and most informative.
Honourable senators, this new session of
Parliament is opening under war conditions
much more favourable than those which prevailed a year ago. Very important, indeed
brilliant, victories have been won by the
United Nations on the land, on the sea and in
the air. We can truly say that the tide of battle
bas turned in our faveur and that ultimate
victory is assured. But we must also realize
that there is a long and hard road ahead and
that great sacrifices have yet to be made
before our enemies are ultimately defeated.
Since war broke out, we on this side of the
House have only performed our duty by giving
loyal support to the Government's war measures
and other legislation brought before this
Chamber. At the saime time I want to make
it clear that we reserve our right te criticize
whiere we think criticism is fair and just, and
to offer constructive suggestions. We feel-at
least I do-that since war broke out the
Government have not kept Parliament as
fully informed as they should have done. We
are all in this war together, yet much information that could not be deemed of benefit to
the enemy in any way bas been refused
Parliament. I hope that when we hear from
my honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr.
King), of whorm we all think so highly, he will
give this Chamber much more information
than we have been in the habit of getting. In
another place and in this Chamber, during past
sessions, honourable members have listened to
the reading of long memoranda containing
generalities about the country's war effort, but
nothing that I should consider concrete and
definite. Let me make myself clearer. No
doubt, like myself, a good many other honourable senators follow the debates in the
Imperial Parliament. I have been impressed
by the number of questions that are always
asked the Government over there at the
beginning of every sitting, and the frank and
apparently complete information given by the
Ministers. I have also been cheered to read
what their wonderful Prime Minister bas said
on more than one occasion about the high

FEBRUARY 3,1943
regard he has for the House of Commons, its
rights and privileges, and its criticisms,
whether fair or unfair.
I would suggest to my honourable friend
opposite that the Government be more frank
with us-take us more into their confidence.
The other day the President of. our gallant
ally to the south, when addressing the Senate
and House of Representatives, made this remarkable statement, among others. He said,
" We have built in this country 48,000 combat
planes, anid we are building them at the rate
of 5,000 a month." Imagine what would happen
if any honourable member of this House or
of another place inquired of the Minister in
charge how many combat planes had been
built in Canada since the war broke out, or
how many it was expected would be built
during the coming year! The only response to
the question would be the subterfuge that it
was not in the public interest to give the
information.
Personally I believe that Parliament and
Government would stand stronger with the
public if more definite information were given
out. No one in Parliament has any-desire to
ask the Government for information that
could reasonably be considered secret, or
beneficial to the enemy, but surely we are
entitled to be told more than we have been
told so far.
I wish to refer to a few major problems that
are agitating our people at large, and also
Parliament. The first problem to which I
will address myself is that of man-power. I
apologize to honourable senators for speaking
on this subject now, because I had something
to say about it at the last session. I wish to
point out again that in my opinion, unless it
is changed by anything the honourable leader
of the House (Hon. Mr. King) may say, the
Government have not an accurate registration
of man-power. My reasons for that opinion
were, given at the last session. The 1940
registration was accurately done, but that is
three years old now. The census that followed
was taken very inaccurately, and the same
can be said of the registration of unemployed
between the ages of sixteen and sixty-nine. No
doubt some honourable senators opposite will
say that according to law these men are called
up in the various categories from time to
time. I do not dispute that fact, but I do say
the lists are so inaccurate, and such large
numbers of men in the various categories have
changed their addresses, that there are
thousands and thousands of men whom it is
impossible for the Government to find. What
is the remedy for that? The remedy is to take
a new census immediately. The other day I
read that this is opposed by the Minister of
Labour, who thinks the census would cost too

19

much and take too long. No expenditure
necessary for the purpose of obtaining an
accurate registration of man-power in war-time
should be considered too high. And a census
could be taken quickly.
I again urge upon the Government the
appointment of a strong man to be given
complete charge of man-power, as bas been
done by our neighbour to the south. In the
United States Mr. Paul McNutt has complete
charge of man-power and is vested with extraordinary authority. I never met Mr. Little,
who resigned some time ago as Director of
National Selective Service in Canada, but I
have read the correspondence that passed
between him and the Minister, and also his
views in regard to man-power. He impressed
me as being a very strong and able man, the
right man in the right place. From what I
could gather he was asking only for the powers
of a deputy minister under the Minister of
Labour. I regret that Mr. Little is no longer
holding office.
The next subject that I wish to bring before
this Chamber is the greatest war menace,
which, as we all know, is the U-boat. Ship
sinkings are very serious. This menace will
be overcome, but, as the experts say, in only
two ways: first, by increasing the patrol, which
will necessitate more naval vessels; and,
secondly, by the construction and putting into
service of more cargo boats. Honourable
senators have often heard me speak about
cargo boats. I do not think that anyone in
this House knows how many of these vessels
have been built in Canada since war broke
out, and how many have been put into commission. It is interesting to note-if I may
refer to Washington again-that the President
announced, that eight million tons of shipping
had been built in the United States since war
began, and the objective is another eight
million tons, or sixteen millions in all.- That
is a further instance of the kind of cheering
information given out in Washington. It
certainly could not be said for one moment
that it is net in the public interest to tell
the people about these things. I understand
there is or was an order in this country for
125 Liberty ships, of ten thousand tons dead
weight each, for the United States. Why not
tell us how many of these ships have been
delivered to our neighbour and put into commission? Why not tell us how many ships
have been built here for England? Why not
tell us how many have been built for Canada,
and how many more the Government expect
will be built this year?
The genial countenance of my old friend the
honourable senator from Lunenburg (Hon. Mr.
Duiff) recalls many memories of another place

SENATE
at the time of the last war. He has a great deal
of experience and knowledge with regard to
ships; so it was only natural that when I was
Minister of Marine he launched at me a great
many questions. I always endeavoured to
give him honest and prompt replies. If he
had asked me how many ships were built and
I had told him it was not in the public
interest to give that information-well, the
great blizzard that struck these parts a few
weeks ago was nothing compared with the
cyclone that would have struck the House
of Commons in those days.
Hon. Mr. DUFF:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
As to naval
vessels, time and time again in this House,
before war began and since, I have urged the
Government to adopt the Jellicoe minimum
plan and build three cruisers. Our naval
forces have been greatly increased, and I congratulate the Governrent on that. We are
all proud of the splendid record of our destroyers, corvettes and mine-sweepers in this
war. But why should we net build cruisers
with four-inch and six-inch gens, and, if at al]
possible, eight-inch guns? We certainly need
such ships for escort work.
I come now to our overseas forces. Canada
bas every right to be proud of the large number of men who have so promptly enlisted
for overseas service. We have, I am sure, a
most efficient and well-equipped body of
troops in England. No doubt they will be
getting into action this year and. much to
our regret, we must expect very heavy casualtics. Naturally net only the mothers and
fathers and wives of our men overseas, but
also Canadians
generally are wondering
whether sufficient reinforcements*are at hand.
The Minister of Defence, quite properly, had
no hesitation in stating the strength of the
Canadian corps in England. Very often the
people of this country have but a vague idea
of the strength of an army corps in terms
of fighting men. For instance, we are told
that 600,000 men have joined our arned forces.
Truc, 600,000 men have enlisted, but that
includes also enlistnents in our naval and
air forces. In addition there are ancillary
troops over there, such as the forestry and
medical branches, and so on. After allowance is made for these non-combatant troops,
the number of men who will actually take
the field when that great day comes will be
between 80,000 and 90,000. To quote the
Minister, it means three infantry divisions,
two mechanized divisions and a tank brigade.
Now, if it is net against the public interest
for the Minister to say how many troops we
have overseas, why does hc say it is not in
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

the public interest that he should tell Parliament the number of our reserves in England?
I know of no reason in the world for refusing
Pariiament the information. I know that
when the honourable leader opposite rises we
shall hear the usual story: "A steady stream
of reinforcements are going over from time
to time, according to the shipping available."
There is a good deal of truth in that statement; but we have been at war for three
years and there has been ample time to have
the necessary reinforcements overseas, and I
hope that when he rises Pe will tell us whether
we have 10,000, 20,000 or 50,000 men overseas
as reinforcements-not here, but actually in
England.
I should like to say a word about the army
in Canada. Honourable members will please
understand that I do nôt pose as a military
man at all, though I have had some military
experience. We have asked over and over
again, "What is the strength of the army in
Canada?" No answer. We have asked over
and over again, "How many men in Canada
have signed on for overseas, and how many
have stated that they are willing to serve
only in Canada?" Again, no reply. I think
we ougbt to bc told the size of our army
in Canada, the number of enlistments for
overseas, and the number of enlistments for
service in Canada alone. I realize we must
have a sufficient armed force on both coasts
for defence, but I should like to know how
many of the thousands of men who have
signified their intention to serve in Canada
only are serving in the interior of Canada
at great expense to the taxpayers. If those
men are net willing to serve in other theatres
of war, then. since we are so short of manpower, I would let them out of the army,
subject to call, and put them into war industries, or other industries, or on the farm.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: It may be the
honourable leader will give us tat
information. I hope so.
Coming to another subject, I do net know
whether honourable senators have seen tie
January number of Industrial Canada. It contains, I understand, the most accurate count
to date of Government-owned companies,
controllers, boards and interlocking boards.
Before I proceed further on this subject I
want it clearly understood that I am not
criticizing Hon. Mr. Howe, the very efficient
and capable Minister of Munitions and Supply. I do feel, however, that he is a much
overburdened Minister, and notwithstanding
the assistance e bas in the way of deputies
and other officials, I do not think it is possible

FEBRUARY 3, 1943
for birn to keep in toucb not only wîth twentyseven wbolly owned Government companies,
but also with controllers and otber organizations. 1 wish also te pay my tributs te the
many abls business executives, chartered accountants and others who as dollar-a-year men
are rendering sucli abls service in our war
effort. There is a rising tide of public opinion
that Vhs Government have dehsgated too mnuch
authority to these Govsrnment-owned. companies and controhlers that I have just mentionsd. No doulit honourable members on
the other side will say, "Oh, but bear in mind
tbat all these controllers and Governmentowned cornpaniss are responsible to a Minister of the Crown." But, I ask, how is it
humanly possible for a Minister, no matter
how capable, to keep even rernote control
over se many activities? No wonder thers is,
as 1 have said, a rising tide of public opinion
critical of what is regarded as too much bureaucratie rule and not enough goveramental
supervision.
1 was pheased Vo note in the Speech from
Vhs Throne that the Govsrnment have under
consideration the appointment of under-secretaries. I hope speedy action wihh lie taken
along that uine. because at least five members
of the Cabinet bave far too much to do. 1
refer to tbe Minister of Finance, the Minister
of Def ence. the Minister of Defence for Air, the
Minister of Defence for Naval Affairs, and tbe
Minister of Munitions and Supply. The
appointment of under-secretaries sbouhd bring
welcome relief to tbose very busy Ministers.
A matter in wbicb we are ail interested,
because it touches oiîr pocket-books, is the
Rumi plan of colhecting income tax. I am
giad te note in tbe Speech from the Tbrone
that the Government are giving this plan consideration. I had the pleasurs and privilege
about two weeks ago of attending a meeting
of the Canadian Club in Vhis city and bearing
Mr. Rumi explain bis proposal. 1 was mucli
impressed by bis speech, and I bave no hesitation ini saying tbat 1 am heartily in faveur of
bis plan. Thousands of our taxpayers are in
desperate straits in meeting their obligations
respecting incorne Vax. No doubt, shouhd the
Governrnent make Vhs change, it wouhd apply
te 1943 income. Besides affording muchnseded relief, it would, P believe, result in the
collection of more revenue in the long run.
As late as yesterday 1 heard a chartered
accountant in Ottawa cite the case of a man
who in 1942 was earning $15,000, but whose
incorne Vhis year wihh drop te $5,000. Unless a
chneis made in the system of income Vax
collection, bis 1943 income tax wihl lie based
on an income he ne longer enjoys.

In regard to social servi-ce and other matters
mentioned in the Speech from the Throne, I
shall reserve comment until the legisiation
reaches this House. We are ail in. favour of
everything tha-t can lie done for the health of
the people, and also for their social betterment. Jjoubtless some honourable senators
have heard of a convention beld at Winnipeg
recently, and if they will take the trouble
to look up the views on social service of those
who gathered there, they will be encouraged
to make progress along similar lines.
In conclusion, honourable senators, I have
only to add that we are ail in this war for
victory. That is the goal we ail want to reacli.
We will support the Governrnent Vo that end.
But give us your confidence-give us the
information that 1 have asked for.
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators, I
desire to extend a hearty welenme to the new
members of this Chamber. 1I had an opportunity hast week of welcorning lis Hýonour the
Speaker.
Lust evening the honourable senator from
Repentigny (Hon. Mr. Du Tremblay) and the
honourable senator frorn Kingston (Hon. Mr.
Davies) moved and seconded the Address in
rephy Vo the Speech from the Throne. Both
gentlemen are well and favourably known. in
their respective communities, wbere their views
are read in the daily press which they se ably
edit. In fact they are known to a much wider
public, as their writings are frequently quoted
by Canadian newspapers. We are indebted Vo
Vhem for the excellent speeches Vhey delivered
yesterday. We have every reason to expect
tVbat this Chamber wilh be greathy benefited by
their ripe experience and broad knowledge in
dealing with various matters that wilh corne
bel ore us frorn time Vo time.
I would also extend to Vhe honourable mernber frorn St. Catharines (Hon. Mr. Bench) a
hearty welcorne. I arn informed that he is tbe
y-oungest member of the Senate. Though
young in years, he cornes to us as a man. of
mature judgment, bis ýcounsel and advice being
souglit and accepted not only by laymen, but
also by members of 'his profession.
The honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne) bas made sorne criticism of Governrent .policy, and tbat is to lie expected. He
is erninently qualified to offer criticism and
advice Vo the Administration. He was a mernber of Vhe Cabinet during the last war, and
undoubtedly lie is farnihiar witb the strain and
worry to which. members of tbe Government
are -subjected in war-time, and 1 tbink it is
largely because lie realizes the difficulties
encountered by those charged with the grave
responsibility of directing national affairs in
these critical days that he has heen rnild and
fair in bis criticism.

22

SENATE

He has suggested that the Government has
been disinclined to furnish information. Well,
is that quite true so far as members of Parliament are concerned'? Only yesterday I
tabled all the Orders in Council that have
been passed since the last session, and they
are at the disposal of honourable members.
The Government also publishes from time to
time a journal, copies of which are sent to
members of this House and of the House of
Commons. This issue, dated November 26,
1942, sets forth Canadian war orders and
regulations. These booklets contain a great
deal of information, and anyone who would
give enough time to reading andi digesting
them would have considerable knowledge of
what is going on. In addition, the Government has set up bureaux which supply information to the members of the House of Commons and of the Senate. At one time, when
those offices were sending out reams of paper
advising as to contracts, setting forth prices,
and so on, I thought the practice was rather
wasteful. There is, further, a committee of
the House of Commons which sits not only
during the sessions of Parliament but also in
the intervals between sessions, and makes a
complete and, exhaustive investigation of expenditures and such matters, and it sends out
sub-committees ta investigate the various war
industries throughout the country.
We all know that every time we are travelling up or down in elevators we see notices
advising us to be cautious in our talk. In
England also the public is advised not to talk
on war matters. It was only last year that
in the city of Boston it was found necessary
to form clubs of restaurant-keepers and, others
who come into contact with the public, to
report cases of persons who were talking too
freely and might possibly be disclosing information that should not be made public. It
is the desire of the Government to prevent
careless talk.
I do not agree with my honourable friend
that information has not been made available
to Parliament. Last year Mr. Howe, the
Minister of Munitions and Supply, gave full
information in regard to shipbuilding and the
construction of guns, tanks and other equipment. Similar information has been made
available to Parliament within the last few
days.
I should like now ta refer to the question
of maný-power. There is perhaps no problem
more difficult for a Government to deal with
in a free and democratic country. We are a
free people, not subject to regimentation.
When this war broke out we had made little
or no preparation for war. The Government
tried to meet that situation. If there had
Hon. Mr. RING.

been someone with supernatural powers, or some
group with sufficient knowledge to plan and
say where people should be placed, it is probable that no mistakes would have been made.
But such things are not humanly possible.
Consequently, in this as in every other country some mistakes have occurred and there
has been much grief with regard to the distribution of manpower. Two years ago the cry
was raised that every man should go into the
Ariy ; that farmers' sons were being favoured;
that we were not raising men for the armed forces
rapidly enough; that the Army, Navy and Air
Force should be strengthened and that the question of men on farms and in industry should be
a secondary consideration. But what do we find
to-day? We find that there has been a great
shortage of labour on our farms and in our
mines, especially the coal-mines, with the
result that last year the farmers hadi great
difficulty in harvesting their crops, and during
the present winter people are having dlifficulty
in keeping warm in their homes. But is that
situation peculiar to Canada? Does it not
exist also in the United States and in Great
Britain? Is it not truc that even in countries
where regimentation is the rule the same conditions prevail, and men have to be moved
from the armed forces back to the farms, the
factories and the mines? Such a condition
can hardly be avoided in any country.
A reference has been made to Mr. Little. I
am not going to become involved in any controversy in that regard,. He was employed
by the Government and came here as a
Director. He has presented his own case, it
is before the public, and he will be judged
by the public.
My honourable friend has spoken of the
dangers of bureaucracy, and at the Winnipeg
Convention the gentleman selected to lead
the Progressive Conservative party expressed
the fear that a bureaucracy was growing up
in this country. If all the proposals contained
in Mr. Little's memorandum to the Prime
Minister had been accepted and one man had
been allowed to build up his control, there
might have been something in the nature of
a bureaucracy. But it cannot be said that
the Civil Service of this country has become
bureaucratie, and it is only when the men in
the permanent Civil Service take it upon
themselves ta suggest and dictate Government
policy that you have a bureaucracy. I spent
some nine years in the Government of Canada,
and during that time had an opportunity of
getting to know our Civil Service. I found
the civil servants of Canada to be a very
able body of men. I found also that when
there was a change of goveronent those men,

irrespective of what their politics may have

23

FEBRUARY 3, 1943
been, swung in behind their Ministers and
the Government, acceptéd the policies of the
Government, and did all in their power to
make those policies successful. The Civil
Service of this cduntry has worked hard and
long, as have also the men who of their own
volition and from a desire to serve have come
to Ottawa to offer their services. Many of
these men held high and responsible positions
in the financial and industrial life of the
country, and their advice and assistance have
been gladly accepted. I think that anyone
who reviews the situation since 1939 and considers the change-over in oùr financial and
industrial life will agree that Canada may
well be proud of what has been done by her
professional men and scientists. There may
be some among them-there are almost sure
to be a few-who upon being made controllers
would assume more authority than they were
intended to have. But all these appointments
are made under Order in Council, and the
authority is controlled. This is plain to be
seen by anyone who cares to familiarize himself witb those Orders in Council. If it is
thought that an official has exceeded his
authority-and there have been examples,
such as the case in Ontario in which a magistrate so found in regard to certain orders
made by the officials of the Wartime Prices
and Trade Board-the matter can be referred
to the Supreme Court. In the case I refer
to, the Court upheld the validity of the Order
in Council and the order made by the official.
My honourable friend spoke of certain information that should be supplied now. He
mentioned shipbuilding for example. In 1941
Canadian shipyards built 85 corvettes and 9
mine-sweepers. In 1942 they built 74 ships
for the Navy. This was a decrease of 11, but
in that year many of the largest shipyards
were devoting their attention to the building
of cargo ships.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: If my honourable friend will allow me, I would say that
I was speaking of cargo ships.
Hon. Mr. KING: In that year over 80
ten-thousand-ton cargo ships were built.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: And put into
commission?
Hon. Mr. KING: The information I have
is that every three days Canadian shipyards
built a ship ready to sail-a record that bas
not been surpassed even in Great Britain.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: My honourable
friend surely does not mean that within three
days of the laying of the keel of a tenthousand-ton ship she was ready to go to
sea.

Hon. Mr. KING: That is what is happening.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Henry Kaiser,
that wonderful man in the United States,
takes six days to build a ship.
Hon. Mr. KING: That is what is happening, and it can be confirmed: a ship every
three days. •I do not mean that a ship is
being built in three days, but ships are going
to sea from Canadian yards at the rate of
one every three days. This is no mean accomplishment for a country that was not
building ships before the war.
My honourable friend has asked why there
should not be some information given as to
the number of ships that are being built for
the Government of the United States and the
Government of Great Britain. I may tell my
honourable friend that I asked the Minister
that very question, and the Minister said that,
according to the request of the governments
of the two countries, he could not divulge that
information. That is a fair answer.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I do not want
to interrupt too often. I know the Minister
gave that answer, but the Deputy Minister
gave the full information.
Hon. Mr. KING: He may have done so.
If he did, he went outside his field; and if my
honourable friend has full information I do
not think he has any cause to complain. I
asked for that information and was told that
the governments of Great Britain and the
United States did not want it disclosed. One
can well understand why that would be so.
As to the armed forces, I think we can find
some information for my honourable friend.
Such information was given very fully by
Colonel Ralston in the House of Commons
last year, and similar information is available
now,
Hon. Mr. McRAE: May I ask a question?
Hon. Mr. KING:

Certainly.

Hon. Mr. McRAE: I endeavoured to follow
the Minister's statement in the House last
year and was unable to find definite information anywhere as to the number of reinforcements we had overseas. Figures were given as
to the forces we had there, and, as you may
remember, I attempted late in the session, by
the process of deduction, to arrive at the
number of reinforcements. The figure I
reached was approximately 12,000, but there is
no assurance that it is anywhere near the
mark. I think you will find that in the information given in another place last session
there was no definite statement as to
reinforcements.

24

SENATE

Hon. Mr. KING: If I remember rightly,
Colonel Ralston gave the number of our troops
and auxiliary forces overseas. He also indicated tbat we had a division here being
trained to go overseas, that an armoured
division would. go over, and that the present
strength of the overseas army would be
maintained. I think it is being maintained
as far as humanly possible. We know that
to-day the movement of troops overseas is
difficult. With American troops moving as
they are, not only over the Pacifie, but also
over the Atlantic and 'to the African coast,
accommodation for the movement of our
soldiers is limited. When one considers the
munitions and other supplies that have to be
transported to seats of war, one realizes something of the tremendous task it is to send
armed forces abroad. Every now and then
we bear of another contingent of Canadians
arriving in the Old Country. That news is,
of course, withheld until the contingent arrives.
The Speech from the Throne says that our
army overseas will be maintained and reinforced, and no doubt the Ministers will confirm this in the other House. I think my
honourable friend can rest assured that reinforcements are being trained in Canada and
will be sent overseas as need arises.
The honourable leader opposite suggested
that in the interior of the country there are
a lot of troops who could be temporarily
discharged from the Army in order to relieve
the labour shortage in various industries and
on the farm. As to that, I am not in a
position to judge; the matter is one that
must come within the purview of the military
authorities. We know that a large number of
troops are assembled on our eastern coast,
that many others are in Newfoundland and
in the Pacifie area. We have troops co-operating witb American troops in Alaska and in
British Columbia for the defence of our
Pacifie coast. In the course of thicr training
our men are transferred from place to place.
many of them going to Camp Borden and
Petawawa, for instance, then to the coast and
overseas. I tbink honourable members may
rest assured :that the Government is fully
conscious of the necessity of maintaining our
troops in the Old Country at full strength,
and that in Canada we have trainedi troops
that may be moved to seats of war when
required.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Will the honourable gentleman allow me?
Hon. Mr. KING: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: From time to time I
notice that in certain military districts there
is a call-out of single men of nineteen or
H.n.

twenty to forty years, and in certain other
districts married men' from twenty to twentyfive are called out. I should like to know how
the basis for calling out is arrived at. Certain
sections of the country, wliere there were a
large number of volunteers, have naturally
run short of single men. and now married men
are being called out in those sections. but
net in others. What is the basis of the policy
of calling men out?
Hon. Mr. KING: I am not sure that I
understand my honourable friend. I think be
has indicated that there is a variation in the
call-out in various districts.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes.
Hon. Mr. KING: With that I am net
familiar. I will try to obtain that information within the next day or two.
I do not wish to delay the House longer in
replying to the very proper question of my
honourable friend from Vancouver (Hon. Mr.
McRae).
As to information, I think that all of us who
require facts properly available to members
of Parliament mav obtain them. It is true
that in Great Britain a number of secret
sessions have been held, but it must be
remembered tiat over there they are very
near the seat of war. I did not think that in
Great Britain the Ministers give information
more fully or more freely than our Ministers
here do: but my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne) states to the contrary, and I
must take his word.
The Speech of His Excellency refers to
certain phases of this war, which is now in
its fourth year, and portrays the Government's policies and intentions. On these, Parliament will be asked to deliberate and, if
they are acceptable, to confirm them.
I am not sure the people of Canada fully
realize the important part this country has
played in the war. When we adjourned last
August, although we lad bad some successes,
the British having taken Madagascar, there
was a feeling, not only in Canada, but in the
United States and Great Britain as well, that
co-ordination among the Allies was lacking,
and people were calling for a joint command.
Governments were criticized for inactivity. We
had had reverses in Africa. Rommel had
driven us out of Libya back into Egypt,
and had come within striking distance of the
great naval base at Alexandria and of the
Suez Canal. The Russian army was being
thrown back well into the Caucasus. Leningrad
was surrounded and besieged; Stalingrad was
under siege, with Hitler proclaiming that he
would take that great city soon. In Great
Britain crowds paraded through the streets and

SENATE

The Speech from the Throne directs our
attention to the subject of social security, and
the Government purposes recommending the
early appointment of a select committee of
the House of Commons to make an exhaustive study of what further measures may be
necessary to develop a national plan. I am
inclined to think that this Chamber might
very well set up a special committee to consider what is necessary to be done in this
regard.
It will be recalled that at the first meeting
of Prime Minister Churchill and President
Roosevelt they laid down certain cardinal
principles in what is now known as the Atlantic
Charter. I desire permission to place this
charter on Hansard, for convenience of reference, since the principles therein set forth
were declared to the world, and doubtless
they will be the governing principles at the
peace table. These are the eight points of the
Atlantic Charter:
1. Their countries
(British Empire and
United States) to seek no aggrandizement, territorial or other.
2. They desire to see no territorial changes
that do not accord with the freely expressed
wishes of the peoples concerned.
3. They respect the right of all peoples to
choose the form of government under which
they will live; and they wish to see sovereigu
rights

and

self -government

restored to

those

who have been forcibly deprived of thein.
4. They will endeavour, with due respect for
their existing obligations, to further the enjoyment by all States, great or small, victorious
or vanquished, of access, on equal terms, to the
trade and to the raw materials of the world.
which are needed for their economic prosperity.
5. They desire to bring about the fullest
collaboration between all nations in the econoic
field with the object of securing for all improved
labour standards, economie advancenient and
social security.
6. After the final destruction of the Nazi
tyranny, they hope to ses established a peace
w'hich will afford all nations the means of
dwelling in safety within their own boundaries
and which will afford the assurance that all
the men in all lands may live out their lives
in freedom from fear and want.
7. Such a peace should enable all men to
traverse the high seas and oceans without
hindranec.
8. They believe that all the nations of the
world, for realistie as wel! as spiritual reasons.
must corne to the abandonment of the use of
force. Since no future peace cau be nmaintained
if land. sea or air arnament continue to bc
employed by nations which threaten, or nay
threaten, aggression outside their frontiers, they
believe, pending the establishment of a wider
and permanent system of general security, that
disarmament of such nations is essential. They
will likewise aid and encourage all other praeticable measures which will lighten for peaceloving peoples tc crushing burdens of arinaient.

improved labour standards. economic advancement and social securitv." That is international in its scope. In the Speech from the
Throne the reference. of course, is to social
security within our own country and to what

migtt be donc to improve that condition.
Wbile on the subject of the Atlantic Charter
I should like te quote a short statement by
the Vice-President of the United States. Mr.
Wallace. He is one of the advanced students
along this line in his country, and his views
will, I think, be of interest 'to honourable
senators. Ie is reported to have made these
suggestions:
For the international unity that is a requisite
of peace, the United Nations w ill need:
1, machinery to keep aggressor nations disarmed; 2, machinery to prevent economic
warfare; 3, probably an international court to
settle disputes; 4, a world conncil, se that
whatever world system evolves w ill have enough
flexibility to meet changing cireumstances as
they arise.
To achieve international liberty, regional
problems should be left in regional hands. The
aim would be the maximum of home rule that
ean be maintained along with the minimum of
centralized authority that mnust come into existence to give the necessary protection.
That is, each state in dealing with domestie
problems niust not be so nationalistic as to
ignore the interests of other countries.
I quote again:
The United Nations trust back up military
disarmaiment with psychological disarmnamentsupervision, or at least inspection, of the seool
systems of Germany and Japan.
We know what las happened in those cotintries during tte last ten or fifteen vears. Their
young people have been instilled with doctrines of hatred and of racial superiority which
profess to justify the most brutal trea-tment
of so-called inferior peoples.
To continue:
The first concern of each nation must be the
well-being of its own people. That is as true
of the United States as of any other nation.
Maintenance of full employment and the highest
possible level of national incomte should be the
joint responsibility of private business and of
governument. When the war is over. the more
quickly private enterprise gets back into peacetime production and sells its goods to peacetinte markets here and abroad, the more quickly
will the level of government wartime expenditurcs be reduced.
That fairly well confirms what my honourable friend from Kingston (lion. Mr. Davies)
said las night about employment in Canada.
There should be no idle men in this Dominion.
Thtere are great opportunities here for young
men w-ho desire to play their part in the
development of our vast resources. Young

sion requirement will be increased very materially by the necessity of making provision
for men wounded and disabled in the present
war.
The Veterans' Allowance Act was passed
in 1930. It provides allowances for those who
did not sustain disabilities from wounds or
illness, but who were found in later years
to have broken down in health because of the
nature of their service. They were not pensionable under our pension legislation. In
1941, under the Veterans' Allowance Act the
Dominion paid out $8,903,654.
Then we have the Civil Service Superannuation Act, under which civil servants pay
into a fund, along with the Government, in
order that on their retirement from the Service
they may have a fair degree of financial security. In 1941 the Dominion paid into this
fund $2,836,587.
In the same year the Dominion Government contributed to the various provinces
in support of pensions for the blind to the
amount of $1,067,239.
It will be noted that these varions pension
schemes cost the Dominion Government in
1941 a total of $85,034,110. It may be said
that the veterans' pensions should not be
included in the total. With that I agree.
However, veterans' pensions are part of the
cost to every nation that goes to war; and
in this connection I would say that the provisions of Canada's pension laws are as liberal
as, if not more liberal than, those of most
other countries.
Unemployment insurance is carried on under
a Dominion statute. Large sums of money
are being collected from employees and employers, and these moneys are supplemented
by Government grants to build up a huge
fund against the time when unemployed persons are in need through no fault of their
own.
Most of the provinces of Canada have

men of ambition will not be content to stay
in the cities; the bright lights will have no
attraction for them.
In directing our attention to social security,
I think, it would be well to review our social
legislation, both Dominion and provincial,
which will be found impressive both in content
and volume. As of course honourable senators
are aware, our divided Dominion and provincial jurisdictions make'approach to these matters more difficult than in England. There
the whole country knows but one legislative
authority. Under our Constitution we have
joint control exercised by the Dominion and
the provinces in their several fields, as set out
in the British North.America Act. The much
heralded Beveridge report and findings on
social conditions in Great Britain would
scarcely be applicable to Canada, on account
of this divided control. But in spite of these
difficulties we have made substantial progress.
In the Dominion field Government annuities are available to Canadians of moderate
means who make small payments over a
period of years.
In 1926, when Minister of Labour, I was
asked to prepare an old age pension Bill. I
did so, and it passed through the House of
Commons; but this Chamber did not see fit
to accept the Bill, and therefore rejected it.
However a similar Bill was enacted in 19217.
The original measure provided that the
Dominion Government should contribute 50
per cent of pensions to the aged of any
province that cared to adopt the legislation.
By an amendment passed in 1934 the Dominion assumed 75 per cent of the cost,- and
under the provisions of the Act the Dominion
in 1941 contributed a total of $29,611,796. The
provinces contributed the remaining 25 per
cent, amounting to $9,870,599.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Has the Government

Hon. Mr. HIAIG: Before the honourable
senator leaves that subjeet, may I ask another
question?
Hon. Mr. KING:

Certainly.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I have heard personaily,
and I notice by the records of the other
House,'
that it is the intention to appoint a committee to go into the whole question of social
service.
Would the honourable gentleman
recommend to the Gov-ernment that this
Huse be represented on that committee? I
think that is of great importance under present
conditions. I wonder wbat the honourable
gentieman's personal views are. 1 am flot
trying to tic him down, but if there is nlot a
Goveroment, policy, I should like to have bis
opinion on this.
Hon. Mr. KING: I bave already taken the
opportunity to throw out the suggestion that
we might have a committee of our own to
study these questions. I should be glad to
consuit with the members of the Goveromenýt
and sec if w-e could join with the committee
of the Commons and carry on our inquiries
together. There is one thing, however, to be
borne in mind. I bave here a memnorandum
prepared in the time of Sir Robert Borden, the
effeet of which is that it was found that joint
committees of the House of Commons and the
Senate did nlot seemn to get on very well and
wcre flot very satisfactory. I should be glad,
however, to consider my honourable friend's
prop'osai and bring it to the attention of the
Government. I tbink there is an opportunity
there, and that we as senators sbould give
careful thougbt and study to this problem,
which will be placed before us very shortly.
Ail these figures 1 have given seem to be
large, but I do not; think that any public man,
or any man of influence wbo is flot in public
life. would cal-e to suggest for one moment
that we discontinue these services. One thing
wbich may be said about tbemn witb perfect
HIon. Mr. KING.

trutb is that there is no economie loss to the
people of Canada or to any Government in
Canada througb the giving of these services.
In the past these services were provided by
individuai effort or in some other independent
way; but tbe fact that we have these moncys
for such purposes bas donc mauch to make life
botter and happier for many of our people.
Take nid age pensions for instance.
In
days gono by, mon or womnen who had to
depend on their families at a certain age were
pusbed more and more into the background,
and their situation was a most unbappy one.
The fact that two nid persons to-day may be
eligible for a pension of $40 a month bas done
mucb to remove the fear of oId age and to
enable our people to enjoy life more fully.
i am pleased to note that the Speech from
the Throne refers to the establishment of a
national systern of beaith insurance in Canada.
I think that wbat the Government bas in mimd
is a fund to ho built up by contributions from
the individual, from employers and from the
Govcrnment. In many countries sncb a system
is in effeet to-day; and it woîild probabiy
provide a sound basis on wbich to build a
healtb insurance plan.
I migbt speak of my own experience as a
medtical man in British Columbia.
I went
into that country during the construction of
the Crowsnest Railway. Many mon were engaged in that work, but thero were scarcely
any hospital facilities.
It was the responsibiiity of the company employing them ta
find surgeons or physicians ta look after them,
and a system grew up-what was known as
"contract practico"ý-undier wbicb a deduction
was made from the empînycos' wages. That
system worked, very successfully, and the
people in the community, numbering some
thousands, received good medical andi bospital
care at very little cost to tbemselves.
1 am giad to know that the medical fraternity tbroughout Canada bave been in conference with the officers of the department and
that the oxecutives of tbe Medical Association, who met in Ottawa only a few days ago,
indicatedý tbat they would be favourable ta
the scheme if the Govornment would provide
that thoro sbould be no lowering of the standards of the profession. I do not think the
panel systemn should ho adopted in Canada.
We have not sufficient population. I think
it is the hope of the medical profession that
some sehemne may be worked out wbereby the
individual will ho assessed, bis payments to
go into a fund supported byr the federal and
provincial governmonts. Under such a seheme

should be assured a good living, if he deserves
it, as fortunately most of our people do. Our
young men who return to us after the war
are entitled to the assurance that in this
country they shall have an opportunity to
make a good and honest living, with sufficient
income to maintain themselves and their
families in health and happiness. Indeed,
every Canadian, whether he serves in the
armed forces or not, should have that
assurance.
But there is a limitation. As the honourable
senator from Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies) said
last night, all men are not born equal either as
to their mental or their physical equipment.
A sub-normal or deformed person is incapable
of gainful occupation and should be well taken
care of by the State. The normal person must
earn his or her own living. There should be
no place in any scheme of social service for
the sluggard who will not earn his bread. The
man who works should be assured of a good
living wage; but he who refuses to work should
not be maintained by the State. Take away
the spur of individual effort, and you take
away all energy, initiative, invention. But
fortunately no legislation can kill the incentive
to individual effort; it is innate in most people.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon Mr. BLACK: I would go as far as
anybody in assuring to every worthy Canadian
health and strength, and equal opportunity and
happiness, to such a degree as is humanly possible. I do not think anyone could be asked
to do more.
Trades unions have been instrumental in
improving working conditions. I believe in
trades unions because they have opened our
eyes to the injustices of the industrial world,
as I think will be generally admitted. I do
not know whether trades unions have always
followed the wisest course on any given occasion. But it must be conceded that this must
be left to their own judkment. I suspect they
have worked along the lines of least resistance
in order to get where they are to-day. It has
always been a question in my mind whetlier
the minimum wage is a fair basis of remuneration. For the average worker there should
be a minimum wage high enough to assure
him a good living. But unfortunately a
minimum wage penalizes the skilled and! industrious workman. I am well aware that the
unions do not follow the principle absolutely.
I think this holds good, that, taking for instance a minimum wage of 50 cents an hour.
you will find in one group many men who
do not earn it, while in the same group there
are men who are worth 70 or 80 cents an hour.
In othei- words, the inèfficient worker shares

31

the advantage of the better worker's additional skill. It seems to me that a minimum wage
should be on a sliding scale, so that the man
who doeà eight hours' real productive labour
should reap the fruits of his industry, as compared with the man who stays on the job eight
hours and does perhaps only two or three
hours' real work. I should like to see those
inequalities straightened out by the labour
unions, for I am with them every time, and- I
believe a move in this direction would be
worth while:
I do not like the term "social service
scheme," but I believe all well-thinking men
in this or any other country will subscribe to
any plan for the creation of a post-war world
in which every person will get what he deserves. If the Government introduces legislation along this line, I am confident that those
of us on this side will go hand in hand with
honovurable members opposite in working out
a practical scheme.
With regard to medical treatment for all
the community, I wish I had some suggestions
to make, but I am not sufficiently familiar
with the subject to do so. We must leave it
to honourable senators who are memibers of
the medical profession and to those who have
studied the subject to evolve a workable plan
to provide medical treatment and hospitalization for persons who are unable to pay for
such services. Though these services would
be free, it does not follow that doctors and
nurses should be expected to work for nothing.
They perform a national service in safeguarding the health and strength of our people,
and should receive adequate remuneration.
Any scheme of medical treatment and hospitalization should be broad enough to cover
the whole community and to meet the needs
of any patient. After that is provided for,
if a patient is able to pay for special accommodation and special treatment, he should do
so. In other words, those who are prepared
to pay for the frills, or whatever the extras
may be termed, should pay according to their
ability.
I look forward to a committee of this House
or a joint committee of both Houses considering these questions, and I hope that when we
come to discuss its report we shall arrive at
conclusions which will be a credit to ourselves
and, above all, a benefit to every citizen of
Canada.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable senatorsSome Hon. SENATORS: Order!
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I thought my honour,able friend had concluded his remarks.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. BLACK: That is an intimation
that I ought to stop. I sball be through in a
moment. I did not prepare any speech. A
gentleman whom we all know came to me
and said, '"Will you speak?" He is the boss.
Wbat was I to do? I had to get up and
say something.
To sum up, I disagreo with honourable
members opposite and their party on certain
policies, but I agree with them on other
policies. I commend everything the Government has done towards the effective prosecution of the war. It is a war to the death. We
in Canada did not realize that at the start,
but we know now that defeat means slavery,
and slavery is death to the individual, to the
community and to the nation. It is. I repeat,
a war to the death. But we are all confident
that we shall not lose the war. True. the
outlook was not as rosy ton months ago as it
is to-day. And, honourable members. it does
not look too rosy yet. We have a long way to
go to final victory. The Axis powers are still
strong. They have lost 350,000 men in Stalingrad, and in the Russian campaign as a whole
their losses exceed a million and a half men
in killed, wounded and prisoners. But Gernany alone. at the outset of the war, had an

arieid force of 8.000,000 men. and has since
added 2,500,000. We must also take into account
3,000.000 soldiers from Rumania and 5.500,000
froin Italy. Nor should the Japanese forces be
ov erlooked. These are colossal figures. We
must fight on with all our might. Lot us dlo
everything we can to aid ourselves, our
Empire, and our Allies to bring this war to a
successful conclusion.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: lonourable senators,
I do not wish to enter into the general discussion that as taken place, but one or two
ideas have been running tirough my mind.
I think we have to thank the honourable
leader of the House for having given us a
fairly broad picture of the social legislation
that lias been placed on the Statute Books of
this country, both federal and provincial,
during little more than the last quarter of a
century.
We are inclined to think from the discussion
that goes on throughout the country and in
the Press that social legislation is something
new. That is not correct. It would have been
largely true, say, a century ago, but during the
last century, from time to time, this country
and other countries have made great progress
along socialistic lines. I am not going to
bother you with many illustrations; I will take
only one. I suppose I should be safe in saying
that sixty years ago, yes, even fifty years ago,
all parents had te pay for the education of their
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

children. Then there were no public schools
such as we have to-day. There were private
schools, and parents chose the school te which
they would send their children, and they had
a good deal to say about what those children
should be taught. That is not so to-day, except
to a very minor degree. All democratie countries have the public school system, paid for
by the State, federally, provincially or municipally, and standards are laid down in the
interests of the child and of the State. I
mention that in order te make a comparison.
Would anyone say that health is of less
importance than education? Health is probably
the most important thing of all. A brainy
child without health is nothing. Yet throughout the entire world the State bas not taken
hold of this question of health as it bas taken
hold of education. To-day if a child is sick
it is up to the family of that child to work
out its salvation. Is that right? Is it not
absurd? Is it net of great importance that
the State should interfere in the field of health
as it has interfered in the field of education?
I can well remember that when I went to
Western Canada as a boy there was not a
public health institution in the whole West.
There were a inmber of private hospitals and
institutions of that kind. But when I came
down here in 1917, or a few years later,
there was not, I think, a private general hospital in all that Western country: all the
hospitals had been taken bold of by the State.
As has been said by the honourable leader of
the louse, provision has been made in the
province of Saskatchewan-and I dare say
this is true also of Alberta-to permit the
municipality to set up its own little local
hospital, paid for by all the people in the
municipality. Furthermore, it has been provided that the municipality may employ a
doctor or two or three doctors to look after
the health of the people. The State bas
stepped in and the peuple are not left entirely
to tIeir own resources in the matter of health.
I am convinced, as surely as I am standing
here, that it is only a matter of time until
this question of public health is handled by
every democratic country in the world in such
a way that all the resources of the State will
be at the call of all the people who need treatment. I believe the same may be said also
with regard to many other things that are
talked about to-day. There is no question as
to the general principle which underlies the
Atlantic Charter and in so far as it is humanly
possible you must take that into consideration,
because it lies at the very foundation of this
whole problem. Man is a wonderful animal
but he varies tremendously in his capacities

what a distinguished jurist lie is, and I understand that to-day ha is just as alert and
active mentally and physically as lie ever was.
Therefore I ara not opposed to the Bill being
given second and third readings to-day.
Hon. Mr. KING: I arn sorry the honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) has raised objection to the Bill being
read the second time now. There is some urgency
in regard to this measure. The original Bill
extended the term of the Chief Justice to
January 7, 1943. On that date the Houses of
Parliament were not in session, and until
Parliament met again there was no opportunity
to enaot a further extension of the terra. If
mny honourable friend insists on bis objection,
I amn placed in the position of having ta give
notice of motion for to-morrow, that Rules
23F, 24B and 68 be suspended in so far as
they relate to this Bill.

The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at
3 p.m.

Hon. Mr. KING: With the consent of the,
Senate, I would ask that the Bihl ha given

Honourable
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK:
senators, personally I arn entirely in~ favour
of the -Bill. Since, however, in another place
passage of the Bill was opposed by a substantial vote, it seems to me that if the Senate
is to retain in some measure its reputation for
giving adequate consideration to ahI questions
brouglit before it, Rule 23 sbould be observed.
Honourable
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE:
senators, speaking for mysaîf, I have no objection whatever to the passage of this Bill.
The proposed extension of the Chief Justice's
term of office will not cost the country anything; in fact the country will gain. We ahl
know from the long record of Sir Lymnan Duif

Hon. Mr. RING: I think not.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Than there is no real
reason for baste in tbis matter. I have not
followed what bas occurred elsewhere, but it
has been intimated to this Chamber that there
bas been considerable opposition to the present
Bill. I arnnot opposed to the second reading.
However, it seems ta me that if there are
reasonable grounds for not passing the Bill,
we should at Ieast -have time to consider the
matter, unless there is an absolute necessity
for haste. Apparantly haste is not nacessary.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I hope no one will
misunderstand -me. I arn not opposed to the
Bill; on the contrary, I arn heartily in favour
of it; but in view of what developed in another
place I do not think we should trample our
rules under foot. If the majority of the

72542-3
REVISED EDITION

34

SENATE

Senate think the second reading should proceed, I will withdraw my objection. Nevertheless, I still think we should not ignore the
rules.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I am opposed to this Bill,
but I think it important that the Bill should
be considered by the House as soon as possible, because, as I understand, in a number
of cases tried before the Chief Justice judgments have not been delivered, and those cases
will have to be tried over unless the Bill is
passed.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I think my honourable
friend from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder) misunderstood my leader. There is no Acting
Chief Justice in Canada to-day. The Supreme
Court of Canada is without a Chief Justice,
the term of office having expired on January
7 last. That is the reason why the honourable
leader was asking us to pass this measure
to-day.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: There must be power
to appoint an Acting Chief Justice.
Hon. Mr. COPP: There may be power to
do so, but I am informed that there is no
Acting Chief Justice at the moment. Of
course, if the honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) absolutely objects
to our putting the Bill through to-day, we
shall have to wait until to-morrow. It is not
a matter of particular urgency, but there is an
anomalous position which should be rectified,
and this is to rectify it.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I must assume that
there is power under the law to appoint an
Acting Chief Justice. If the Chief Justice
takes ill with typhoid fever and is in the
hospital for weeks and weeks, what happens
then? In such circumstances there must be
power in the law to appoint an Acting Chief
Justice.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I may say to my honourable friend that the Chief Justice is still Chief
Justice even though he may be ill in hospital.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Certainly, but some
person acts for him in his absence.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I do not know the details
of the procedure, but I have no doubt that
the Court's work would go on. In all probability the senior Justice would substitute
temporarily for the Chief Justice.
An important consideration at this time, as
was mentioned by my honourable friend from
Winnipeg South-Centre (Hon. Mr. Haig), is
that the Chief Justice has a number of judgments to deliver, but he cannot deliver them
until this Bill is passed.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable senators, I withdraw my objection to second
reading of the Bill on the understanding that
the Bill will be sent to a committee, se that
the honourable gentleman from Winnipeg
South-Centre (Hon. Mr. Haig) and others
may present their arguments.
Hon. Mr. COPP: They can present their
arguments on the motion for second reading.
Hon. Mr. KING: I thank my honourable
friend from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) for
his consideration and courtesy. The matter
is of some importance, and if it is agreeable
to the Senate I should like to move second
reading now.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Honourable senators, it
seems to me that before we consider a motion
for second reading we should have the Bill
before us. I cannot find it on my files, and on
inquiring for a copy I am informed that it
has not been printed. In any event, the Bill
has been given first reading here this afternoon, and it seems to me that unless there is
a special reason for taking second reading
now it might stand over until to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. KING: I rather think we should
make better progress if we had second reading
to-day.
Hon. Mr. COPP: My honourable friend
from Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duff) will probably find the Bill among his mail.
Hon. Mr. KING: I can let my honourable
friend from Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duff) have
my copy of the Bill if he wishes. I made
inquiry beforehand and was informed that
copies of the Bill were in honourable members'
mail this morning.
It will be remembered that an Act was
passed in 1939, extending the tenure of office
of the Chief Justice for three years, until
January 7, 1943. The first section of that
statute providied:
. . . the person holding the office of Chief
Justice of Canada at the passing of this Act
may continue to hold the said office for a period
not exceeding three years from and after the
seventh day of January, one thousand nine
hundred and forty.
The Bill before us is a very short one. Section
1 strikes out the word "three" in the part of
the Act that I have just read, and substitutes
the word "four." The second section of the
Bill makes this amendnent retroactive to the
seventh day of January of this year.
Since the beginning of the war, if the
Deputy Minister of a department has certified
a desire to retain the services of a capable
official beyond the normal retiring age, it has
been the custom of the Government to ask

FEBRUARY 4, 1943
that officiai whether hie will continue to serve
the State. That explains the original extension of the terni of Chief Justice Diii!, and
the present request for a furtber extension. I
do flot need to, dilate upon the Bill. Chief
justice Dfluf is recognized as one of the outstanding jurists, flot only in Canadta, but
throughout the English-speaking world, where
big opinions and, judgments are beldi in high
esteem by ail judicial bodies and lawyers.
The extension baving expired on January 7
last, the Chief Justice was asked whether, if
Parliament consented, hie would continue in
office for another year, and with bis customary
devotion to the public service hie said, "I
should be glad to serve another year."
In order that there may be no misunderstanding, I may say that the Chief Justice
could have retired in 1939 on full salary. Bis
consenting to carry on for three years represents a saving to the country of 845,000, and
this will be increased to $60,000 if hie serves
for another year. I ar n ot putting this forward as having any bearing on the case, but
the saving effected might appeal to, some
persona.
The fuît mental and bodily vigour of the
Chief Justice renders bim, eminently qualified
to preside over tbe Supreme Court, and, in
view of the probability of cases involving
international issues being referred to the Court
for decision, I tbink it would be wise that bis
period of office sbould be extended for another
year.
I move tbe second reading of tbe Bill.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I arn opposed to the general principle
underlying this legislation, not to tbe man
himself. The present Chief Justice-if I may
so, refer to bim-bad a distinguished career at
the Bar, and early in life was called to tbe
Supreme Court of British Columbia. In September, 1906, Sir Wilfrid Laurier appointed
bhir a puisne judge of the Suprerne Court of
Canada. In 1924 bie became senior judge of
that Court, the only exceptions being Sir Louis
Davies, tbe Chief Justice of that day. On
the deatb of Sir Louis it was generally supposed that Sir Lyman Duif would succeed him,
but the present Prime Minister, wbo was then
in power, passed over Sir Lyman Duif in
favour of Mr. Justice Anglin. Wben Mr.
Justice Anglin died, in 1933, Mr. Bennett made
Sir Lyman Cbief Justice. In perusing the
biographical sketch of Sir Lyman Diii! I arn
struck by one statement in particular, namely,
tbat hie is a Liberal.
Hoa. Mr. DUFF: That does flot burt bim.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Tbat is flot so bad.
An Hon. SENATOR: It is quite a handicap.
72542-3j

35

Bon. Mr. HAIG: Apparently Mr. Bennett,
that great lawyer wbo was then Prime Minister, tbougbt so, mucb of Sir Lyman Duff's
ability that bie promoted him to the Chief
Justiceship. By so doing, Mr. Bennett reestablisbed a precedent wbich I believe should
be observed in future, tba.t wben a vacancy
occurs the senior judge of tbe Court sbould
become Chief Justice.
It is not a question whetber Sir Lyman
Duif is an eminent jurist. Bis eminence is
recognized in ail legal circles. But the first
Parliament of Canada enacted the legislation
under wbich the Supreme Court was instituted, and by an amending Act passed in 1927
it was provided tbat a judge should cease to
bold office upon attaindng the age of 75 years,
or immediately if bie bad already attained that
age. Tbe first exception to tbat statutory
nile was made in 1939, when an Act was
passed- to extend the termi of office of the
Chief Justice for tbree years from January 7,
1940.
I think bonourable senators will agree with
me that an able judiciary is tbe keystone of
the arch of democracy. Every lawyer recognizes that the most important appointments
in the gift of the Federal Government are
appointments to the Bench, for you get a
proper administration of justice only so long
as you bave able men acting as judges lu our
courts, whether they be district courts, trial
courts, appellate courts of the provinces, or
the Supreme Court of Canada. By able men
I mean, not necessarily those wbo bave distinguisbed themselves at tbe Bar, but men
wbo with their legal attainuments combine a
wide experience lu general affairs.
I amn ready to admit tbat some men at 75
stiil enjoy fuil vigour of mind and body, but
they are the exception. Often a man once
inteilectuaily bnihliant is no longer so, because
of physicai weakness. In my own province we
have two uudges wbo are over 75. Their
brains are clear, but their bodies tire out in
about an hour and a haîf. As a result, the
administration of justice is impaired. Sometimes I have been told, "But, my dean
senaton, some of the menibers of the Senate
are over 75 yeans of age." I reply: "True, but
many of our membens are under 75, and tbnee,
four or six aged senators are not a large proportion lu a membership, of 96. If lu a court
of five members two have passed the age of
75 and thnee are under that age, you have
virtually only haîf a court."
I do flot thinc we shail ever be asked to
extend the Chief Justice's terni again. My
honounable friend from Pankdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) has mentioned the substantial vote
in the other Bouse in opposition to this Bitl.

SENATE
In my judgincnt the majority of our lawyers
dIo flot think that any man over 75, however
crment bis abilities, should sit i11 s0 important a court as the Supreme Court of Canada.
I hope the day is flot far off when that ivill be
the ultimate appeliate court for this country.
Truie. there is stili a considerable body of
opinion in favour of the Priv'y Couneil as our
last court of appeal, but 1 believe that as the
Supreme Court of this Dominion continues f0
grow in stature it will attraet the ablest of
aur lawyers to its membersbip.
I shall not ask for a division, but, 1 repeat,
I arn opposed to the Bill. The great men of
other days, Macdonald, Mackenzie, Blake,
Tupper. Cartier, mnay have been wrong, but
they said 75 shouid he the liraitHon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Oh, no; that limitation was imposed much later.

Bill we shahl, I think, be taking a retrograde

it. We must flot get into aur mincis the ides
that this kimzl of thing is essential just because
a man has done well in a certain job, and I
dio hope the Government wil1 seriously consider the situation before this legislation is
carried.
Hon. WILLIAM DUFF: Honourable senators, now that we have the Bill before us, we
can sec better what we are dealing with. My
honourable frienci from Winnipeg South-Centre
(Hon. Mr. Haig) told us in an able speech
about the principle laid down by previous
legisiators, namely, that when a judge has
reached the age of seventy-five hie shahl retire.
But a later generation of legisiators wîth more
modern ideas, including my honourable friend,
some three years ago decided that in the
interest of the country the terni of office of
the Chief Justice should be extended for three
years. That terni expircd and was extended,
presumably 'because we were at war. Though
I do flot pretend to be in the confidence of
the Government at ail, I take it that the
present extension is asked for the same reason.
This country is in a serious condition, and
while 1 agree with my honourable frîend from
Winnipeg South-Centre that there are in thîs
country many able lawyers, constitutional and
other, it may he that they are engaged in war
work, on commissions and in various other
organizations, and that the Government feels
that it is better to leave themn where they are,
for the time being, than to retire the Chief
Justice and appoint someone else in his place,
or to pramote one of the present members of
the Court.
Like my hanourable friend here, I cannot see
any objection to this Bill. If I opposed it I
shoulci be going against my clan, and if I did
that nobody in the Duif clan would forgive
me. That is a Scotch characteristic.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: It saves money.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Yes, and that is Scotch
ton.

Now I am going ta make a suggestion. There
are many people who do not think the war will
end this year. If that is true-and I am afraid
it is-it seems to me thât we are not going far
enough in this Bill. The present incumnbent
of this very important office is -a fine specimen
of the Duif clan and is good for another ten
years. This heing so, in order that a similar
Bill may not have to came before us ncxt
year, and that the Government may not be
worrying about having to take a man from
some other position ta put him into the
Supreme Court, I would suggest that we amcnd
the Bill by inserting in the hast line the figure
"S" instead of "4." It is only a few monthi

.37

until next January, when the extension provided by the present Bill would expire. Under
my proposai no harm wouhd be donc. If the
war shoulci end in the meantime and our
learned, esteemcd and distinguishcd friend
should decide next year not ta carry on any
longer, the Bill would have no effeet on his
position or that of the Govcrnment. What 1
suggest would obviate further discussion in this
House or in another place ncxt year about an
extension for a further terni.
Hon. P. R. Du TREMBLAY: The Iaw says
that juciges shahl retire at the age of sevcntyfive years. I think that is a good haw, speaking
generally, but there are exceptions ta most
rules. In the present instance there is onhy
one Chief Justice; hie is in perfect condition
physically and mentahly; hie was asked ta continue to give his services as Chief Justice of
this country for anc year more, and I do not
see why wc should be deprived of those services. This is anc of the cases in which I
think we might make an exception.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill
was rcad the second time.

THE LATE SENATOR COTE
TRIBUTES TO HIS MEMORY

Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senatars, it
is with deep regret that I have ta bring ta your
attention the passing of another distinguished
cohleague, the Hon. Senator Louis Coté, who
died on Tuesday nieht, February 2.

38

SENATE

Senator Coté was born in 1890, a son of the
late Pierre Martial Coté, K.C. R1e was a
graduate of the University of Ottawa, and of
Osgoode Hlall, Toronto. Hie xvas called to the
Bar in 1913, and at the time of bis death was
senior partner in the law firmn of Coté and
Hardy. 11e scrved as Crown Attorney and
Clerk of the Peace for the United Counties
of Prescott and Russell fromn 1919 to, 1922,
and rendered distinguishced service as one of
the commissioners appointed by t1he Ontario
Governiment in 1925 to report on FrenchEnglish schools ini the province. In 1928 hie
was created a King's Counsel. 11e occupied a
number of eminent positions, being a director
of Banque Provinciale dii Canada and a Commander of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem.
The late senator was one of our youngest
members when summoned ýto this Chamber, in
December, 1933. From that time on hie participated in most of our important debates and
in the work of a number of committees. I
had the good fortune to be associated w'ith
bima not only in the Senate, but also as a
fellow-member of the executive of the St.
John Ambulance Association.
His sudden
passing is a great. shock to us ahl, and on
behaîf of ail honourable memnbers of the
bouse I desire to extend to Madame Coté and
the family our deepest sympathy in their very
great bereavement.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, it is wvith a deep sense of sorrow and
regret that 1 rise to psy, not only my own
personal tribute, but that of ail honourable
senators on ùhis side of the House to my late
desk-mate and friend, Senator Coté.
The sudden and tragic death of our late
colleague is an irreparable locs to -the Senate
of Canada and to the whole country. The late
senator passed away at what migbt 'be truly
termed an ear]y age, and at a time when he
ivas at the height of bis usefulness in the
prominent and important role which he played
in public life. Brought up in this city and
province, hie did muchi for the welfare of the
Canadian people, more particularly for the
youth of this country, in regard to education.
Honourable senators are aware of what he accomplished in getting the Ontario achool
problema settled in a satisfactory manner.
Senator Coté was a gentleman of high ideals
and lofty motives. 11e took a prominent part
in the St. John Ambulance Association, and
to many charitable institutions hie rendered
valuable service. Hie was not only learned
in the ordinary law of this country, but was
as well a profound constitutional lawyer.
Indeed, few members of the legal profession
had made a more exhaustive study of the
Hion. Mr. KING.

Constitution of Canada in its bearing upon
this country, both as a separate entity and
as an integral part of the British Empire.
Our late colleague was a devout Roman
Catholic and a strong believer in that faith.
11e held, hiowever, most tolerant views in regard to those who belonged to other religious
denominations.
AIl on this aide of the Chamber join with
the honourable leader and those associated
wvith him in expressing our sincere sympathy
to Madame Coté and ber family.
Hon. GUSTAVE LACASSE (Translation):
Honourable senators, this is the second occasion on wbich it has been my sad privilege to
pay a tribute of sympathy and deep respect
to the memory of a Frencb-speaking fellow
senator from Ontario during the few years
that have elapsed since I had the bonour of
becoming a member of this Huse. The first
victima of the Grim Reaper was our ever
lamented colleague Senator Belcourt, and,
grieving as deeply to-day over this new
bereav ement, 1 again voice feelings of sincere fe'llowship.
The late lamented senator was the successor
in this House of our departed friend Senator
Belcourt, but that was not the only tie
between him and us. Senator Coté laboured
with us in the samne field of activity-a fact
which I shaîl emphasize in a few moments.
A sincere Christian, an outstanding citizen,
an able lawyer-be soon became prominent; at
the Bar, as well as in the business world, when
stili comparatively young-and a worthy
father, Senator Coté was, besides, a shrewd
political man and a resourceful debater.
is
oratorical gifts were quickly recognized by the
leaders of bis party when, a short time after
the resignation of the former leader of the
party which sat at the lef t of this House, his
successor chose bim as bis first lieutenant.
From a political standpoint, honourable
senators, that is not the only outstanding
feature in the life of Senator Coté. It is
especially in the provincial field, and from
the point of view of the part bie played in the
rectification of an irritating and unfair situation wbich formerly obtained in the province
of Ontario in the field of bilingual teaching in
our scbools, that I commend the devotion, the
ability and the zeal of our lamented colleague.
We ail remember how Hon. Howard Ferguson,
then Prime Minister of Ontario, sîngled out
our colleague and entrusted to himi the task
and responsibility of being his main exponient of co-operation in connection with
the sehool settiement I have mentioned.
We aIl remember the important part hie played
at the outset of that settiement, and bis naine

FEBRUARY 4, 1943
wil ever be linked witb the historical document known in our province as the MerchantScott-Coté report. For that marked, honourable senators, the beginuing of a new trend
toward justice and common sense fromn the
standpoint of the improvernent of hilingual
sebools in our province, and it was that first
officiai action, undertaken under the direction
of Senator Coté and bis two colleagues, which
prompted the adoption of a more equitable
and generous policy in the teaching of French
in our Ontario scbools, a policy one of whose
first salutary effeets was the repeal of the
well-known Regulation XVII, whicli limited
ta one hour per day the teaching of French
ln our schools. That first trend was succeeded
by a series of improvements, which were
followed up and considerably extended by the
administrations which -followed Hon. Mr.
Ferguson's Government in power. That explains why to-day, thanka to the devotion of
Senator Coté and of all bis fellow-members
of the Ontario Frenchi Canadian Educational
Association, the teaching of French has
assumed mucli importance in my province.
We take pride in baving to-day ln our Ontario
scbools, as a resuit of furtber equitable measuires taken since that time by the Hepburn
Goverument, a systemn of Frenchi teaching
which le perhaps superior to any other ln
Canada outside the province of Quebec. You
will thus understand, bonourable senators, why
I chose, this afternoon, to use the French
language in paying tribute to, the memory
of our departed colleague, who co-operated s0
beartily witb us in increasing the prestige and
ensuring the survival of that language in my
province of Ontario.
I therefore beartily and sincerely join those
who have already expreased their grief on this
occasion, and I also join tbem in tendering to
the stricken wife of our dear colleague, and
to the cbildren partly orpbaned by his de;ise,
as well as to bis venerable uncle, the honourable senator for Grandville (Hon. Sir Thomas
Chapais), wbom we are fortunate in having
still witb us lu this House, the trîbute of our
deep respect and our beartfelt and fraternal
sympatby.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable senators, lately Fate bas laid a lieavy baud on
this House. It is but a few hours since we
bowed our beads before two graves freshly
filled. The flowers of respect and friendsbip
laid on those tombs bave scarcely faded, yet
again we are assembled to mouru the passing
of anather colleague from our midst.
This time also Fate bas struck swiftly and
mercilessly. We had special reason to expeet
that the career so abruptly cut short would

3

pursue its happy course for many years to
came. Indeed, from its inception it was
already heavily freighted with useful and
meritorious work.
For many years Senator Coté was the youngest member in our midst. His slow and somewbat hesitant words carried the weight of
thouglit and judgment and a rare sense and
knowledge of the law. He bas been spared
a slow ebbing of life, whose glow would
gradually diminish as the emptying lamp
fiekers to extinction. As with so many of
our late departed colleagues, a sudden commanding blast from the eternal shore has
summoned him away for ever. He has left
us, but lias joined many of our friends
who have entered the realm of memory, peacefui and oblivious of ail but what is good; and
with him there was no lack of the best.*
Our heartfelt sympathy will go out ln its
fulness to hie bereaved wife and family.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, on behaif of the many frlends
and acquaintances of my late senior colleague
in this city (Hon. Mr. Coté), as well as on my
own personal account, I should like to join
with other members in expressing sincere
regret and sorrow at bis untimely psssing.
I did not have the privilege of frlendship
wi*th himi so long or so intimately as many
others here have liad; but since 1 entered this
Chamber five years ago my contacts with him
became increasingly numerous and frlendly.
Conversation and argument were favourite
avenues to an appreciation of our colleague.
He was well versed, lu the law and had a
mid whicb loved to probe and penetrate its
pbraseology for fine distinctions. He also liad
a student's genuine appreciation of art, and bis
memory was filled with a ricli store of literary
references from the classics, which hie had
widely read, and whicb lie could quote witli
apt facility to fit any occasion.
Public spirit and an uinmistakable patriotism
characterized bis work as a senator, as well
as bis active interest in wortliy causes outside
Parliament. In bis demise we have lost an
able and effective member, and bis city and
province a loyal and useful citizen.
Honourable
Hon. CAIRINE WILSON:
senators, little remains for me to add to the
tributes that have been paid to our late mcmber, but as bis senior colleague in the city of
Ottawa I should lilce to say a few words of
appreciation.
We know that Senator Coté was one of the
most faithful and indefatigable members of
this Chamber, and that bis advice was eagerly
souglit on every committee on whichlihe served.

THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SPEECH
ADDRESS IN 11EPLY

The Senate resurned frorn yesterday tbe
consideration of lis Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the opening of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Du Trernblay for an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN: In resurning the
dehbate on the gracious Speecb frorn the
Throne, perbaps you will allow mne in the
first place, Mr. Speaker, ta offer you my sincere congratulations on your elevation ta the
important office you now occupy. I arn sure
72542-4

we are ail very pleased to know that in this
and coming sessions we shall have the advantage of heing led and guided by you and of
profiting frorn the great experience which you
have gained ini a sirnilar capacity in another
Chamber.
May I also add rny srnall rneed of praise
ta the maver and seconder of the Address,
the bonourable senators frorn Repentigny
(Hon. Mr. Du Tremblay) and Kingston (Hon.
Mr. Davies). I arn sure that whcn listening
ta thern we were convinced that they constitute a distinct addition ta the dehating
strength of this assernbly, and we look forward ta hearing thern often in the course of
future debates. The rcrnarks of the honourable senator frorn Kingston on the history
and tribulations of the people of Wales, from
which he is sprung, aroused my syrnpathy,
because Itoo corne frorn an oppresscd people,
the people of England. It is truc that wc
occupy the rnost irnportant part of Great
Britain, but on the ather hancl we are constantly being harried, invaded, govcrned and
generally oppressed by the outlying tribes
frorn Scotland, Ireland and Wales.
In. discussing the Speech frorn the Throne,
hionourable senators, rnay 1 say that it was
the rnost întercsting and perhaps the most
encouraging I have listened ta on any of the
six occasions upon which I have had the
privilege as a senator of being present at the
opcning of Parliarnent, and that because it
offers a prospect of real progress along the
lines of social reforrn. Two paragraphs f rom
the gracious Speech particularly interested rne:
It is in the general interest that freedom front
fear and from want aboula be the assured possession of ail. A nation-wide plan which would
provide insurance against the inevitable consequences of major economie and social hazarda is
essential if this objective is ta be attained.
My Ministers believe that a comnprehensîve
national scheme of social insurance should be
worked out at once, whicb will copstitute a
charter of social security for the whole of
Canada.
Then there is a reference.ta the appointrnent
of a parliarncntary cornmittee ta inquire inta
this whole question.
1 have always thought, honourable senators,
that the Unernployment Ineurance Act which
we passed in 1940 was one of the most useful
and important measures it has fallen ta aur
lot ta consider in the few years that I have
been in this House. I do not tbink anyone
now would deny the wisdorn of passing that
measure at that particular tirne. It was a
tirne of very full ernployrnent, when contributions by ernployers and ernployed could be
cxpected ta continue and grow greater, as
indeed they have donc. These contributions
have resulted in the setting up and constant

MEISED EDITION

SENATE

augmentation of a suibstantial fund, which
will be of great value in easing the troubles
and difficulties of the temporary unemployment whîch is 'bound to corne at the conclusion
of the war. Honourable members will recaîl
that in the debate on the Bill in this Chamber
an attempt was made to delay its passage until
after the war, on the ground that it would
be unfair to impose upon industry thjs additional burden at a time when it was attempting to change over to war production. I do
not think that argument would be used today. Unemployment insurance bas corne into
force; its machinery is workiog well; the
burden, if burden it be, is being cheerfully
borne both by employers and employed, and
the measure bas become an essential and
integral part of our industrial life.
1 say that because we are now faced with
the prospeet of additional social legislation,
and, I do flot think anyone would now use
the argument that we should flot proceed with
social legisiation just because we happen to
be at wac. In that connection I should, like to
refer honourable mýemýbers to a sentence from
an address by Mr. Winston Churchill in 1919,
shortly after the last war. Like so many of
his sentences, it is significant and, pregnant
with meaning. H1e said:
The true measure of nations is what they
can do when they are tired.
True, we are engaged in. a life-and-death
struggle, but this, I say, is no time to abandon
schemes of social reform. In fact, as 1 think
my honourable leader (Hon. Mc. R{ing) and
the honoucable senator fcom Saltcoats (Hon.
Mr. Calder) pointed out yesterday aftecnoon,
we in this country have an obligation to
continue wjth mensures of social reform. As
one of the Allied nations we have assented to
the Atlantic Charter, and two of the points
of that charter se.t out by those two great
leaders of democracy, President ýRoosevelt and
Prime Minister Churchill, are freedomn from
want and fceedom from fear. It see.ms to me
that as one of the Allied nations we are called
upon to do everything we an, to free our
citizens fcom want and from fear.
Mc. Chucchill's phrase that the true test of
a nation ýis what it can do when it is tired is
surely a yard-stick by which we can mensure
the people of Britain at the pcesent diay. Look
at the situation there. They hiave had three
and a haîf years of war; their cities have been
bomibed; their slips have been sunk; they
have been in constant danger of invasion;
their armies have been thcown back in different parts of the wocld and only now is the
tide beginning to turn. They are tired, yet
this is the time when the British niation puts
forwacdi, in the report of Sic William Beveridge,
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN.

perhaps the meost fac-reaching scheme of social
ameliocation and cefocmn that the wocld bas
ever seen. I think that pechaps is an example
which this country should follow, and that, to
use Mr. 'Chucchill's phrase, we should sec what
we can do when we are ticed, along the lines
of scial reform.
Incidcntally, thece is one rather intecesting
thinig about the Beveridge report: its propagranda value. I venture to say that it has
been one of the most important points of
propaganda for the Allied side that have corne
out for many months past. It is a clear
demonstration to the people of occupied
Europe of the sort of social policy and social
progcess which Great Britaýin stands for. The
proof of iLa propaganda value is not far te
seek. From the moment it was made public
the German radio of Dr. Goebbels bas consbantly 'been doing its lest to ccy down that
report and minimize its value.
I thecefore heactily welcome that part of
the Speech fcom the Throne which refera to
the appointment of a parliamentary committee
to go into the whole question of social reform.
Evidently our Govecnment re.alizes that we
need some general all-embcacing plan for
social security. sirnilar in essence to the plan
which Sic William Beveridge bas proposed for
Gceat Britain.
It is not my intention to discuss in any
detail the Beveridge report. It is a lengthy
document. But basically, to use the words of
its author, it involves "the determination of
British democracy to, free itseîf once and for
aIl of the scandai of physical want, for which
there is no economie or moral justification."
In brief, it proposes to set up one central
insurance fund administered by a central
authority, to which payments are to be made
in varying proportions by employers, employees, independent traders and workera, and
the State. Out of this fund there will be
granted unemployment allowances, disabilîty
allowances, medical treatment, old age pensions, workmen's compensation, maternity
expenýse, family allowances for children in
excess of one, and funerail expenses. As bas
letn said, it is designed to provide foc the
minimum economie wnnts of thc average
man between thc cradle and the grave.
It would be well here pechaps to, emphasize
the word "minimum." I should like to quote
for the benefit of honourable members a few
lines of what Sir William Beveridge says on
that particular point. This is one of the bases
upon which the suggestions contaîned in that
report are founded. These are his words:
Social security must be achieved by cooperation between the State and the individual.
The State in organizing security should flot

ikely that a broad scheme of this kind would
-elieve the provinces of the financial burden
f a great deal of social legislation which at
the time of Confederation it was not conIemplated they should undertake, and xvhich
it is becoming more difficult, particularly for
the poorer provinces, to meet, as demands for
more and more social services come along
year by y;ear. That problem of the extent to
which the Dominion should take over the
provincial field is one that will require profound study by the parliamentary committee. It maiy becorne nece-sary to set up
some sort of Dominion-Provincial authority.
It may, and I hope it will, be found possible
to carry on in very large part with the
present provincial administra tions, leaving a
large proportion of the control to them. But
an attempt will have to be made to dovetail the present machinery into a new national
scheme. Sir William Beveridge proposes and
strongly recommends that there should be a
Ministry of Social Security in Great Britain,
and, in view of the vast extent of our own
country, if we are to have a truly national
scheme here, I think a ministry of that kind
will be even more necessary for us.
Broadly speaking, a national scheme of
insurance must mean a large measure of
national co-ordination, if not national control.
Faced as we always are with the bogey of the
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in
London and its unpredictable decisions about
the constitutional rights of this country, it
may well be that we shall have to seek an
amendment to the British North America Act.
Honourable senators will recall that that is
what was done in the case of the unemployment insurance measure. It will also be
recalled that the governments of all the provinces unanimously assented to the assumption
by the Federal Government of the necessary
power to administer that measure; and we all
are aware of the highly co-operative spirit
shown by the provincial governments in the
last two or three years in the matter of
Dominion-Provincial finances. I hope and
sincerely believe that in this matter, too, the
provincial governments will show a broad
national spirit and will consent either to give
up to or share with the Dominion such constitutional powers as may be necessary in
order to provide our people with a truly
national system of social insurance that will
ensure freedon from want and freedom from
fear.
I wish to discuss for a few moments the
financial implications of such a scheme. It
will be a heavy burden. There is no sense
or reason in our denying that. It will be
a burden upon the individual, upon industry,

sociaI

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN.

and upon the State. An example of the sort
of burden contemplated in Great Britain is
the degree te which Sir William Beveridge
proposes that present contributions be increased, namely, the contribution of the
Government by 95 per cent, that of the empluyers by 55 per cent, and that of insured

perons by 275 per cent.
It is the Government's contribution I wish
to discuss here for a minute or two. It will
entail a considerable redistribution of the
national wealth. It will involve high taxation;
not as high as the sort of taxation to which we
are subjected at the present time, when more
than 50 per cent of the national income is
devoted to purposes of war, but I should say
measurably higher than the scale of taxation
to which we were subjected immediately prior
to the war.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE:
May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question?
Hon. Mr. IHUGESSEN:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Can the honourable
gentleman tell me whether or not a measure
of this kind would do away with the present
Unemployment Insurance Act, or shall we be
taxed in that respect also?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I should anticipate
that the Unemployment Insurance Act would
be a part of the whole thing. The machinery
that bas been set up and is now in operation
under that Act could and would probably be
used and expanded to take in, to some extent,
the additional services contemplated by a
national undertaking along the lines of Sir
William Beveridge's scheme. Unemployment
insurance is one of the things covered in his
scheme.
I do not regard with any great alarm the
prospects of high taxation. I am a believer
in higher taxation for purposes of social service, and in a redistribution by that means of
the country's wealth, provided always that the
taxation is fair and that the social objects
sought to be achieved are worthy of attainment.
You can do a great deal by high
taxation devoted to useful social purposes. An
illustration of that fact is to be found in
England itself, where in the last thirty or forty
years high taxes have been collected and
devoted to great measures of social justice.
Now, this is a rich country, and I can sec
no justification for the extremes of wealth and
poverty that still exist in our midst. Perhaps
I should state a little more clearly just what
I mean. I have no objection to inequalities
of wealth, or te accumulation of wealth by
the fortunate few, but on one condition: that
there be a first charge on the national income

FEBRUARY 4, 1943
ta provide for ail a decent minimum standard
of living, with security against want, sickness,
unemployment, and aid age, subject, of course,
ta necessary safeguards against abuse. After
that first charge has been met there will be, ini
a rich country like ours, an ample margin left
as reward for individual initiative, enterprise
and tailent.
1 should like ta quote ta the Bouse
some remarks by Sir William Beveridge
about the capacity of Great Britain ta undertake a great and expensive scheme of social
insurance such as this. Referrmng ta a number
of investigations carried out during the last
few years in variaus industrial tawns in Great
Britain, he says:
While in every town surveyed substantial percentages of the families examined had less than
the bare minimum of subsistence, the bulk of
them had substantially more than the minimum.
Want could have been abolished before the
present war by a redistribution of incarne within
the wage-earning classes withont touching any
of the wealthier classes.
There is no question that we can establish
ini this cauntry a satisfactary minimum standard of living for ail. In saying that ours is a
weal'thy country I amn talking not in termas of
money, but in terme of what is produced by
aur ýfarms andi factaries, our fisherie.s and aur
Our
mines, aur water-powers and so on.
ability ta praduce wea.lth has been largely
increased during the last few years and is
capable of being stili fui'thpr 'increased. From
the Dominion Bureau of Statistics 1 obtained
an estiniate of the national incarne in the
five years Leginning with 1938. These figures,
which represent the total value of everything
prodiuced in this cauntry in, the years mentioned, are interesting:
$4,310,000,000
1938 ....................
4,575,000,000
1939.....................
5,406,000,000
1940.....................
approximately 6,500,000,000
1941 .........
(estimated) 7,500,000,000
1942 ...........
On the basis of these figures I think it would
be fair ta assume thet for the future aur
national incarne is not likely ta faîl below five
billion dollars annually. We have a population of eleven- and a haîf millions. Dividing
one figure inta the other will give you an
amaunt of 3435 per annurn for every man,
waxnan and child. in the country. Ta take an
average family of five persans, that would be
a yearly incarne for the farnily of $2,175, or
$181 a month. Now, as every honourable
senatar knows, a large proportion of aur
population lives in comparative cornfort an
less than $181 a rnonth. Tisat is clearly
demonstrated by incarne tax figures. Unfortunately the figures have flot been brought
up to date, and the last I was able ta obtain
are those for the fiscal year 1939-40. They

45

divided into classes the number of people
who paid incarne tax that yetar. They are
rather interesting, because they show that in
that year slightly fewer than 169,000 persans
had an incarne of $2,000 a year or more. That
is less than one and, one-haîf per cent of aur
total population. It ail goes ta show whait I
was tryiing ta demonstrate a few minutes aga,
that the national incarne is arnply sufficient
to. provide ail our people with a decent
standard of living.
May I refer ta a recent experience of my
own which goes ta support the same conclusion? Bonourable senators will remember that
recently the Government increased the allawances ta dependants of men in aur fighting
farces ta an amount which we are assured is
higher than any comparable scale paid by any
other country in the warld. Under that
increased scale the wife of a private saldier
with four children now receives a monthly
allowance af $102, including cast of living
bonus. As Joint Chairman of the Âdvisory
Committee for Military District No. 4 af the
Dependants' Board of Trustees, I have had
in the last few monthe the taak of examining
into the budgets of mare than 1,000 soldiers'
families, and 1 can tell the Bouse that a
monthly income of $102 for a family of five
persans is on the present scale of prices
sufficient in city districts, and is perhaps on a
samewhat generous scale in country &istricts,
where the cost of living is generally lower. I
arn speaking, of course, of the province of
Quebec.
I want ta emphasize that the Beveridge
report is designed for the absalute climination
cf want. I have already quated ta the Bouse
what Sir William Beveridge says about the
possibiity of eliminating want in Great
Britain-a country with far less resources than
ours-merely by redistribution cf incarne
which would be within the lirnits of the
working classes in the few towns he
investigated.
With reference ta, the capacity of this
country ta support such a scheme, I wish ta
quote a local authority. As honourable members will recall, Dr. Cyril James, Principal of
McGill University, was lest year appointed by
this Govemnment as head af the Committee on
Post-war Reconstruction. Be is an economiat
cf wide renown. Be made a speech ta the
Canadian Club af Mantreal on the l8th af
January last, one or two quotatians .fromn
which were given, 1 think, by the honourable
senatar from Repentigny (Bon. Mr. DuTremblay) on Tuesday last. This is what
Professer James said on that accasian as ta,
the capacity of Canada ta support such a
minimum standard of 111e:

SENATE
If it is possible for the people of Great
Britain by their own initiative and enterprise,
working with the limited natural resources of
that Island, to derive froin their efforts an
annual income large enough to provide a basic
minimum standard of subsistence for every man,
woman and child over there, it would be foolish
for any one of us to suggest that 12,000,000
enterprising and vigorous people over here are
doomed to a smaller per capita return from
their scientific exploitation of the gigantic
natural resources of this Dominion. Even before
the war, Canada's national income was statistically adequate to the task of eliminating want,
if Canadians had been willing to undertake
that partial redistribution of income which
social insurance requires; and every one of us
knows that during the present war the intensification of our economic activity, in spite of the
fact that 600,000 men and woinen are in the
armed forces, has increased total national production to a figure never dreamed of before
1939. The problem that faces Canada is clearly
one of human vision and courage, rather than
one of material resources; since it becomes
increasingly apparent that we have as yet
scarcely scratched the surface of our potential
wealth.
In view of what Professor James says, and of
the knowledge that every honourable senator
has of conditions throughout this country, I
do not think anyone will venture to deny that
we have it in our power, with our resources,
to provide a decent minimum standard of
living for all our people by some all-embracing
system of national insurance such as that
contemplated by the Speech from the Throne.
Not only can we do it, but I venture to
think that this Government is right in suggesting that it should be done with the least
possible delay. What is the reason for that?
I think one answer is to be found in a consideration of two large and important classes
of our people. The first class is the workers
in our war industries. As the Prime Minister
stated in another place three days ago, we
have now more than one million people
working in our war industries. Those men
and women are afraid that their jobs will
come to an end when the war comes to an
end. There has been a certain amount of
labour trouble in some of our war industries
in the past few months, and I think it is
common knowledge that we are threatened
with more trouble of the same kind. I am
convinced one of the fundamental causes of
that trouble is the uncertainty in the minds of
those men and women as to what is going to
happen to them after the war. They are
afraid of being thrown out on the street, with
no resources, or only with the small limited
resources which they have been able to
accumulate during the last few profitable
years. That is a very natural fear. I venture
to suggest to honourable members that there
will be a tremendous increase in the confidence
and self-reliance of the workers in our war
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN.

industries if before the war ends they are
assured of protection against the hazards of
life during the period of reconstruction, and
that the provision of such a scheme would go
a considerable way towards eliminating further
labour troubles in our war industries.
The second class of our citizens to whom I
wish to direct your attention is the nearly
700,000 men and women in our war services.
At the present time those men and women are
receiving adequate pay, and, generally speaking, their dependants are receiving a sufficient
allowance for their needs. But they, too, are
wondering what will happen to them and their
families when the war comes to an end.
Remember, many of those men went through
the depression years of the nineteen-thirties
and they had to exist with their families on
the miserable pittances of a few dollars a
week, grudgingly bestowed, to which the honourable senator from Kingston (Hon. Mr.
Davies) referred so feelingly a couple of
evenmgs ago.
Now, may I be permitted to refer again to
my experience as a member of the Dependants' Board of Trustees? Applications for
assistance have to be submitted to us on forms
for the purpose of obtaining certain information. That information includes the occupation of the soldier before he enlisted, the
monthly budget of family expenses, and the
amount of debt incurred both before and after
enlistment.
In a great number of cases, in
answer to the question as to the occupation
of the man before enlistment, the answer is
"Unemployed and on relief" for a period
varying from a few months to eight or nine
or ten years. In nearly every one of those
cases where men had been unemployed, if
you turned to the column of debt incurred
after enlistment, you would sec what happened. As soon as the man joined the Army
and his family came again into possession of
a regular income, the first thin-g he and his wife
did was to go out and buy $100, $200 or $300
worth of furniture on the instalment system.
That, honourable senators, tells a lamentable
story, the story of families which during the
depression period had to get rid, piece by
piece, of their furniture. Once the man enlisted and a regular income was coming in,
they hastened to reconstitute the home and
make it something which they could be proud
of, and live in with human dignity.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Is that condition
general?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:
In nearly every
case where the man stated he had been unemployed before enlistment that is what happened. It is indeed a significant fact. I think
honourable senators will agree with me that

47

FEBRUARY 4, 1943
aur men have a right ta expect something
better after they return from this war. It is
quite true that social insurance will not cure
unemployment, but it will provide a fairer
distribution of the national income, and it
will ensure a decent standard of living being
maintained by returned men and, their families
while they are readiusting themselves in civil
if e.
*In what I have said in the latter part of my
remarks I have tried to show two things:
first, that Canada can afford; a systema of social
security whîch wili provide a decent standard
of living and reasonable insurance against the
ordinary bazarde of life for ail our people îand, second, that the time is ripe for us ta set
up such a system. The working out of the
plan will of course involve much effort and
much goodwill; and it will also involve a
considerable redistribution of the national
incarne.
In closing, may I refer once more ta that
pregnant sentence of Mr. Winston Churchill's,
that the true measure of nations is what they
can do when they are tired. We have had
three and a haîf years of war: we are tired:
and we shall be more tired yet before the final
day of victory cornes: but I suggest that we
take up Mr. Churchill's challenge. Let us
see what we can do as a nation when we are
tired. Let this Government and this Parliament act now to procure for ail our people
freedom fromn want and freedom from fear.

GENERAL'S SPEECH
IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
consideration of Bis Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Du Tzemblay for
an Address in reply thereto.
Honourable
Hon. W. M. ASELTINE:
members, at the outset of my remarks I wish
ta congratulate Bis Honour on his elevation
ta the important position of Speaker of this
Chamber. I am confident that his wide parliamentary experience wiIl stand him in good

stead and that he will always preside over
our deliberations ie a fair and impartial
mariner.
1 desire to congratulate the mover (Hon.
Mr. Du Tremblay) and the seconder (bei.
Mr. Davies) of the Address je reply to the
Speh from the~ Thrn.
They acquitted
themselves with distinction. 1 have no doubt
that their extensive experience je, the newspaper and business fields will enable thema te
make very valuable contributions te the work
of this Chamber. 1 hope tbcy will have many
oppertunities te share in our labours.
I listcncd very carefully te the excellent
speech of the honeurable gentleman who has
preceded me in this debate (Hon. Mr.
ilugessen), and I must congratulate hima on
the information and benefit whicb it is evident
he bas gained fromn readýing the Port Hoýpe
resolutions as well as tbe resolutions adoptcd
at the recent Progressive Conservative convention je Winnipeg.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hoýn. Mr. ASELTINE: No doubt boneurable members know that recently certain publie men have genýe out of their way te attack
the Sonate. 1 do not thinjc these attacks
should be passed over ligbtly, and I intend te
refer to, them. briefly. I do net inteed te deal
with the attack made by a former premier
of this province, but I do wisb te say something about an attack made by a certain
meniber of Parliament. It seems tu be a
popular pastime with certain politicians wbo
have failed, te rcach this Chamber te criticize
it and ask for its abolition when they have
nothieg else te discuss.
A few days ago, je another place, the leader
of one of our lessor political parties made
certain derogatory rernarks concerning the
Senate of Canada. These remarks were se, farreaching that tbey were je the nature of an
attack. I do net know wbat prompted bim.
te take this course. Surely there were plenty
of other subi ects te wbich ho might well have
directed bis attention, but prôbably he was
seeking political aggrandizement.
I understand that bis remarks passed without objection je the Commons; se I think there sbould
be ne objection if occasionally we become
critical of the other bouse.
Ie the past we have been in the habit of
just considering the source of sucb attacks and
saying nothing ie reply, but this time the
remarks were in my opinion made with malice
aforetbougbt; tbey wero malignant and ietended te be damaging. Tbey werc, I am
convinced, made for the purpese of currying

pelitical faveur and attracting votes. Obvieusly the remarks were untrue. It is net my
intention te repeat them; they wilI ho found
le the Commens Hansard and in the Press.
1 for one certainly reseet the attack. The
Senate is one of the most democratic bodies
le the world.
Soe

Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Anyone is at liberty
te appear 'befere our Senate committees, and
anyone who dees se receives a most sympathetie bearing. We conduct our business
witb fairness and impartiality and without
rancour. It is very seldoma that we decide an
issue on straigbt party linos.
Moreever, the members of the Senate represent tbe best braies in the country.
Hon. Mr. IDUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. AISELTINE: Senators are chosen
from every walk of life, and have every qualification necessary te advise lis Mai esty ie
matters of govorement.
It was neyer the
ietention of the Fathers of Confedieration that
this Chamber sbould sit continuously or be a
second debatieg society. I always remnember
the first year I entered this Chamber. We
made about one thonsand ameedments te
bouse of Commons legislation. Bills were
remodellod and improved, and when they left
this Chamber a considerable numiber of them
bore little evidence of beieg tbe original Bills
except je their titles. In addition, several
very important Goverement moasures were
intreduced in the Sonate that, year, and as a
result of the good work porformed by this
Chamber much meney was saved te the
country.
Criticizing the Senate bas been deseribed as
a popular indoor sport. I well recaîl tbat
during my second year at the University of
Manitoba I xvas a member of a little debatieg
seciety and that one of the questions which
came up for consideration was, " Resolved that
the Senate of Canada sbould be abolisbied."
At tbat tinie I was speaking for the negative,
net knowing that later on I was te become a
member of this Chamber. Ie preparing my
speech I found n refereece in tbe Canadian
Eecyclopoedia, 1 think, te the effeet tbat on
une particular occasion tbe Senate of Canada
bcad sueceeded, by defeating a Goverement
moasure, je sax ieg te, this country enough
nioney te pay tbe salaries of the senators for
one hundred years. Later, je conversation
about this same matter. the honourable senator
from Red Deer (Hon. Mr. Michener) informed
me tbat after ho came te, this Chamber the
question of the alienation of certain ceai lands
in the province of Alberta came up, and that

FEBRUARY 5, 1943
as a result of the action of the Senate these
lands, which. were warth another $100,000,000,
were saved ta the Crown and ta the people
of the country.
I also wish ta, refer ta a debate in this
Chamber in 1934, during which speeches were
made by Hon. Mr. Murphy and others on this
subject. 1 do not think the views about which
I have complained are popular throughout the
country. There are still mnany people who
tbank God that we stili have a Senate.
1 wish ta deal next with the matter of
contrallers, boards and Orders in Council. I
realize, of course, that there is a war on, and
that there must be at alI times a certain
amount of control and regimentation; but in
my opinion these tbings have been carried s0
far during the present war that the supremacy
of Parliament is in greater danger than ever
before. In my office in Rosetown, Saskatchewan, I receive the Orders in Council and the
orders of the controllers practically every
morning. I have in my library a file of them
which is, I should say, a foot or twa thick.
Just when I think I have mastered the latest
Order in Council or the latest order of some
controller, board or commission, I find that I
must look through all the orders again because
of the fact that a few days before an amcndment has heen made with which I must
become familiar before it is possible for me
ta give proper advice ta, my clients. When
you compare the year's statutes with the
Orders in Council and the orders of the variaus
controllers and boards passed each year, you
find the statutes are contained within a very
small volume, an inch or two thick, whereas
the orders complained of, if bound together,
would make a volume ten or twenty times as
large. These Orders in Council and the variaus
boards' orders that I have been complaining
of are soinetimes made just on the eve of the
session of Parliament and often -while Parliament is in session, without being considered
hy Parliament at all. Last fail I picked up one
Order in Cauncil having ta do with wheat
regulatians and found it was No. 10,000. A
littie later I saw another Order in Council,
dated November 26, and it was No. 10,793.
Since that time the Orders in Council and
orders issued 'by controllers and baards have
run into many hundreds more, some of 'whichi
have even fixed penalties, fines and imprisanment for breach of regulations. It is my considered opinion, honourable senators, that the
people af Canada do not like that way of doing
business. Take the ýOil Controller, for instance.
If hie is satisfied that there has been a breach
of regulations 'by a filling station, hie can order
that station clased for three mon'ths or permanently, at his discretion. The owner of the

49

filling statiok, with no charge made againet
him and -no chance ta defend himself, may
find his living bas been done away with. My
contention is that that kind of thing should
flot happen, even in war-time. Everyone
should have access and recourse ta the courts,
and na man shouild be put out of business
without having a charge against him. fairly
deait with.
It stands to reason that when Goverument
'business is carried on ta such an extent 'by
boards, 'Ly cantrollers, by Orders in Council
and by orders of controllers there is much less
wark for Parliament ta do. In fact, if we
continue along that line it will flot be long
before Parliament becomes a mere rubber
stamp. 1 well remember that last session one
debate-on a very important subject, it is true
-went an in another place for the greater
part of three months, and even then the question was .not solved. Surely we do flot wish
te have the other Chamber resolve itself inta
the categary of a high-class debating saciety.
But that, honourable senatars, is what may
happen if things continue as they are.
Honourable senators w.ill remember that last
year we had quite a 'long debate in this
Chamber as ta the reason why the Senate had
flot been given more work ta do. The question
was nat solved in the debate, but immediately
thereafter the honourable leader of üthe Senate
laid on the Table a pile of Orders in Council
about a foot high, whieh had been passed in
the preceding few weeks. That was the
answer. The work that Parliament should have
been doing was being done instead by these
boards and controllers and, by Orders in Council. In war-time some of these orders are
nccessary, but surely not ail of them, if the
supremacy of Parliament is ta be maintained.
Reverting ta statements made by a member
in another place with regard ta the Senate, 1
think hie might 'have employed his time ta
better advantage -if, instead"of attacking this
Chamiber, hie had attacked, the Government of
the day for carrying on 'business in the manner
I have mentianed. He knows perfectly wel)
that the supremacy of Parliament is 'being
challenged. I can only came ta the conclusion
that hie is satisfied with the manner in wb.icb
the business of Parliament is being carried an,
and that the Co-operative Commonwealth
Federation would, if placed in po'wer, conti-nue
the practice naw in vague.
I now wish ta make some remarks with
reference ta the Speech from the Throne. In
spite of opinions expressed by previaus
speakers, I must say I was more or less disappointed with that speech. I was not present
when it was delivered, but I heard a summary
over the radio and read the full text of the

50

SENATE

speech in the newspapers, on my way to
Ottawa. I was hoping that an editorial prediction in the Saskatoon Star Phoenix of
Friday, January 29, would be fulfilled and that
there would be a great deal of work for both
Houses of Parliàment; but upon a careful
reading of the speech I find there is going to
be very little work for Parliament to do at this
session, outside of considering estimates and
voting money for the carrying on of the war.
It is truc a committee is to be appointed to
work out a national system of social security,
but, as it took Sir William Beveridge eighteen
months to study the question in England and
submit his report, it is not very likely that the
committee appointed here will make a full
report this session. Another committee has
been appointed, one on reconstruction, 'but I
call attention of honourable senators to the
fact that no member of either House of Parliament is named on that committee. One other
committee is to resume work. We are to
have an amendinent to the Income Tax Act, a
Health Insurance Act and a Redistribution
Act, and that is about all. I presume the rest
of the work will continue to be done by boards
and controllers, and the greater part of the
legislation will be passed by Order in Council.
An editorial in the Winnipeg Tribune of
Saturday, January 30, 1943, calls these matters
"Parliament's Little Chores," and the writer
is disappointed, as I am, to find there is
nothing in the speech to indicate that the
Government is even considering the grave manpower crisis now confronting the country.
There is complete silence in respect to wartime strikes in essential industries. There is
no indication that the Government is aware
of the crisis in Western agriculture.
In the same issue of the Winnipeg Tribune I
noticed also a report on a Liberal meeting held
at Winnipeg. The heading is, "Liberals Hear
Speaker on Economie Wartime Controls."
Imagine my surprise when I read this:
"We may as well face the fact that we are
going to be governed by control boards after the
war," said Mr. A. M. Stinbane, K.C. "It is
our just duty to grapple with these problems
and solve them ourselves and for ourselves."
That is a startling statement. I hope that
Mr. Stinbane had no authority for making the
statement, and that it is not to be the Liberal
policy after the war, but, if it is, I think this
House should lead the fight against such
bureaucracy. Otherwise it will be National
Socialism, Fascism or something just as bad
for all of us.
I wish to refer next to certain Western Canada
matters. When I say Western Canada I mean
particularly the Prairie Provinces. The first
matter in this connection is the income tax
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE.

in so far as it affects the farmer. During the
depression years, from 1930 to 1938, inclusive,
there were poor crops in the Prairie Provinces,
and the prices for all kinds of farm produce
were very low-so low that heavy debta were
incurred Iby the farmers. In many cases farm
mortgages were doubled, farmers who had purchased land under agreements of sale were
unable to make payments on the agreements,
and arrears of interest piled on top of the
principal made insuperable obstacles. Machinery and farm equipment got into a bad state
of repair and wore out. The farmers were
in need of nearly everything that makes life
on the farm bearable. Their debts piIed up to
such an extent that in 1934 Parliament passed
the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act,
under which many proposals were made for
reducing farmers' debts, or extending the time
for payment, and so on, in the hope that
when there were good crops again farmers
would be able to pay their debts and replenish
their worn-out equipment.
In 1939, 1940 andi 1942 the crops in the
Prairie Provinces were good, but by that time
the Excess Profits Tax Act had been passed
and the income tax rate had been greatly
increased. I do not think the excess profits
tax was intended to apply to farmers at all.
In my opinion its purpose was to prevent corporations and others from making fortunes
out of the war. Farming was a depressed
industry and there was no chance of making
a great profit in it. But with good crops and
better prices to-day many farmers find themselves in the excess profits bracket. The
reason for that in my territory in the West is
that last year a large crop of flax was grown.
As I say, many farmers are now liable for
the excess profits tax, but they are unable to
pay this and the high income taxes and also
reduce their debts and replenish their wornout equipment. These men are in a deplorable financial position, almost without any hope
at all for the future. As a result, many 'of
them are paying on their debts in order to
save themselves from bankruptcy-that is, they
are complying with the proposals made by the
Board of Review under the Farmers' Creditors
Arrangement Act-and, are not paying any
income tax at all.
In a recent issue of Maclean's Magazine I
noticed an article stating that arrears of incom.e tax owed by farmers must be forgiven,
and that a committee had been appointed to
prepare simple income tax forms, which
farmers would find easy to fill out. I understand this committee has met and that the
new form is ready. In fact, I saw one of the
new forms at Saskatoon a few days ago.
Imagine my surprise on finding thaf instead

FEBRUARY 5, 1943
of having four closely printed pages, as the
old form had, this one has six closely printed
pages and is so complicated that the sight of
it would discourage any farmer from making
out his return. I think something should be
done about this matter. I am not prepared, to
suggest just what should be done, but it is a
very important matter and one to which serious
attention should be given. The farmer does
not want to evade payment of his income
tax, but on the other hand he does not want
to be unable to pay something on his debts.
He is helped somewhat by the fact that payments on mortgage principal or on the principal of his agreement of sale apply on his
compulsory savings under the income tax
law, but he needs more help than this.
My next remarks will be about that vexed
subject, butter. About a year ago the price
of butter in industrial Canada commenced to
go up, and it was thought wise to have a
ceiling placed on this product. I believe the
price fixed at that time was thirty-three cents
a pound. In Saskatchewan then there was
plenty of butter, the price to the average consumer for good dairy butter being about
twenty cents a pound in the summer and
twenty-five cents in the winter, though some
farmers supplied customers at twenty cents a
pound the year round. But as soon as the
ceiling was fixed at 33 cents by the Wartime
Prices and Trade Board the price in the Prairie
Provinces immed.iately went up to that figure;
so the consumer hac to pay a good deal more
than before. True, the farmer who produced
butter got some advantage.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: What is the
ceiling now?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I think the ceiling
now is about 35 cents. It seems to me that
the different boards look at things through the
eyes of Ontario and the industrial East, and
when a condition arises in those areas they
think that a similar condition prevails in other
parts, and they proceed to act on that assumption. The result is a hardship on Western
Canada. That, in my opinion, shows a lack
of planning on the part of the Government,
and is my chief complaint in regard to the
matter I am now dealing with.
As a result of the rationing of butter, dairy
butter has almost disappeared from Western
Canada, and where we had plenty before
rationing came into effect we have now a
shortage. The farmers who have been making
dairy butter find difficulty in selling it. Many
of them live long distances fromn town and on
account of the gasoline and rubber regulations
they are unable to come in more than once
a week. They find themselves unable to deliver the same quantities of butter to their

51

old customers as heretofore, for now they have
to secure a licence to sell, and their customers
must present coupons for their purchases. The
stores also in many cases refuse to accept
dairy butter.
Many of these farmers decided they would
ship their cream instead of making it into
butter. You can imagine their surprise when
they found that not a cream can was available
at any price. Consequently the farmers have
turned their calves on the cows and now intend
to fatten the cows for beef. Another result of
these regulations is that butter-making in
Western Canada is now almost entirely in the
hands of the creameries; and in Saskatchewan
we have only a few creameries. In fact there
are none in the district from which I come.
To-day many dairy cattle are being shipped
out of Canada. The Government, in my
opinion, should restrict the export of dairy
cattle. It does not appear to have a worka'ble
plan to deal with this serious matter.
I come now to the rental regulations. These
have given me, as I believe they have given
other senators, a great deal of trouble. At first
the regulations affected only the industrial
Easte-large centres where there were air fields
and air schools, and where there was a congestion of population. But in the rural parts
of Canada, particularly in the West, no rental
regulations are necessary at all. There is no
congestion of population. On the contrary,
many people are leaving the rural areas and
going to the large industrial centres in the
East in searoh of work. Depopulation of the
West is continually going on and will increase
unless industries are opened up there. There
is no real objection to the fixing of a ceiling
on rent, in spite of the fact that in many
areas of the West rents are very low, owing
to bad crop years; but there is strong objection to the other rental restrictions. These
interfere with provincial rights and tiherefore
are, in my opinion, ultra vires.
Let me give an illustration. Take Rosetown,
where I live. It bas a population less than
2,000. We have no industries, no air fields or
air schools; in a word, we have no activities
to attract population, with resultant shortage
of bouse accommodation. The town subsista
entirely on the farming community of the
surrounding district.
An Hon. SENATOR: Are there no churches?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Yes, we have five
W'hy should a property owner in a town like
that be subject to rental regulations? In many
cases the tenant might be objectionable; he
might be a bootlegger or a pander, or he might
wantonly damage the property; but before the
landlord could obtain vacant possession he

SENATE
would have to go into court and make out
his case. Why should the property owner in
any of our rural districts have to give a year's
notice to his tenant to vacate a house in case
of sale? Why, in fauet, should there be any
rental regulations at all in areas such as I
have described? The laws of the province
should prevail.
When the Government decided to refer to
the Supreme Court of Canada the question of
the right of delegation of legislative powers to
controllers, 'we thought the reference would
deal specifically with the rental controller and
that some relief was in sight, and I for one
was surprised w'hen I found the reference was
confined to orders made by the chemical controller. His orders were unlikely to affect
farmers or property owners. The rental regulations are bearing so ýharshly upon property
owners that they have formed local associations
for the purpose of securing legal advice as to
exactly where they stand. I should have been
glad indeed had the Governiment decided to
bring the validity of the rental regulations
before the Supreme Court of Canada. In this
connection I think honourable members will
be interested in my reading, in part, this editorial which appeared in the Fortnightly Law
Journal of December 15, 1942:
We wonder why the choice did not fall on
some really coutroversial dictatorship like the
Rent Controller. At least we do not really
wonder, we know why. The answer is too
obvious. Too many people would be really
interested in seeing the powers of that
bureaucracy restricted to constitutional limits,
and besides that there is in that case a real
conflict of powers between the Dominion and
the provinces involved. The property owner
who is so vitally affected sot only by rent
control, but also by the inexcusable interference
with contractual rights involved in the provisions as to termination of leases and so on,
has organized for his own protection and so bas
the means at hand to obtain representation on
the hearing of any such reference, and it is
fairly obvious that such representation is not
only not desired, but is in fact made as far
as possible impractical under the form this
reference takes. In other words this reference
looks very much like an attempt to apply that
well known instrument, the whitewash brush,
through the medium of the courts. We suspect
all references, as we have said, and this reference more than any other.
I have also under my hand a resolution
which was passed by the Hamilton Law Association at a special meeting held on December
21, 1942. A copy of this resolution was, I
understand, sent to the Prime Minister and to
members of his Cabinet, and also to such
Government officials and members of the
House of Commons and the Senate as the
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE.

executive of the association might deem advisable.
This is the relevant part of the
resolution:
Now therefore be it resolved that the Hamilton
Law Association deplores the amendients to
said Order No. 108 of the Wartime Prices and
Trade Board, which came into effect on December 10, 1942, in so far as the said regulations
extend the period of time beyond three nonths
before an owner who has sold his rented property, or a purchaser who has purchased rented
property, can obtain possession of the same as
against the tenant, and this Association places
itself on record as being of the opinion that
the amendments to said Order No. 108, whicb
came into effect the 10th of December, 1942, in
so far as they extend the period of notice to a
tenant and the obtaining of vacant possession
of a property, should be revoked and repealed
forthwith.
Be it further resolved that if the Government
of the Dominion of Canada does not sec fit to
repeal and revoke the said amendment to said
Order No. 108 of the Wartime Prices and Trade
Board in so far as they affect the right to
vacant possession of rented premises by an
owner-vendor or a purchaser, then this Association suggests and asks that there be forthwith brought on for hearing by a proper and
competent court, having jurisdiction to adjudicate thereon, the question as to wbether the
Orders in Council passed pursuant to the War
Measures Act and the regulations made thereunder in so far as they assume to incorporate
the terms and provisions thereof into any
existing leases of real property, are ultra vires
of the Dominion.
It is my hope that these matters will come
before some competent court for decision at an
early date.
Now, honourable senators, what I have been
trying to show is that in my opinion there bas
been a sad lack of planning on the part of
the Government. Regulations have been made
one day and changed the next; new regulations have been made at a later date and then
again changed, until everybody is in confusion
as to what is the last regulation, and what it
means, and whether or not something has
happened that he knows nothing about. I
think the Government should have some
definite plan which would not benefit one part
of the country to the detriment of other parts,
particularly the rural parts of Western Canada.
Half-planning measures lead to dissatisfaction
and discontent. Just because a thing exists
in Ontario or the East is no reason why it
should exist in Western Canada. It seems to
me that the Government should be well
informed before taking any drastic action.
I had intended dealing with certain other
matters having to do with Western agriculture,
but, as I have already spoken at some length,
I will defer my remarks to a later date.

FEBRUARY 5, 1943
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Honourable senators, it is not my intention to speak at any
great length, but there are one or two paragraphs in the Speech from the Throne upon
which J want to touch.
First of all, Mr, Speaker, let me offer to
you my sincere congratulations upon your
elevation to the position you now hold. I am
sure you will acquit yourself with dignity and
impartiality, and I hope our long association
in the House of Commons may continue for
many years in this Chamber.
I also offer my congratulations to the mover
(Hon. Mr. Du Tremblay) and the seconder
(Hon. Mr. Davies) of the Address in reply
They
to the Speech from the Throne.
acquitted themselves very well of a task which
is not an easy one, as I know. I had the
privilege of seconding the Address in the other
House, and found it a rather nerve-racking
experience.
The atmosphere in this House and in Parliament to-day is to my mind a great improvement over the atmosphere that existed at the
opening of the session of Parliament last year.
Everybody seems to be in harmony; the unity
of the country is stronger than ever before,
and conditions as a whole in Canada are such
as we ought to be proud of and try to maintain. This atmosphere is the result of the
application of well-thought-out policies, and
the leadership of the Prime Minister and his
associates, who have refused to be stampeded
into adopting ill-considered policies advocated
inside and outside of Parliament. I think we
ought to be very careful to do nothing that
would bring about an atmosphere such as
existed at the opening of last session, or
would tend to undermine the Prime Minister
and his colleagues or our parliamentary institutions. I maintain that if we are not careful
to do everything in our power to show our
respect for existing authority, parliamentary
institutions will be discredited throughout the
country; and if they are discredited they are
destroyed, and there will be little left.
Another subject to which I wish to refer
before I deal with the Speech from the Throne
is the vicious attack on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation made by the Right Hon.
Arthur Meighen at the Progressive ConservaIt was not
tive convention at Winnipeg.
Progressive then; it did not become Progressive until the very last minute. To my
mind the names " Progressive " and " Conservative " are each a denial of the other. The
attack on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which plays a very important part
in our national life, was one of the most

vicious I have listened to. In that attack it
was not only the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation that was brought into questionHon. Mr. ASELTINE: Is the honourable
senator sure that the speech was broadcast?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I am talking, not
about the speech being broadcast, but about
the attack on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation by the Right Hon. Arthur Meighen
at the convention in Winnipeg. Not only did
he attack the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, but he left the impression that the
Government of Canada was to blame because
the Conservative convention did not have the
facilities of a national hook-up.
Hon. Mr. HORNER:

So it was.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Perhaps my honourable friend does not know as much about radio
broadcasting as I do. I was the Chairman of
the House of Commons Committee which in
1936 formulated the report that brought into
being the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation
as it is to-day, and its regulations. The committee was composed of members of Parliament from all parties in the House of Commons. The report was a unanimous one and
was incorporated in its entirety in the proposed legislation, and this was approved not
only by the House of Commons, but also by
the Senate of Canada, of which the Right
Hon. Arthur Meighen was at the time a
member. The purpose of that legislation was
to provide that the national broadcasting
system of Canada, because of its importance,
shou.d not be subject to political interference.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: The complaint made
by the Right Hon. Arthur Meighen and by
many other persons in Canada is that the
legislation has not been adhered to, and that
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is
being made a propaganda machine for a
certain party.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I do net agree with
the honourable gentleman, because the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to-day is entirely independent of the GovernmentHon. Mr. HAIG:

I will tell the honourable

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
The honourable
gentleman might accuse a person of belonging
to a certain political party, but since the
Winnipeg convention it has been very difficult
to know to what party some people belong.
The Board, of Governors of the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation is composed of
members from all parts of Canada, independently of politics.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:

What?

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
I could name
several who never took part in any political
activities-Mr. W. L. Brockington, and Mrs.
Nellie McClungHon. Mr. HAIG:
What is her political
record? She was a Iiberal member.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
Mrs. McClung
naturally opposed the political system that
existed, in Winnipeg between 1900 and 1914,
a system we were glad to get rid of in 1915.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: She was a Liberal member of the Alberta Legislature.
Hon. Mr. COPP:
qualify her.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:

That should not disNo, but she is a Liberal.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: That does not
affect the argument. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is not a Governmentcontrolled body; it is an independent body,
and the Act was so designed that there should
be no political interference.
Further, the
system of broadcasting on political affairs was
arrived at by a conference of all political
parties, C.C.F., Conservative, Liberal and
Social Credit, so that it would be as fair as
possible and give equal rights to all. What
did the Broadcasting Corporation do immediately after the conclusion of the Winnipeg
convention? It gave Mr. John Bracken, who
became the leader of the Progressive Conservative party, time over the national
network. My honourable friend from Winnipeg South-Centre (Hon. Mr. Haig) knows that
at all political conventions, whether national,
provincial or local, many things of a controversial nature are discussed. In Winnipeg,
for instance, there was a certain objection to
changing the name of the Conservative party.
I think that if the convention had not been
so well engineered and controlled by certain
elements the name would not have been
changed.
The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is doing a big job, of national
importance. If we continue to attack it and
'ther institutions which are created, not by
TIop.

Mr. BEAUBIEN.

the Government, but by the Parliament of
Canada, we shall be undermining the very
institutions we want to preserve. My honourable friend from Westmorland (Hon. Mr.
Black) said a couple of days ago that the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is "a
Government broadcasting agency." It is not
a Government broadcasting agency.
The
corporation was created by Parliament and is
independent of the Government.
Another thing I want to mention is that part
of the Speech from the Throne which deals
with social security, social insurance, and so
on. The debates that are going on to-day lead
me to believe that we talk about these
matters entirely from the industrial standpoint.
My honourable friend from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) gave us yesterday a very fine
address, in whioh he explained much about the
Beveridge report. He is one of those who
believe that a young country like this, with all
its natural resources and with so much of the
pioncer spirit among its people, should jump
into a scheme of social legislation such as
Great Britain, a country centuries old, has
just found out she needs.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: And has not adopted yet.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: We must not
overlook the fact that the Dominion of Canada
has a large rural population, which is very
important to the well-being of the country as
a whole.
Let us not be stampeded by
advocates of social legislation that might destroy individual initiative and create a situation detrimental to our people. If we are
going to have legislation to protect labour and
the industrial centres of Canada, the farming
population will be asking the Government for
insurance not only against crop failure, but
also against diminution in the quantity of
milk given by cows, and against all sorts of
things. The only point I want to make is
that if we embark upon a programme of social
legislation we cannot have it apply to the
uxban centres only.
Another interesting paragraph in the Speech
from, the Throne is this:
In accordance with the provisions of the
British North America Act you will be invited
to consider a Bill for the redistribution of
representation in the House of Commons.
If there is redistribution on the basis of the
last census, Manitoba will lose three seats in
the House of Commons, and Saskatchewan
four. Why should we lose those seats when the
fact is that our population has been reduced
solely on account of the war? The number of
enlistments from these two provinces in the
armed forces is as great as, if not greater than,
the number from any other part of Canada.

FEBRUARY 5, 1943
Besides, thousands and thousands of our men
and women have gone to Eastern Canadato Ontario or Quebec-where the industries
are. In these circumstances I think it is unfair to do away with seven of our seats. If
this redistribution takes place, then in addition to having our industries concentrated in
the East we shall also have representation in
the House of Commons concentrated in the
East.
I do not know whether under our Constitution a redistribution is compulsory at this
time, but if that is a fact I would suggest
that the Constitution be amended to provide
for postponement of redistribution until after
the next census. I think that is only fair when
you take into account the contribution that
these two Western provinces have made to
our war effort, through enlistments in the
armed services and the supplying of labour
for war industries. When the war is over, the
people will return to their homes from the
armed services and industries, and along with
them will be many new-comers, so that instead of our population being lower than
before, as it is now, it will be greater than
ever. I submit that in the meantime it would
be unfair to Manitoba and Saskatchewan to
deprive them of a total of seven seats in the
House of Commons, and I hope the honourable leader of the House (Hon. Mr. King) will
bring this matter to the attention of the Government, with a view to having redistribution
deferred, if at all possible, until after the next
census. If the Government can do that, it
will be only rendering justice to these
provinces.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable sonators, I wish to make a few remarks. Some
of them may not be strictly relevant to the
Speech from the Throne, but I understand
that on an occasion like this we are allowed
certain liberties.
First of all, I wish to congratulate Your
Honour upon your appointment to the high
position of Speaker of this Chamber.
I wish also to congratulate the mover (Hon.
Mr. Du Tremblay) and the seconder (Hon.
Mr. Davies) of the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne. I listened with particular interest to the seconder's remarks, and
I shall have something to say later on about
some of them.
The honourable senator from St. Jean
Baptiste (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) interjected
into his speech certain references to the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and this
brings me to mention a subj ect which is a
very sore one to me-the refusal of that
corporation to allow the Right Hon. Arthur
Meighen to reply over the radio to charges
made against him. I still maintain that the

55

Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is to some
degree controlled by the Government of
Canada. I have personally listened to Ministers of the present Government talking polities
over the air, attempting to show how well they
were doing in comparison with what had been
done in the last war. But although an attack
was made over the radio on a prominent public
man, the Right Hon. Arthur Meighen, who
gave thirty-five years of his life to serve the
people of this country, he is not allowed to
reply by the same medium. I am satisfied,
honourable senators, to leave to the people of
our country the question whether that is fair
treatment.
My honourable friend from St. Jean Baptiste criticized the party to which I belong for
adding the word " Progressive " to the party's
name. That criticism does not come very well
from him. There was a time when he himself
was quite proud of that word.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: I was not criticizing. I said that one word was a negation of
the other.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: At many meetings in
the West I have been challenged by radical
speeches, and have had to bear strongly to the
right; but after listening to most of the
speeches that have been made so far in this
debate I think I can afford to pull to the left.
In that way I hope to keep sailing down the
centre and avoid being wrecked on either
bank.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I remember one
meeting held in the West a year or so ago,
where the speakers were denouncing all governments and deploring the plight of the farmers.
On that occasion I went a good deal further
than the honourable senator from Saltcoats
(Hon. Mr. Calder) did here a couple of days
ago in pointing out the progress we have made
along socialistic lines. I reminded the meeting
that in Saskatchewan there were three sanitaria
at which our people could receive free examination at any time. We also have two large
mental hospitals in the province. Perhaps
some honourable senators may think we should
build an addition to one of those. The fact is
that we have gone a long distance in the
direction of Socialism. I take the honourable
seconder of the Address (Hon. Mr. Davies)
to be a rugged individualist and capitalist. The
trouble is, as I see it, that capitalism is off
the gold standard. We have mixed a great
deal of Socialism with our capitalism, and it is
something like mixing oil with water.
The honourable senator from Saltcoats
(Hon. Mr. Calder), in commenting upon the
great variety that there is among human

SENATE

beings, said they range between the two extremes of imbecility and genius. But he
neglected to say there is a great variety in the
principles that guide different people. If we
are to preserve democracy we must see to it
that control over public affairs is taken out of
the hands of people who have no principles, or
only bad ones. I agree with the suggestion of
the honourable senator from St. Jean Baptiste
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) that putting anything
like the Beveridge scheme into effect in a new
ountry like ours, wbose people have the
pioneer spirit, would be a very difficult thing
and vastly different from putting it into effect
in England. In my opinion we shall not need
sucb a scheme in Canada if the geniuses without any principle are taken off our backs.
There are always going on a number of
deals in which the publie play the role of
sucker. Take the organization of many of our
life insurance companies. When their stock
is first sold to the public, the purpose of the
game is to rob the ordinary man. I should
like to tell honourable members about one
instance of this kind, without mentioning the
company's name. The men who were taken
in by the scheme were poor, and, perhaps you
will say, in the imbecile class. Two or three
of the brightest salesmen who could be secured
combed the entire country for any persons who
had a thousand or two thousand dollars to
invest, and sold them stock in the company at
$45 a share. These salesmen represented that
the stock really was not for sale at this price,
as it was certain to go to $60 right away, but
they had asked their head office for permission
to visit their victinis, whom they flattered by
trcating them as outstanding citizens for whom
tbey had received a number of shares at an
attractive price. About twenty-two years afterwards this same stock, some of which I held,
sold at from $4 to $5 a share.
But that 'is nat the worst part of it. Salesmen of that type are said to be financial
geniuses. Many of them are, in the sense
tat they knew exactly what had happened to
other companies, and to them there was
nothing wrong in taking money from "the
great unwashed."
About four years after those fellows had
dlone their work, another superman arrived
in the village, phoned out to the farmers
in the district and invited those Who wished
to seil their stock to see him. He would nat
take the tiue to go ont to them. He offered
the farmers who came in $10 a share for their
stock. J said to him, "Did you bear I was
-iarving ta death?" "Well," be said, "I have
bought 400 shiares." That is just a sample of
what bappened in this instance.
lon. MNr.HORNER.

The late Senator Burns told me the story of
how his company was sold to the public. The
same sort of thing happened in that case. The
men as-ociated with that business understood
exactly the arnount of capital it could pay
dividends on-something which, of course, the
average Canadian citizen did not know. He
was not familiar with the packing business, but
be knew the company had been prosperous
under the Burns management, and naturally
lie wished to buy dividend-paying stock to put
into the family stocking. In a few years' time
all that stock was back in the hands of the
men who at the time of floating the company
had deliberately planned its manipulation for
their own enriclment.
Such as been the practice rigbt along. A
few years ago an investment trust company
was organized in the city of Montreal. Very
intelligent men with sanctimonious faces
travelled throughout the West and assured
prospective investors that they 'would get 7 per
cent interest on their investment in the company. Many a labouring man asked me when
I was going to Montreal to find ont what had
bappened to the company. Well, I found that
93 per cent of the capital had disappeared.
By means of interlocking directorates and
skilful manipulation the investment of those
poor people was virtually wiped out.
Honourable members, this kind of thing must
be stopped. The people of Canada are
asking foi legislation to protect themn fron
tiese so-called financial geniuses.
I would suggest to the Government that
every life insurance company in the Dominion
should bu nationalized. I said so when Parliament passed the Unemployment Insurance
Bill. Now bere is a cry for social and health
insurance. How are you going to put it into
effect? I hope we shall nat have to apply to
this proposed measure of social security the
words we have heard in relation to the war:
"Too little and too late."
We need State medicine, particularly in regard to drugs. In several municiipalities of
Western Canada ire have had for a number
of years a fori of State medioine. Many
doctors I have spoken to are strongly in favour
of it up to a certain point.
I come now to the marketing of cattle. I
should like to se the 'Government take over
every stock-yard. The placing of a ceiling
price on beef has proved a money-making
proposition for the packing companies, but
from the cattlemen's point of view it has been
a buge farce. Nat long ago Canadian Packers
Limited was fined severely -in Quebec. If our
anti-combine laws were being enforced, that
company would never have been organized in

FEBRUARY 5, 1943
the first place. What purpose do the stockyards serve now that we are at war? The
farmer takes in a load of cattle for sale. Hie
finds a whoie army of men assembled there,
and they pound the animais with canes to,
separate them and weigh each one in order
to take advantage of the odd pounda and the
break of the beam. I have killed'my own
beef and I can tell what weight an animal will
dress, and what it will be on the hoof. Alter
the cattie have been weighed as I have
described, they are presumed to be sold to the
commission men, but alter you go back home
there is a resale to, the packers. That is the
way our public cattie markets are being run.
Packing companies buy cattle at 9 cents a
pound and selI as though they had paid at the
rate of 12 cents a pound. The Government
shouid take over the yards, put in inspectors,
send the cattie to the slaughter-houses as
they can handle them, and credit the cattieman with the proceeds. Our people are dissatisfied with the manner in which the stockyards are conducted to-day.
I would remind honourable senators that the
men who have lef t our province and gone
overseas to fight for freedom know the conditions which I am describing, and I honestiy
believe that for the wcifare of this country we
must do something to encourage their morale.
For this purpose the measures I speak of are,
I believe, absoiutely essential. We have
encouraging evidence froma Russia of how well
soidierswili fight when thcy believe they have
an organization which is reaily worth fighting
for. 1 believe, honourabie senators. that these
reforms should corne, and corne now,' in order,
as I say, to, build up the moraile (if the men who
are overseas fighting for our freedorn. I notice
several members in the other House have ýbeen
referring to what was promised our soidiers
in the last war. At that time it was the wish
of ail public men-and I believe they meant
every word of what they said-that this
country shouid be made fit for heroes to. live
in. But unfortunately, because of the conditions I have mentioned, our veterans were
robbed of the very money the Govern.ment
gave them on demobilization. Although we
prohibit betting, thousands of gamibling
rackets are being operated by men whom we
caill financial geniuses, but whose poor dupes
are rcferred to by iess flattering naines. We
know of a great genius who rob'bed his own
country of 820,000,000. Hie robbed thousands
of people, even ýmembers of his own family.
Hoan. Mr. LACASSE: Hie was a wizard.

57

Hon. Mr. HORNER: 1 refer to Ivan
Kruger. He was an amazing man. It is the
duty of a Government to put a check on that
sort of thing.
I do not suppose I shall get any praise from
the packing companies or the insurance companies, but I feel 1 have done my duty in
giving expression to these views.
Hon, W. E. FOSTER: Honourable senators,
I rise to make a few remarks on the customary document which is before us for consideration and approval, namcily the Speech frorn
the Throne. Before, however, dealing with
some of the matters rcferred to therein, I
should like to follow the traditional practice
of extendmng my congratulations to those
chosen to perform the duty of moving and
seconding the motion for the adoption of the
Address. The speeches by the inover (Hon.
Mr. Du Trernblay) and the seconder (Hon.
Mr. Davies) were full of information and demonstrated that these honourable gentlemen
can speak as wcil as th.ey can write, and, as
honourabie senators know, they are both outstanding newspaper men. They are an added
strength to the Senate.
As is the customn also, we have heard the
honourable leader of the Governinent (Hon.
Mr. King) and the honourable leader on the
other side (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) on the
Speech from the Throne. The honourable
leader of the Bouse supported the speech,
whiic, as was to bcecxpected, the honourable
leader opposite vicwed it critically. 1 may say
that the Speech from the Throne does not
leave very much roomn for criticism, and I
have ahl the more reason to congratulate my
honourable friend fromn Aima (Hon. Mr.
Bailantyne) on his excellent address.
We have frequentiy heard it stated that
the debate on the Speech from the Throne is
a waste of time and an unnecessary expense.
and that it adds littie to public information.
I have neyer thought so, provided the debate
is confined to a reasonable period of time. Wc
should bear in mind that the member of a
legislative body represents the people with
whomn he is more or less in personal contact,
and this enables him. to give expression to
their views on the floor of the House, so that
they may be circulated- among the public
generally.
I wish, Mr. Speaker, to add my congratulations to the many you have already reccived
from honourable members who have preceded
me in this debate. As I once occupied the
Chair, I arn better able to appreciate the
advantages, and the disadvantages, if there
be any, that accompany the high position you now occupy. During the term of

SENATE
office of any Speaker there is sure to arise
something of particular importance which
makes a deep impression on his mind, that is,
something happening outside the usual routine.
That occurred in my day on a Saturday
evening in September, 1939, and was of such
a character that it left a vivid impression on
my mind. It was the motion for the adoption
of the Speech from the Throne, which, in
effect, was a declaration of war on Germany.
I shall never forget the tense atmosphere
that prevailed and the emotion I experienced
when I rose to put the resolution to the
Senate. That was an historie occasion. It
reminded us that Canada had achieved independence, for there had been written into
statute law our right either to remain neutral
or to declare war. Parliament voted unanimously to stand by Britain and declare war
on Germany.
When I had the honour of being appointed
a member of this body I thought it well to
ascertain what my duties would be and how
I could best perform them. I knew that it
was a life appointment and, that I should
have to plan accordingly. I realized that I
was through with the task of endeavouring to
persuade the electors that what I stood for
was in their interest, or that I was a suitable
person to represent them. Of course, I was
not always able to persuade them, but the
balance was on the right side. The appointment also brought with it a realization that
I was not representing any particular unit or
constituency, and, that I was under no obligation to address myself to the electors, but
rather that it was my duty from, time to
time to give attention to questions as a whole
and ta their effect on the country and
the
people generally. I realized that this branch
of Parliament was so designed that there
should be an equality of representation from
the different sections of the country, and that
together the members would deal with any
sectional questions which might arise, and
would safeguard and maintain the autonomy
of the provinces. I also learned that the
main function of the Senate was to revise
legislation coming from the other branch of
Parliament, and, in 'extreme cases, to hold up
what might be regarded as hasty or ill-advised
measures. Therefore, in my view, I was to
become a part of our democratic legislative
machinery, which would deal with legislation
emanating from a Government that had been
chosen by the people to carry on their affairs.
Truc it is that private legislation can
Driginate here and be passed along to the
other Chamber. This is a method, I think,
Hon. Mr. FOSTER.

which should be encouraged, as private legislation is something that is shorn, of any political complexion and can be effectively and
carefully dealt with by this Chamber, particularly in the early days of the session.
My honourable friend from West Central
Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) spoke of
certain criticisms which have been made from
time ta time. I am sure other honourable
members have noticed them also. I would, nat,
even if I couldi, mention the source from
which some of those criticisms come, for, if
I did, His Honour the Speaker would call me
to order. I cannot but feel, however, that
some of the criticisms which I have read or
heard from time ta time must have emanated
from among those who would not want a body
or a branch of Parliament possessing power
to hold up what might be regarded by the
majority of the people as ill-advised or hasty
legislation. For this reason one can readily
understand why such comments are made, and
imagine where they originate. It has also
been advocated in some quarters that our provincial legislatures should be abolished. May
I say that if these suggestions for the tearing
asunder of our established institutions are pursued further, it may be that this branch of
Parliament will be found more useful than
some of our critics believe it to be. As one
who is now moving towards the shady side of
life, I would say: Hold on to that which has
We have the best form of
proved good.
government in the world. Do not tamper with
something that millions of people in the wartorn world would give their souls to possess.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. FOSTER: Honourable members,
there are reasons why this body is not more
prominent in the public eye. One is that we
are not good advertisers.
Possibly, after
listening ta the words of the mover and. the
seconder of the Address and considering the
line of their activities, we may take a lesson
and improve our position in this respect.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: With their cooperation.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: We have not been
advertisers. We have done our work without
any blare of trumpets. Furthermore, in doing
that work we have not found it necessary to
indulge in a great flow of talk. Of course, the
situation at the present time is more apparent,
as there is less legislation to be dealt with than
there would be in peace-time.
The War
Measures Act has been utilized, and properly
so. You cannot fight a desperate war, such as
the one in which we are engaged, without delegating broad powers to the Government.

FEBRUARY 5,1943

Prompt action is necessary in innumerable
cases in which the delay occasioned by the
passing of legislation might jeopardize the
undertaking. Therefore the Government is
clothed with wide powers under this Act, to
bring into being such laws or regulations as
are necessary to meet situations promptly
when they occur.
The criticism offered at the present time and
under the particular circumstances is hardly
fair. This is not a good time to give utterance to statements which have a tendency to
weaken the faith of the people in our political
institutions--and this branch of Parliament is
part and parcel of our form of government,
which, as I have said, is the best form of
government in the world. It provides the
greatest degree of protection for the life and
property of the individual and for the civil
and religious liberties of al. As I stand here
giving expression to my views I cannot but
think of the freedom which we enjoy and the
privileges which are still ours-things of which
so many people in this world have been deprived, all through one man's lust for power.
I am afraid we do not appreciate or fully
realize how close we have been to losing this
freedom whioh we treasure so highly.
Earlier in my remarks I referred to certain
events which I had the privilege of experiencing when occupying the position of Speaker
of this House. One which will always remain
fresh in my memory is that, because of my
position, I had the advantage of conversing
more frequently with the late 'Governor
General, Lord Tweedsmuir, than otherwise
would have been the case. Since then I have
also been interested in reading some of his
literary works. Recently I have been reading
again a book written by this man with the
quite ordinary name of John Buchan. It is
entitled "Memory Hold-the-Door." In this
wonderful book, which was published after -the
author's death, he wrote something bearing
upon the privilleges and the freedom of the
people-privileges and freedom Which we the
people of Canada enjoy. I think it might be
well at this stage ta quote from this publication a statement by this wonderful writer.
He says:
For centuries we have enjoyed certain blessings; a stable law, before which the poor man
and the rich man were equal; freedom within
that law to believe what we pleased, to write
what we pleased, to say what we pleased; a
system of government which gave the ultimate
power to the ordinary man. We have lived by
toleration, rational compromise and freely expressed opinion, and we have lived very well.
But we had come to take these blessings for
granted, like the air we breathed. They had
lost all glamour for us since they had become
too familiar. Indeed, it was a mark of the

59

intellectual to be rather critical and contemptuous of them. Paradoxical young men acquired
a cheap reputation by sneering at the liberal
spirit in politics, and questioning the value of
free discussion, toleration and compromise.
To-day we have seen those principles challenged in the fundamentals, not by a few armchair theorists, but by great Powers supported
by great armies. We have suddenly discovered
that what we took for the enduring presuppositions of our life are in danger of being
destroyed. To-day we value freedom, I think,
as we have not valued it before. Just as a man
never appreciates his home so much as when
he is compelled to leave it, so now we realize
our inestimable blessings when they are threatened. We have been shaken out of our smugness
and warned of a great peril, and in that warning
lies our salvation. The dictators have done us
a marvellous service in reminding us of the true
values of life.
That, honourable members, was written by
the late Governor General. In addition to his
abilities as an author, he was a true sportsman, and I have enjoyed talking with him
about the pleasures of endeavouring to induce
that king of fish the Atlantic silver salmon to
rise to the fly-a pastime at Which I think the
honourable the Leader of the Government tries
his skill with varying degrees of fortune.
Honourable members, it is not my intention
to speak at great length. The Speech from
the Throne refers to a number of subjects.
It tells us that a study will be made of a
proposed national system of social insurance
and security. Such a study will take some
time, and after it is concluded it may be
opportune to bring forward some measures of
the kind suggested in the Speech. In this
respect I think it is well for us ta bear in
mind that the end of the war is not so near
that undue haste is necessary in dealing with
such matters. My experience in public life
bas been that remedies too speed-ily applied
sometimes produce evils greater than those
we seek to cure. But I must say I was
greatly impressed by the argument advanced
by the honourable senator from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) in favour of our taking
action as early as possible. It is true that
if social legislation of this kind were passed
in various countries it would probably bring
about a greater spirit of contentment among
the peoples and perhaps indirectly help to
hasten the end of the war.
But, honourable senators, we must not conclude that the governments of the provinces,
under whose jurisdiction health laws and
certain social legislation are administered, have
taken no action at all to improve the living
conditions of our people. The 'fact is that
for the past twenty years or more a steady
improvement has been made in this respect.
At least, I know that is so in the province
from which I come.

60

SENATE

I have had some experience in the evolving
of laws for social reforms. When I entered
public life I may have possessed some ideals,
and probably had some illusions. That was
not very long ago, but I could not help viewing with alarm the conditions then prevailing
with respect to the care of the poor and
needy, and the utter lack of regulations for
safeguarding the health of the rising generation. I was approached by an eminent medical
doctor who was willing to join me in efforts
to improve conditions. I mention this because, although it may not be of great interest
to honourable members present, I wish to
place on the records of the country some
testimony to the splendid work done by that
gentleman. He entered the provincial Government of New Brunswick for the particular
purpose of establishing a Department of
Health, and he became the first Minister of
Health in the British Empire. He naturally
encountered many difficulties. His efforts and
plans were opposed-and the schemes suggested
in the Speech from the Throne will be
similarly opposed-by people who regarded
social legislation as encroacbment upon the
liberties of the individual.
This eminent physician, who became. as I
say, the first Minister of Health in the British
Empire, agreed to serve for a time in that
capacity without salary. As it was not possible to obtain suffc.ient money to establish
the reforms lie deemed necessary for properly
administering the department he decided to
set up, be appealed to one of the generously
endowed institutions in the United States, I
think the Rockefeller Foundation, to whom he
outlined his plans for social services in our
province. So impressed was that Foundation
witb his proposals, particularly with his plan
for appointment of district nurses to serve the
poor people, that it agreed to furnish, and did
furnish for a considerable number of years a
large sum of money to help along his great
work. He established medical inspection in
the publie schools of our province. That was
a revolutionary thing in those days, because
people did not understand the necessity for
regular inspection of children by doctors. He
also establisbed district clinies and serum
depots, which rendered invaluable service on
the threat of any outbreak of smallpox, diphtheria or disease of that kind.
But he ran up against most serious opposition when he tried to bring about compulsory
pasteurization of milk. That was something
so novel to the minds of the people that when
he came up for re-election he was defeated. I
should say that up to that time in no province
at all was pasteurization of milk compulsory.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER.

In the election campaign his opponent contended that if nature had intended milk to
undergo treatment such as proposed, the
machine for the purpose would have been
within the cow. However, the Minister was
later re-elected, and continued his good work,
but died in office. A monument stands to-day
on the grounds of the Parliament Buildings at
Fredericton to the memory of this pioneer
in the great public health movement, the
Honourable W. F. Roberts, M.D.
I mention this case, honourable senators.
because I think it is well to bear in ýmind that
our governments, federal and provincial, have
net been unmindful of the welfare of the
individual. The proposals made in the Speech
from the Throne are but an extension of
measures that we trust will eventually be
joined, with the co-operation of the provinces,
mnone great movement.
Honourable members, I will not take up
more time just now. At a later date, when
these measures of social legislation come before
us. we shall be in a better position te discusi
the whole question, for then we shall know
definitely what steps are proposed. I wish only
to say again that I was very much impressed
with the speech of the honourable senator
from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen).
No
doubt many honourable members are often
invited, as I am, to address various societies
and service clubs, and it seems te me that
whenever we have occasion to discuss the proposed social measures the speech of the honourable senator from Inkerman migbt well be
referred to for information, not only as to the
benefits to be derived from them, but also as
to their cost to the taxpayers. His speech
must have been preceded by very extensive
research.
I hope, honourable senators, to deal at a
later time with other matters referred to in the
Speech from the Throne.
Hon. EUGENE PAQUET (Translation):
On January 27 the political party leaders
paid tribute to the new Speaker of this
House. I wish to join them in tendering
him my congratulations on his appointment
to the high position he now occupies. I am
sure that be will fulfil the duties of that
high office in a manner befitting the best
traditions of the Senate.
The clouds of unrest which toward the
end of the summer of 1942 were darkening
the horizon in the United Nations have
lifted, if not entirely, alt least enough to
let us glimpse the dawn of victory. I consider that our young country's achievements
have been wonderful.
I wish to do justice
to our people, who, without any distinction

FEBRUARY 5, 1943
of party, race or creed, have given their
support to the Government. In the tremendous task accomplished we have proved that
those races which make up the population of
Canada are actuated by the same patriotie
feeling that moved their forebears.
Since the Jast session of the Dominion Parliament the Government has floated its third
war boan. iFinancial sacrifices must be made
in order that we may prosecute the war and
achieve victory. That is a tremendous task,
but it can and must be successfully. accomplished.
I wish to quote the following message issued
by His Eminence Cardinal Villeneuve in
connection with the third Victory Loan:
The Canadian Government is floating its third
War Loan.
It is doing this for obvious reasons: the war
goes on with vicissitudes that make it more and
more cruel and are bound to bring it nearer
and nearer tu us. Neither courage nor optimism
can persuade us that we shall be cornpletely
spared on our shores and even inland. Recent
events indicate the opposite.
Already a great many of our men have shed
their bloofi, and they will expect us at least to
support thema financially, so that their efforts
inay be strengthened and victory ultimately wvon.
On the other hand, economists recognize that
the investment of our savings in Government
bonds is an efficient and neeessary way of protecting ourselves against inflation and post-war
economie upheavals. That is why we encourage
and exhort our faithful to respond according
10 their means to the appeal made by the
authorities. That is essentially an act of higb
patriotism and economie prudence which supernatural intentions may render quite deserving
in the eyes of God.
To the sacrifices that are necessary, we shall
add our prayers, so that the Lord of victory
and peace may bestow His mercy and, justice
on the world and free it from war and iniquity.
In supporting that Ioan we are taking the
course that is necessary for the salvation of
our country, for our survival and for the
defence of our Christian ideals. On hearing
the call to arms, our fellow-citizens have
volunteered and joined the Allied troops for
the defence of their country and the destrucSince the
tion of Prussian militarism.
heginning of this war. the Min.ister of Finance bas exhorted the people to heed the
appeals of the authorities, wbo ask the Canadian people to practise tbrift and lend to
the Government wbat they can save. Foresight, whicb is a personal duty, becomes a
national duty in the present circumstances.
The Canadian people are prepared to make
heavy sacrifices in order to ensure final
victory for the Allies, but they would neyer
condone abuses in the bandling of the funds
entrusted to the Government.
Our coun.try is seriously tbreatened, and
if we are to save lier we must accept tbe
greatest sacrifices. The war effort of Canada
requires buge sums of money. Taxes alone

61

cannot suffice. Loans must be resorted to,
so that the taxpayers' nioney may belp the
nation's cause. The enemy spares no effort
to maintain the efficiency of bis armed
forces.
Let us ponder the words of tbe Minister
of Finance:
All Canadians will generously co-operate in
order to ensure a striking success for the next
Victory Loan, so tbat we may give the enemy
a furtber indication of our staunch resolve to
vanquieli him, w-hile setting at the saine time
a good example for our neighboure.
Frencb-speaking Canadians ensured the success of the last boan because they considered
the threat to the Allies as a menace to freedom everywhere, evea in the province of
Quebec. In the great task that lies before us,
we must show no besitation wbatever. We
must flgbt for the eternal. principles laid down
by the Creator-for justice, wbich protects
human rigbts; for charity, which mitigates
unavoidable bardships. We must win the war
at ail costs. Sucb is the thougbt that should
be uppermost in our minds at tbis time.
If we lose the war we shaîl sink into an
abyss of untold misery. Freedoms gained
througb struggle snd saccifice will ail be
destroyed if we lose the war. As has been
said on many occasions, certain people should
stop disparaging democracy and endeavour,
ratber, to save it. Let us make every necessary effort to remedy its imperfections. The
Prime Minister of Canada pointed out one
of tbe remedies the other day, when be said
tbat "we ougbt to utilize our resources and
ability to meet tbe needs rather than the greed
of mankind; we should, above ail, endeavour
to use our natural resources for the conservation of our man-power and the betterment of
tbe bealth and welfare of the whole
population."
Il may not be untimely to quote wbat was
said hy Mr. E. Bevin, Minister of Labour in
Great Britain, in connection witb Canada's
war effort:
The British Government are aoxjous that the
Press should properly recognize the effort which
Canada is accomplishing in this war. The
Dominion entered tbe confiict at the very heginning, and it devotes all its energies to it. 1
can assure you that f rom the standpoint not only
of the armed forces, but also of production,
Canada is rapidly moving toward the rationalization of armament production. Besides being
confronted with problems like those which we
in this country must solve, Canada is ready to
co-operate promptly in the building of ships,
aircraft and so on. In otber words. Canada
shows lier eagerness to collaborate with Great
iBritain and to meet this country's needs.
Tbat statement constitutes an important
tribute to Canada's achievements in tbe Allied
cause.

U2L

SENATE

As bas already been said in this House, we
are all agreed that victory must be won.
However, I am not alone in thinking that, in
the circumstances, the utmost clear-sightedness
and a well reasoned prudence will be needed
to cope with the general confusion that will
not only possibly but probably result from
the present confliet. Hence the opinions which
have been voiced, in Canada as well as in the
United States, with regard to post-war problems. It is therefore imperative that we
should foresee as far as possible their consequences in every field.
Some people are beginning to discuss the
need of immigration.
After the war of
1914-18 serious mistakes were made in the
matter of immigration. No sooner had the
European war come to a conclusion than we
were opening our doors to thousands and
thousands of immigrants who, ten years later,
were on Government relief, either because they
had been unable to adapt themselves to the
conditions of life in Canada, or because our
economy could not absorb so large a number
of immigrants.
Here are the immigration figures from the
end of the Great War to 1930: 1918, 31,845;
1919, 107,698; 1920, 138,824; 1921, 91,728;
1922, 64,224; 1923, 133,886; 1928, 166,783;
1929, 164,993; 1930, 104,806. At the very
beginning of the depression, the Liberal
Government having been defeated, there was
a departure from such a thoughtless policy.
In 1931, the number of immigrants fell to
27,530. During those years, the British Isles
were prominent in the immigration figures:
1919, 57,251; 1920, 75,804; 1921, 43,772; 1922,
31,005; 1923, 70,110; 1924, 57,612; 1925, 35,362;
1926, 48,819; 1927, 52,940; 1928, 55,848; 1929,
66,801; 1930, 31,709. But the United Kingdom
could not without danger suffer such a loss of
population. Consequently, from 1926 ta 1930,
with the exception of 1929, foreign countries
sent us a much larger number of immigrants
than Great Britain and Ireland.
What happened to the new-comers? Some
of them have had a remarkable success in
politics, in the civil service, in finance, in
industry and in the Press. But, on the whole,
very few have achieved a great measure of
success. Most of them have lived from hand
ta mouth. Some have even been destitute.
In February, 1934, there were 1,154,822 persons on relief; in February, 1935, there were
still 1,054,821. Of course, those who were on
unemployment relief were not all immigrants.
Many of the new-comers had obtained positions formerly occupied by Canadians. This
was a cause of discontent and grievance.
Canadians have a very sad recollection of that
'infortunate period. They certainly do not
Hon. Mr. PAQUET.

want to see a repetition of it. They are undergoing enough sacrifices in this war ta be
entitled to what our English-speaking fellowcitizens call social security, that is, a reasonable
protection against unemployment, destitution,
and uncertainty. As was stated by Mr. Omer
Ieroux:
Things must be faced as they are. Undoubtedly, there is now being prepared for the
post-war period a policy of mass immigration.
It is imperative that we should determine as
soon as possible its probable effeets and consider the attitude that must be taken about it.
There can be no question of closing our doors
to all people from other countries, but the first
duty of those in power is towards the people
who have developed this country, and towards
their children. Let us not, in the vain hope of
promptly improving conditions brought about by
the war, run the risk of making the position
of our present population worse, or of disturbing
the economic, the social and even the political
balance in Canada. Everyone realizes that, from
those three points of view, the sudden arrival
of too large a number of people from the outside might have alarming effects.
At any rate, one thing must be kept in mind.
One of the serions problems that will arise in
the post-war period will be connected with
immigration-such immigration as, for varions
reasons, many people with powerful means of
action at their command want to see carried out
extensively and promptly.
That is one of the points which we should
not overlook.
Let us now see what another writer bas
to say in this connection:
After the sad experience of the last thirteen
years Canadians are no longer interested in
false doctrines expounded by people whose concern is to lessen the burden of other nations
rather than the load which their own country
must bear. Our post-war problems will be
numerous and overwhelming. No serious-minded
man tries to wave them aside under some pretext or other. But it would be utter folly to
think that any sudden and important increase
in population could make easier the solution of
our financial, industrial and agricultural difficulties. It would certainly make them worse.
We no longer live in the days of the Far West,
when there was no objection to migrations
taking place under the worst conditions of the
struggle for life. The tillable land now available
is anything but plentiful. Canada bas not the
same climate as the United States. Neither
has it the diversified wealth of that country.
To make a comparison between the United
States' population and ours, as an argument
in support of immigration, is to show a lack
of knowledge of the true situation of both
countries.
The worst feature of this new campaign is
that it threatens the 700,000 Canadians who
have volunteered for service or have been called
up for training. They were told that the
struggle was for freedom, for a new and better
order, for the security of their homes, for a
greater degree of prosperity in Canada. They
were pronised the gratitude of their country.
These soldiers have been led to expect some
consideration.
But now that they are in
England, guarding strategic points since 1940,
or in their corvettes sailing the seas, to protect

FEBRUARY 5, 1943
convoys, or taking part in the fight for aerial
supremacy, there is talk here of inviting
thousands of immigrants to take over available
fari or to crowd into the industrial or mining
towns, tbereby increasing the number of workers.
Concerning this strange project our soldiers read
articles composed by persons who plan for the
post-war period in the s .ame way as they contribute to the war effort, that is, by writing
fine words in the comfort of their editorjal
offices. However, our soldiers f ail *to see any
serious effort on our part-if serious effort there
is-to prepare for their retuTn, to masure their
re-employment, to guarantee that they shail be
in a position to earn their living.
This campaign to promote immigration appears
to be an inappropriate and cynical enterprise.
Does it not tend to discourage commendable
effort and self-sacrifice?
We are faced with tremendous problema,
the most serious of which is surely that of
our youth. They are entitled to the opportunity of preparing their own career, and it
is our duty to ensure their future. When we
are already planning for the post-war period
ive muet not forget that our first obligation
is to see that the youth of the present generation are properly equipped in the intellectual
field. They -muet receive the best possible
training in ahl branches of knowledge: science,
technology, craftsmanship, agriculture, without
forgetting the sphere of higher
knowledge,'
which is of such paramount importance in the
training of future leaders.
The Governinent,
in order to prevent the post-war period from
being too gloomy, should allow the students
to complete their studies in law, arts and
literature.
To settlc the labour question, let Mr. King
revive the splendid programme hie outlined in
June, ý1940. To win the war, said the Right
Honourable Prime Minister in 1940, our
mnen must continue to work in the bush
to produce the lumber necessary for the
construction of wharves, buildings and other
projects immediately required; they must
continue to wark in factories where they
will performi tasks infinitely more useful to
the country, by applying their skill to the production of airplanes, munitions and other war
material, than what they could do by offering
themselves for military training; the farmers
must continue to operate their farms so as
to supply, with the least possible delay, ail the
agricultural produets necessary to the fulifi-

ment of our task.

In Canada,

industry is a

corollary to agriculture, by reason of a natural
evolutionary process. After man took possession of new territory hie endeavoured to draw
his sustenance from the soi], handing over any
surplus to the traders. The problem, of agriculture at the present timne deserves the highest
consideration. If we had kept more men on
the farin, if we had put more men to work in
shipyards, we could supply more food to

6

Europe, and we should have more shi.ps to
transport it, more naval units to convoy it
across the Atlantic, and, consequently, less
reason to put our people on the ration system.
One of the main factors of the present situation is that we have sent too many men to
the armed forces, but have not kept a sufficient
number for the f arms and the shipyards.
According to a comprehensive survey, 250,000 farmers have already been mobilized. They
are ail hardy young men whose work on the
farins was of the utmost importance. . In
spite of the increasing nceds of agriculture and
the shipyards, more men have been mobilized
for the army. To shorten the war it is imperative that our soldiers be supplied with the
necessary food.
Here is what the editor of Le Devoir wrote
on January 30, 1943:
To win the war hundreds and thousands of
soldiers are not enough. Among other things,
we muet know what our needs are in coreparison
with those of other countries; we must organize
our agriculture instead of depleting its manpower; we muet encourage and help this industry
to increase its production; and, above ahl, we
must use common sense, practical comynon sense
based on a thorough consideration of present
factors, facto and statisties. Who will ever
believe that common sense inspired the rationing
of such a domestie product as butter, a produet
which is the more necessary to our people because of our severe climate, and it is particularly
severe at the present time, when our population
has a greater need than ever of so-called protective foods sucli as butter, eggs, green vegetables, raw fruit and oils? But Canadiens more
and mýore have to do without them, not only
because thoughtless orders have been passed, but
also because production and importation are
increasingly impaired and the regular markets
disorganized. The rationing of tea, coffee and
even sugar is understandable: they are ahl
imported goods. But people have to do with
less butter than previously, at a time when it
is needed more than ever before.
We are
allowed about 5 ounces of butter a week as
against 40 ounces of àlcohol....
As a former physician of Bonaventure I may
be allowed to caîl attention to the Fourth
Co-operative Congress, held at Gaspé Seminary on October 27 last. The leading citizens
of the Gaspé peninsula met under the enlightened leadership of His Excellency the Bishop
of Gaspé, Msgr. F. X. Ross. The inidefatigable promoter of social welfare wished to
show the co-operators of Gaspé bis afppreciation. of the task they have undertaken; the
social, moxal and material progress of the
Gaspé peninsula.
The Fourth Co-operative Congress of Gaspé
is a milestone on the road to progress, mutual
understanding and union of ail the co-operators
of the Gaspé peninsula. It bas been for everyone a source of hope and inspiration as well as
a proof of the power already wielded by the
co-operative movement of tbis district.

SENATE
Provided they remain faithful to the prinuiples of co-operation, and show initiative, the
co-operators feel positive of contributing to
the establishment of not only a new, but a
better order.
The fishermen and navigators of Gaspé, the
Lower Saint Lawrence and the North Shore
are not satisfied with the manner in which the
three National Defence departments have
been administered. Therefore, at the election
of Charlevoix-Saguenay, the electors refrained
of
these
the
policies
from
approving
departments.
The Hon. Minister of Justice, at a banquet
ield in the Lapointe-Drouin Club, stated that
the ships sunk in the Saint Lawrence river
numbered only 10 to 15 and that measures
lad been taken to remedy the situation. I
have carried on my profession for a period of
18 years in the centre of Gaspé peninsula, and
in the midst of all the dangers to which this
district is exposed. I thank Mr. Sasseville
Roy, federal member for Gaspé, for his efforts
to see that a reasonable and efficient defence
policy be applied in the region of the Lower
Saint Lawrence.
Why is net the strategic Gaspé highway,
continually mentioned in the past two years,
already started? Not only do politicians speak
about it, but, on October 22 last, Mr. LouisPhilippe Roy, one of the editors of L'Action
Catholique, wrote as follows concerning the
dlefence of the Saint Lawrence:
It is now evident that all the doubting
Thomases have been convinced. However, the
whole population of the country, and especially
that of the province of Quebec, are wondering
wvlhether our river is sufficiently protected
against Axis submarines.
A statement from the Minister of Naval
Services has raised the following question in
the minds of many people: Are the convoys as
well protected in the Saint Lawrence river and
gulf as they are on the Atlantic?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald stated recently that our
naval forces uow comprised 500 warships and
that our units were assuming nearly one-third
of all convoy missions on the ocean.
We

have

reason

to

be

proud

of

sucl

an

achievement.
We nay well feel proud of the long road
covered since 1939, of the great progress realized.
However, should we not be the first to benefit
froin the marvellous development of our navy?
Is not the first duty of a nation towards itself,
as Hon. Mr. St. Laurent stated in the Comnons
recently? We are glad that our ships protect
convoys across the Atlantic, but we wish this
protection to start at Father Point.
Once more, we do not wish to protect our
interests exclusively; we should not like to
umobilize all our ships for service in our waters
only. But we do ask that eneny submarines
be first chased away from our river. We suggest that steps be taken to prevent submarines
froin parading in sight of our shores, even
though they may not be as numerons as the
ppoular imagination makes them.
Hon. Mr. PAQUET.

We approve wbat the English newspaper of
bas published on this subject. Its stand
proves that, like us, it places the protection of
Canadian interests, the defence of Canada, first.
This is only reasonable.
When we attempt to determine whether our
country is best protected in Europe, where the
enemy is, or in Canada, from which the enemy
is far removed, the debate may be long drawn
out. But when it is a matter of repulsing the
enemy already in our midst-in the present case
in the St. Lawrence river-all argument should
drop. The first duty of our navy is to rid us
of the Nazi submarines so far as it can accomplish this task.
In conclusion, may I be allowed to quote
fron the words uttered by the late Senator
Dandurand on June 18, 1936. They express
my feelings towards our youth, my wishes
to them and my hopes for them:
I say to the younger generation of Frenchspeaking Canadians, now dissatisfied with their
lot, more especially in the economie field, that
they can by superior training and higher culture qualify for an important role in the Canadian Confederation. They will thus forum part
of the elite which will mould the destiny of this
country. They must resolutely apply themselves
to the task. The leaders who have preceded
them have not had their opportunities for higher
study and culture. The men of to-day and of
to-morrow should be better equipped. If they
have superior culture, character and moral
stamina, with unity of purpose to serve their
country, they will command the respect of their
associates for themselves and for the rights and
privileges tbey so deeply cherish. To those
young men, to that coming generation, I declare
that I have no hesitation whatsoever in placing
under their guardianship these rights and
privileges.
It is our duty te rehabilitate Canada's
youth in the moral, social and professional
fields. I ask French Canadian youth te seek
economie power so that they may be enabled
to fulfil the ideals te which Providence calls
then in their province. I appeal to those
who belong to another race and speak another

language.

Let us give the minority the rights granted

Let our race be dealt with justly, and the

Let English-speaking and French-speaking
Canadians unite, as Lloyd George asked the
British House of Commons to do during the
last war.
Enough of rivaîries. of commercial, professional, political and other jealousies. Let us be

FEBRIJARY 5, 1943
In conclusion, I quote the last page of an
essy written by Mr. Gustave Lanctôt, Chief
Dominion Archivist of Canada:
During the last three months the German
armies have f ailed ta achieve a single victory
on any front. On the United Nations' side
China is still fighting, and naw Wavell is
starting a new offensive in Burma. In Africa
the diays af the Axis are numbered, their army
being squeezed between Anderson's force in the
west and Montgomery's in the east. In Asia
Japan is gradually losing ta the Americans and
Australians the autposts used as bases, while
on the Soviet front the raut common ta al
invaders af immense Russia seems ta be on the
point ai starting. Now we see the beginning

of the end of the war. Let us hope that 1943
will herald the beginning of the end of German
barbarismn, Italian acquisitiveness and Japanese
ierocity. At long last, Justice rises on the
horizon.
The Address was adopted.

we should be only too glad ta resume earlier,

SUPPLEMENTARY 1942 WAR
APPROPRIATION BILL
FIRST RtEADING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 6, an Act for granting Vo
His Majesty aid for national defence and
security.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shail this
Bill be read a second time?
Hlon. Mr. KING: I would move, with
leave of the Senate, that the Bill be read
a second time naw.
Honourable senators, when we adjourned
an February 5 we knew it was the intention
of the Minister ai Finance to bring down. hie
Budget and financial measures within two or
three weeks. It was only an February 8 that
we learned the Gavernment had found it
necessary ta bring down a supplementary
estimate ta caver certain war expenditures that

EUVimE EITIOI

SENATE

had been incurred during the fiscal year
1942-43. In order that we might deal with
this Bill as soon as possible after it had been
passed in another place, His Honour the
Speaker exercised the power granted him by
a resolution passed in the Senate on the
opening day of this session, and summoned
the Senate te resume earlier than the date
set at the time of the adjournment. This
occasion, the first of its kind this session,
demonstrates the wisdom of and need for the
resolution.
The Minister of Finance had indicated to
the House of Commons the necessity for
granting a supplementary estimate to cover
certain expenditures net provided for in last
The Comptroller of the
year's estimates.
Treasury advised him that certain commitments required immediate attention, and in
order to secure prompt action he suggested
that the House of Commons be given full
opportunity of discussing these expenditures
when the main estimates for 1943-44 were
being considered. The other House accepted
the suggestion and yesterday passed the Bill
through its various stages at the afternoon and
evening sittings. I am hopeful that we shall
give the measure similar dispatch.
It bas been the practice in this Chamber net
to debate at length or te alter financial proposals of the Government. But I have in mind
what occurred here last year, and what I do
net think we should like to have happen again:
that is, we were asked on the closing day of
the session to pass the full War Appropriation
Bill at one sitting. It seems te me that this
session, in anticipation of such a Bill coming
from the House of Commons, we might
well study its provisions through a standing
committee, or set up a special committee for
the purpose, and so familiarize ourselves with
them before actual receipt of the Bill. I
understand there would be no objection te
that procedure and I believe that for our
own satisfaction and in the public interest it
would be wise te follow it.
I think it is a surprise te most of us to find
that Canada has been able to produce net
only the implements of war, but also the
primary products se essential to war, far in
excess of what was expected. It is understood
that to-day 40 per cent of the output of our
war factories and of our farms, mines and
forests are required for our own armed forces
and 60 per cent are available to Great Britain
and the other Allied nations. We have been
sending very large quantities of war supplies
net only te Great Britain, but also to Russia,
and as mueh as possible te China. Since our
defence
or security is net immediately
imperilled, I think it is the desire of the
Hon. Mr. KING.

Canadian people that basic products as well as
munitions and other war supplies should be
made available for the other Allied nations.
Mr. Ilsley rather showed what he had in
mind when he stated in the other House how
we had financed and provided dollars for
Great Britain up to the present time. That
bas been done by our acquiring Canadian
securities before their due date, supplying
Canadian funds for that purpose. We also
accumulated pounds sterling, which were set
aside and eventually lent te Great Britain for
the duration of the war, without interest.
These sums have been exhausted, and it will
be necessary for us to consider further measures. The Minister bas indicated that when
he brings down his financial statement he will
advise Parliament as to the intention of the
Government to set up within the Cabinet a
Board of Allotment, te advise on the allocation of our surplus. In this respect we are
fortunate in having, in the person of Mr.
Howe, a representative on the United Nations
Board, which meets in Washington; but it is
felt that the Government of Canada should
make the allocation of our extra supplies.
Now I come te the Bill itself. I am informed by the Clerk of the Senate that it is
word for word the same as the bill we passed
last year, except that in section 4 it contains
the figure of $858,000,000 instead of $2,000,000,000. Mr. Ilsley in the other House yesterday intimated that his last year's estimates
overran the amount he had asked Parliament
to vote. I think we all remember that a year
ago he stated to Parliament that it was very
difficult to forecast the requirements of the
Department of Munitions and Supply. There
are other items also. You will remember the
conference held here in June, I think, of last
year, by representatives of Great Britain, the
United States and other Allied nations, with
regard te the air training scheme. The scheme
was very much enlarged, and this was net
provided for in the estimates. Mr. Ilsley says
that if the $858,000,000 is added te the S2.000,000,000 asked for last year, the total will just
about tally with his estimate as given to the
House last session. He intimated that be did
net ask for more than $2,000,000,000 then because if more were required a supplementary
amount could be asked for whenever Parliament was sitting.
I am informed that certain commitments require almost immediate attention, and I know
it is the desire of Parliament and of the
people of this country that Canada should
meet her obligations as they become due. It
is suggested that such important items as
dependants' allowances might be held up if
we failed te furnish these moneys.

FEBRUARY 16, 1943
In another place a question was asked as to
the amount of the increase in the civil or
ordinary estimates included ini this Bill. I
understand it is $118,000,000. The explanation is that there was interest on the war debt
previously contracted; there were su-bsidies
granted or payrnents made to the provinces
in lieu of revenues they surrendered in turning over certain taxation fields to the Dominion; and payments were made under an
agricultural bill passed last year to permit of
a certain acreage being summer-fallowed instead of being put into wheat or other production. I think probably there were other
payments also on wheat. These amounts, Î
believe, cover and explain the increase ini the
civil estimates.
The Government is also taking care of
British exp enditures on war industries in
Canada, which amount to some 8200,000,000,
and that figure is included. in this total.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Honourable senators, if
1 understood the honourable leader of the
Government rightly, this Bill for $858,000,000
represents expenditures in excess of the arnount
estirnated last year.
Hon. Mr. KING: No; that was flot exactly
what I said. When hie asked for 82,000,000,000
the Minister intirnated it was very difficuit to,
make a definite estirnate for the Department
of Munitions and Supply and the air training
scherne, and hie said that if his estimate
proved too small hie would corne back to
Parliament and ask for a supplementary
amount.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Then it means that lis
estirnate was short by $858,000,000?
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes, hie was short that
rnuch.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, this House having been surnroned
hy His Honour the Speaker to meet to-day,
we on this side have flot had an opportunity
of giving as much consideration as we should
have desired to this supplementary estirnate
of $858,000.000. Much as I admire the efficiency of the Minister of Finance, I arn rather
at a loss to understand why hie did not anticipate earlier that this supplementary arnount
would be needed. However, apparently the
need is urgent, and we are here to, consider
this Bill and to pass it, after we have obtained
the information that we hope to get. It is
not my intention to delay passage of the Bill
unnecessarily. As the honourable leader has
stated, two billion dollars had already heen
voted, and now this additional surn of
858,000,000 is requîred.
72542-5 j

67

Hon. Mr. CALDER: For the current year.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: For the current
year. This includes an excess of $118,000,000
over the estirnated ordinary expenditures of
8482,000,000.
I need not tell the honourable leader, for
hie is as well aware of it as I arn, that the
people have neyer been more keenly interested
in and watchful over govcrnrnental expenditures than at the present time. The weight of
taxation is becoming heavier and heavier for
thern as time goes on. They are not objecting;
on the contrary, they are perfectly willing to,
pay to, the lirnit of their capacity; but they do
want Parliarnent, and especially the Government, to keep a rnost watchful eye on expenditures and to cut them down wherever possible.
I notice that subsection 2 of section 3, on
page 2 of the Bill, says this:
Any expenditure required to be made by the
Government of Canada under any contract for
munitions of war and supplies entered into by
the Governrnent of Canada for the purpose of
enabling any company wholly ow-ned by the
Governrnent of Canada to fulfil its obligations in
respect of orders received by such eompany
f rom the government of any British or foreign
country allied with His Majesty may be paid
out of any unapproprîated rnoneys in the
Consolidated Revenue Fund.
The honourable leader has not touched on
this. I hope that when hie speaks again hie
will outline to this Chamber what investigation is rnade when requests for authorization
of.expenditures by Crown companies, generally
referred to as Governrnent wholly-owned. coinpanies, reach, as I presurne they do, the
Minister of Munitions and Supply. 1 know
that as a rule these companies, of which 1
helieve there are twenty-seven, are headed by
very able dollar-a-year business executives;
but what is worrying me is whether a sufficiently strict checking system is ernployed, by
the requests being examined item by item
before the Minister or the proper authority is
satisfied that the expenditures are justifiable.
Probably the House will bear with me for a
rnornent if I outline how a large industrial
concern would handle a matter of this kind.
Let us asstfrne that the headquarters of the
concern, which we will caîl the Dominion
Company, are at Montreal, and that branches
are rnaintained in the principal cities of every
province, the day-to-day operations of these
branch offices being, as I présurne is the ceue
with the Governrnent wholly-owned companies, under local or separate management.
Before a local manager could get any appropriation frorn the head office hie would have to
suhmit a detailed staternent of what the
money was required .for, with the different
amounts carcfully itemized. Then hie would
be summoned to the head office, and the chief

68

SENATE

executive there, or someone delegated by him,
would go over every one of these separate
amounts, item by item, probably reducing
some, increasing others, leaving some as they
were and striking others out altogether.
That is an outline of the procedure that
would be followed by a business concern, but
we have no information as to what procedure
the Government follow with respect to these
companies. After reading what was said in
another place, I should gather that these large
estimates are sent to a greatly overburdened
Minister, who has not the time to go into
I do not know whether they are
them.
scrutinized by bis deputies or not, but I am
given to understand that the requests are
referred to the Treasury Board. If this is the
system, I do not think it provides a sufficient
or safe check. I have no reproach to make
about the men who are at the head of these
Government wholly-owned companies, but no
doubt they make requests of the Government
for very large sums, and I do think they ought
to specify in detail what they want the money
for. I also think that all the heads should
have been called here one by one, to go over
with the deputy minister or the Treasury
Board or some other officials every item in
each requisition, and that not a single item
should be approved until this is done. Possibly when the honourable leader speaks again
he will give this Chamber a clearer idea than
I at least have of the watch that is being
kept over these expenditures.
I was glad to hear the honourable leader say
that the right is reserved to this Chamber to
discuss this measure again when the main
Appropriation Bill comes before us, at which
time it will be possible to give more consideration to the measure than we can give
just now.
In view of the Minister's statement that he
expects the total expenditures this year will
amount to four and a half billion dollars, it
is the bounden duty of honourable members
to see to it that all expenditures are kept
down to the lowest possible amount. There
seems to be a mistaken idea that this Chamber bas not the right to deal ývith money
matters. I am not a constitutional lawyer,
but from all the information I have been able
to gather I think we have that right; and I
was delighted to hear the honourable leader
say that this Chamber at least will give more
attention to money bills than it has given in
the past. In this way, with the experience and
the ability that we have in the Senate, we
ought to be able to perform an excellent
service to the country.
The honourable leader drew our attention to
what was said by the Minister of Finance about
the development of industry in Canada. It has
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

been remarkable. The Government deserve
praise for having played an important part in
this development, but I do not think enough
credit bas been given to Canadian industrialists who have changed over from peacetime
to Wartime production and done a marvellous
job at a small profit. Their regular business
has been seriously interfered with, but they
have been only too glad to play their part
loyally and well by helping in every way
possible in the prosecution of the war.
Hon. B. F. SMITH: Honourable members,
I rise simply to ask for a definite assurance
from the honourable leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. King) that when the main war
expenditures bill for this session is brought
down we shall have an opportunity to discuss
the merits of this measure.
Hon. Mr. KING: That is understood.
Hon. ARTHUR SAUVE: Honourable members, I wish to say a few words on this Bill
6, and shall express my views in my own
language.
(Translation): Is the Senate, as a court
of review, sufficiently informed to feel justified in voting these supplementary estimates? Up to a few minutes ago we did
not even have the Bill before us. We have
not even had an opportunity of looking
over the explanations given in the other
House by the Minister of Finance in an endeavour to justify the vote of these supplementary estimates, which will raise our total
expenditures for the year 1942-43 to the incredible sum of over $4,000,0000,000, to be
borne by a population of less than twelve
millions.
My remarks are prompted by no feeling of
defeatism or sedition, nor by any antipathy
toward the Allied cause against our common
enemy, the Axis. My opposition and my hesitation become greater and greater as I, like
many others, notice abuses, and as I hear the
comments of good pro-Ally Canadians who
experience a feeling of discouragement in the
face of what they consider an excessive number of ill-planned and reckless orders, the enforcement of which, it must be recognized,
spells disaster, entailing as it does unwarrantable and ruinous expenditures. We have been
called back for the purpose of hastily voting

a sum of nearly $1,000,000,000.

As I said, an

increasing number of serious complaints are
being voiced throughout the country, by people
from all walks of life or from all political
groups-by people who, in a word, represent
all shades of opinion in all provinces, from
prominent bankers to small farmers and lowly
workmen, who notice practically everywhere
all kinds of wastefulness. Are not the abuses

9

FEBRUARY 16, 1943
recently condemned by a former Minister, Mr.
Cardin, sufficient to warrant the appointment
of a committee of inquiry? But it should be a
committee honestly instituted and made up of
intelligent men, of trustworthy representatives of the various classes of Canadian ratepayers. There are able men in all walks of
life. If, after having introduced his estimates,
honestly arrived at, the Minister of Finance
now finds it necessary to acknowledge a deficit
of over $800,000,000, is that not sufficient
evidence of wastefulness somewhere? Does it
not also indicate an intolerable incompetence
in some branch of our war administration? It
seems to me, honourable senators, that this
matter should be attended to right now; not
after the war, but before it is too late. In view
of the fears that are entertained on all sides,
Parliament should, I think, take drastic action
in order to reorganize the administration and
respect the rights and prerogatives of the
responsible representatives of the Canadian
people. How can Parliament preserve its more
and more needed prestige if it allows its prerogatives to be infringed? Every man of goodwill understands that the progress of the war
compels governments to take drastic measures
which would be unacceptable in peace-time,
and that it is fair, and even necessary, to
recognize that fact in this country, as elsewhere; but, according to the right interpretation of our parliamentary institution, should
not a limit be set somewhere if its indefeasible
right of supervision is to be safeguarded? The
Senate exists; it must exist and function, just
as it did during the war of 1914-18; not, however, as a partisan body, but as a court of
review, and in keeping with the spirit of its
constitution.
The Government, the members of the two
Houses, the Canadian leaders, who, for varionus
reasons, from motives connected with the interpretation of our status within the British
Empire, have supported their country's participation in the war, or have not opposed a
Canadian contribution proportional to that of
the other dominions of the Empire of which
we are a part-those men have a responsibility
which compels them to demand at least that
the Government expenditures be limited to
our administrative requirements and to the
strict necessities of war and the post-war planning. Those necessities should be honestly
examined by Parliament and determined according to our means; in other words, the
expenditures should correspond with the needs
of a reasonable production commensurate with
our resources. Of course, we should produce
for the Allied armies, but not for the benefit
of profiteers either privileged or clever enough
to hide their speculative dealings from an
honest or gullible Government. Therefore,

those responsible Canadians are in duty bound
to oppose and check the frenzy of extravagant
and useless expenditures resulting from faulty
administrative machinery. Our population, in
Quebec as in every other section of the country, is quite willing to accept every sacrifice
in order to ensure an Allied victory and a just
peace. Our fellow-citizens accept restrictions
for our war requirements, but not certain
ridiculous and unfair restrictions which cause
In
resentment and decrease production.
Quebec, as everywhere else, the people are
prepared to accept restrictions tending to bring
our population back to a more normal standard
of living and to eliminate wastefulness, as regards the consumption of food and drink, for
instance. We welcome restrictions which can
increase our contribution to the Allies, but we
do not want restrictions or ceilings which decrease our production capacity.
Honourable senators, I shall make no furthecomments to-day, since the Senate will have
many other opportunities of discussing similar
matters during this session.
Hon. Mr. KING: I regret that I am
not able to reply to my honourable friend
who has just spoken (Hon. Mr. Sauvé). I
believe his main complaint is that the Senate
has not been given sufficient opportunity to
consider these war financial measures. We are
all vitally interested in them, and that is
why I have suggested that this session we
anticipate the receipt of the estimates for the
next year and give particular attention to
war appropriations. That suggestion can be
dealt with when we meet again.
As to the remarks of the honourablIe leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) I am satisfied
that the precautions lie mentioned are being
taken in regard not only to private business
concerns and their branches engaged on war
contracts, but also to Government-owned
companies.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: In what way?
Hon. Mr. KING: The managers are called
in and they are required to justify their
estimates in the same manner as the Minister
has to justify his estimates not only to the
Treasury Board, but also to the War Cabinet.
As Mr. Ilsley said yesterday in the other
House, his department has a large number
of travelling auditors going through the
accounts of all private companies engaged
in war work, as well as the accounts of
companies owned by the Government.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. KING: Thorough audits are being
made from time to time, and I think the
greatest care is being exercised ia that regard.

70

SENATE

When we organize the committee which I
have suggested, · we shall be able to bring
before it officers of the department, and that,
I think, would be an opportune time for
them to describe to us just what precautions
are being taken in all these matters. I have
every reason to believe that the explanations
to be furnished by those officers will satisfy
the committee.
I do not think I have anything further
to add. This appropriation is necessary and
is really a supplementary estimate. It was
foreseen by the Minister of Finance last year,
but at that time le told the House of
Commons that he preferred to let the main
estimate stand at $2,000,000,000, and if any
more moneys were required Le would make
a further request to Parliament. That is what
Le is now doing.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

SENATE

Honourable members will recall that at the
meeting between Prime Minister Churchill
and President Roosevelt they declared in the
Atlantic Charter their views on international
conditions after the war. Bearing in mind
that those two world-renowned men represent
the two great English-speaking nations, we
can, I think, rest assured that the Atlantic
Charter will exert a guiding influence on any
peace conference. We might well study the
declarations contained in the Atlantic Charter
with respect to international relationships as
they affect transportation, communications,
exchange, credit, and so on. Such a study
would at least be interesting and would, I
think, place us in a better position to consider
our policies after the war.
Furthermore, we have in this Dominion men
outside of Parliament who are well qualified
to discuss matters affecting their interests.
Take the great basic industry of agriculture.
Probably there is to-day no botter organized
industry in Canada. It is organized locally
and provincially and has a Dominion executive.
I think it would be both interesting and profitable for a committee of this Chamber to hear
the views of members of our agricultural
organizations regarding their post-war objectives.
We have also to consider our great manufacturing industries, which will eventually have
to be transformed from a war-time to a peace
basis. In manufacturing industries we have
two groups of men: the managerial group and
the employees. Both those groups, I have no
doubt, are giving very serious thought to
how this transition is to be brought about.
Unquestionably, organized labour is giving this
and related questions very careful study. I
think it would be in the interest of Canada
generally to have representatives of these great
bodies appear before our committee and indicate the studies they are making in regard to
post-war problems and what steps they propose to take for their solution.
I do not intend to labour the subject. I am
convinced in my own mind that here lies a
field in which the Senate of Canada may find
useful employment. It is my hope that this
committee, when appointed, will give full time
to the work, and, since our sessions are net
likely to be many or lengthy, I think it will
be advisable for the committee to ask to be
allowed to sit during adjournments. I hope
the Senate will desire te appoint it this week.
I think it should be a large committee, for I
find many senators would like to be associated
in the proposed work. I imagine that once
assembled, it would appoint various subcommittees to undertake explorations in certain fields, each reporting back to the main
committee from time to time.
Hon. Mr. KING.

There is no reason to worry about the committee coming to conclusions before the end
of the session. I do net think this is either
possible or necessary, but I do think its studies
will be useful not only to the Senate itself,
but also to the body politic of Canada. If
we as a branch of Parliament undertake at this
time a careful analysis and study with a view
to clarifying what is now a somewhat cloudy
vision, I am confident we shall be serving a
useful purpose.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Honourable
senators, I regret that I am not prepared at
the moment to make reply to the honourable
the leader of the House in regard to the
motion he has just moved. I therefore move
the adjournment of the debate.
The debate was adjourned.
STANDING

COMMITTEE ON FINANCE
MOTIOÑt

Hon. J. H. KING moved:
That the Standing Committee on Finance be
authorized to examine expenditures proposed by
the estimates laid before Parliament and by
resolutions relating to war and other proposed
financial measures of which notice bas been
given to Parliament, in advance of the bills
based on the said estimates and resolutions
reaching the Senate.
He said: Honourable senators, I have only
a word in explanation of this motion. Some
days ago, with this in mind, I said it was not
advisable that we should b called upon at
the last day of the session, as we were last
year, to pass on the whole financial programme
of the Covernment, especially the war programme, without being able to give it proper
consideration.
We know that throughout
Canada to-day bankers, merchants and others
affected by the financial proposals brought
down by the Government yesterday are in
conference, and I sec no reason why a committee of this Senate should not consider the
legislation which eventually will come to us
for approval. When we meet again the conmittee could at its convenience take into
consideration
the proposals put forward
yesterday by the Government.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: May I inquire as te
the number of members on that committee?
Hon. Mr. KING:
The committee as it
stands to-day numbers seventeen. I hope we
may add other members to it when the
House meets again. I think it might well be
enlarged to twenty.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I should think the
work of this committee would be exceedingly
important at this

time.

These utterances,
coming from men holding the positions they
do, constitute, in my judgment, an insuit not
only ta you, Mr. Speaker, but to ecd and
every member of this Chamber; and I think
I may go stili further and say that they constitute an insuit to the Fathers of Confederation.
When the Fathers of Confederation framed
or assisted in framing the Britishi North
America Act, they thought it well, in their
wisdom, ta appoint this body; and they
appointed it for certain reasons: ta safeguard
the minorities of this country and ta provide
a safety valve, so ta speak, for legisiation
which might corne from the other flouse. If,
for instance, the group leader who, bas called
us tbe most undemocratic and useleas body
in existence were ever ta attain a position
of such prominence in that Chamber that lie
would bave power ta frame legisiation, and
if the socialistie fire, of wbich, we bave had
evidence already, shauld begin ta burn within
him, the necessity of this safety valve that
we bave here ta guard against such legisiation as miglit be introduced- would, I tbink,
become apparent ta ail. Speaking of the

them.

approval of what it has done. A court of
law-and the Sonate has often been compared
to a court of revision-does not offer any
excuses because there are no cases to come
before it; and I am not aware that the judiciary has ever been criticized on that account,
or that anyone has ever suggested that it
should be abolished.
"Abolish the Sonate!" we hear from some
of the members of the other House. Why?
Would it be because the Senate does not hold
long and continuous sessions, because it does
not fill its Hansard with repetition after repetition of what has been said over and over
again, or because it does not enunciate new
doctrines? Such is not the function of the
Senate. Do they forget that without the
creation of the Senate for the purpose of protecting the rights and privileges of the minorities Confederation never would have been possible? Those who are in it to-day would not
have been in it but for the creation of the
Sonate. New Brunswick, which led the way to
the federation of the Canadian provinces,
moved as a first resolution: "That there should
be an equal number of legislative councillors
from each province." Later, when the Act was
passed, this principle was adopted by the
division of Canada into zones, so that to-day
we have four, each with an equal number of
senators.
Further, certain qualifications were provided
for in the Act, so that Canada might have as
senators men who were independent, intelligent
and fair-minded and would give wise and
deep thought to all legislation brought before
them; and, in accordance with the purpose
for which they are appointed, senators on receiving their commissions are supposed to forgo
their politics, their appointment for life being
their protection. They are to aid the House
of Commons in perfecting legislation by calmness of judgment; to safeguard our constitutional system; to protect the provinces against
the encroachments of the other House, and to
assure the rights of all minorities. In other
words, being an independent body exercising a
moderating and restraining influence upon the
legislation of the country, they are to give
equal justice to all. I believe it can be said,
honourable senators, that the Sonate of Canada
has fulfilled the mission for which it was established, and has fulfilled it well.
The British North America Act provided
that there should be one Parliament, consisting of the King, the Upper House-styled the
Senate-and the House of Commons. Evidently the Fathers of Confederation and their advisers thought that the three branches were
necessary and that each had a mission to fulfil.
I am not going to compare their wisdom in
Hon. Mr. LEGER.

that regard with the opinion of those who disagree with them. The necessity that existed
then tas not in the least subsided by reason of
the entrance into the federal arena of an increased number of political parties. The Senate has co-ordinate jurisdiction with the House
of Commons except in the case of bills involving a charge upon the Treasury, which
must originate in the lower House. We can
neither originate such bills nor amend them by
increasing the amount thereof, though we may
reject them.
As the Sonate has not the right to originate
bills involving a charge upon the Treasury,
and as, nowadays, on account of the war, the
greater part of our legislation does involve
a direct or indirect charge thereon, it follows
that our powers of legislation are necessarily
restricted. On the other hand, it is a well
recognized fact that the standing committees
of the Sonate devote more pains to and deal
more satisfactorily with bills referred to them-and all bills are-than do the standing committees of another House. And in that respect
not only are our committees a great help, but
their seal of approval, after modifications have
been made, is an assurance to the country at
large that all is well.
So I find it hard to understand the aims of
those who would do away with the Sonate.
Have they forgotten that in 1867 the then
Canadian provinces, of their free will and
under certain conditions provided in the British
North America Act, entered into a solemn
pact, a convention, which like all other conventions binds and obligates the contracting
parties? Do they not know that the smaller
provinces realized that under the Confederation scheme they would not only remain small,
but would be dominated in the lower House
by the larger and more populous provinces, and
so nsisted on the establishment of the Sonate
as a condition precedent to their entering
Confederation?
Abolish the Sonate, and what have you to
protect the rights of the minorities and guide
the restless? Abolish the Sonate! Such talk
is not only dangerous, unpatriotic and unconstitutional, but if expressed in the other House,
it is, to say the least, unparliamentary. If
that were carried to its logical conclusion, the
small provinces by the sea would in Parliament
be subjected to the political exigencies of the
more populous provinces. Our Constitution
would thereby become not only a political
machine, but a constitution of dominators, of
selfish and unjust politicians favouring their
own localities. Faith in our great Confederation would thereby be impaired, and as a
sequence we should find the dissatisfied provinces passing resolutions demanding their

MARCH 3,1943
severance from Confederation. In the past
some provinces have demanded their release
for much less.
And would the victorious stop there?
Granted the power, with their main obstacle,
the Settate, ahbolished, what would prevent
tbemn from doing away with the governments
of the provinces?
Has it not been hinted
before that we were over-governed?
Oh, abolition of the Senate may sound like
a joke now, but if this is encouraged the provinces some day, should they stili exist, will
wake up to find that the only powers they bave
are those whicb. a maimed or mutilated
Parliament condescends to give them!l
Abolish
the Senate!1
"Delenda
est."
Abolish-do we hear it suggested elsewberethe very institution wbich the Fathers of
Confederation, in their wisdom, created to
protect the rights of the minorities? If that
is so, and if it is true that "the essence of
democracy is respect for the rights of minorities," then the demolishers and the abolishers
in another Bouse, the would-be champions of
democracy, would do well, before calling the'
Senate an undemocratic body, to learn the first
of the principloe that constitute democracy.
Others say that a reformi is necessary. Oh,
reform there could be, perhaps, ail along the
line. But this is not the time nor the
occasion to go into that.
The provinces migbt not objeet to te
appointment of senators hy the provinces
themselves, instead of by the federal authorities as at the present time. They migbt also
counsel the placing of independent ministries
in the Senate.
But, after ail, wben ail this is said and done,
is it not a fact that in nearly every case any
argument for the abolition of the Senate bas
come from a small group to whom British fair
play means notbing; to whom the federation
of the Canadian provinces means tbe surrender of one nationality to the other, the
domination of one language, one faith and one
law, as if, contrary to the fact, the progress
and welfare of Canada *were not dependent
upon loyal collaboration, on the same footing,
of ahl those who have made Canada their
home and country?
Wben our boys are flghting at the front for
the Mother Country, for the rîgbts of wronged
citizens, for the freedom of ahl races, for their
bomeland and everything therein tihat they
cberisb and deemi sacred, is it not painful to
find here that the institution whicb was established particularly to protect the rîgbts of the
minorities, to safeguard our constitutional
rights, to give equai justice to aIl and thereby
promote gond relationship, is being assailed?
Coming, as I do, from a province wbicb at
the time of Confederation sacrificed its best
72542-6j

interests for the welfare of tbe Dominion, and
representing, as I do, a smali minority in this
House, I am not in the least disturbed by
wbat bas been said ini another House or elsewbere with reference to the Senate. I stiil
bave faith in 'the pledge given by tbe Imperial
Government of Great Britain at the time of
the passing of the British North America Act,
that tbey " would maintain the integrity of
our Constitution with the wbole power of the
Empire against any assauit, come from wbom
it may." Boni soit qui mal y pense.
Bon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Bonourable senators, I should like to refer to the
observations made by my respected colleague
fromn Victoria-Carleton (Hon. Mr. Smith)
when hie was speaking a moment ago as to the
danger of certain influences in the other Bouse
reaching a point where they migbt control the
destiny of this country. I am afraid that a
wrong conclusion might be drawn from that
point of view. If the timi sbouid come wben
such a state of affairs did exist, it would be as
a result of the expression of the popular will
of this country, registered at the poils in a
general election.
In elaborating my thougbt further, I should
like to quote from a statement by a rigbt
honourable gentleman wbo in the recent past
was the leader of this Bouse. In distinguisbed
language, much better than I could use, the
rigbt honourable gentleman dealt witb the
very subject that bas been tbe basis of the
remarks just concluded by my two honourable
He said,:
colleagues.
Soine time ago a prominent and popular Canadian, a man of opposite political association to
myseif, said: "I am thankful in these days for
tbe Senate! No matter what wild and extreme
radicalism may sweep the country, the Senate
will stand firm; it will save the ship." This
surely is worth saying and remembering: the
forces of wild and extreme radicalismn must be
met right out among the ranks of our people,
in their houses and meeting places; there the
power of reason and commnon sense muet he
applied, the lesson of long experience must he
taught, or notbing will Rave the ship. Surely
we have learned frm tragedies in oCher lande
that the tide of a mad, militant and persistent
majority neyer can be stemmed. It must flot
become a majority. If in this country the trade
of po]iticians is to be what it bas been ton
often, to f atten on the fruits of clase hatred,
class envy, class aflimosity, to reap a harvest
in votes by fanning tbese dangerous fires, then
do flot depend on the Senate or anything else
to hold in place the foundations of democracy,
because it may be too late. There are those
who believe that dire thinge can happen even in
the presence of f air and equitable laws. It
certainly ie not too mucli to say that they can
more easily take place when territnry is large
and distances are great. wben population derives
from a multitude of races and when the forces
of sanity and industry are selfishly indifferent
and at the samne time divided.

SENATE
With these words I entirely concur. I think
that the test that this House must meet is
the test that must be met by Parliament, by
the House of Commons as well as by the
Senate. Our future depends very largely upon
what we do now. The supremacy of Parliament in this country is being challenged,
for many reasons, which it is not necessary to
enumerate now. But it is within our power
as a Sonate so to conduct our activities as
to constitute ourselves at this time in a very
peculiar way the sponsors and guardians of
democracy in Canada; in a way that I think
is open to us much more definitely than it is
even to the members of the other House.
In conclusion, regardless of what may be
said by certain irresponsible persons elsewhere,
about this House, I do not think it is a
time for one body to indulge in recriminations
against the other; but I do think that it is
time for action and that we should devote
ourselves unreservedly to dealing with the
problems that now confront this country.
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN:
Honourable
members, while the honourable gentleman
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) was quoting a statement
made by a former right honourable leader of
this Chamber with respect to the usefulness
and importance of the Senate, my mind reverted to what I believe to be one of the
best defences of this House that were ever
made. I refer to a speech by the late Hon.
Charles Murphy. To my mind it is a pity
that the information contained in that speech
is not in the possession of some of those who
are so prone ta criticize this Chamber. The
late Senator Murphy cited an occasion when
the Senate rejected a railroad measure requiring a very large expenditure out of the public
treasury. By its action on that occasion the
Sonate saved the country enough money to
carry on the work of this Chamber for many
years to come.
I think those of us who come from Western
Canada know the importance which the consumers and farmers of the West attach to the
preservation of the Crowsnest pass agreement.
It would be well if those in Western Canada
who are constantly criticizing the Senate were
reminded of the fact that the benefit of that
agreement might have been lost but for the
activity of a member of this body at the time
it was under discussion.
One of our weaknesses is that we do not
stand up for ourselves and direct the attention
of the country to the great national services
the Senate has already given and the further
services it may yet give to the Dominion.
Another weakness is that a great deal of important business is carried on in our standing
and special committees, and no record of this
lon. Ar. LAMBERT.

appears on Hansard. I refer particularly to
the valuable labours of the standing committees on Banking and Commerce and on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours. The people
are not aware of the many vital and valuable
changes which those committees make in bills
that come to us for consideration from the
other Chamber. A little timely enlightenment
of the public along these lines might change
their opinions with regard to this body.
I repeat, I am prompted to make these
observations largely because of the quotation
cited by the honourable gentleman who Pas
preceded me and of the speech by the late
senator from Ottawa to which I have referred.
If I only had that speech before me now I
would quote some pertinent paragraphs from
it, for in my judgment no more effective case
was ever made out demonstrating the value
of the Sonate to the people of Canada.
The Sonate adjourned until to-morrow at
3 p.m.

the

out

Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, you all are familiar with the motion
that was moved yesterday by the honourable
leader of the Government tHon. Mr. King).
I may be permitted to read it:
That a special committee be appointed to
consider and report upon matters arising out
of post-war conditions, particularly those relat-

ing to problems of reconstruction and re-establishment and a national scheie of social and
health insurance; and that the said conmittee
have authority to send for persons, papers and
records.

At the outset of my remarks I want to
make it abundantly clear that the party I
represent in this House is fully in accord with
the principles of the legislation which in the
Speech from the Throne the Government
indicated it may bring down this session or in
the near future. If I needed ta give this

MARCH 4, 1943
honourable Chamber proof of our approval
of such proposed legisiation, I might cite the
policies which. the Progressive Conservative
party laid down at its historic Winnipeg
convention as the policies the party would
translate into legisiation should it attain power.
1 have had several friendly chats with the
honourable leader opposite, as we are always
on most cordial ternis with each ather, and I
have endeavoured to persuade hirn, but so far
without succese, not to have a cammittee of
this House appointed ta deal with such matters
as health insurance, social securîty, and s0 on.
Ail honourable membere are as well aware as
1 arn that these matters are full of complications. If, for instance, we were t'o deal with
the question of health insurance, the proposed
committee would have to sit for many months,
and experts would have ta he heard, at considerable expense ta the country, for this
motion gives the commîttee authority to send
for persons, papers and records, and the
persons summoned before the committee
would have to be paid their out-of-pocket
expenses. Further, no one knows better than
the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
King) that when Parliament attempts to deal
with these social problemes it will find itself
immediately up against provincial jurisdiction
as upheld by the Judicial Committee of the
Privy Council in recent yeare. I think I arn
safe in saying that no more complicated
legisiation than that now contemplated has
ever been proposed.
I desire at this point ta assure you that if
the Senate decides ta appoint this committee
it will have the full support and co-operatian
of everyone on this side of the House, but I
beg the Minister ta take under lis seriaus
consideration the fact that to-day there existe
a multiplicity of committees, some ini another
place and sorne outside of Parliament, and
they will ail go into these questions fully. I
cannot see any justification for asking this
House ta go over ail the evidence given before
these various other committees and ta try ta
arrive at sorne decision that might be helpful
ta the Government.
The Minister in hie speech yesterday intimated that lie did not expeet this proposed
comrnittee ta arrive at the making of a repart
this session. 1 will quote his own words:
There is no reason ta worry about the coinmittee coming ta conclusions befare the end of
the session. I do not think this je either possible
ar necessary, but I do think its studies will be
useful flot only ta the Senate itself, but also
ta the body politic of Canada. If we as a
brandi of Parliamient undertake at this time a
careful analysis and study with a view ta
clarifying what is now a somnewhat cloudy vision,
I arn confident we shall be serving a useful
purpose.

77

The Minister himself has given a very cogent
reason why thie cornmittee ehould nat be
formed, for yesterday lie clearly stated that
it would not reach any finality. Further, I
think we mnay infer from hie remarks that we
need not expect Parliament at this session ta
deal wîth any legielation on these probleme
mentioned in the Speech from the Throne. In
fact the Prime Minister, in speaking on the
Address in the other Ilouse, made it clear that
measures respecting social security would not
be brouglit before Parliament at this session.
Then I have another reason, whicb I think
is the niost important of ail. As was so ably
stated by honourable senators who, addressed
this Chamber yesterday, the function of the
Senate of Canada as created by the Fathers
of Confederation was ta safeguard minorities
and ta review and revise legislatian. I may
be wrong, but I thinkc that since Canfederation
this Chamber has neyer been called upon
ta advîse the Government regarding legislation
proposed in the Speech from the Throne. If
this bouse were asked ta formulate policies,
and later the legislation embodying them were
braught before Parliament and reached thie
Chamber, we should be reviewing policies
which we had propased-a procedure which
would certainly place this bouse before the
public in a very wrang light. I think that
this Chamber muet continue its usual valuable
function of reviewing and, revising legislatian
and sometimes vetoing bills.
The idea, of calling upon us to advîse the
(lovernment as ta policies ta be put into effect
is entirely new ta me. I know it will be said
that the Imperial Parliament appoints coinmittees. That je true. We in this country,
too, have appoin-ted royal commissions ta investîgate and report upon complicated or
seriaus Canadian. problems. But that is quite
different from the Governmenlt saying: "Here,
we intend ta have legislatian dealing with
health, social security, unemplayment insurance, reconstruction and -rehabilitatàon, but
we as a Government have no definite policies
ourselves and we appeal ta Parliarnent"ý-which
includes this Chamber-"jto set up variaus
committees ta advise us as ta what aur policies
should be." I do not think that a, Government
whýich adopts that method je functioning in
accordance with the Britiesh Constitution. I
amn sarry ta, differ frorn my honourable friend,
but I should think týhat if this bouse is
desiraus of doing mare work it might select
one important subject, such as finance, for
instance, and do very good work on it. If
that were not sufficient we might take up the
problem of agriculture in Canada. We could
deal with one problem at a time. But while
Dominion health legisiation je certainly very

SENATE
necessary, it is most involved, and I do not
think the public woultd look with favour upon
the Senate sending for numerous specialists in
one line or another, bringing them here and
paying their expenses.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: And duplicating the
work of the Commons.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Yes. I have
already pointed that out. Besides the committees of the House of Commons, there are
several others. An Order in Council of
January 23 provides:
There shall be an Advisory Committee on
Reconstruction consisting of the following menibers: Dr. F. Cyril James, Chairman; Dr. R. C.
Wallace, Mr. Tom Moore, Dr. Edouard Montpetit, Mr. J. S. McLean, Hon. D. G. McKenzie.
Then it goes on to say:
Officers and personnel employed by the Committee on Reconstruction, prior to the passing
of this Order, shall, in all respects, continue
under the supervision of the committee established by this Order, at the rates of compensation and under the conditions presently
approved. The committee may appoint such
subcommittees and consult such recognized experts as it may deem advisable, and, further,
may invite to appear before the subcommittees
persons specially qualified to deal with any
matter coming within the terms of reference of
the committee; all such persons called in consultation to be entitled to receive the actual
and necessary out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by them while absent from their places of
residence for the purpose of such consultation.
The committee may, with the approval of the
Governor in Council, employ such qualified
persons and incur such expenses as may, in their
opinion, be necessary to the performance of
their duties.
This Chamber would very much like to
know, Mr. Leader, what progress that committee bas made and what plans it bas in view.
If the honourable leader is not prepared to
give this information to the House, does it
seem logical that while that comrmittee is
functioning we should have a committee here,
both dealing with the same question and
rolling up duplicate expense? In view of the
numerous committees dealing with post-war
questions, my opinion certainly has not
changed from what it was yesterday, when I
had the privilege of discussing the matter with
the honourable leader. I think this House
would be very well advised not to approve of
this resolution, though we might allow questions of finance to be dealt with by the standing committee, as proposed in another resolution. Of course, as I said a moment ago, if
the Senate decides to appoint a committee
on post-war conditions, we are in duty bound
to render all the services we possibly can.
Before I resurne my seat, may I make one
further reference to social security?
The
Imperial Government appointed a royal comHon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

mission under the chairmanship of a very distinguished man, Sir William Beveridge, who
was surrounded by a good many experts. It
took that committee eighteen months to make
its recommendations to the Government. If
we were to get into that question in this
country, I do not know when we ever should
reach a finality.
On general principles, I am altogether opposed to parliamentary committees being asked
to advise the Government in power, which bas
the responsibility, how it should draft its
legislation.
Hon. Mr. KING:

No, no.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Well, what
other viewpoint can you take of it? I have
always understood that governments proceeded in this way: proposed legislation indicated in the Speech fron the Throne is
drafted with the aid of expert civil servants,
then submitted to the Department of Justice
for legal opinion, and after the legislation bas
been introduced in either House it is referred
to a special committee, or sometimes to the
Committee of the Whole, and, if passed, is sent
on to the other House, where it again may be
referred to a special committee or to the
Committee of the Whole.
To repeat, I do not think the Government
should say to Parliament: "Here are very
great and difficult problems, some of them
pressing problems. Will you be good enough
to consider them and advise the Government?"
J do not think we should be called upon to
do that.
This House, I think,' should
confine its efforts to what it was created
for-the revision and improvement of proposed
legislation.
I have nothing further to say on this
subject. But I do hope the honourable leader
(Hon. Mr. King) will change his mind and
not press the resolution.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, I feel that I should ask the
indulgence of my ceolleagues for rising so soon
after the discussion of yesterday. I had hoped
that the motion presented by the honourable
leader of the House (Hon. Mr. King) for
the appointment of a committee to study
reconstruction problems would be discussed
yesterday. In supporting that motion now I
should like to refer as briefly as possible to
some of the committees that have already been
set up to consider the subject of rehabilitation
and reconstruction. The resolution now before
the Senate calls for the appointment of a
committee to study that subject and social
security. Originally notice was given of two
resolutions, one for the appointment of a
committee on rehabilitation, and the other for

MARCH 4, 1943
a committee on social security, but the
honourable leader of the House, after consideration, decided to recommend that the
two subjects be dealt with by one committee.
I do not propose to spend much time in
referring to the position taken by the honourable leader on the other side (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne). I shall leave that to others who
participate in this discussion-and may I say
here that I hope the discussion will be a
thorough one, continued to-day and tomorrow, if necessary, and not cut off by an
adjournment. I should like to hear others
discuss the honourable leader's position regarding the Senate's functions in relation to the
subject of post-war reconstruction. Suffice it
for me to say briefly that I cannot understand
any.one viewing the prospects before this
country with a degree of detachment and a
lack of constructive suggestion. We have
to-day in Canada nearly a million people
engaged in war industries, and another 600,000
are on active war service. That is a total
of 1,600,000 who within a relatively short time
may be thrust back upon us, to find that we
have made no plans for their absorption into
the economic life of the country.
The whole question of the economic background of social security, which is being talked
about very freely on all sides, should be closely
analysed and examined by the Senate, so that
this body might at least have opinions with
which to guide other committees now in
existence. Any studies that we make here
would enable us the better to deal with what
is done in committees set up by the other
House. We have always professed that one
of our outstanding functions was to review,
and'to a certain extent to mould, proposals
and legislation originating in that House.
However, I shall leave to others the discussion
of the Senate's relation to these matters
of rehabilitation, reconstruction and social
security.
Now I should like to refer to the committees
that have been established to deal with these
subjects in Canada. The Cabinet Committee
on Demobilization, Re-establishment and Reconstruction, the very top committee, was set
up in December, 1939, shortly after war broke
out; and directly connected with that was a
general Advisory Committee on Demobilization and Rehabilitation, which took form under
the Department of Pensions and National
Health, and under the chairmanship of Brigadier General McDonald. The concern of that
. particular committee was to deal with soldiers'
problems of demobilization and settlement, and
out of the committee's work developed the
Land Settlement Act which already has passed
through Parliament.

79

The next committee that took form was
called the Canadian section of the Joint
Economic Committees, which was appointed in
June, 1941. The chairman of that section is
Dr. W. A. Mackintosh, and its personnel is
made up of officials from the Departments of
Munitions and Supply, Finance, Agriculture
and External Affairs, the secretary being an
official of the Bank of Canada. The committee's function is to form direct contact with
its counterpart in Washington for the purpose
of discussing the relations that are so essential
between the two countries in the prosecution
of the war. In the process of the meetings of
the Canadian and American committees there
is constant consideration of economic trends
of action between our two countries and of
the work being done for their mutual advantage in the prosecution of the war. Included
in the work of these joint committees, valuable
thought is given to laying foundations for the
post-war period. In other words, measures
found necessary for the prosecution of the joint
war effort should, if possible, be made adaptable to post-war conditions.
The third committee to take form was the
general Committee on Reconstruction, of which
Dr. F. Cyril James was made chairman. The
other members of that committee are Hon.
D. G. McKenzie, of Winnipeg, a representative of agriculture; Mr. J. S. McLean, of
Toronto; Dr. Edouard Montpetit, of the
University of Montreal; Mr. Tom Moore,
president of the Trades and Labour Congress
of Canada, and Dr. R. C. Wallace, principal
of Queen's University. The secretary and
economic adviser of this body is Dr. Leonard
Marsh, of McGill University. The general
Committee on Reconstruction has appointed
four subcommittees, one to deal with agricultural policy, another with conservation and
development of natural resources, another with
post-war construction projects, and the fourth
with post-war employment opportunities. Also
linked up with the work of the general
Committee on Reconstruction is a group of
specialists to undertake special studies of
immigration, irrigation, forestry, and subjects
of that sort. Their studies have not yet been
completed, but their conclusions will be placed
in the hands of the general committee, of which
Dr. James is the chairman.
In addition to those committees there is the
House of Commons committee which was set
up last session. Furtherm-ore, nearly every
province has set up committees dealing with
some phase of the problems of post-war reconstruction.
It will be seen therefore from this tabulation
of committees that much ground has already
been covered. In the form of memoranda of

80

SENATE

various kinds, discussions in committees and
interprovincial conferences, addresses by Principal James and statements by officials of
Government departments, and many other
persons who have been directly concerned with
the task of trying to formulate plans for the
future, much material has been accumulated
and many views have been recorded.
I might also say that committees, most
important committees, have been at work in
Washington and in London. Dr. Mackintosh,
the head of the Joint Economic Committee,
has visited London and also Washington and
is familiar with the progress of the planning
that has been under way in those capitals.
To those who think it is superfluous to give
time and attention to post-war problems now,
I should like to quote by way of a sort of
text to this discussion a statement made by
the Prime Minister of this country in London,
England, in September, 1941. In the course
of his speech at the Mansion House on
that occasion I find the following:
Much is being said about a new world order
to take the place of the old world order when
the war is aýt an end. If that new world order
is not already on its way before the war is
over, we may look for it in vain. The new
world order cannot be worked out at some
given moment and reduced to writing at a
conference table. It is not a matter of seals
and parchments. That was one of the mistaken
beliefs at the end of the last war.
The function of this proposed Senate committee should, it seems to me, be that of a
sort of court of review to examine and analyse
material which has already been submitted in
different quarters, and later, if possible, to
indicate practical ways and means of carrying
out measures which would be of value in
enabling the Government to meet post-war
developments. The extent to which witnesses
possessing special knQwledge should be called
upon to give evidence and information before
this committee could be decided upon by the
committee as it proceeds with its work. But
the real need in connection with this whole
subject at this time is to focus thought and
effort upon essential and, vital spots in our
economy according to their relative importance.
The question of Government-controlled
activities in relation to private enterprise, for
example, is surely one question which a
committee chosen from this body, with its
abundance of practical experience behind it,
should be able to pass upon with definite,
practical common sense.
The purpose of this committee therefore
should be to reduce to some order the mass of
information and data which already has been
adduced on this subject and would be availHon. Mr. LAMBERT.

able to it. The result of any work done by
this committee might be of use also very
directly to the special committee of the House
of Commons. There is certainly room for
co-operation between these two bodies.
I
would point out that the chairman of one of
the committees of the House of Commons
that met last year, speaking to a similar
resolution in the other House recently, took
cognizance of the possibility of a committee
such as this being established in the Senate,
expressed his favourable attitude towards it,
and invited the fullest co-operation between
them.
Principal James has described the central
problem of any plan of rehabilitation as full
employment and the maintenance of the
Canadian standard of living at as high a level
as possible. Without an attempt to enlarge
upon that objective now, it is obvious that
such an undertaking will require the most
thorough and realistie examination of Canada's
economie and financial resources, including
her present and prospective international
relationships.
The functions of the Senate have been aptly
described by the right honourable gentleman
I had the pleasure of quoting yesterday
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen). I should like to
quote him as often as I can, for seldom have
I the opportunity of agreeing with him. He
described the functions of this body as those
of

" a workshop

rather than a theatre."

I

submit, honourable senators, that in setting up
this proposed committee we have a good
opportunity of testing the truth of that
description.
Hon. C. P BEAUBIEN: Honourable senators, I am afraid that my honourable colleague
who has just taken his seat (Hon. Mr.
Lambert) has somewhat imperfectly interpreted the purpose of the remarks of the
leader on this side of the House (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne).
May I say at once that I congratulate the
honourable leader of the House (Hon. Mr.
King) on deciding to draw on the potential
resources of the Senate for the purpose of
solving the very grave problems that will face
this country at the end of the war. Happily
the resources of this House are great-that is
my opinion at all events-but unhappily our
post-war problems will be great too.
I thought the honourable leader on this side
of the House made it very clear that we think
an investigation such as that proposed by the
creation
of this committee is essential.
There is no doubt that it is essential. We
cannot come to the end of the war utterly
unprepared to meet post-war conditions. It

MARCH 4, 1943
would be foolish to do so. Not only that, but
I think we have shown that we are completely
in accord with the necessary reforms, which
will lead a long way towards the solution of
these problems.
Therefore I may well take the speech of the
honourable gentleman from Ottawa as the
basis of the remarks I am about to make. I
do not differ with him; I agree with him. No,
the trouble does not lie there at all. The
trouble is that while we are pleased that the
Government is willing to use this House for
some useful purpose, yet we are greatly
disappointed to find that the Government is
asking us to undertake work which it has
already well in hand. As honourable senators
know, this matter has for more than two
years been studied by the Government itself
and by special committees of the Government,
which committees have divided themselves
into ten subcommittees, and from month to
month they have been doing all the necessary
spade work.
Now the Government is asking the House
of Commons to form just such a committee
as we ourselves propose to create. If honourable gentlemen have any doubt as to that,
they have only to read the remarks of the
honourable Minister in the other House, as
reported at page 903 of the Commons Hansard.
What my honourable friend who has just
taken his seat has said may all be found there.
The honourable Minister went to a great deal
of trouble in telling the other House that
the Government had day by day and night
by night been working on the problems. The
Minister has drawn on the best brains of the
country. More than a hundred persons have
been working day by day, month by month,
almost year by year, preparing necessary data.
It is most natural that the Government
should ask for a committee of the House of
Commons to receive the reports of all these
subcommittees, to profit by the facts assembled, and thereon to base its conclusions in
order to draft the necessary legislation as
announced in the Speech from the Throne.
In that speech the Government said to the
country, "We are prepared to introduce legislation to effect this purpose." That means
the Government will assume the responsibility
of introducing legislation on the most important problems we have to study. I do not
suppose the Government will draft legislation
of that kind without thorough investigation.
Therefore a thorough investigation covering
the whole field will be conducted by the House
of Commons committee. What are we to do?
Principal James will come before the committee of the House of Commons and there

81

express his opinions to enlighten the committee and, through the committee, the Government, as to what should be done. Very
good. Then other experts will come and d
the same thing. So, I would ask honourable
members to bear in mind, the entire field will
be covered. It must be. I give credit to the
Government for its intention to do the job
thoroughly.
Now comes the Senate's turn. Honourable
senators have for several sessions been waiting
to do effective work. We are already convinced that what the Government intends to
do is in the right direction. We on this side,
as members of a party that has officially pronounced itself in favour of the purpose that
the Government has in view, are all for it.
Our committee will have to do the job
thoroughly, as thoroughly as the committee of
the House of Commons will do it, and therefore every one of these witnesses will have to
be brought back here to tell his story again.
Is that necessary? If the Government wants
to have the opinion of the Senate-and I congratulate the Government if that is its desire
-why not use all the evidence already collected and analysed by the co.mmittee of the
House of Commons? Is there a water-tight
compartment between the two Houses? What
will the country think if we insist upon having
presented a second time, for our exclusive
benefit, all the evidence and opinions that
have been adduced before the House of Commons committee?
There is the only difficulty between the
two sides of this Chamber. I do not know
whether I have made myself clear. As I have
already said, we are for the purpose of the
investigation. We have given proof of that
officially. We cannot, it seems to me, do it
in a clearer and more positive manner than
was done at the Winnipeg Convention of the
Progressive Conservative party. I repeat, we
are in agreement with the purpose of the investigation. Not only so, but I think we are
very much in agreement with the intentions
of the honourable leader opposite, and we
thank him for desiring to utilize the resources
of this House; but we take the liberty of
asking him to assign to us another field.
I suppose it is not of much use to exert a
great deal of energy in trying to convince the
honourable leader opposite. Indeed, I think
that has already been done. But may I
humbly make a suggestion? Let us not, sO
to speak, servilely step behind the House of
Commons, fearful of deviating from the, path
they have taken. Can we supplement the
work of the House of Commons? I do not
know. I suppose the matter would lie in the
hands of the Minister to a large extent. There

82

SENATE

are many problems. We might very well ask
the House of Commons to reserve certain of
those problems for us. The leader on this
side of the House bas mentioned agriculturea subject of great practical importance. We
know that the farmers to-day are not satisfied,
and we know also that they will be very useful
after the war. Therefore agriculture is a field in
which we might be helpful at the present time,
and also later on. I need not mention any of the
crucial problems now confronting the farmer. I
think the Government bas lately received from
the Federation of Agriculture of this country a
list of problems, some of which touch us very
closely. I cannot help remembering to have
heard farmers say, "Why, they are rationing
butter, and we cannot sell our butter." They
have also been heard to say, "They want us to
produce more, but we bave no farm labour."
A great many of our farmers, because they
lacked help, bave had to sell their milch cows.
They complain that there is not a parity of
prices, something which I think is essential.
You cannot have very bigh prices in the cities
and very low prices in the country, for if you
do, the country will not buy from the cities,
and there will be unemployment in the cities.
I do not need to elaborate the point. Everybody
knows that. I am just opening that side issue.
If the leader of the House persists, he can
count on us ta do our best to help. But
can we not do a work that will be our own?
Must we foilow the House of Commons step
by step? After all, our problems are numerous, and they are extremely difficult ta solve.
We bave internal problems and external
problems. The Government might allow us to
take up the external problems. However, it
may fear our handling of a delicate political
situation. The Department of External Affairs
may think we might be imprudent. I do not
know. Then there is the economic side of our
affairs, which will be of great importance after
the war. What are we going to do with our
production? The first thought that comes to
mind, of course, is that we shall sell our wheat
to a great many people who are now starving.
Or it may be said that more paper will be
wanted in the United States, and, as we have
too much, we should send them more. But that
is a condition which will not continue more
than one or two years. If we take the Atlantic
Charter as an indication of the future, what are
we going to do in this country without a preferential tariff? It is all very well to say that for
the peace of the world we must do without a
tariff, and perhaps that is true, but honourable
members of this House are well enough versed
in business to know that we export 30 per cent
of our production. Can we do without that
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

export?
There is a strange theory abroad
that so long as you keep your people at work
they can consume unlimited production, or
that you can borrow from them indefinitely.
I am not so sure that that principle is sound.
Suppose we keep the people busy, thoroughly
busy, and make them wealthy, will that enable
them to eat all our wheat? We consume not
more than one-third-sometimes only onequarter-of what we produce. Even if we had
money to burn, could we consume all our
wheat? Could we use all the paper we produce? As you know, we now use only a
relatively small proportion of it. Could we
use all the nickel produced in this country?
Prior to the war we consumed only five per
cent of it. What would become of the rest?
This is a very serious problem, and one which
I think we might study with great benefit to
the whole country. But I am afraid I have
been carried away by my good intentions.
We on this side of the House wish to collaborate, but we want to do it in the most
efficient way. We do not want to duplicate
what is being done by others, and being done
well. We simply ask the leader of the House
to give us a field of our own in which we can
work efficiently and do a job that ought to
be done.
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN:
Honourable
senators, I have been in this Chamber long
enough to have heard many expressions about
the capacity of honourable members to deal
with the major problems of the country. I
have heard it said that this House is made up
of men of wide experience, men who have
served in the other branch of Parliament and
in the legislatures of the various provinces,
men who have held administrative offices and
high positions in the professions, in the fields
of banking and commerce, and in agriculture.
I have heard it said that there is no parliamentary body more capable than the Senate to
inquire into and report upon problems facing
the people of Canada. If this is true, is it not
fair to argue that a committee such as the one
suggested in this resolution, composed of men
of the character I have just described, might
approach all these problems from a standpoint
which would be different fron that of other
committees whiclh have been studying post-war
reconstruction, social security, or whatever it
may be? Having this in mind, I support
the resolution.
I differ with the leader on the other side,
who says it is our business, not to tell the
Government what to do, but rather to review
what the Government sends to us. Since I
came into the Senate I bave sat on two con-

MAROR 4, 1943
mittees whose purpose was ta make recommendations to the Government. Possibly tbey
did flot succeed. One was the committee dealing with the St. Lawrence river power project
and the other deait with the railway problem
of Canada. If those who held certain views had
had a mai ority in those committees, they
would have made recommendations ta the
Government that it should follow certain policies in dealing with those problems.
We corne to a report that is now widely
known as the Beveridge report on social
security. That report was prepared by a cornmittee named *by the ýGovernment of Great
Britain. It is only within the last few weeks
that we have found that supporters of the
Gov.ernment have not ail, perhaps, been very
rnuch ia sympathy with the report and were
flot accepting everything offered 'by that
committee.
But my purpose in participating in the
discussion on the resolution before us is
largely to deal with one aspect of reconstruction with respect to which 1 think a Senate
cammittee. could render very helpful service.
If I were using a text f or what I arn going ta
say, I would quote from the rernarks made by
the Minister of Finance in another place only
last night, as reported at pages 927 and 928 of
the flouse of Commons Hansard:
Let those of us who are inclined to fear the
economie consequences of aur war expenditures
remember that these expenditures have developed and brought ta iight an enormous
increase in aur Canadiau capacity ta produce
-an increase greater than any of us had ever
before suspected. Let them think of the future
in terms of maintaining and stili further developing that enlarged capacity, that potential
of a greater national incarne. We ean and
mnust make use of that increased capaeity after
the war.
My thought was this, that certain developments, whieh were prirnarily intended for war
purposes, could he utilized after the war;- that
we should study some of them and, if necessary, make recommendations as ta how they
might he made ta contribute ta the general
welfare of aur people.
Coming from Western Canada, Iar
acquaînted with a few of these developmentS.
We hear rnuch of the Alska highway, which,
as everybody knows, was constructed for war
purpases ini order ta give the Ulnited States
essier acceas ta Alaska. That highway is ta
be permanent, and it runs through a vast
area of country that had nat been opened up
previously. Naw, what are the passîbilities i
that great territory? Does it possess accessible
riches? I think this Senate comrnittee could
properly make an inquiry as ta what resources
are up there, and how they might be
developed.

Only a few days ago sornething was revealed
in the other Bouse that had been familiar ta
many people in my part of the country,
narnely, that the ail fields discovered a good
many years aga at Fort Norman, in the
Mackenzie river district, are now supplying
the needs of the United States Army in
Alaska. What happened? A pipe line was
constructed from Fort Norman through thé
Yukon ta Alaska. As I vision the post-war
future, those fields, which were lying dormant
until military requirements mnade it necessary
ta draw upon them, can he developed into a
major source of supply, not only for Alaska,
but for other parts of the Pacifie area and
Western Canada. We rnight study that aspect
of developrnent that has heen brought ahout
by the war, in an atternpt ta find out how
great aur ail resources there are and how
great a use can he made of them.
Within the last month or two I was reading
a volume an the Arctic regians, and I was
pleased ta find in it constant reference to the
report made by a committee Of the Senate
back, I think, in the 8O's or early 90's. It is
worth hearing in mind, honourahle senators,
that sa long ago as that a cornmittee of this
Chamber investigated the Arctic regions and
made a report which is being utilized to-day.
I wonder whether the'Senate could not refer
hack ta that report and go ahead from where
that aId committee lef t off, in an endeavour
ta find out what has happened in the meantime in the Arctic regions and other parts.
Only within the last week or two Wendell
Willkie, in an article about a visit he made
ta Siberia, revealed what great things the
Russians have accomplished in developing
their Aretie territories. We might very well
consider whether we tao have possibilities in
the Arctic. Some people will ask, "What is
the use of bothering about the Arctic when so
rnany other parts of aur country await
development?" But it seems ta me that the
Aretic may have resources which are not
available anywhere else. Ia recent years
minerai deposits have been found in that
region; we knaw now it bas large ail fields;
and it rnay have many other valuable
resources.
Ahl honourable members have read of the
great undertaking that bas came ta he known
as the Shipshaw power development an the
Saguenay river in the province of Quebec.
I was amazed ta find in the story I read-I
do flot know whether it is corret-that the
power production capacity there is greater
than the combined capacity on bath sides of
the river at Niagara Falls, greater than the
capacity of the proposed St. Lawrence river
projeet and even greater than that of Boulder

Dam, in the United States. What is going to
be donc with all this electrical energy after
the war is over? Could the Senate not inquire
into this and recommend some industrial uses
for it in the future?
My honourable friend who has just taken his
seat (Hon. C. P. Beaubien) referred to the
agricultural situation in Canada. So far as
Western Canada is concerned, the war has
brought about a complete transformation in
We are producing to-day live
agriculture.
stock, poultry, and dairy products away beyond anything that had ever been conceived
before in that part of the country, and wheat
is being replaced to some extent because of
that transformation. The problem of what .to
do with our surplus wheat has been a serious
one in this country for many years. It has
often been discussed in this Chamber, and in
another place, and in the legislatures of the
Western Provinces. Well, if we could maintain the increased production of other farm
products, we might in a sense solve the wheat
Could not a committee of the
problem.
Senate concentrate on a matter of that kind,
perhaps call witnesses who understand the
situation, and make a useful report? I do
not think the various committees on reconstruction, whether in Parliament or outside of
Parliament, have covered the whole field of
post-war problems. In this Chamber there
are men familiar with conditions in the various
provinces who can approach these problems
from a different angle from that adopted
elsewhere. If we are what we say we are,
men of knowledge and experience, let us use
our knowledge and experience in carrying on
the work proposed for this committee.
I am particularly interested in a matter
that I think has a bearing on the whole
economic welfare of southern Saskatchewan
and Alberta, namely, water conservation. If
the waters that are now being wasted in those
provinces every spring were stored in reservoirs
and utilized when needed, as is done in the
United States, we might change the whole
picture in Western Canada by bringing large
areas out of wheat raising into mixed farming.
In the part of the country where I live there
is a very considerable acreage of irrigated
land. I recall that a good many years ago, I
think it was in 1919, one of the driest years
we had in Western Canada, my honourable
friend from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder) made
a trip through parts of my province that I
should call deserts, but he finally came to
irrigated oases where he found an abundance
of verdure, and fertile land on which various
crops were being raised. Could a committee
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN.

of the Senate not deal with this subject of
water conservation in a sane and constructive
way?
I feel that so much timber is being cut for
commercial purposes on the eastern slope of
the Rocky mountains that we are in danger
of bringing about a condition such as China
has suffered from. We are destroying the
protection for snows and waters that nature
intended should feed the streams, and if the
present rate of cutting is continued many
streams will dry up. I mention that only
casually as another matter worthy of our
study.
I am -taking up more time than I had
intended, but I will not detain the House much
longer. Recently I came across a little book by
an authority on world geography and resources,
containing statements so flattering to the part
of the country from which I come that I cannot
refrain from making a brief quotation. I hope it
will direct the attention of the Senate to some
of this country's great possibilities, which,
though they may not have any direct relation
to post-war reconstruction problems, deserve to
be studied by a body such as this. The book,
entitled "Canada's Role in Geopolitics," was
written by Professor Griffith Taylor, Professor
of Geography in the University of Toronto, a
former President of the British Geographers'
and the American Geographers' Associations.
After speaking of some of the mineral products
of Canada as a whole, he goes on to say:
Possibly of all the mineral products of Canada the last to be discussed will in the long
run be the most important. This is the vast
coal field of southern Alberta. The coal is of
the Cretaceous age, and is not equal in quality
to the carboniferous coals of Nova Seotia or of
the United States. But it is more valuable than
the brown coals of Europe, which the Germans
are using to a tremendous extent in modern
industry. Around Lethbridge and Drumheller
it bas been estimated that there are about
600.000 million tons in reserve. This is considerably more than the combined coal supplies
of Germany and Poland, which have led to the
growth of huge industrial populations in those
countries. The sole rivals of Alberta, if we
accept the figures quoted, are to be found in the
United States, which bas vastly greater supplies
(near the Rockies, and around Illinois), and
China (Shansi) and Siberia.
A little further on, writing from the angle
of geopolitics, with which I suppose many
of us are not particularly familiar, he says:
The unlimited supplies of Alberta coal will,
in all probability, produce the densest Canadian
population of the future.
Professor Taylor's statements may have no
relation to any problem we are immediately
concerned with, but I think they indicate the
Senate would not be wasting time in studying
certain aspects of our national resources, par-

MARCH 4, 1943
ticularly those that have been developed during the war. My thought' is that, as I suggested a few moments aga, we could probsbly
appraach this whole question of reconstructian
from a somewhat different stsndpaint fram
that associsted with studies made by other
groups.

Yesterday we hsd a short discussion ini
respect ta criticisms of this Chamber. I have
frequently heard those who defend. the Senate
argue that it should be a body ta investigate
as well as ta review; that aur committees
could often take the place of royal cammissions. If that view appeals to honaurable
members--I think it would appeal thraughaut
the country ta people who want the Senate
to do the best it eau ta serve Canada-I do
not see why there should ha the slightest
objection ta the appointment of the committee
proposed in this motion. We may have ta
go over some af the material that has been
gone over befare by other bodies, but surely
the members of this Chamber can bring forward new ideas sud offer constructive suggestions that, whether acceptable ta the
Gavernmeut or not, might readily appeal ta
the people at large.
Hlon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Hýonourable members, it might be wise at this time ta suspend
the debate until the n-ext sitting. If this
is agrecable ta the honourable leader of the
Hanse, I should lika ta maya adjourument of
the debate.
Hou. Mr. KING: I should not be eager ta
adjouru the debste at this stage. I do not
wish ta speak now in reply ta my honoural
friand, but I sbauld like the debste ta be
brought ta a conclusion befare we adjouru
for same time. In fact I may as well advise
honourable members uaw that it is the intention ta adjourn until the 23rd of March.
That beiug sa, I sbould like the debste ta
be concluded and the propased committea
sppointed sa that it may complete its organization before we adjourn. If, howeýver, the
motion of my hanourable friend ýis acceptable ta the Hanuse, I sea no abjection ta
aur adjourning the debate until to-morrow:
afternoon.

Han. N. M. PATERS ON: Honourable
seustars, before the Senate adjaurns I desire
ta make a few remsrks an the motion. I
think there has been a little misunderstsnding
in regard ta the abj-ect of the' proposed
committee. It seems ta me tha-t the honourable gentleman from Montarville (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien) completely proved the case for the
sppointment of. such a committea.

I should like to explýain one or two th-ings
that I had in mind wben I spoke ta aur
honourahie leader a short time ago in regard
ta the subject-matter of this motion. I have
.in mind how the situation at Fort William
may be affected hy post-war conditions. The
Canada Car Company is now manufacturing
aeropla.nes at its factory -in Fort William. It
is reasonable ta cxpect that when the war is
over there will he about 5,000 trained men
out of employment. Those men have been
there for at lest t.hree years, and the maj ority of themn have married and acquired homes
and are raising; families. In a word, they are
firmily estahlished in the city. The situation
would be really seriaus if that plant were ta
close down and -its 5,000 employees were thrown
upon a city which is nat able ta psy out a
grcat deal in, unemployment doles. We have
also a shaîl factory and, a shipbuilding plant
at Port Arthur. The affairs of one city are
pretty much anialogous ta th-ose of the other,
and you may regard bath as olie community.
I ask honourable members ta picture what msy
happen with the war over and no provision
made ta take care of these people. My point
is that were this committee estýablisbed it
could send word ýahesd to the local city council
ta provide the necessary secretarial help in
order ta prepare for a hearing for the purpose
of getting ideas from variaus persons as to
the best means of absorbing same of the labour
that might be thrown on the masrket when a
factary becames idla. A similar situation,
I assume, would exist in Montreal and
Toronto, in fact prabably in every city of
Canada in which war industries are located.
It has been said that hack of our territory
lies a vast extent of land that could be utilized
for agricultural. purpases. As honaurable senstars are aware, there is s great deal of timber
in the northarn areas, aud it has ta a certain
extent been devalaped, but in this connection
I should like ta give s few particulars of what
may occur after the war. Up ta the time the
war started, Sweden and Norway were sending almost 2,000,000 tons af ground woodpulp into the msrkets of the United States.
That business of course has been intarrupted,
,but as soan as tha wsr is over, those people
hsving tha freedom. of the St. Lawrence river
wîll be able again ta, ship their ground woodpulp into, thase markets--markets which we
naw enjoy exclusively. Our timbar industry
would be bsdly hurt, because the Scandinavians
can ship their production a great deal more
cheapiy than we can, as they have not the
high-pricad labour that we have encouraged in
this country. Ohviously, we shall have a difficuit situation ta face if the war ends suddenly
and sîl that ground wood-pulp is thrown upon
aur hsnds.

bu

SENATE

The agricultural end also deserves attention. I hope my honourable friend opposite
will not leave the Chamber for a minute or
two. It is said that every farmer on the land
is supposed to keep ten men busy in the cities..
A soldier at the front is supposed to keep
sixteen men busy behind the lines. If what
is said as to the farmer be true, it seems to
me we could absorb a good deal more labour
in urban centres by having more farmers on
the land. I think it would be interesting to
know how the farmer will be affected after
the war. I was looking at our figures to-day
and noticed that in the last few weeks we
sold three-quarters of a million bushels of
oats for shipment to Cedar Rapids. This
year we have handled more barley than we
ever handled in our lives before. The possibility is that this country may change somewhat from wheat growing to the production
of coarse grains, with great advantage to the
farmer.
All these things should be investigated and
the information made available to us. If we
are not afraid to work-and I am quite sure
we are not-the job could be divided up evenly
among us, and information could be secured
which would be of great value for the purpose
of dealing with post-war problems. I am
afraid I have not enough confidence in college professors to expect them to bring in
a report of any practical value. It may have
a psychological effect, but what we want is to
provide employment for the people after the
war is over. I believe that the proposed
committee would be able to bring in a report
of considerable value at not too much cost to
the country.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN:
Is my honourable friend not aware that all the problems he
bas nentioned have been studied by a committee of the other House?
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: I am sorry, but
I have never seen any report by that committee. It may be that we should not need
to ]eave this city, but might study the problems on the ground here. But that committee
has never held a meeting in Fort Williamand we are concerned with what we are going
to do with the Canada Car Works there when
the war ends.

SUPPLEMENTARY 1942 WAR
PRIATION BILL

APPRO-

REFERENCE OF ESTIMATES TO COMMITTEE

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. B. F. SMITH: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are proceeded
with I should like to submit a question to
the honourable leader of the Government.
He will recall that when the supplementary
estimates for $858,000,000 were brought down
on the 16th of last month I inquired whether
or not we could refer to the items later. I
realized the importance of the passage of that
Bill and had no desire to impede its progress.
I should like to ask the honourable leader
whether he will be agreeable to have those
estimates go before the Banking and Commerce
Committee or the Finance Committee, so that
the total may be broken down and we may
be able to ascertain what items make up the
total.
Hon. J. H. KING: Yes. I see no objection
at all to the honourable gentleman's suggestion. In fact that is the desire in referring
these matters to the committee. It will be
done later in the session.
Hon. J. A. CALDER:
The honourable
gentleman spoke to me to-day about it, and
I can sce that there will be a slight difficulty
in the way of bis suggestion. We have a
Finance Committee which, as explained by
the honourable member from Prince (Hon.
Mr. MacArthur), has not met for a number
of years. The investigation or inquiry proposed would be a very large one, and I think
the leader of the House intimated the other
day that the committee might be enlarged.
I would suggest that, instead, he consider the
desirability of joining together the Finance
Çommittee and the Committee on Banking
and Commerce. That would make a fairly
large committee, of course, but this is a big
subject.

On motion of Hon. Mr. Sinclair, the debate
was adjourned.

Hon. Mr. KING: Many of the members of
the Finance Committee are also members of
the Committee on Banking and Commerce.

The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at
3 p.m.

time, has had very little to do. Here is an

opportunity, and I would make the suggestion
to the leader that he consider having the two
committees joined together.
Hon. Mr. KING: It is worth considering.
COMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC RE-ESTABLISHMENT AND SOCIAL SECURITY
MOTION-COMMITTEE APPOINTED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the debate on the motion of Hon. Mr. King for the
appointment of a special committee to consider
and report on matters arising out of post-war
conditions.
Hon. J. E. SINCLAIR: Honourable senators, in continuing the debate on the motion
now before us for the appointment of a committee to examine into the many questions that
are paramount in this country, as well as in
other countries, and second only to the war
effort, with which we must allow nothing to
interfere, may I say the procedure proposed
appeals to me as being a very proper one.
There are various reasons for this. One, which
perhaps is closer to us than any other, is that,
as we often complain, important legislation
that has been considered for a long time in
the lower House comes to the Senate when we
have no opportunity to study it as fully as we
should like. We could overcome that difficulty
by having our committee investigate such questions and get information on them from those
who are best qualified to give it, both from
within the Government service and from outside.
As was stated previously in this debate by
the honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert), many committees outside of the
membership of Parliament which have given
consideration to reconstruction programmes
and related. problems would, I am sure, be
much pleased to give us first-hand information
on various matters, particularly those which
have not been dealt with by committees in
the other House. It was pointed out during
the debate that we might be traversing similar
ground to that traversed by committees of the
other branch of Parliament. I think that difficulty could be very easily overcome. Full cooperation should exist between the two
branches of Parliament, so that they would
not cover the same ground and would not be
having before them men dealing with similar
subjects.
There is no doubt, I think, in the minds of
honourable members that the proceedings of
our committee should be printed and kept for
reference, as the record might be useful to us
and perhaps be the basis on which legislation
would afterwards be founded.

87

I do not wish to take up too much time just
now in discussing the need of an inquiry. The
field for investigation is so wide that when our
committee begins its sittings we should have a
clear understanding as to the lines along which
the inquiry will proceed. In that respect, I
think the discussion by honourable members
in this Chamber will be a guide for the
committee.
In the Press of all the English-speaking
countries we have of late seen a great deal
of material based primarily on Sir William
Beveridge's report to the British Government.
That report has received so much favourable
comment in the Press and from public men
that everyone apparently believes that some
programme along the lines it recommends
should be carried out in all the Allied nations.
When we consider that fact we must, it seems
to me, come to the conclusion that action
must be taken in a broad way to bring about
that freedom from want and fear which was
pràposed in the Atlantic Charter and in our
own Speech from the Throne. In the British
Parliament the Beveridge report has been the
subject of considerable discussion, all of which,
I think, has been directed to the bringing in
of certain social provisions for eliminating
want and fear in the future.
As I said at the start, our first concern must
be the prosecution of the war, but, as a
fundamental basis for the efforts our armed
forces and our industries are making to that
end, the Prime Minister of Great Britain and
the President of the United States have set
down in the Atlantic Charter certain objectives
at which social legislation should be aimed by
all the nations now engaged in trying to rid the
world of oppression. I do not need to read
the Atlantic Charter; its contents are well
known to honourable members.
When we look into the post-war era and
observe that the nation to the south of us
is prepared to extend its lease-lend aid for
the rehabilitation of countries that will not
be able to rehabilitate themselves after the
war, and holds out the hope of raw materials
being provided for the needs of all nations
with as little impediment as possible by way
of tariffs and otherwise, we must realize that
great changes are facing us, changes that will
require very careful consideration before we
can get them down to a workable basis.
I might mention now a few of the conclusions given by Sir William Beveridge in
his report, to which I have already referred.
These conclusions, in my opinion, are applicable to Canada generally. He cited conditions in Great Britain, where social legislation
has, I think, gone further than in any other
country in the world to meet the needs of the

SENATE
people. Sir William points out that each of
the different branches of social legislation
was being administered at a cost considerably
higher than could bc justified. He recommends that one central authority be set up
to administer the different branches of social
security. It does appear te me that our proposed committee might well inquire how far
we should go in this direction; whether it is
wise to have a full, all-out system of social
insurance and give support to allied services
that are not contributory in Canada at the
start, or whether we should let the system
grow up piecemeal, as has been the case in
the United Kingdom. I hesitate to express
an opinion, but I submit it is a phase of the
subject well worthy of our consideration.
It is important to bear in mind what was
stated by the honourable leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Ballantyne), that in dealing with
social security we nay get into constitutional
difficulties with the provinces. I am quite
sure means will be found to overcome such
difficulties, but it will take time and patient
negotiation. However, that is more properly
within the sphere of the Government of the
day in Ottawa. Some arrangement will have
to bc worked out between the provincial and
federal authorities, either by amendments to
the British North America Act or by agreement.
The Beveridge report recommends that in
order to protect the people from economic
fear and want there should be set up a subsistence level for the whole population, also a
level of income, and that those who receive an
income above that level should bc contributors
to the gencral fund for the security of those
below the subsistence level. It is evident
that Parliament will have to consider very
carefully to what degree this principle can bc
enforced by legislation.
If wc sbould set up such a subsistence level,
I do not sec how we could avoid exercising
some control over the cost of living. Our
proposed committee might well make a study
of this in order to ascertain whether or not
it would bc necessary to continue the controls
now exercised by our Wartime Prices and
Trade Board. In the absence of such controls
the committee would have to consider how
we are to provide for an increase or a decrease
in the cost of living in relation to the subsistence level.
There is an international side to this question also, for we shall have to consider how
far other countries are ready to go, and what
terns we may have to live up to as a result
of the negotiations upon which peace will be
based. We hope and believe that we shall bc
anong the nations which will take part in the
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR.

negotiations. Those terms we cannot very
well foresee at the moment, but they will
have a bearing on any legislation that may
be introduced along the lines I have mentioned.
I was rather surprised by the rather negative
position which the honourable leader opposite
took yesterday with regard to the proposed
committee, and in view of his remarks I desire
to give a few quotations illustrating the views
of leading Canadians both in finance and
industry. Mr. J. A. McLeod, president of the
Bank of Nova Scotia, in the course of his
presidential address at the 111th annual meeting of the bank said:
The greatest problem of the future, both in
the period of transition and later, will be that
of obtaining an adequate volume of employment and a greater degree of economie security
for the people of Canada. There is no doubt
that the Government bas a major responsibility
in bringing about such conditions, and as an
indication of the development of thought in this
direction the Beveridge plan is worthy of the
most careful study.
Another leader in finance whom I desire to
quote is Mr. Charles McCrea, K.C., now
president of the Toronto General Trusts
Corporation, but at the time he made the
remarks I am about to read Ue was its vicepresident. In moving the adoption of the
report at the 61st annual meeting of the
corporation he said:
The task of war is still a colossal one. Hopes
and wishful thinking cannot achieve success.
The road te victory is still a long one. We
shall meet trial, sacrifice, suffering and anxiety,
every step of the way. llitler's European
fortress still stands. Battle grounds in the
Pacifie and in the far eastern seas impose
tremendous jobs. The task of controlling enemey
submarine forces is pressing and vital, for men,
food, munitions and supplies nust irove over
far-flung seas to our fighting men and allies in
every zone of need.
A New Moral Order
There is a second great job beckoning us.
It, too, is a colossal one. it is the job of winning
the peace-an enduring peace. As yet, only the
foundation stones have been laid. These stones
are to be found in the "Four Freedoms" included
in the Message of President Roosevelt in the
77th Congress of the United States of America
in January, 1941, and the "Eight Points of the
Atlantic Charter" of August, 1941. How farreaching these main principles are. Their
application, and the details to complete the
picture, must await events, but meanwhile we
must not flag nor fail. If our fight si the titanic
struggle, still at fever heat, is one to preserve
our Christian civilization and our way of life,
then the teachings of Christ must forem the
foundations of and animate the peace structure,
for a new moral order must prevail.
Post-war Planning
A rearrangement of world affairs is a certainty. The cry is a freer world and a better
world, and Canada must face the problems
involved, both in the rebuilding, and in the

MARCH 5, 1943
successful operation of the new set-up. Canada
must put on its thinking cap now, for post-war
problems involve
(a) Canada's internal relations among its own
nationals, and
(b) Canada's external relations among the
nations of the world.
Canada must be ready for peace-making. It
must make studies and know its problems and
be able to defend its proposals. These studies
should not be left to Government agencies only,
but leaders in every phase of our interna]
economy must play a part in their preparation.
There will be many fields of discussion. Basic
products and basic industry-manufacturingfinance-transportation-capital-labour-social
legislation-standards of living-free enterprise
-and the many new suggestions for Government
control. Peace Conference decisions may have
vital and far-reaching effects on the destiny of
our country.
Canada has the resources-the industriesthe skill of workmen-and the genius of
leaders-to play an outstanding part in world
reconstruction.
When such outstanding men express themselves in those strong terms, I think it behooves us at least to set up the proposed
committee and go as fully as possible into
whatever phases of the question we may arrange
with the committee of the House of Commons to deal with in order to avoid duplicating its efforts. Let us do our own work and
do it well.
Another statement which I think will interest
honourable senators was made by Dr. Sydney
E. Smith, of Winnipeg, president of the
National Council of the Y.M.C.A. of Canada.
Under date of February 12, the Ottawa Citizen
published the following dispatch from Toronto:
Dr. Sydney E. Smith, of Winnipeg, president
of the National Council, earlier in the day told
the meeting the war had promoted better
relations not only within the British Commonwealth, but among all the United Nations. But
he warned the peace may be lost "if we do not
capitalize these vigorous and constructive impulses for a better society."
I have opinions expressed by other prominent men in the industrial and financial life of
the country, but I do not think I need direct
them to the attention of honourable members
at this time. There is just one other matter I
should like to refer to. Honourable members
no doubt have received in the mail, as I have,
a pamphlet entitled "A Beveridge Plan in
Canada," by Huntly R. Drummond. On the
front cover of this pamphlet are the words,
"Look before you leap." I cite this in support of our effort at this time in setting up an
inquiry to learn how far we can go and what
it is possible for us to do in this direction.
But when I look inside the pamphlet I find
many things with which I would not care to be
associated, and with which I do not agree. I
think that whoever composed this pamphlet
should have given the matter more consideration than it would appear to have received.

80

Another pamphlet that I have just received
in the mail is, I think, worthy of note. It
contains a statement by Mr. George F. Davidson, M.A., Ph.D., Executive Director of the
Canadian Welfare Council. As he is associated
with Canadian welfare, I think his comment on
the Beveridge plan is worthy of consideration.
I cite these gentlemen in support of the suggestion that the inquiry we are setting up is
justified. I do not think the more or less negative attitude taken by the honourable senator
from Alma (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) on this
question is the general opinion of many worthy
citizens of Canada.
I may say in conclusion, honourable members, that I think we should get the committee
working as soon as possible. There is a large
field of inquiry to be covered. When work like
this becomes available to us, and we appoint a
committee, it is the right and privilege of every
member of the Senate to attend, and, except
for voting, to take an equal part with members
of the committee in its deliberations. I think
that, with proper guidance and with the cooperation of the committee of the other House,
we are fully justified in undertaking an inquiry
at this time.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators,
I wish to make a few remarks. It seemed yesterday that what I have to say might not be
in order, but after listening to honourable
members I think it may be useful at this time.
In view of what I said on a former occasion,
I want honourable senators to understand that
I am not a Socialist in any particular. 1, perhaps, am more fearful of National Socialism
coming into this country than is any other
member of this Chamber. I think I realize
that the main cause of National Socialism in
the several countries that have it to-day was
that they neglected to regulate their democracies and allowed abuses to creep in. As a result
the people lost confidence in the democratic
form of government and turned to a National
Socialist state.
If this committee is merely going to patch
here and patch there, we know what will happen. We read in the Bible that
No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto
an old garment, for that which is put in to fill
it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is
made worse.
If that is what this committee is going to
attempt to do, it is, in my opinion, absolutely
useless. I believe it is essential for the committee to study some fundamental changes and
controls in the present set-up of our government.
I should like to refer for a moment to some
extracts froin the debates in the British House
of Commons. Mr. Leslie, the member for
Sedgefield, said:

90

SFNATE

. . The nations must organize for peace not
less earnestly than they have organized for war.
May I remind the House, and those die-hards
who sneer at planning, of what the Foreign
Secretary said at the Mansion House on the
29th of May, 1941?
And this is what the Foreign Secretary said:
We have declared that social security must
be the first objective of our domestic policy
after the war, and social security will be our
policy abroad no less than at honme. It will be
our wish to work with others to prevent the
starvation of the post-armistice period, the
currency disorders throughout Europe, and the
wide fluctuations of employment, markets and
prices which were the cause of so much misery
in the 20 years between the two wars.
Then Mr. Leslie goes on to tell what
happened in his constituency. He says:
In the six years from 1932 to 1938 no fewer
than 41,607 persons migrated from the county
of Durham alone, trying to seek employment in
other parts of the country. In my constituency
there is a village called Stillington. It was
made dereliet by the removal of blast furnaces,
leaving behind an unsightly slag irountain. At
the beginning of this war a small company was
formed to produce insulation material from the
slag heap, and the material Las proved of
immense value in the war. That company was
able to find work for local men who had been
unenployed for over ten years. One produet
worthy of mention was a fire-resistant cork
substitute. Cork had been coming from Spain
and Sardinia, and vessels lad been lost in bringing it here. The company interested in the cork
in Spain was known as the Vestey Combine,
which seem te have a finger in every pie, fron
ice-cream to cork. They sought to buy out this
small company, which is the Cork and Asbestos
Insulation Company. Being thwarted in their
design, they secured by subtle means a Government licence to construct works and enter into
competition not only with the Stillington works,
but with old-established firms in the production
of slag wool. Thus we see how small businesses
are placed at the mercy of unscrupulous cocobines. Surely monopolies of this kind are a
danger to the nation, and the Government ought
to keep a watchful eye on their activities.
Then Mr. Bevan says:
We are sent here because we are amateurs;
net because we are experts. Representative
government is government of the experts by the
an:ateurs, and always Las been. If you are
going to leave this matter to the experts you
will bu handing the war over to Fascism at
once. That is whbat Faisni is.
Since the
amateur started to govern socicty a comparatively short time ago, mankind Las made more
progress in 150 years than in the 10.000 years
during which it was governed by the experts.
There is no reason for us te bow our heads
in shame because of representative government.
Democratie representative government has more
to its credit than any other single political
institution.
These are the thoughts of the gentleman I
have named, and they are somewhat similar
to my own. We must have changes-very
great changes.
lon. Mr. HORNER.

I have here a booklet which I presume Las
been sent to all honourable senators. It is
called "Wheat and the Futures Market." I
do not intend to read it. It is very well prepared, and perhaps might go before the conmittee. It deals with the futures market of
the Winnipeg Grain Exchange, and mentions
various markets which, the author asserts, are
similar to the Winnipeg Exchange. Among
them he refers to the Union Stock-yards at
St. Boniface. There is a futures market for
wheat, but not for cattle; and there is no
similarity at all between these markets, so
far as that is concerned. He sets out the
great benefits of the futures market in financing the crop. He analyses it, and tells who
finance it. He calls them speculators. I call
them gamblers. I am sorry to say that many
of them are Western farmers, and that they
are losing money by their operations. That
is part of the reason why they require legislation to assist them to-day. If that is the
best method modern democracy can devise
for the handling of such an important cornmodity as grain, it is time for a change.
Certainly it is profitable to those who have
seats on the Exchange, because they charge a
rake-off on every bushel sold; but they are the
only ones to benefit. Sometimes an entire
crop Las been sold as often as forty-five times.
I merely mention thlese as things that rmight
very well come before the committee.
It is claimed that the exchanges furnish a
service in estimating the crop year. I do not
know why there is no such service for estimating the number of machines the farmers buy.
Why the sellers of the grain should consider
it necessary to advertise to the world whcen
there is a surplus, I do not know. If I am
permitted a personal reference, there is one
thing I should like to say. In the year 1937,
J think it was, when a board, including a
former president of the Grain Exchange, was
proceeding to sell the farmers' wheat at
around eighty or eighty-five cents a bushel,
they were very slow in estimating the crop.
J do not claini to be an expert at estimating
crops, but I travelled from Winnipeg to Calgary, and although there was a crop of about
one hundred and thirty million bushels in the
West that year, I was able to estimate within
one million bushels. The farmers' wheat was
being taken away frem them, being sold for
eighty to eighty-five cents a bushel, and it
went to $150.
We are concerned to-day about the price
of wheat, and what to do with it. We cooperate with the United States in regard to
the manufacture of munitions and that sort
of thing. I wonder why there should not be

MARCH 5, 1943
a little co-operation with regard to food. In the
big United States market we see wheat quoted
at $1.49 a bushel when in Winnipeg it is at
ninety-one and a fraction cents. How can
the people of Western Canada feel at ease
when they see that? Cattle prices are five
cents a pound higher in the United States
than in Canada, and hogs are almost five cents
a pound higher.
On the other hand, the Minister of Finance
allows restaurant keepers to charge five cents
extra for a cup of tea. Surely that is taking
money out of the poor man's pocket. I read
in a trade journal not long ago that ever since
the depression in 1930 the one class of people
who have been prospering all over this continent were the restaurant keepers. They have
been making money every year. Every other
business is regulated-we have weights and
measures and all sorts of inspections--but there
is no limit to the prices that can be charged by
the restaurants. They can give you, as I think
they sometimes do, about a twentieth of a
pound of bacon and charge you 35 cents for
it, which works out to about $7 a pound.
Yet these are the people who. are being assisted
now by permission to charge an extra five
cents for a cup of tea or coffee. If a working
man needs six cups a day, that means 30 cents
off his daily wages. This assistance to restaurant proprietors is entirely unnecessary.
It is one of the things that should be done
away with if we are to have peace and plenty
in this country.
Another thing. Honourable senators will
remember that before the war flax was selling
at 40 cents a bushel in this country, and there
was no sale for it because of the large quantities of vegetable oils that were coming in
free. I imagine that a few men were reaping
the benefit frorn that situation; that a few
men were making more money than they had
any use for. That was a calamity to the
people in Western Canada.
My point is that if we are going to have a
plan of social security which simply hands
out a dole to the people in order that the
present system may be continued, I have no
hope of any good being accomplished by the
proposed committee of the Senate. What, we
need are some measures to change the economic set-up under which we have been
living.
As was said some years ago by the right
honourable gentleman who formerly was
leader of this House, economic problems like
those of to-day did not face our country at
all when maffy of us here were boys. Men
went out to work with a scythe, let us say.
One man could do a little more than another,

91

but all could do enough to procure a living.
But to-day, with the vast organizations-the
wealthy combines, if you will-that wield such
wide control, we find there is need for a
referee. I repeat, honourable senators, that
you will not save the situation by handing
out doles, for by doing that you will ruin the
very people you attempt to benefit.
Referring back to the restaurants for a
moment, I am glad to be able to say that
when I was a boy they did not have the
machines they now use for shaving those thin
slices of bacon. Some of our people are often
criticized for having no ambition. Is it any
wonder that they lack ambition if they get
their meals at restaurants? I imagine that
many men who eat at those places are partly
starved and have not enough energy to work
well. Yes, I am glad the bacon was not
shaved so thin when I was a boy, or I might
have been a good deal thinner than I am,
and not much good for anything.
I shall be perfectly willing to assist on the
committee, if the motion is carried, but I
maintain that in order to bring about any
permanent good we must make fundamental
changes. We are told that in the olden days
the people formed a committee to inspect a
certain piece of country and bring back a
report upon it. The committee reported that
they found a land flowing with milk and
honey, and that all the inhabitants were
giants. Well, we hear a great deal of talk
to-day about Canada being a land of wealth,
and on the other hand we know there is
poverty amidst plenty. That is our fault,
honourable senators, the fault of the Government and perhaps of everybody else. This
is a land flowing with milk and honey, and
it is time we took stock and acted in such a
way that all would have a share in that milk
and honey. Under the present system, to
quote what was said by a former Minister of
Agriculture, the man who needs the most gets
the least.
I may have perhaps exceeded the proper
limits for an occasion such as this, but
honourable senators will pardon me. In closing, I want to emphasize my sincere belief
that in discussing reconstruction problems we
shall have to go right to the root of things, or
otherwise we shall be only putting a new
patch on an old garment, and it will not be
long before the rent is worse than it was in
the first place.
Hon. W. McL. ROBERTSON: Honourable
senators, I would crave your indulgence if I,
a junior member of this Chamber, should
appear to transgress the rules of propriety and
good taste in venturing, so soon after my

SENATE
introduction, to express an opinion of the
motion before us. As justification, if that be
needed, I should like to say that I come from
a province in which I believe a majority of the
people are not only desirous that the influence
of the Senate of Canada shall not diminish,
but are more than anxious that it shall
materially increase. The reasons are obvious.
In this House we of the Maritime Provinces
have a numerical strength which is perhaps in
keeping with our position at Confederation;
and it probably is equal to what we had hoped
it would be at this moment, and, I believe, to
what we hope it may be in the future. The
Maritime Provinces have twenty-five per cent
of the numerical strength of the Senate,
whereas in the elected body our proportion has
dwindled to less than ten per cent.
I am bound to say, however, honourable
senators, that while no other portion of Canada
would more fiercely oppose abolition of the
Senate, there is, I believe, on the part of
many of our people, who are kindly disposed
towards this branch of our parliamentary system, a growing feeling that in the changing
conditions which have gradually developed in
recent years and perhaps have had greater
emphasis since the outbreak of war, this
branch has not been fully alive te its opportunities of service te the public of Canada. Se,
honourable senators, it was a particular
pleasure te me, upon my introduction here,
te find on the Order Paper a motion, subsequently moved by the honourable leader of
this House, in terms that evidenced a freshness of mind and a responsibility te the body
politic which I believe is worthy of the highest
commendation. It was as well a particular
pleasure te me te find among honourable members with whom I came in contact, on this
side of the House at least, a willingness and
eagerness te render, in any way within their
power, service in keeping with the spirit and
letter of that motion.
In all parts of the Dominion to-day, bodies
public, semi-public and private, despite the
increasing responsibilities thrown on them as
individuals and groups. are giving a generous
amount of their time te consideration of the
great problems with which we shall be faced
in the post-war world. Boards of trade, municipal councils, associations representing primary
producers, employees and employers, and the
provincial governments are considering the
situation from their respective viewpoints.
And, as was pointed out a day or two ago by
the honourable senator from Ottawa (lon.
Mr. Lambert), the Government and honourable members of another louse, despite the
crushing responsibilities of carrying on the
war, have made time te give careful consideratien te the future. I should judge that their
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

action in this respect lias been reasonably
successful, since it has won the enthusiastic
applause even of honourable senators opposite
who spoke yesterday or the day before.
Faced with these countless instances of disinterested public service, honourable senators,
is it to be suggested that this body is to give
no consideration te the future? We cannot
plead lack of time. The incidence of war, far
from increasing our responsibilities in this
House, has tended te diminish them; and,
from what the honourable leader of this House
has indicated, the tendency in future will be
rather te diminish them still further than te
increase them. Nor can we plead lack of
facilities, for they are around us on every
side; and we are indemnified for our time
from the treasury of the Dominion of Canada.
We must not take refuge behind the technical argument that our sole traditional function is te review and revise legislation
emanating from the Commons, at a time
when from the highest te the lowest our
people are giving se generously of time and
energy te all that they can do net only in
the prosecution of the war, but also in applying their best abilities and judgment te
preparation of plans for the future. I feel,
honourable senators, that this motion presents
a unique opportunity te consider the broad
principles that will govern this country in the
future in matters of national and international
importance. Far removed as we are from
the racial and national animosities of the
old world, perhaps we by precept and example
may be able te afford a beacon light te a
strife-torn world. We, as members of the
Parliament of Canada, need have no inferiority complex in approaching this or any
other problem. Canada's contribution te the
prosecution of the war has amazed the world,
and often the larger nations among our Allies
have sought te emulate our example. We
have learned in international affairs how a
small nation can live beside a large nation
without fear. We have learned to live in
harmony and with an ever-increasing mutual
respect beside others who differ from us in
racial origin, language, and religion. We are
united in our desire ever te increase the sum
total of human happiness for every human
being within our borders, and we have, I
hope, the wit te appreciate the fact that
it is equally desirable te raise the standard
of those who are without. Perhaps it is
ordained that we shall exercise on the postwar world an influence far out of proportion
te our numbers.
It is because I believe, honourable senators,
that the adoption of this motion presents an
opportunity for us te give our best considera-

MARCH 5, 1943
tien to this most important task from the
point of view of the Dominion of Canada
as a wliole that the motion shail have, as far
as I am concerned, my strongest support,
both in the spirit and the letter; and I shal
be surprised and disappointed if after dune
and mature reflection eaci lionourable senator
does not deal witli it likewise.
Hon. CAIRINE WILSON: Honourable
senators, during the hast two days we have
heard much of the considerations that
prompted the Fathers of Confederation to
insist on a second cliamber, but, despite the
judgment of the Judicial Committee of the
Privy Council, I do not think the founding
fathers ever considered that a woman was
a "person" and eligible for admission to this
Senate. However, tlie present situation
clearly indicates that times have clianged.
I was inteirested in the statement by the
lionourable senator from Aima (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne) that it was nlot our duty to
advise the Government as to legislation. It
seemas to me that of our outstandýing committees there are two which were distinctly
set up for that purpose, althougli 1 confess
tliey have been -somewhat inactive. I refer
to our Committee on External Relations,
which I think would profit by a study of
international questions and perhaps be able
to advise the department thereon. The other
is our Committee on Commere~ and Trade
Relations. The purpose of both these committees would seem to refute the contention
of the bonourable gentleman from Alma.
1 was interested in listening to our colleague
from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien), wlio
yesterday seemed to think that agriculture
could be placed in a water-tight compartment.
The lionourable senator from, Saskatchewan
Nortli (Hon. Mr. Horner) lias sliown this
afternoon that tliat is impossible. We know
tliat the farmer is dependent for his prosperity
on both domestic and foreign markets, and
tliat the reason the farmers with ahl the other
people of Canada suffered so severe'ly during
the depression was tlie lack of markets. That
is, experts must be paid for by importa. Tlie
war lias demonstrated to us the truth of what
formerly we refused to believe.
We have lieard mudli about the work of tlie
proposed commiittee, in regard to questions
which are bound to arise af ter the war. I
have liad many communications from women
wha are eoncerned that se little attention has
been given to their particular probhems. As
we aIl know, an enormous number of women
wlio before the war had net souglit remunerative empînyment are now gainfully employed.
It is very doubtful whether tliey will be
oontent to return te the Tanks of non-

9

workers. I contend that even those women
are employed who do nlot receive pay for
their work, and when ýthe war is ended they
will stili be included in the vast body to
whom consideration must be given.
Tlirough our much lamented senator from
Eganville (H-on. Mr. Graham) I have been
greatly interested in a nursing service national
in scope: I refer to the Vietorian Order of
Nurses. This order supplies nursing services
to about a third of the population of Canada.
I know that during the last decade, when many
nurses were unemployed, fully two-thirds of
our people were in need of their services.
This is something to be borne in mind should
a similar situation arise in the future. I think
we are aware of an awakened public conscience in this respect.
Not only would it be to the advantage of
our people in need to receive nursing attention, but this service and ahl other forms of
health insurance would give a substantial
return in dollars and cents. I read recently
a statement by one of our. public men to the
effeet that il health had last year cost
Canada 8300,000,000. I know that during 1940,
the first year the Commonwealth Air Training
Plan was in operation, it cost Canada

approximately 100,000 beds in our hospitals,
and these are filled virtually every day of the
year. It is said that on the average there are
50,000 persons absent from industry every
working day. These ilinesses are largely preventable. We can well afford.to give our best
attention to such problems.
Since I have been in this Chamber I have
heard -continual complaints that legislhation
which cornes te us fromn the House of Commons has not been as carefully considered as
we should wish, and that we have to pass it
very hurriedly. Even though we cannot
greatly influence legislation, we shaîl at least
acquire some menit in the country if we
seriously consider the problems involved. and
learn aIl we possibly can about them.
I was greatly impressed the other day by
a passage whicli a Czech lady attributed to a
patriot of lier native land, whomn we know as
Comenius, but whomn the Czechs know as
Komenski. -Nearly three centuries ago, in
1645 , lie said:
It is not proper that only the ehildren of the
rich and noble should be sent to sehool. All,
without difference, high-born and low-born, ricli
and poor, boys and girls in ahi cities, towns,
villages and liamlets, sliould be educated. And
this because tliey were born that tliey maiglit

of wisdom entirely. For they too are made in
the image of God. They too are gifted with a
mind quick to understand and susceptible to
wisdom-often more so than the male sex. To
them, too, the road to high affairs is open:
frequently even to the governing of nations, to
giving excellent advice to kings and princes,
also to the medical art and to other matters
beneficial to mankind. . . .
Why, then, should we admit them to the
alphabet first and drive them from the books
afterwards?
I think this bears out recent remarks by the
honourable senator for Saltceoats (Hon. Mr.
Calder). I was much pleased when he said it
was useless to give our young people education
if we did not give them healthy bodies as
well.
We are all aware of the uneven social
legislation in our various provinces. Some of
the wealthy provinces give to their citizens
many advantages which are not available to
those dwelling in the poorer provinces. I have
personal knowledge of this, for there are no
mothers' allowances in New Brunswick, and I
have in mind the case of a worthy and most
industrious young mother who, through the
tragie death of her husband, was left with six
children to provide for. Had it not been for
the intervention of friends she would have
had to send those children to an orphanage.
Thanks to that friendly help, she is bringing
up her family to be worthy citizens of the
province. Such a mother is a credit to our
country.
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators,
T rise simply for the purpose of calling attention to a statement which may be liable to
misrepresentation, but which, I assume, was
not so intended. I listened with a good deal
of interest to the excellent address d'elivered
by the honourable senator from Queen's (Hon.
Mr. Sinclair). In the absence of the leader on
this side (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) I would call
the attention of the House to the fact that
he did not oppose the appointment of this
proposed committee, nor had he any intention
of doing so. The only difference between the
two leaders, as I understand it, concerned the
scope of the inquiry to be undertaken. I hope
the honourable gentleman from Queen's did
not intend to convey the impression I got from
his remarks. Certainly the leader on this side
did not oppose the suggestion for the appointment of a committee to go into whatever
matters may be referred to it according to
the terms of the motion. As I have said, the
only question between the two leaders was as
to the advisability of the scope which the proposed inquiry might take. No one on this side
is opposing the motion, and I may say that
personally I favour it.
Hon. Mrs. WILSON

Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable senators,
I have listened to the entire debate with a good
deal of interest, and I congratulate those who
have taken part on the suggestions they have
made. I am sure these will ba useful to the
committee. I may say frankly that I have
hesitated to take any part in the debate myself, chiefly because I am not familiar with
what is actually taking place by way of inquiry. I am fully aware that all sorts of
inquiries are being held. That is very desirable. Further, it is highly desirable that this
House should. take part in them. I am sure my
honourable friend from Queen's (Hon. Mr.
Sinclair) did not intend to represent that the
leader on this side was opposed to inquiry.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I may explain, since
two honourable members have referred to it,
that what I said was that he took a negative
position.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Oh, no, not at all.
There is plenty of room for a difference of
opinion as to the nature and scope of the
inquiry, but that is an entirely different thing
from a difference of opinion on the necessity
for an inquiry itself. Speaking off-hand, I
would say that if I had in my own hands the
decision as to the nature of the inquiry to be
held, I doubt very much whether I would
pursue the course that is now being followed.
I am not certain; I simply say that I doubt
it. Owing to the scope of the inquiry, its
vastness and intricacy, I am inclined to believe
that in both Houses of Parliament there will
be great difficulty in reaching the decision or
decisions that are necessary during this session
of Parliament. We all know what occurs in
Our committees, particularly the large ones.
We know how much time is, in a sense,
wasted on repetition and that sort of thing;
and if we think there is any necessity for
haste, I should be inclined to believe it would
be better to have some of these inquiries, at
least, made in another quarter.
I do not object to the proposal at all. I
say I have hesitated to take part in the
debato for lack of concrete, definite knowledge
as to where, up to the present time, inquiries
have led us, and I now rise merely for the
purpose of giving one or two thoughts to the
committee.
Let me say that at the close of the last war
I was close to a situation somewhat similar
to, though less extensive than, the present one.
I played a part in the aftermath of that war,
and I have at least some idea of the difficulties and the problems disclosed during that
period. The idea I want to leave with the
House, and with the leader of the House, in
the hope that he will convey it to the Govern-

95

MARCH 5, 1943
ment and to the country, is that there should
be not one moment of delay in making
decisions with refei-ence to certain things that
will come upon us overnight. Let me give
you a picture. In the year 1918 I went to
Europe with other members of the Government. In the early part of July of that year
there was not the slightest view in the mind
of anybody whom I met in high political and
military circles in Great Britain that the war
would end that year. I can go further and
say that I attended a very important gathering
of sixty or seventy outstanding men whose
sole topic of discussion for two or three hours
was how to get our troops out of France.
That was the position in late June of 1918.
The Allied nations at that time had decided
jointly and unanimously that they would try
to end the war in 1919. It ended in November
of 1918. I must say very frankly that so far
as the Government of Canada of that day
were concerned they had not prepared properly or efficiently for what was to take place
when the war did end. They should not be
blamed for that. The situation was a new one.
They did not realize what was going to occur,
and it came upon them like a cloudburstand I was in that cloudburst and know something of what happened. What I would
suggest to this House and to the Government
of this country is that they lose not one single
minute in having their plans prepared concretely and definitely so that we may act when
the time comes. We must not presume that
the war is going to continue for two, three,
four or five years. Look at the picture given
us by the honourable member from Fort
William (Hon. Mr. Paterson): in a day, some
thousands of people in that city will be
turned out of their jobs, and hundreds of
thousands throughout Canada will walk to
their homes and remain there. What has been
definitely decided upon by Canada in order
to deal with that enormous situation when it
arises, as it will some day?
I say that while all the various matters discussed are very important, there are two or
three major problems that will stare us in
the face, and we must be prepared to deal
with them at once. Is there a member of this
House who does not agree with me?
My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Sinclair)
tells us that the president of the Bank of Nova
Scotia says so and so, that the president of the
Toronto General Trusts Corporation says so
and so, and that certain college professors and
others say so and so. That is all very well.
Discussions of all kinds are going on in this
country from ocean to ocean, but that will not
get us anywhere until the discussions are
studied and finally put into concrete form to be
submitted to Parliament and made into law.

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I agree entirely with
the idea contained in the remarks of the
honourable member from Queen's (Hon. Mr.
Sinclair) on the question of social security
and health insurance. I think that a committee of our Chamber, instead of going through
the mass of evidence that had to be examined
by the Beveridge Committee, could very well
take their report, study it clause by clause,
and decide to what extent the plan there proposed could be adopted in Canada. Instead
of conducting an investigation such as that
committee carried out, extending over a period
of eighteen months, let us take their findings
and recommendations and consider to what
extent they would be applicable to Canada.
And now I must not delay the House. The
committee will be formed, and I have not the
slightest doubt that all the members, regardless of which side of the House they sit on,
will be willing to do their full share towards
securing the best results they can from the
work of the committee.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hrear.

Hon. J. W. de B. FARRIS: Honourable
senators, I would not think of addressing this
House at this stage merely for the purpose of
advocating the passage of this resolution, because I am quite sure that it has been assented
to unanimously in the minds of honourable
senators. But there are to my mind two
aspects of this question in regard to which
debate is useful. First, the discussion so far
bas given an indication of the views of various
honourable members as to what the function
of the Senate really is; and secondly, a discussion of this kind by the Senate as a whole
will be of great benefit to the committee when
it is formed, and particularly in the inception
of its activities.
May I say a word about this question of
the functions of the Senate as the discussion
has developed it in relation to the problem
with which we are now dealing? The honourable senator from Montarville (Hon. C. P.
Beaubien) is not here to-day, but he suggested
yesterday that perhaps we were getting direction from the Government, and that perhaps
other directions or lines of activity should
have been indicated to us by the Government.
He mentioned agriculture. I think the Senate
ought to take it to heart that we are the
masters of our own destiny and are not dependent on this or any other Government as to
what the activities of this body should be.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I do not think that
quite concludes what is to be said on that
point. There are in my judgment certain

96

SENATE

things the Government might do to facilitate
the activities of the Senate, and it is my
regret that from time to time they have not
been done. We all recognize, particularly in
these times, that there is not much use in advancing legislation unless it is Government
legislation. And in my own mind I have no
doubt that time could be saved and the
services of the Senate used to great advantage
if some Government measures were introduced
in this House.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: While in the main the
business of the country should be introduced
in the other House, some of it could be introduced here. We all know the unfortunate
situation that develops towards the end of the
session, when long awaited bills reach us from
the Commons and it is not feasible for us to
give them the consideration that we otherwise
should. Of course, we must recognize some of
the difficulties in the way of introduction of
Government measures in this House. It is
natural that each Minister should desire to
father his own legislation. That is certainly
one important reason why more bills are not
brought down first in the Senate. I would suggest as one remedy the appointment of
another Cabinet Minister to membership in
the Senate, in addition to the honourable
leader. We are all satisfied to a high degree
with the efficient services of the honourable
gentleman who leads the House (Hon. Mr.
King), and I think it should be said that in
all fairness he should receive adequate remuneration for the time and effort he bas to
devote to the work of his office.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: But I think that in
addition there might be in this House another
Cabinet Minister.
Hon. Mr. BLACK:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: The legislative measures
of that additional Cabinet Minister would be
first introduced in this flouse.
It is suggested that the Senate is not a
democratic body. I wonder, honourable senators, how many honourable members of this
Chamber or of another place could give an offhand definition of democracy. Sometimes it is
thought to be rule by the majority. That is
not my conception of democracy. I believe
that majority rule is a necessary expedient in
a democratic system, but the Fathers of
Confederation recognized that democracy did
not consist of that alone. I think they recognized, as we do to-day-though we sometimes
hesitate to say so, because the statement is a
Hon. Mr. FARRIS.

little hackneyed-that Lincoln gave the true
definition of democracy: government of the
people, by the people and for the people. That
does not mean government of the majority, by
the majority and for the majority. Majority
rule is the nearest practical expedient obtainable, but the Fathers of Confederation saw fit
to qualify that by saying-and they had the
example of the Old Country to guide themthat along with a Chamber controlled by the
majority there should be as part of the parliamentary system a Chamber not subject to that
control. It was felt that sometimes an appointed body such as this could give expression to
the thoughts of the people perhaps more accurately and frankly than a purely elected body
could.
In these days we have a number of boards
whose chairmen and members exercise a very
wide and powerful contrai over most of our
economic activities. I am not criticizing at
all; on the contrary, I am approving, for I
feel that these boards are necessary for war
purposes. But it is idle to say now, of all
times, that a body such as this, composed of
women and men who for long years before
their entrance into this House were associated
with the public life of the country, is not fully
representative of at least a large thinking
portion of the people.
There is another aspect to be considered,
honourable senators, the aspect of what this
discussion means and what the activities of the
committee will mean when it is appointed. I
was greatly impressed by the brief but forceful remarks of the honourable senator from
Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder). There is no
doubt that urgency exists in the present situation. I do not think he meant we should assume the war will not last two or three years
longer. The honourable gentleman would agree
with me that so far as our preparations for
fighting are concerned, we must of course go on
with undiminished activity, with no idea but
that the war will continue.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Quite correct.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: But for other purposes,
and for the purpose of this proposed committee, a different viewpoint may be taken as
an alternative. Not long ago I was reading
Lord Riddell's Diary, and he tells us there
that in March, 1918, there were 400,000 of our
men killed or missing and another 80,000
taken prisoners within a period of fourteen
days. Yet, a few months after that, in the
fall of that year, the war terminated.
It is my idea that the work that could be
done by this committee is three-fold. Yesterday the honourable senator from Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) stated, as I followed
him, that with the committees now at work

PRIVATE BILLS
SECOND READING

Hon. A. K. HUCESSEN moved the second
reading of Bill B, an Act to incorporate Montreal Shriners' Hospital Foundation.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a Bill
to incorporate the 'Montreal Shriners' Hospital
Foundation. This hospital bas beèn carrying
on a very good work for a number of years in
caring for crippled children. In the past it bas
been very largely financed 'by the Shriners of
the United States.
This Bill is for the purpose of establishing a
corporate body, consisting of residents of
Montreal and vicinity, to collect and administer the endowment fund for the benefit of the
hospital. Frankly, honourable senators, I am not
aware of the reasons wby it should be necessary to incorporate this body by special Act,
nor am I aware of the particular reasons why
a special body is needed, separate and apart
from the hospital which is to benefit. However, I can assure you that the Bill is sponsored by responsible citizens of Montreal, and
if the House will consent to give the Bill
second reading, I shahl then move that it be
referred to tbe appropriate committee, where
the sponsors can give their explanations in
full.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I move that Bill B
be referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. KING: I have no objection to
the motion, for it bas been tbe custom for bills
of this character to be referred to the Banking
and Commerce Committee.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Honourable senators, it
bas been the customn of the Senate for many
years to refer almost all bills to the Banking
and Commerce Commîttee. I feel that other
standing committees should be given something
to do. This is definitely a private Bill; it bas
nothing whatever to do with banking or with
commerce, and I certainly think the Private
Buis Comrnittee should be given tbe privilege
of looking after this Bill, which undoubtedly
cornes under its jurisdiction.
Hon. Mr. KING: The mover has no
objection.
The amended motion was agreed to.
SECOND READING

Hon. L. MORAUD moved the second
reading of Bill C, an A'ct to incorporate
Canadian Alliance Ingurance Company.
He said: Honourable members, this Bill
passed this House last year anid wass sent to
the Commons, where it received first and

Hon. L. M. GOUIN: Honourable senators,
before we adjourn, may I caîl the attention of
the Senate to the fact ýthat to-day is the birthd'ay of one of our colleagues? On arrival in
Ottawa I had the privilege, along with many
of yeu, of offering heartiest congratulations to
the honourable senator from Grandville (Hon.
Sir Thomas Chapais), who, is eighty-five years
old to-day.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: All Canadians are justly
proud of this excellent historian who bas given
to our country an admirable series of books,
for which he lias received the reward, of the
Frenich A'ademy, the highest honour, by the
way, to which any writer in my own mother
tangue can aspire.

Quebec. These men are well prepared for and
particularly capable of studying this question
thoroughly and of handing down a judgment.
It is in the light of this documentation that
we shall best be capable of judging the new
budget where it deals with special grants and
compensations given the provinces. We must
not forget that above these compensations
there is a right which cannot be bought nor
bargained for, a right which must be saved in
its integrality.
As my honourable friend from Sorel (Hon.
Mr. David) knows, during the last twenty-five
years I have often asked that provincial
autonomy be respected, and I have denounced
the encroachments or the attempts at encroachment by the insistent advocates of a
legislative union. To-day I cannot contradict
myself. During the last war, 1914-1918, Sir
Lomer Gouin, then Prime Minister of my
province, raised a protest against such attempts at encroachment. I, as the leader of
the Opposition, gave him my modest, full and
sincere support. Sir Lomer was one of the
able statesmen who had acquired great prestige amongst the Canadian population of both
languages, and especially amongst the leaders
of the Canadian economy. Unlike bis fatherin-law, another great Canadian, Honoré
Mercier, he was a zealous partisan of our
Confederation and a great admirer of Cartier.
Whatever be the seriousness of the conflict
with which the interests of the country are
now connected, I am always against all kinds
of sabotage. I belong to a province indissolubly attached to its legislature and to the
rights and powers which the British North
America Act has conferred upon the province.
I recognize that it is in duty bound to take
care of its rights with intelligence and propriety. It must not be for one moment
ignored or forgotten that this autonomy has
been won through the exercise of the best
intelligence in our history, and in the vital
interest of our country-thanks to the penetrating, logical and energetic patriotism of
Sir Georges-Etienne Cartier, with the support
of his French-speaking colleagues; thanks also
to the fair play of the English-speaking Canadians, worthily represented among the most
illustrious and most influential of the Fathers
of Confederation. I have always opposed federal
attempts at encroachment. I have also opposed the claim of autonomy being abused, or
being put forth in a wrong way.
I have long since communicated to the
Prime Minister of my province, Quebec, my
humble opinion concerning the attitude of the
province as to its licences, and the necessity of
economy during war-time. I still appreciate
his very kind answer, although it has remained
Hon. Mr. SAUVE.

without practical results. I believe that he
had to deal with ministers or officials from
Ottawa who invoked the necessities of war. I
did not at all intend any unlawful or disrespectful interference in the business and
prerogatives of provincial government, but it
was justifiable and necessary for me to
intervene as a representative of Quebec's
supertaxed contributors.
There is a high
consideration which should not be neglected
nor rejected, namely, that of provincial rights,
with which are connected, for instance, the
revenues required by a provincial administration, including those obtainable from motor
vehicle permits or licences.
If we must loyally recognize the true necessities of war and our duty of accepting our
share of work and sacrifice, measuring our
efforts by our resources, should we not in
consequence require wise measures of government, also the best faculty of understanding
the situation of each province, each class, each
zone of production? A negative answer would
be offensive and fatal during this war and
after. If it is impossible to produce evidence
of strict and rational economy in the course
of our participation in the war, and to insure
respect for and fair protection of the rights
of the people, how will the people accept the
cost of the war and its obligations? The
advocates of rational, logical participation
require more and more the strictest economy
from the Government and the people. That
economy should avoid much restriction and
high taxation, and produce a contribution that
is better balanced and better accepted.
In at least one province vehicle owners pay
from $20 to $50 for their yearly licence. That
is the same cost as when there were no federal
restrictions upon the purchase and use of these
vehicles, nor upon the purchase of parts and
other items needed. These owners rightly claim
that the cost of a permit should be in proportion to their capacity for using the vehicle,
and to the heavy obligations that are imposed
upon them by Orders in Council and federal
restrictions.
If a Government passes such Orders in
Council, should it call upon those who buy
permits to carry the whole burden of those
Orders in Council? While admitting that in
these days of sacrifice it is quite fair to restrict
pleasure travelling and other causes of waste,
in order to bring the population back to normal
life, I do not believe that it is fair or tolerable
to expect people to pay for some items 300 per
cent more than in normal times. To pay $40
for a yearly permit and not have the right to
purchase more than 120 gallons of gas in the
year is not fair treatment. Such is the case in
the province of Quebec, and I do not believe

MARCH 24, 1943
a similar case exists in any other province
except perhaps New Brunswick. In Quebec
one cannot get a seasonal permit, that is to
say, a permit for three or six months. Formerly
a semi-annual permit could be obtained at a
proportionately lower fee; but now, although
that privilege bas been asked for, the Quebec
Government has answered that it cannot lower
the cost of permits, because its budget is too
hard hit by federal wartime requirements. I
understand this situation. Under the present
system motor vehicle owners in Quebec are
taxed more than the owners in many of the
other provinces. Is it fair? No. Where is
the cause of this unjust or unsatisfactory situation to be found? Should this situation be
attributed to the Federal Government? Underlying that question is a fact which should
interest the Senate. Has the Ottawa Government imposed restrictions affecting the
revenues of a province without the consent or
against the will of the Government of such
province? It is important to know whether
this is so, and that is the reason for my motion.
It belongs wholly to the provinces to issue
automobile permits and to impose taxes on the
sale of gasoline. Has the Federal Government
the constitutional right to restrict the use of
an automobile for which a permit of unrestricted mileage has been granted by a provincial treasurer under a provincial law?
The Federal Government will answer that
it is paying the provincial governments a
special subsidy or grant to make good their
loss of revenues occasioned by war measures.
In fact, in the budget I see a sum of $98,856,000
for "special grants and compensations to provinces." Does this item cover the case I am
now presenting? Is this sum sufficient to cover
the loss of revenues occasioned by federal
Orders in Council? Has a provincial government made representations to federal authorities to the effect that the rationing of gasoline
for certain vehicles will in justice to automobile owners compel it to lower the cost of its
permits? If such representations were made,
what was the federal answer? That answer
should be known to us and to the public.
Those are the purposes of my motion and
the reasons why I respectfully ask this Chamber to adopt it.
Hon. P. R. DU TREMBLAY: Honourable senators, the honourable gentleman from
Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Sauvé) bas referred to certain war measures taken by the Fedetal Government and has described them as encroaching on provincial autonomy. I do not think
he is right in taking this attitude. The
Federal Government, before imposing a tax
on gasoline, reached an understanding with the
various provincial governments. None of

those governments was obliged to accept the
Dominion Government proposal, which proposal, I might add, was discussed by the respective governments and in its final form was
accepted by them as fair and reasonable.
At the present time our people have a certain advantage in regard to taxes. As honourable members will recall, there was a time
when, in the city of Montreal in particular,
the taxes were very heavy, there being three
sources of taxation-Dominion, provincial and
municipal.
Moreover, it must not be forgotten that the
arrangement between the Federal and the
provincial governments is expressly limited to
the duration of the war. There was no attempt
by the Federal Government to encroach on
the rights of the provinces. I am confident
that neither the members of the Federal Government nor the members of the Senate and
the House of Commons desire in any way to
disturb provincial rights.
With respect to the increased grants to the
provinces in lieu of their losses of revenue, I
think it is obvious that those grants are
adequate in view of the surpluses which various provincial treasurers have been able to
announce when presenting their budgets. An
outstanding example is that of Ontario, which
has a surplus of more than $20,000,000.
It seems to me, honourable senators, that all
the circumstances can lead us to but one conclusion, that the measures referred to by the
honourable senator from Rigaud are measures
necessitated by the war, and neither harm the
provinces nor encroach on their rights.
Hon. L. M. GOUIN: Honourable senators,
in replying to the speech which our honourable colleague from Rigaud (Hon. Mr.
Sauvé) has delivered in support of his motion,
I desire first of all to thank him for the
tribute which he paid to the memory of Sir
Lomer Gouin.
Like the honourable gentleman from Rigaud,
I am deeply attached to provincial rights. I
believe that a respect for provincial autonomy
is absolutely essential to the welfare and
progress of this country, and it would be
regrettable if the impression were created
that the Dominion Parliament and the provincial legislatures are designed to act as if
they were foreign and even hostile powers.
The Fathers of Confederation intended that
the federal and provincial authorities should
co-operate to further the development of the
country as a whole. Particularly is it the
clear duty of the Dominion Parliament and
of every provincial legislature to co-ordinate
their efforts for the purpose of winning the
war. I know very well that frequently legislation or regulations emanating from Ottawa

1U4

SENATE

may affect provincial rights, but under present
tragie conditions the supreme duty of the
State is undoubtedly to save Canada by
winning the war. The mere fact that, for
instance, provincial revenues may be diminished because gasoline is rationed does not
in any way constitute an encroachment upon
provincial autonomy; it is an indirect consequence of wartime measures necessitated by
the vital importance of conserving gasoline.
It would be a great pity if, for instance, the
fact that a man who bas taken out a motorcar licence in the province of Quebec cannot
use his car as freely as under normal peacetime conditions should be seized upon as a
pretext to promote disunion in this country.
We all realize that what is most essential just
now is a real and sincere union of all Canadians of good will. In particular, I feel that
the moment would be ill-chosen to discuss
grievances, whether real or imaginary, when
there is such an urgent task before us as the
successful prosecution of our military operations.
For this and other reasons I do not think it
would be advisable for the Senate to accept
the suggestion of the honourable senator
from Rigaud to embark on a study of provincial rights under the British North America
Act. J believe that, first of ail, it would be
a grave error to think that the British North
America Act comprises all our Constitution.
Thank God, this country is primarily governed by the unwritten and generous principles of the British Constitution, and I wish
to affirm most solemnly that we Canadians
of French origin are just as much attached to
those fundamental principles of the British
Constitution as any Canadian of British origin.
This political system which we have inherited
from Great Britain is, I believe, sufficiently
flexible to enable us to adjust within its
framework all our minor differences. I think
that at the present time, when the Senate has
appointed a special committee to study postwar reconstruction and social security, to
organize another committee to discuss such a
delicate subject as the constitutional relations
between the Dominion and the provinces
would be a useless and unnecessary step and
would only serve to weaken our efforts and
dissipate our strength.
A few years ago what is known as the
Rowell-Sirois Commission undertook to study
the relations between the central power and
the provincial governments, and devoted
several years to the work. I had the honour
myself of preparing some legal reports for
that commission. The voluminous report it
submitted brought home to us all a realization of the difficulties which confronted the
Hon. Mr. GOUIN.

commissioners.
A careful perusal of their
conclusions should be sufficient to convince
anyone that in a country of such vast extent
as Canada, with the conflicting economie
mterests of the Maritime Provinces, the
Central Provinces, the Prairie Provinces and
British Columbia, coupled with the problems
of different races and different creeds, it is
extremely difficult to try to improve our
present constitutional machinery. I believe
very sincerely, honourable senators, that the
circumstances are not favourable to the undertaking of that gigantic task; that it is only
when God rewards the efforts of our soldiers,
sailors and airmen, and again blesses us with
peace, that this body can calmly and earnestly
undertake the task suggested by the honourable senator. Indeed, what would be left of
civilization, what would be left of freedom,
what would be left of this country if, first of
all, we did not earnestly and constantly
devote all our efforts towards the one primary
task of winning the war?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators, I
do not intend to make an extended reply to
my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Sauvé). I
think the address just delivered by the honourable senator from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr.
Gouin) is sufficient answer to the suggestion
that the Senate at this time should inquire
into matters pertaining to the relationship
between the provinces and the Dominion of
Canada. The Government has thought it
necessary at this time to devote all its efforts
to the successful prosecution of the war. It
is true that during periods of this kind the
Government must take greater authority and
make greater efforts than would be necessary
in peace-time.

My honourable friend has asked for:
-a ceopy of all representations, letters, documents and telegrams between the Federal Government and any provincial government concerning the rationing of gasoline, or any other
subject related to motor vehicles, such as the
loss of provincial revenues caused by the said
rationing, and also related to the rights of the
provinces and of the Dominion.
The matter of gasoline rationing is, I think,
pretty well understood by the publie generally.
It is not the official act of the Dominion
Government that has tied up gasoline in the
province of Quebec; the fact is that gasoline
is not to be had in large quantities, and that
most of the supply available is required for war
purposes. I do not think, in view of the
cause, the ordinary motorist in the province of
Quebec is making any great objection to the
curtailment.

the suggestions -of my bonourable friend from
Rigaud.
The Hon. The SPEAKER: Is it your

Somne Hon. SENATORS: No.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: After listening to my
bonourable friend from De Salaberry and the
bonourable the leader of tbe Senate, I think
my motion was not well understood. The
motion asks:
That an Order of tbe Senate do issue for the
production of a copy of aIl represents.tions,
letters, documents and telcgrams between the'
Federal Government and any provincial government concerning the rationing of gasoline, or
any other subjeet related to motor vehicles,
such as the Ioss of provincial revenues caused
by tbe said rationing, and also related to the
rigbts of the provinces and of tbe Dominion.
There should be no controvcrsy about that.
It must bc admitted that a protest was made
in public by many representatives of govcrnments, including Ministers, Prime Ministers
and leaders of the Opposition. During the
course of my remarks I said: "Wbat is rigbt?

LIMIT 0F CA-NADA'S POPULATION
On the Ordýers of the Day:
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators,
there is a matter which. I wish txo bring to the
attention of the Senate and the Governrent.
Au item appearing in. last evening's Citizen,
dlated from Sydney, reads as follows:
Says 40,000,000 is population limit here.
Canada is not capable of caring for a population
of more than 30,000,000 to 40,000,000 people,
Honourable T. C. Davis, Canadian Hîgh Commissioner to Australia, said in an address to. a
Rotary Club luncheon to-day.
The High -Commissioner has given bis
personal estimate. I think I have just as
much right as be bas to make an estimate,
and I think my estimate will be of as much
value as his.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Wbat would your estimate
be?
Hon. Mr. HIORNER: My estimate would
be that before Canada could maintain a full
degree of prosperity, we sbould have a population of at least 200,000,000. The province of
Saskatchewan could accommodate 40.000,000
people vcry well, Alberta another 40,000,000,
and outside of any of the provinces, you could
put another 40,000,000 in the Northwest
Territories.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Could tbey live?
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Ycs. We are wasting
mucb land. Some may say that there would
be difllculty in the drougbt season. The
trouble bas been that the people on the large
farms could not farm them properly. I know
that in the nortbern part of our country the
capable farmer on a quarter-section is tbe
one who is able to buy bonds to-day and to
live witbout support from the Government.
Along the rivers in my province, in the river
fiats, there is no end of good land wbich is
growing nothing but brushwood. Here and
there, long distances apart, there are gardens
growing water melons and sugar beets almost
as large as a man. That land is almost entirely
wasted. You could place a tremendous population there. Before man cntered that country
vast berds of 'buffalo and other animals were
running wild in those areas and were sustaining
themsclves on wbat tbey found.

on the Alaska highway. There would be
grazing there for live stock the year round,
as there is at the present time for wild cattle.
As a Canadian citizen I object to Canada
being advertised in the manner indicated by
the dispatch I have read. I hope this gentleman has been misquoted. I think it probable
that the statement he made was that in order
to progress Canada should have 30,000,000 or
40,000,000 people. The statement that that
is the limit of population that we could support is outrageous. I would place the number
at 200,000,000 at least.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
I think I know a little about the north
country. I do not like to differ with my
honourable colleague, and I am not running
down the north country, but I think he is
pretty optimistic in his estimate of 200,000,000.
It takes quite a stretch of the imagination to
visualize a population of 40,000,000 in that
country. None of us here will see it. We do
not know what the spread of civilization may
necessitate, but I should certainly think the
estimate of the Hon. Mr. Davis was moderate,
and I should not like to see any criticism of
his statement. I think it is about as accurate
a statement as could be made at the present
time.
Hon. J. H. KING: I have nothing to say
in reply to the criticism of my honourable
friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Horner). He must
realize that he is in a much happier position
than Commissioner Davis, for the honourable
senator is at liberty to make even extravagant
statements if he so desires.
As regards the High Commissioner's statement in Australia, we have only a newspaper
report. I have no knowledge of the actual
statement he made at the gathering in question.
Men occupying these positions have to make
speeches, and they try to make them informative. As we sec now, there is a difference of
opinion as to the size of population that
Canada could accommodate. That question will
work itself out after the war. The number of
people who reside in Canada will depend upon
how much crowding there will eventually be in
this world.
However, I take my honourable friend's
statement into account, and I have no doubt
the Department of External Affairs will do so.

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Honourable members there are a number of divorce bills on
the Order Paper for second reading, running
down, I think, to Order No. 42.
I would
move the second reading of these bills en bloc.
The Hon. The SPEAKER: It is moved by
Hon. Mr. Robinson, seconded by Hon. Mr.
Sinclair that Orders Nos. 1 to 42, for the
second readings of bills of divorce, be taken
en bloc.
Hon. C. E. TANNER: I think all honourable members have received about forty
reports of hearings by the Committee on
Divorce. This flood of cases reminds me of
the expectation most of us had that if the
former leader of this House-whose passing
we all very sincerely lamented-had lived,
something would have been done to remove
this incubus from the Senate. I do not know
whether my honourable friend the present
leader bas the matter in contemplation, or
whether the Committee on Divorce is considering the matter, but I want to express
the hope that something will be donc before
very long to provide that honourable members of this House shall not be called upon
to devote so much time to the washing out
of dirty linen, and that these cases shal be
taken over by the courts.
That was what
our late leader had in mind-some provision
whereby the cases would all go to a judge
or to the courts.
I know, of course, that many do not agree
with me when I say that I think the province
from which these cases now nearly all come
should open its courts to its people who
desire to apply for divorce. Not only have
the members of our Senate Committee the
Hon. Mr. KING.

labour of sitting day after day and hearing
evidence in regard to these matters, but at
times they have to take from another part
of this building very disparaging remarks.
At times they are talked about as if they
were utterly incompetent to discharge the
duty of hearing and deciding these cases. I
do not know that any of them have entered
any protest against that, but I am taking
opportunity by the hand to point out to those
fault-finders that every man on the Senate
Committee that hears and disposes of these
divorce cases is thoroughly competent for
the work-so competent that by himself ho
could try and wisely decide the cases. In my
judgment, the members of our committee are
a galaxy of judges as competent as any in
the country.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: As I said a moment
ago, I think some provision should be made
for dealing with divorce cases outside of
Parliament. I think the late Senator Dandurand had an idea that a judge should bo
appointed especially for this work. In any
event, I feel that the Senate should endeavour
to have all these cases turned over to some
court. If there is any virtue or quality in all
this talk that we hear about freedom-and I
concede that there is a lot in it-I cannot
understand how under British freedom and
British law any province can shut any body
of people out of its courts. It is up to the
Senate to say the word, because the Senate
is the branch of Parliament that is now dealing with divorce, and Parliament has exclusive
jurisdiction in regard to those cases which
come from two provinces.
From time to time I observe in Montreal
newspapers reports of cases in which the
Quebec courts are asked to have a man and
his wife separated. My observation is that
such applications come up frequently.
It
would appear to me that the people down
there, who are not permitted to go into the
courts and bluntly ask for a divorce, as are
the people in other provinces, are compelled
to invent plausible reasons, reasons that do
not appeal to me as having quality and value.
There is a doctrine called errer of person. I
do not profess to know what it means, nor to
quote any judicial decision as to what it
means; but not long ago I read the opinion
of an eminent justice of a Superior Court in
the province of Quebec, and if he was reported
correctly he certainly expressed the view that
this "error of person" was a fiction, not a
substantial reason for asking that a man and
bis wife be separated.

MARCH 25, 1943

I have read the report for this reason. If I
am right-I may be wrong-this was a case of
a marriage legally performed and in lawful
effect because the necessary dispensation had
been granted. Being a lawful marriage, it
could not, in my humble judgment, be called
a nullity; and if it was not a nullity, the
marriage could not be dissolved except by
proceedings for divorce. Where the law has
been carried out and consequently a lawful
marriage has been performed, the mere calling
of the proceeding an annulment means nothing,
to my mind. It may have been a great mistake
on the part of one of the contracting parties;
there may have been gross deception; but
once there is a lawful marriage, I submit, the
judge was in error in attempting to dissolve

of the judgment.

Commonly we sec the word "annulment."
I do not know what an annulment is. A
declaration of nullity is made when, say, a
marriage presumably took place, but in fact
it never was a marriage; that is, it was an
absolute nullity. That may be the ground on
which these decisions are frequently based in
the province of Quebec.
I am not contesting the judgments of eminent men on the Quebec bench. I am only
trying to stress a common-sense view of these
matters. My attention was really brought to
a focus this morning when I noticed in the
Montreal Gazette a report of one of these
contestations. I will read it:

110

SENATE

The honourable senator has suggested that
the Senate could declare that applications for
divorce should not corne before it. The only
thing I think the Senate, as at present constituted, could do would be to refuse to hear
such applications.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: The honourable
gentleman from Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner)
meant Parliament.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: I think it is a
matter for the parties concerned to seek to
have the jurisdiction now exercised by the
Senate transferred to the courts of the land.
I do not think the Senate of itself can do
anything of the kind.
Hon. J. J. DONNELLY: I do not rise for
the purpose of discussing the case which was
dealt with by my desk-mate (Hon. Mr.
Tanner). I wish only to refer to a statement
he made at the opening of his remarks. He
said the Senate has special charge of divorce.
I never understood this to be the position.
It seems to me that a divorce bill might just
as weIl originate in the House of Commons,
for the effect would be the same as if it were
first presented here. Very seldom do I disagree with my honourable friend, and then
only on minor points.
The question of divorce brought to my mind
that when I came back on Tuesday night I
found my post office box virtually filled with
reports of divorce evidence. I told the Clerk
of the Divorce Committee that I was not
particularly interested in such reports and
that I would prefer that he stop sending them
to me. He informed me that any senator who
made a similar request would have his name
taken off the mailing list. This would save a
considerable amount of printing and a lot of
trouble.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Honouraile members, I think the remarks of the honourable
senator from Pictou as to the position of
the Senate to-day, and the suggestion that
some effort should be made to transfer the
matter of divorce to the courts, are important
indeed. We talked a good deal about this
question last session, and considerable research lias been conducted by the Law Clerk
of the Senate, in consultation with the Department of Justice and others, with a view
to seeing if there could net be developed some
method of transferring these cases to the
courts which would meet with the satisfaction
of Parliament. We are not quite ready yet
to make a proposal to the Senate; I suppose
we hardly know whether it is a Government
matter. or who bas the right to deal with it;
but I think that shortly the Divorce ComHon. Vr. MacLENNAN.

mittee, whether it has the right or net, will
be prepared to make some suggestion. One
suggestion was that the Exchequer Court
should be given jurisdiction. Then the question arose as to whether it should be given
the power to deal with divorces from the
provinces of Quebec and Prince Edward
Island alone, or should be given jurisdiction
throughout Canada, even in provinces which
already have divorce courts. There seem to
be a good many obstacles in the way of
transferring divorces to the Exchequer Court.
I think perhaps at a later period I can go
into the subject a little further and give the
Senate the ideas which the legal authorities
have on the matter.
Another method proposed, as was suggested,
I think, by the honourable senator from
Margaree Forks (Hon. Mr. MacLennan), is
that these matters be referred to the courts
of the province of Quebec. I do not know
just what situation would arise in that event,
but it does 'seem to me that it might be
well to extend to the courts of Quebec the
same jurisdiction as bas been given to the
courts of the other provinces. I think that
would be a most reasonable way of settling
this question. However, this is a contreversial matter, and one which we have to
approach very delicately. I think myself that
something should be done. In my opinion
divorce is not a proper subject for the
Parliament of Canada to be dealing with;
it is a judicial matter, and one for the courts;
and if the committee should decide to present
a short bill, as it may after a little further
discussion, it will probably be along the line
of giving the courts of Quebec jurisdiction
to deal with divorce. There is no divorce
law now in the province of Quebec; so there
would have to be parliamentary authority
for it.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: May I inquire as to
the number of divorce petitions that come
to the Senate from provinces other than
Quebec?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: There is only one other
province from which they come, and that is
Prince Edward Island.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Divorces that come
before the committee?
-Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Once in a while
there is a case from Prince Edward Island.
There is some sort of divorce law down there.
but it is net utilized at aIl.

MARCH 25, 1943
I think, perbaps, in a day or twa wa shall ba
able ta take this mattar up again and ask the
Senate for its opinion as ta what sbould ha
done. We may have a proposai. ta lay before
yau, ta see what yau think is hast. In the
meantime I do not know that thare is anything furtber ta say.
Han. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourabie senators, I rise ta say just ane word. I arn
rather surprised and a littia annoyad, I arn
frank ta say, at the suggestion that tha courts
of Quabac sbould bceampowared ta deal witb
divorce.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: That is what I
wantad-an opinion.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I do not tbink my
honourabla friand needs my affirmation for
that. Ha knows vary weli that for very many
years the question bas been discussed, and
hae must know that the opinion of tha immense mai arity of people in tha province of
Quehec lias heen vary clearly demonstratad
as being opposed ta such a measura. I do
not want ta go inta the manits of that. I
undarstand perfectly wail the advantagas
thare would ha from a judiciai point of view;
I understand also the graat advantaga thera
would ha in ridding the Senata of the work;
but suraly the Sanate, wbosa spacial function
undar tbe Constitution is ta dafand the rights
of minoritias, would not imposa sucb lagisiation upon the province of Quabac.
My honourahia friand knows vary weil wby
the province of Quahac is opposed ta this. It
is opposad ta it hecause tha Catholie Cburch
is opposad ta divorce. But tba Catholie
Cburcb is not alana in this; the Higb Church
of England also is firmly and fundamantaily
opposed ta divorce. Howevar, I do flot naad
ta discuss that. That is a matter of conscience. Thera certainly wauid ha tremandous
resistanca ta any sucb eiffart, and I trust the
Senata will respect the views of the people of
Quahec, as it bas done sinca Confederation.
I undarstood that the leader of the House who
precedad my honourable friand opposite (Hon.
Mr. King) had a project wbich would ha agreeable ta everyhody. It was the intention, I
undarstand, ta transfer ail thasa cases, at al
avants for the taking of evidance, ta the
Exebequer Court, and ta hava that court
make a repart ta the Senate, wbich practically,
I suppose, would andorse it. The question of
juriadiction would nat stand in the way; yet
the Senate would ha fread, s0 ta speak, from
a work which is not very congenial. I bava

I would not have risen had it not bean that
the suggestion of the Chairman of the Committee on Divorce alarmed me, and will considerahly aiarm the province of Quebec. I
arn expressing the hope that the procedure he
refers ta wiil not ha foliowed. As to the rest,
I do not know that I naad ta discuss it.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Would my bonourable friend touch on ana point wbile hie is on
lis feet, namely, the numarous marriage annulments which Judge Forest bas deait witb?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I was coming ta
that. I arn not going ta discuss the different
judgments that have been randered in my
province. There was ane judge, for instance,
wbo for a great many years always rendared
judgments cancelling marriages that had been
ceiebratad hctween a Catholia and a Protestant and before a Protestant ministar. That
situation waS regarded with soma astonisbment
outside the province. But it bas heen raversed.
Witbin the iast year or two, a case of that
kind was submitted first ta the Superior
Court, and then ta the Court of Appeal, and
the jurisprudence bas been compiately reversed. That is sattied; sa I do not need ta
bother with it.
As ta the annuiments, my honourable friend
is quite rigbt. You do flot annul a marriaga;
you may declare it neyer ta have existed. In
my province a marriage is bath a contract and
a sacrament. If it were not a sacrament 1
would flot he discussing wbat I arn discussing
naw. Our law says tbat the formalities of
religion must be followed in a certain mannar, otherwisa thare is na contract. One of
the tanets of my cburch is that a Christian
cannot ha married ta a non-Christian, and if
a ceremony has taken place batween such persans, the judge wha takas up tbe record bas
ta decide upon it. Furtber, a minor cannat
consent to a contract of marriage any more
than hae can, ta any other*contract. Ha must
he assisted, by bis parants. That is a question
of iaw. Surely tbe province of Quabec bas
its awn jurisdiction and can maka its own laws.
If 'yau contest that proposition, I have
notbing ta say: if you admit it, I bave littie
ta say othar than that I understand the judge
in this case followed the iaw.
Now I came ta a third point, that of asking
the Minister of Justice ta sit, so ta speak, as
a final court of appeai on a judgmant. That
would ha the moist extraordinary procedure
I bave evar heard of. Suraly that could not
ha permittad, either as a lagai and, canstitutional process or as a reasonable one. If such
wara the situation, anyhad.y anywbara in the
country could taka a judgmant ta the Mirnster

SENATE
of Justice and say: "I want you to bring this
judge to reason. The basis of my request is
this judgment." Is it possible that the Minister of Justice would pass on every judgment
brought to him from any part of the country,
for one reason or another? There are other
courts of appeal, and it is in those courts that
the judgments rendered in my province, on
this as on any other matter, are subject to
revision.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Will my honourable
friend tell me whether it is not a fact that
every one of these judgments by Judge Forest
on which an appeal was taken has been
reversed?

Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: So far as that is
concerned, I do net need to give an answer
to my honourable friend. Quebec is the only
province whose courts have not divorce
jurisdiction. Why is it that we did net give
this jurisdiction to Quebec when we gave it
te other provinces? Because the situation in
Quebec was different from that existing
anywhere else.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:

Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Well, that has
nothing to do with the question we are
discussing.

Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: I believe that
Judge Forest was the only one-I may be
wrong; there may have been another judge as
well-I believe lie was the only one who
established that jurisprudence.

Hon. Mr. HORNER:
May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question?
What
about the rights of the minority in the province
of Quebec? The people of the minority are
being put te extra expense.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
right.

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: That is the pointthe unfairness to the minority.

I think you are

Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Unfortunately, on
that account, a great many cases of the same
kind were brought to him. Finally an appeal
was taken and the jurisprudence was completely reversed, and now the former reason
for annulment has disappeared completely.
However, my purpose in rising was net te
deal with this. I rose because of the suggestion of the honourable Chairman of the
Committee on Divorce (Hon. Mr. Robinson),
as I wish te express the sincere hope that the
Senate will net impose upon the great majority
of the people of my province any legislation
that is contrary te their religious tenets. -In
saying that, I speak net only for Catholics.
I know I speak also for a great mass of the
Protestants of my province.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: May I ask my honourable friend a questidn?
Hon. C. P. BEATBIEN: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: What is the difference
in principle between the giving by Parliament
of jurisdiction over Quebec's divorce cases te
the Exchequer Court and the giving of that
jurisdiction to a court in the province of
Quebec?
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Well, off-hand, I
would point out that the Exchequer Court is
of course a federal tribunal, created by the
Dominion.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: In either case it would
be a court upon which the jurisdiction was
conferred by Parliament, and te that extent
a court functioning under the direction of
Parliament.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN.

Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Of course, if we
are going to take the stand that in legislating
for the province of Quebec we should be
guided by the desires of a very small
minorityHon. Mr. HORNER:
The smaller the
minority, the greater the right to protection.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: I do net think you
can say we take away the right to protection.
Evidence has been given by my honourable
friend from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock)
that the people of my province who wish
divorce have a remedy here. That remedy is
net as easy to use, I am ready to admit, as if
it were available in the province, for people
from Quebec have to come here instead of
applying to their own judges. But the remedy
is not taken away. I do not know whether I
should speak as I am speaking now, if it were
taken away; I think that perhaps I should net.
But I am not discussing that. My point is that
the Senate should have regard to the policy
that was established at Confederation and has
been maintained ever since. We must remernber that the reason which existed for the law
being as it iwas then, exists to-day. I trust
the decision of the Senate will be what it was
before: a decision which respects and does net
violate the religion of the majority of my
province.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Honourable senators, Quebec and Prince Edward Island are the
only provinces in Canada which have not their
own divorce courts, but these two provinces
are net in quite the sarne position. In Prince
Edward Island we have the power to establish

MARCH 25, 1943
divorce courts, 'but we have neyer used it,
whereas the province of Quebec, as I understand it, bas flot this power.
If divorce courts were set up in the province
of Quebec and the law in. other respects remained as it now is, any applicant in that
province would stili have the option of petitioning Parliament, instead of the courts, for
a divorce. I should like to ask my honourable
friend a question. Does hie think that if a
divorce court were established in Quebec the
judge would look at the evidence at ai, or
would hie consider each case from the poin.t of
view of religion? Would the evidence have
any weight at ail?
Hlon, C. P. BEAUBIEN: Is that question
put to me?
HRon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Yes.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: I would not attempt to
answer that.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: The only answer
I can make to my honourable friend is that the
jndge would. of course have to render his
decision on the evidence. That is obvions. My
hope is tbat jurisdiction will flot be given to
Quehec courts, so that our judges will flot
have to look at the records in such cases. But
if jurisdiction were given, then any judge
before whom a case was properly bronght
would have to go into the evidence and give
judgment accordingly.
-Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Il a person in
Quebec who wants a divorce prefers to apply
to the courts, hie can move to one of the other
provinces and, after establishing a domicile,
apply to the courts there. That course is open
to those who can avaýil themselves of it. To
my mmnd, the denial of divorce to people wh.o
are entitled to it resuits in a great deal of
imýmorality. It precludes the parties from
establishing homes, and in the end it leads to
a bad, mess.
Hon. Mr. KING: Hononrable senators, I
arn not sure that this discussion is in order. I
think my honourable friend from Pictou (Hon.
Mr. Tanner) referred to a newspaper article
in relation to a case that came before the
courts in Montreal. I submit, Mr. Spea)ker,
that a reference of -that kind is not a proper
subject of discussion, and I do not intend to
continue this one. Frankly, I thinýk it is out
of order.

COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PRINCE
EDWARD ISLAND AND MAINLAND

115

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. J. P. McINTYRE:
Honourable
senators, before the Orders of the Day are
proceedýed with. I should like to bring ta the
attention of the Senate a matter wbich I
consider of great importance. While I
realize that honourable senators should take
a Dominion-widýe view of matters that corne
before this House. nevertheless we are appointed to represent the different provineres
of this Dominion, and, such being the case.
we individually are supposed ta bring hefore
this honourable body matters that affect the
province which we have the honour ta

since, although in the last two winters she bas
carried on under difficulties. This winter
particularly she bad two breakdowns; wbicb is
not surprising for a vesse] 29 years old. On
one occasion something went wrong with the
propeller, and sbe was hung up for tbree or
four days for repairs. A few weeks later
something went wrong witb the rudder or
some other part of ber steering apparatus, and
she was hung up again. You cannot expeet
a boat that is pounding througb the stiff ice
of the Northumberland Straits to last for
ever, and I wnnt to bring to the attention of
honourable senators the necessity of action
being taken at the earliest possible moment
to suppîy a new boat, for tbe benefit not
only of Prince Edward Island but of Canada,
because a new boat would be of great belp

represent.

in our war effort.

I have in mind the transportation iiro.hlem
affecting Prince Edward Island. Perhaps it
has been brougbt up in this Chamber at
different tîmes; I have no reason ta belie%,e
otherwise. Hlowever. being a new senalor. 1
arn not aware of that. This is a matter of
prime importance, in fact of nat;inal importance, because that province, isolated from
the rest of the Dominion, will be faicing a
serions situation if something is flot done in
the very near future.
We have the S.S. Prince Edward Island
plyîng between Borden and Cape Tormentine,
as it has been doing for the lest twenty-nine
years. That boat was built in 1914. and has
given wonderful service. She is suhject to
severe strain, especially in the winter-time,
when she has to pound through heaNvy wie floe8.
and it has often taken ber two or three days
ta make the crossing. After she had heen a
good many years on that route the people of
the province began to think she was getting
past her usefulness. and an agitation %vas
started for the building of a new boat. That
agitation was kept up for two or three years,
until at last the Coveriýment realized that a
new boat was needed. Plans and specifications were drawn by Government engineers,
and construction of the new vessel was begun
in the province of Quebec, I think et Lévis,
and completed in 1931. While that ship was
on ber way to Saint John to go into drydock
to be overhauled, almost two years ago, she
kept too close to the coast of Nova Scotia,
ber bottomn was ripped and she sank in, I
think, one hundred feet of water.
That was a very unfortunate affair for the
province of Prince Edward Island. The old
boat, which, as I have already stated, we
thought had corne near to the end of ber
usefulness, had to he pressed into service
immediately. She has heen doing good work

For the information of bonourable senators
I should like to place before the House a
statement of the amount of traffie handled by
the S.S. Prince Edward Island in the past
yeer. In 1942 she made 3,866 crossings, an
average of ten a day. In that time she carried
10,283 ]oaded freight cars from Borden to
Tormentine, and 11.997 loaded freight cars
from Tormentine to Borden. That will give
you some idea of the heavy traffic between
these two points. The number of empty cars
transferred from Borden to Tormentine was
6,823, and from Tormentine to Borden 5,191.
In the same twelve months she ferried 64,019
passengers from Borden to Tormentine, and
62,693 from Tormentine to Borden.
The increase in traffic in the Iast three years
is shown by the oumber of cars, of ail kinds,
ferried in 1939 and in 1942. These include
fieight cars, empty cars, refrigerator cars,
mail cars, Pullman cars and passenger cars.
In 1939 the total was 30,431 cars, and in 1942,
it was up to 37,520, an increase of more than
7,000 cars. Honourable members should keep
in mind that the boat which is handling this
increased traffie is. as I bave a]ready saidý, 29
years old.
I bave already said that Prince Edward
Island is isolated from the rest of the
Dominion. We came in under Confedera-tion,
as you know, six years later than did tbe
otber two maritime provinces. Honourable
members are aware that the Maritime Provin-ces were going to form a union of their own
in 1864. You remember what happened. Sir~
John Macdonald and a few others resolved
themselves into a delegation from. wbat were
then known, as Upper Canada and Lower
Canada and proceeded to the Maritimes.
These delegates were aware of the adverse
conditions under wbich they would meet; they
knew tbat the Maritimes had established a

DISCUSSION

116

SENATE

satisfactory trade between themselves and their
nearest neighbours, who were then known, as
they are to-day, as the New England States.
To offset this the delegates offered the Maritime Provinces inducements to join the larger
union. Some of these inducements were that
lumber, fish, coal and agricultural products of
the Maritimes would find ready markets in
Toronto and Montreal, and a promise was made
that the Intercolonial Railway would be built
for the exclusive benefit of the people of the
Maritimes.
As we now know, after Nova Scotia and
New Brunswick had joined Confederation,
the Intercolonial Railway was built, but it
was not operated exclusively for the benefit
of the Maritime Provinces, because the
freight and passenger rates on that line were
just as high as on any railway in Canada.
The products of Nova Scotia andi New Brunswick, coal, fish, lumber and farm produce, did
not find a ready market in Toronto or Montreal, and the New England markets were lost.
However, there was nothing that the Maritime people could do about it, for they had
joined the union.
Prince Ediward Island refrained from joining the union at that time, in the hope of
getting better terms from the Dominion. She
held out for six years longer, and did not
come into Confederation until 1873. In that
year Mr. Pope, who was Premier, proceeded
with a delegation to Ottawa and asked for
better terms. According to the proposals of
1864 or 1867, the debt allowance was divided
into the population of the Dominion, and it
figured out at $45 per capita; but in 1873,
when Mr. Pope and his delegates came to
Ottawa, an increase from $45 to $50 in the
allowance was offered to Prince Edward
Island because of the province's isolated
position. We joined Confederation that year.
The British Order in Council of June 26,
1873, by which Prince Edward Island was
admitted into Confederation, contained the
following provision:
Efficient steam service for the conveyance of
mails and passengers to be established and
maintained between the Island and the mainland
of the Dominion, winter and summer, thus
placing the Island in continuous communication
with the Intercolonial Railway and the railway
system of the Dominion.
Some time prior to 1916 our transportation
service was operated by the Charlottetown
Steam Navigation Company, with two steamers
in the open season, one plying between
Summerside, Prince Edward Island, and Pointe
du Chêne, New Brunswick, and the other
between Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island,
and Pictou, Nova Scotia. In the winter months
Hon. Mr. McINTYRE.

the Department of Marine operated icebreakers between Georgetown, Prince Edward
Island, and Pictou, Nova Scotia. In winter,
when ice conditions became too bad for the
boats to get through, mail was carried from
Tormentine, New Brunswick, to Cape Traverse,
Prince Edward Island, by small boats hauled
over the ice. When you came to the water
you got into the boat.
The Dominion of Canada as a whole bas
made a remarkable war effort, towards which
Prince Edward Island, an agricultural province,
has contributed its full share. In the last
three years Canada has shipped to Great
Britain 1,350 million pounds of bacon and
pork products, 300 million pounds of cheese
and 70 million dozens of eggs, and Prince
Edward Island bas produced a fair proportion
of these huge totals. Canada has to-day more
than 600,000 men in the three armed forces, the
Army, the Navy and the Air Force, and in
this contribution Prince Edward Island bas
done more than its share.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McINTYRE: Our province, with
a population of about 93,000, has made the
largest per capita contribution of all the
provinces to the armed forces. And in all the
financial campaigns-on behalf of Victory
Loans, Red Cross, and so on-the people of
Prince Edward Island have gone over the top.
When last year the scrap campaign was started,
we in Prince Edward Island gathered thousands
of tons of scrap, sold it, and gave the proceeds
to the Red Cross.
Prince Edward Island has another complaint
We have a
in regard to transportation.
subsidiary ferry service, known as the Northumberland ferry, which runs between Wood
Island, Prince Edward Island, and Caribou,
Nova Scotia. The Dominion Government, at
considerable cost, built piers at the terminal
points. A private corporation, known as
Northumberland Ferries, was organized to
carry on the service. Its first and second boats
were requisitioned by the Government. The
company had to purchase a third boat, and
bas been using that to carry on the service as
best it can under very difficult conditions. In
1940 the Hochelaga carried 3,815 passengers;
in 1942 the new service carried 34,933 passengers. Now let me give comparative figures in
regard to the auto and truck movement. In
1940 the Hochelaga carried 576 autos and
trucks; in 1942 the new service carried 8,133,
or an increase of 1400 per cent. These are the
freight figures: in 1940 the Hochelaga carried
830 tons; in 1942 the new service carried 8,000
tons, or an increase of 1000 per cent. Although
the Northumberland Ferries carried so much

MARCH 30, 1943
more traffie last year, they received a subsidy
of only $28,000, as against a subsidy of $30,000
paid to the other ferry service in 1940.
Those who organized the ferry company
went into it more or less ini the dark, for they
did flot know what they were up against, but
they undertook the risk in order to provide
what we consider to be a valuable ferry service
betwecn the Island and the mainland. In 1941,
when the company started aperations, it just
broke even; there was no money available for
dividends for those who had. put their capital
mnto the company. In 1941 the ferry service
which the Canadian National Railways aperates between Cape Tormentine and Borden
showed a deficît of $424,000. In 1942 the
Northumberland Ferries closed the year with
a deficit of $7,000. In that same year the
Canadian National Railways showed a deficit
of $591,000 on its ferry service. That deficit
was taken care of by the Government, but
similar assistance was flot extended to the
Northumberland Ferries. The ferry company
is up against a difficuit proposition in starting
operations this year, liecause it was in the red
last year, as 1 have stated, ta the tune of
$7,000, and it expects that this year's operations will show a further deficit. Provided it
runs at ail, I think the Northumberland
Ferry Company, whicli maintains this ferry
service, should be granted an additional subsidy, and I would recomrnend that the Minister
of Trade and Commerce, who, I know, is fully
acquainted with the subjeot-matter, take this
inta favourable consideration, so that we may
not lose this service.
As I have mentioned, the boat on the
Borden-Tormentine service is very old. In
1929 and 1930 we thought she was getting
beyond ber period of uscfulness, but to-day,
when she is twelve yeaTs older, we regard lier
as the weak link ini the chain. I would urge
on the Dominion Government that it sliould
now take steps to have a new ferry boat ready
at the earliest possible time. I know the
Dominion Governinent lias a great responsibulity in these trying times and lias ta liorrow
large sums of money ta meet aur very heavy
war expenditure, but I submit it would be a
national disaster if anything sliould liappen ta
that aid boat, whicli, as I have said, is the
weak link in the connection we have between
the rnainland and the Island. A new ferry
boat would cost between two and tliree million
dollars, and it would take considerable time
to prepare the necessary plans and specifications. If construction is put off until the war
ends, this may mean a delay of two or three
years more, and if no preparations are made
in the meantime, tliere will lie further delay

117

involved in letting the contract for the new
boat. By that time, I arn afraid, aur present
weak link would lie broken and we sliould
have no communication with the mainland;
which would lie disastrous.
The people of Prince Edward Island are
eager ta do their utmost ta further the war
effort. Wlien the Minister of Agriculture asked
for an increase in f arrn production of 25 per
cent, aur people arranged for extra fertilizer
and last year tliey succecded in increasing
their production ta that extent. If, unfortunately, anythîng sliould happen ta that weak
link in aur communication with the mainland,
a link whicli is naw almost worn through, the
war effort of aur people on the Island would
be very seriously affected. In short, it would
lie a national calamity.
I do not know, lionourable senators, whether
I arn out of order. I arn anly a new member.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Go ahead. You are
doing ail right.
Hon. Mr. McINTYRE: I dîd not wish ta
trespass an the time of honourable senators,
but I wanted ta put those matters before you,
sa yau would have a fair understanding of
the prohlem confronting us i Prince Edward
Island.
As I have said, the Island lias done its
utmost ta further the war effort. This is the
fourtli year of the war, and, as you know,
Germany lias conqucred and naw holds in
bandage Czcchoslovakia, Poland, Dcnmnark,
the Netherlands, Bclgium, France, Greece and
Jugoslavia, and Japan lias overrun the
Philippines, Malaya, tlie Dutcli East Indies,
and Burma. We should suifer the same fate
if unfortunately aur war effort failed. For
the first time in aur history the Northi
American continent lias heen threatened witli
invasion. The icy waters of the North are
no insuperable barrier ta conquest. Modemn
war equipment lias almost annihilated space
and destroyed time. Remoteness in distance
is no protection; "overseas" lias almost lost
its meaning. There can lie no protection for
us until aur enemy is conquered. It does
not make any difference whethcr this war is
fouglit on the sands of Egypt, the steppes of
Russia or the depths of China, whether an
the islands of the Pacific or in the waters of
the Aretie, whether in the skies over Britain
or Germany or the conquered countries of
Europe. I repeat, there can be no security
for aurselves, aur wives and families until
the enemny is crushed and defeated. Theref ore, honourable senators, let us ail be united,
let there be n differences of opinion, no
sectional prejudices., Let us all go forward,
feeling that ini aur hands lies the welfare of

118

SENATE

the people of this great Dominion. It would
be a grievous calamity if we allowed sectional
or other differences to prevent our carrying
out the vital purpose of obtaining for our
children and our children's children a reasonable assurance of freedom from fear and
freedom from want.
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators, I
should like to compliment the new senator
from Prince Edward Island (Hon. Mr.
McIntyre) on his address. No doubt the people
of Prince Edward Island are at the present
time experiencing great hardships owing to the
loss of the ferry Charlottetown, as this loss has
very seriously disturbed the ferry service between the Island and the mainland of New
Brunswick. The Minister not long ago declared
in the House of Commons that the matter was
being given careful attention, and that architects were already preparing plans in the hope
that a new ship would be built. I think we all
realize that to-day it is very difficult to get
that type of ferry constructed in our Canadian
yards, which are now engaged in the building
of naval and other war craft. However, we are
indebted to the honourable member for his
excellent address.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable senators,
I merely wislh to congratulate the honourable
gentleman from Prince Edward Island on the
way in which be has dealt with a very
mnteresting subject. I am sure that if he had
placed a formal notice on the Order Paper be
would have 'received a good deal of support
from all sections of the House when he introduced the question.
Hon. Mr. MeINTYRE: I want to inform
the honourable member opposite that, being
a new member, I just followed the procedure
adopted by the honourable member from
Victoria-Carleton (Hon. Mr. Smith) and the
bonourable member from Lethbridge (Hon.
Mr. Buchanan) when they spoke on the abolition of the Senate.
Hon.
better.

Mr. QUINN:

They

should

know

The Hon. the SPEAKER:
My embarrassment, on the point of order, is as great
as that of the honourable gentleman from
Prince Edward Island, for, like him, I also
am a new member. The rules in the Senate
are not as strictly observed or applied, as in
the House of Commons. Nevertheless, as I
understand- the rules of the Senate, questions
can be put to the Minister and matters of
immediate and urgent importance can be discussed before the Orders of the Day are
called; but, as the honourable senator from
Hon. Mr. McINTYRE.

Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder) has just pointed
out, when it is proposed to discuss a question
at some length it would seem preferable to
put a formal notice on the Order Paper, so as
to bring the subject to the attention of
honourable senators and allow those interested
to take part in the debate. I understand that
in this Chamber it is the practice to allow
considerable latitude in the application of the
rules, and I assumed that the honourable
gentleman had the unanimous consent of the
Senate to proceed; but I would suggest, bonourable senators, that, so as to ensure that
the debate may proceed in a more orderly
manner, it would be advisable to adhere more
closely to the rules before the Orders of the
Day are called.
Furthermore, on routine proceedings, it is
out of order to move the first or the second
reading of a private bill before the report
thereon has been considered and concurred in.
APPROPRIATION

BILL No. 1

SECOND READING

Hon J. H. KING moved the second reading
of Bill 9, an Act for granting to His Majesty
certain sums of money for the public service
of the financial year ending the 31st March,
1944.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a Bill
which usually comes to us from the House of
Commons at this season of the year. The
estimates for the coming year not yet having
passed through that House, the Government is
compelled to bring down what is known as
an interim supply bill, and to ask Parliament
to vote, from the larger appropriation which
will be made later, a sum of money to be
made available for the publie business during
the next one or two months. To-morrow is
the end of the financial year 1942-43. This
Bill, which is essential, received the approval
of the House of Commons last week.
The Bill follows the usual form. It will be
noted that interim supply is being asked to an
amount of $40,000,000. This is to take care
of ordinary expenditures throughout the Dominion. The Supply Bill for the coming year
will call for $610,880,000, of which amount
some $400,000,000 are fixed charges, statutory
in character and not under the control of the
executive. This leaves some $200,000,000 odd
within the control of the executive, and of this
it is asking one-sixth.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Would
sixth of what is to be voted?

this be

one-

Hon. Mr. KING: Yes, one-sixth.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: It does not include the
statutory expenditures?

MARCH 30, 1943
Hon. Mr. KING: No. Statutory amounts
are included in the estimates, but they are not
included in the Supply Bill. This is one-sixth
of the total to be voted. Last year, I think,
we voted one-twelfth of the total, but, as at
Easter, which comes so late this year, Parliament will probably have a recess, the House of
Commons has voted one-sixth or enough to
take care of the expenditures during the
months of April and May.
There may be some question in regard to
the larger expenditure this year, as compared
with that of last year, and I think I might
make a brief explanation in that connection.
The total vote this year is $610,880,000 as
compared with $565,563,000 last year. This
would seem to indicate a rather large increase.
I may say that it is largely explained by an
addition of $63,260,000 to this year's interest
on the public debt. Then there is an increase
of $2,167,000 in the cost of the administration
of the income tax and the excess profits tax,
an increase of $3,007,000 in the post office service expenditure, and an increase of $3,375,000
in the cost of administering the unemployment
insurance fund and of the Government contribution to that fund. Those increases make a
total of $71,809,000, and they relate to matters
which are, I think, largely uncontrollable.
There is also an increase of $661,000 in subsidies to provinces, as a result of the revision
of population figures based on the recent
census.
Evidence of the continuance of the policy
of restricting normal peacetime expenditures
to the minimum required for the maintenance
of essential services is to be found in the fact
that no fewer than one hundred and sixty-six
items show reductions totalling $35,000,000.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Those are mainly
salaries.
Hon. Mr. KING: They are more than
salaries, I think.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: But mainly.
Hon. Mr. KING: There will be a decrease
this year of $23,910,000 in the moneys paid
for wheat acreage reduction. Then in the
Department of Transport there will be a saving
of $1,390,000, in Trade and Commerce of
$539,000, in Public Works of $405,000, and in
Mines and Resources of $281,380.
The uncontrollable expenditures which I
referred to a moment ago, and which perhaps
I need not recite, include interest on public
debt and other debt charges amounting to
$231,714,000; European war pensions, 1914-18,
$37,500,000; Government contribution to unemployment insurance fund, $15,000,000; old
age pensions, $31,246,000; other pensions and
superannuations, $5,295,000; care of returned

119

soldiers, 1914-18 war, $14,000,000; subsidies and
special compensations to provinces, 898,856,000.
Then there are the Maritime Freight Rates
Act, $4,250,000, and sundry other items to an
amount of $3,650,000. The total of uncontrolled expenditures is $441,511,000.
As I have said, the Government requires
this money in order that it may carry on the
ordinary business of the country during the
months of April and May. I trust the Bill will
receive favourable consideration.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable members,
the leader of the House has given us a digest
of what we are about to consider and, I
presume, approve. I doubt very much if it
would be advisable to add anything to what
he has said. We have had placed before us a
picture of the estimates for the public service
as a whole, and this Bill merely proposes that
we vote one-sixth of that section of the estimates which does not have to do with statutory
provisions. Later on, if the session lasts long
enough, we may have occasion to pass another
bill of this character, and still later the
estimates as a whole must be approvedi.
I see no reason why this Bill should not be
put through the House and receive the Royal
Assent, in order that moneys may be expended
under it.
Hon. W. E. FOSTER: Honourable members of the Senate, I rise for the purpose of
making a few general remarks on the Bill
which is now under consideration, and which,
as the leader of the Government bas said, is
for the purpose of voting one-sixth of the
amount of the estimates for the year 1943-44.
The introduction of this interim supply bill
gives one an opportunity to discuss the
general financial situation of the country, if
one wishes to do so, and also the administration of the different departments; an opportunity which is not available to honourable
members when the main supply bill comes
down at the end of the session, and on the
absence of which there has always been considerable complaint. Therefore I desire at
this time to discuss briefly the question of
supply in general.
First of all, may I say that the Finance
Minister must be very grateful that the
budget he presented to the country has been
accepted by the members of the House of
Commons and approved by a very substantial
majority of those who represent the people of
Canada. That approval was, I think, an
expression of confidence in the Minister himself, in the administration of his office, and
in the Government's conduct of affairs, including the war effort. Also, it must be a matter
of gratification to the Finance Minister to

120

SENATE

know through the people's representatives in
the other House that the people of the
country are willing to give their financial
support to the full, in order that Canada may
do her part in bringing the war to a successful
conclusion at as early a date as possible.
The leader of the Government has very
well expressed the purpose of the Supply Bill,
but I should like to add a few thoughts that
have come to my mind in relation to it. I
should like to point out that last year the
budget totalled approximately $3,600,000,000.
Honourable senators will perhaps recall that
early in this session, shortly after the House
met, there was an additional supplementary
estimate of some $868,000,000, making a total
expenditure for the year of approximately
$4,450,000,000, with a small additional amount
of supplementaries yet to be added, I understand, which would not affect the total very
much.
The expenditure proposed in the
budget this year, 1943-44, is estimated at
$3,800,000,000, with another billion to be added
shortly to the estimated expenditure on war
account. This is a large amount of money.
If a proportionate sum were asked for in
peace-time it would forecast something in the
way of political activity, probably a general
election; but in this case it is without doubt
evidence of nothing except increased activity
in the war effort.
If we add these figures to the sum of what
might be expected in the way of supplemental estimates, the total expenditures for
the coming year will amount to approximately 5,000 million dollars, an amount so
large that it is difficult for an ordinary
individual like myself to comprehend it. Perhaps if in a moment of meditation one took
a sheet of paper and a pencil and wrote down
the figure 5, and then wrote slowly all the
cyphers necessary to express five thousand
millions, one would get a much better idea of
the size of our expenditure than by glibly
stating the amount.
This estimate of 5,000 million dollars, or 5
billion dollars, whichever you prefer to call it,
includes of course the sum of one billion dollars
which honourable members of another place
and writers in the Press have referred to as a
gift to the British Government. A similar
vote was made last year. I think it would be
better described as an amount required to
finance war supplies manufactured or purchased
in Canada for the use of the United Nations.
There are some people, of course, who in terming it a gift to Great Britain do so for purposes of criticism, and others who do so to
show the assistance which Canada is giving to
the Mother Country. But I repeat that I think
Hon. Mr. FOSTER.

the proper way to speak of it is as an appropriation for goods manufactured or purchased
in Canada for the United Nations.
In discussing this Bill, which has been explained by the honourable leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. King), and the other
money Bill that we are to have before us, I
think it is well to keep constantly in mind
the fact that these measures cover two classes
of accounts. There are the non-war or ordinary expenditures, which, as the honourable
leader of the Government has said, are estimated at about $610,880,000. Last year these
amounted to $565,000.000; so that we have an
apparent increase of about $45,000,000. I think
the honourable leader referred to the increase
as about $40,000,000, but I figure it to be
roughly $5,000,000 more than that.
Honourable members have no doubt read
newspaper editorials criticizing the Government for this increased expenditure on ordinary account, and in some instances expressing
surprise and disappointment that there was
not a reduction. From many quarters there
have come evidences that governmental expenditures are being closely watched by the
people.
In the Finance Minister's budget
speech no reason was given for this increase,
but the honourable leader of the House has
shown in part how it is made up. For instance, he pointed out that the item of $63,000,000 for inereased interest on the publie
debt is included in this expenditure, instead
of being placed, as it might have been, in the
war account. There is also the increased cost
of administering the income tax, and the unemployment insurance fund.
These increases,
added to certain other items which could
properly be classified under war expenditure,
total more than $70,000,000 and therefore increase the non-war estimates for 1943-44.
It is clear that if the Government had
wished to make a better showing on paper
with non-war estimates, some of these items
might well have been classified as part of the
war cost. Therefore any criticism with respect
to the $45,000,000 increase in these estimates
falls to the ground, more particularly when
by comparison with last year there are departmental decreases totalling approximately
$50,000,000. If we take from these estimates
the total of the increases I have mentioned,
such as the greater interest on the public d'ebt
and the greater cost of administering the
Income Tax Act, and also bear in mind
departmental decreases of $50,000,000, we see
that the Government has made a successful
effort to meet the hopes and expectations of
the people for a reduction in non-war
expenditures.

MARCH 30, 1943
As to whether or not there are further
avenues which, if explored, might bring
about other economies, one cannot judge
without more knowledge of the operations of
the various departments. I was, however,
particularly impressedi by a statement, which
honourable members have no doubt received,
with respect to the operation expenses of the
Foreign Exchange Control Board. It is a
plain statement setting forth, the board's
various expenditures, and it shows that these
were curtailed to the extent of $254,000 in
1942, as compared with the previous year.
Of course, the expenditures by this board are
made through the Bank of Canada and so
do not appear in the estimates. I mention
this as an interesting example of reduction in
costs. If we received more statements of this
kind, giving figures that we can far more
easily follow than by digging for them in the
Auditor General's report, we could readily
see the effect of efforts made to control expenditure on ordinary accounts.
As was pointed out by the honourable
leader of the Government, the estimated nonwar expend-itures for 1943-44 amount to
$610,000,000, of which I am surprised to find
that on1y about $170,000,000 is controllable.
In other words, only $170,000,000 could be
reduced or eliminated, because by statutes the
remainder have been made charges on the
revenues. That is to say, statutory charges
amounting to $441,500,000 cannot be controlled
unless the laws which created them are
changed..
Hon. Mr. CALDER: If I remember correctly, the controllable portion is $240,000,000.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: I have frequently
expressed myself as opposed to the system
that sets up against the revenues annual
charges which are not controlled by the vote
of Parliament. In my view the laws which
establish these stated annual charges should
be as few as possible.
One of the items to which I should like to
refer, in the uncontrollable expenditure, is
that of subsidies and special compensation to
the provinces. This amounts to approximately 100 million dollars. To be more
precise, it is $98,856,000, which I think honourable members will agree is quite a substantial sum to come out of our revenues in a
hard-pressed time of war. It is true that this
amount includes compensation to the provinces for giving up their rights to certain
taxes, particularly the income tax. At the
same time it is well to remember that provincial revenues in other respects are buoyant.
Apparently, however, this does not convince
some people that the provinces should accept

121

the decreased revenues from curtailed gasoline
and liquor sales and refrain from making
claims against the Dominion on these accounts.
This 100 million dollars of compensation seems
ample when we scrutinize the budgets which
various provincial treasurers have presented
recently. As one who has had some experience in struggling with the finances of a
province, I am not unmindful of the liberal
financial treatment which the Federal Government has accorded the provinces in the past.
The Central Government has always shown
a sympathetic feeling towards the provinces
with respect to their financial position.
The aid provided for the construction of
highways, many of which could not have been
undertaken without some federal assistance,
will be recalled by honourable members. I
refer particularly to the main trunk roads
through the various provinces, together with
the Trans-Canada highway. I think my honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Calder)
was a member of the Government when that
road-building plan was inaugurated, and it
has cost the Dominion Government a considerable amount of money.
We are also aware of the fact that the
Dominion Government has for a number of
years furnished aid to the vocational education systems in the different provinces. There
have also been several grants to the provinces
in aid of agriculture. During the depression
years large sums of money were voted to the
provinces as grants to help out the unemployment situation. Large loans were also made
to certain provinces to tide them over the
depression years. Then there is the federal
contribution to the provinces in respect of old
age pensions, which this year will total about
$30,000,000, representing a contribution of 75
per cent. Those are services solely within
the jurisdiction of and really a direct charge
upon the provinces.
As I said before, the Federal Government,
whether Conservative or Liberal, has always
dealt very sympathetically with the provinces
during the lean years when provincial budgets
were showing deficits, while the Minister of
Finance was able to show a surplus. The
reverse is now the case. The Dominion budget,
by reason of the very heavy war expenditures,
shows each year a large deficit, while on the
other hand the provincial budgets disclose substantial surpluses. The other day I noticed that
the Provincial Treasurer of Ontario announred
a surplus of $20,000,000.
The Provincial
Treasurers of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia
and Quebec have also presented budget surpluses. As I say, the situation is now reversed, and I think it would be a splendid
gesture if the provinces, in view of the liberal

122

SENATE

treatment which, as I have pointed out, they
received in years gone by, should now reciprocate by lending without interest some of their
surpluses to the Government of Canada, to
be repaid after the war. If the provinces were
to do that, they would have a substantial
nest-egg to meet any post-war depression.
Might I mention that there is a precedent
for my suggestion in what the small colony of
Newfoundland has recently done. That colony,
which was in the red before the war, is now
showing a very handsome surplus over expenditures. It is lending some of its surplus to
the home Government, without interest, the
loan to be repayable after the war. That is a
precedent which might well be followed by our
provincial governments in respect to the Federal Government.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Some of the provinces
have voted money to give old-age pensioners
a cost-of-living bonus. What is the position
of the Dominion Government in that regard?
Hon. Mr. KING: This matter comes within
the purview of the Minister of Finance, and
therefore I hesitate to give my honourable
friend a direct answer. Previous to the passage of the Dominion Old Age Pensions Act
the care of aged pensioners rested wholly on
the provinces. At the time of bringing down
the legislation the Dominion Government
undertook to share 50 per cent of the burden,
and later it increased its contribution to 75 per
cent. I think we must look at first things first.
The attitude of the Federal Government today is to try to conserve all its energies for
the financing of the war. I know great pressure is being brought to bear upon the
Minister of Finance either to increase the rate
of old-age pensions or to give a cost-of-living
bonus. Some of the provinces are already
moving to supplement their oldage pension
rates.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

WAR APPROPRIATION BILL

No. 1

SECOND READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading of Bill 10, an Act for granting to His
Majesty aidi for national defence and security.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER.

He said:
Honourable senators, the estimates brought down in the House of Commons show that the Government will ask an
appropriation of $3,890,000,000 in aid of the
defence and security of Canada. This Bill is
for one-sixth of that amount. In other words,
we require this interim supply to the extent
of $648,333,333.33.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: It is one-sixth of the
vote required for the next fiscal year?
Hon. Mr. KING: That is right. The magnitude of this main vote must certainly bring
home to our minds the tremendous undertaking that Canada is shouldering in order that
we may carry through our part of this war to
a successful end. A few years ago it would
not have seemed, possible that this country
of 11,000,000 people would arrive at a stage
where Parliament would be asked for an
appropriation of $3,890,000,000.
The increases are incurred mainly in the
armed services. The expenses of the Army
Services for this year are $1,764,000,000 as
against, I think, $1,150,000,000 last year-an
increase of more than half a billion dollars.
The Naval Service requires $489,000,000 this
year. The Air Service requirements liave inSundry services
creased to $1,129,421,000.
account for another $22,500,000.
The Minister in the House of Commons the
other day brought down a white paper in
regard to these expenditures in comparison
with expenditures for other years. 1 think
this would be both helpful and useful to
honourable senators when they are studying
the main war supply bill. As was announced
not long ago, the anticipated bill resulting
from the budget will in the immediate future
be referred to our Committee on Finance, by
whom a study can be made of the legislation
and also of the estimates. For that reason I
do nat intend to spend a great deal of time
this afternoon in dilating on the expenditures.
This is an interim supply bill, and not only will
there be an opportunity for the Finance Committee to make a careful study of the estimates,
but this Chamber also will have an opportunity
of making a careful comparison of expenditures
in the varions war years.
One can readily understand the increased
expenditures on the armed services. There
has been an increase in the number of men
enlisted and in training, not only in Great
Britain, but also in Canada. There has been
an increase in the munitions and supply
required for the Army. A year ago the air
training programme was extended and greatly
enlarged, and we are now maintaining thirtyfour air squadrons overseas at the cost of

MARCH 30, 1943
the Doaminian Governmant. In the Naval
Service thare bas bean a large expansion, and
new construction is being undertaken.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: May I asIc, just for
information, how many planes constitute a
squadron in aur service?
Hon. Mr. KING: I have asked, that question myself and have not received a very
satisfactory answer. Apparently, we are flot
ta be told.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I cannot understand the
raticence of any dapartmantal officiaI or rnembar af the Government about telling the
Canadian people how many planes forrn a
squaciron and how many squadrons forrn a
flight. I think I cauld make a rough guess,
but 1 have neyer had an answer ta that
question, and I should like ta have one.
Hon. Mr. KING: 1 have neyer been able
ta gat ana eitbar.
Whereas the Departrnent of Munitions and
Supply last yaar axpandad $689,000,000, of
which $200,000,000 was for the purcbase of the
British interest in Canadian war plants, its
expanditura this year is estimated at
$166,000,000, indicating that construction expandituras and the like have caased, and that
this yaar the capital expenditure in that regard
will be less.
Then wa have an item that is greater than
last yaar. Last yaar $50,000,000, 1 think, was
providad for price stabilization; this year it is
estimatad that $120,000,000 will be required
for that purpose. As we ail know, there bas
been an effort, and I think a fairly successful
ana, ta stabilize prices in Canada. This bas
bean done in sorne cases by the granting of
subsidias ta avercome disparitias in price. and
I baliava a great portion of the $50,000,000
votad last year has been usad. If ana could
calculata the saving ta the Canadian people
by reason of the stabilization of pricas, I tbink
it would ba found that this savîng bas been
vary much in excass of $120,0000Ç00.
I do flot wish ta say more. Our bonourable
friand from Saint John (Hon. Mr. Fostar), in
bis ramarks on the financial statamant, deait
largaly with the appropriations made undar
this Bill. I would maya the second reading.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable mambars,
I have not much ta add ta what has been said.
We are here daaling witb another set of
axpandituras. I thinc most honourable members ara familiar with the ordinary axpenditures of govarumant, aither federal or provincial, and clearly undarstand what is takan
into consideration in connaction with ardinary
departmantal services of government and with
statutory expensas. But here we are con-

123

fronted with an entirely different situation.
The Govarnment, and the Government alone,
to a very large extent, is and must be responsible for the estimates that are placad bafore
us. 1 arn not complaining about that at ail.
For very obvious reasons many of the factsI do not say ail-cannot be given- ta Parliament. We cannot be told very plainly from the
floor of Parliamant what -these expenditures
are ail about, simply becausa such information
would be exceedingly halpful to the anamy. I
know there is a certain amount of dissatisfaction in that regard. We had an illustration of
it this aftarnoon in the simple question put by
my bonourabla friend to my left (lion. Mr.
Black), and wa have had evidencas of it
repeatadly since the war began. Personally I
ar n ot complaining, because I understand the
situation. In anothar place, where thay deal
with these mattars more fully than we do here,
there may be a full discussion an thie great
mai arity of the astimatas for the public
service; but so far as war expenditures are
concarnad, aftar ail, we have one common
abject in view-to dafeat the enemy-and we
are prapared ta expend evary dollar that is
nacassary for that purpose. AIL we can do is
simply ta hope that the money is being
expended wisaly, that there is a.s little waste
as possible, and, that the expenditure is made
in such a way as ta give us the greatest
strengtb Canada can possass in this war.
I know, and every persan in this House must
know, that a thousand mistakes will be made
ini carrying on the war effort. That simply
cannot be avoidad. I arn not saying that
matters sbould not be inquired into, or that
there should be no criticisrn, but I think that
ail we can do after this money is voted and
placad at the disposai of the Govarnrent is to
watch as clasaly as possible for signs of ineffective expenditura and waste, and, if we
detact any, to raise aur vaices in protest.
Soma Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That is the only check
we have on the Government at this time.
1 rathar liked the remark made by Winston
Churchill earlier in this war, ta the effect that
ha was not afraid of criticism in connection
witb the war effort; that ha rather welcamed
it. I amn inclined to think our attitude in this
country bas been a littie different, and that
there bas been too much objection ta criticism.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear. Quite right.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Crîticisma is the one
tbing that enables Parliament ta axert a check
on the GovernÙnant, and the Government
should be thankful for just criticism.

124

SENATE

So far as these particular votes are concerned, what are we going to say? What do
we know as to the necessity of these expenditures? We have a general idea that the Army,
the Navy, the Air Force and the production of
munitions have been increased. But wbo decides upon these increases? It is a question
of war policy, of iinited war strategy, a question of the deman.d for supplies to China or
Russia or Britain, and the Government must
be provided witb money to carry on Canada's
full share in the struggle. That is ail we expect,
and wbether the money is wisely spent or not
we cannot decide at the moment. Time alone
will tell. Ail that the public and members of
Parliament can do is to watch and wait, and
sec what is taking place.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

that to-morrow at a quarter-past three we
may have the Royal Assent to the bills passed
this afternoon. If this supplementary supply
bill is passed by the bouse of Commons this
evening, we should have it for consideration
to-morrow. In order to, facilitate the work,
I would, suggest that the House, when it
adjourns to-day, stand adjourned until twothirty to-morrow afternýoon. If the bill is
then ready, and reaches us from the House

BUSINESS 0F THE SENATE
On, the Orders of the Day:
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators,
before the Ordýers of the Day are called I
sbould like to, make a brief statement. When
we adjourned, yesterday I indicated that tbe
money bis which we had just passed would,
with the supplemen.tary estimates that were
expected, from the bouse of Commonis, be
given Royal Assent this afternoon. I am
now advised that the supplementary estimates

1125

MARCH 31, 1943
were flot passed by the Commons last night
and are stiil under consideration. there. On
that account there will be no Royal Assent;
this afternoon, and, we shall ad-journ, this afternoon until to-morrow.
PRIVATE BILLS
SECOND READING

Hon. JOHN T. HAIG moved the second
reading of Bill T2, an Act to incorporate the
Felician Sisters of Winnipeg.
H1e said: Honourable senators, this Bill last
session was discussed fully in committee of
the Senate and given third reading here, but
after passing the committee stage in the House
of Commons it was lost in the final shuffle
preceding the long adi ournmnent of Parliament.
I arn asking that the Bill be given second
reading to-day.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was rend the second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shail
Bill T2 be read a third time?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: With the consent of the
House, I move that the Bill be read, a thîrd
time now.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed,.
SECOND READING

Hon. S. A. HAYDEN moved the second
reading of Bill U2, an Act respecting the
Canada North-West Land Company Limited.
H1e said: The purpose of this Bill is to
change the qualification of directors. Originally the Act provided for qualification on the
basis of a nominal value, in shares, of $5,000.
Since that time there has been some realization of the assets of the company and a
distribution in part, and it now becomes
somewhat impracticuble to maintain that high
qualification in termis of dollar value. Therefore it is proposed sîmply to change the
qualification to the holding of 100 shares of
stock. If the Bill receives second reading, I
intend to ask that it be referred to the
Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
SECOND READING

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN moved the second
reading of Bill V2, an Act to incorporate the
Ukrainian Fraternal Society of Canada.
H1e said: Honourable senators, this society
was incorporated under the Companies Act,

and the purpose of the present Bihl is simply
to bring it under the Insurance Act so that
Mr. Finlayson, the Superintendent of Insurance, will have full jurisdiction-which he
has not had before. I think that if the Bull
receives second reading it should ha referred
to the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce, to which. insurance bills usually
go.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
MR. EDEN'S VISIT TO PARLIAMENT
DISCUSSION

0F ARRANGEMENTS

Hlon. Mr. HAIG: Has the leader of the
House any statement to make about to-morrow's ceremony in the House of Commons?
Hon. Mr. KING: I shall speak of that
now. Some question was raised yesterday
regarding the accommodation that should be
provided for senators in the House of Coinmons at the meeting to ha held to-morrow
for the purpose of hearing Mr. Eden. The
situation is being canvassed, and I believe
arrangements will be worked out to the
satisfaction of members of this Chamber.
When I move the adjournment I shail
move that the Senate stand adjourned until
to-morrow afternoon at 2.45 p.m. I tbink it
would probably be well for us first to meet
here and adjourn during pleasure, and after
Mr. Eden's speech to return here, and, if there
is any business, as I think there will be, to
resumne our sitting and transact the business. We shaîl then adjourn for whatever
period we dccide upon.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: When we meet
to-morrow shaîl we ha told what the arrangements are?
Hon. Mr. KING: I hope so.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Would not a quarter
to three be probably too late? If we meet
here at that time and have prayers, we cannot get to the House of Commons until
three o'clock, by which time the members
of that House will probably be in their seats,
and also, as they were last yýear during the
visit of Mr. Churchill, in seats reserved for
members of the Senate. I know of two
very unfortunate incidents that occurred at
that tiine, and I think it would be regrettable
if similar incidents should occur again. I
would ask the leader of the Huse to consider our meeting at 2.30, so as to have a
ittie more time to get to the House of
Commons.
Hon. Mr. KING: Probably the suggestion
is a wise one and would save confusion. I
will say 2.30 p.m.

126

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: Has the leader of
the House any further information about
what seating will be available?
Hon. Mr. RING: Definite arrangements
have not been made, but they are under
consideration.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: Before arrangements are made I should like to say a few
words in regard to this matter. If I were
considering only my own personal feelings I
should be quite content to sit in the seat
nearest the door, for my hearing is good and I
could hear what was going on. But I am
considering the matter from a broader aspect
than that. With the permission of honourable
members I will read the remarks of the Prime
Minister:
Members of the Senate will be accommodated
in their gallery and also on the floor of the
House in such seats as may not be occupied
by honourable members.
It does not look as though we were going
into the other House on terms of equality. It
was explained yesterday by the honourable
member from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder)
that on the occasion of Mr. Eden's visit the
House of Commons will not be in session, and
that the Commons Chamber is to be merely
a meeting place where, as publicly proclaimed
in the Press and elsewhere, members of both
Houses of Parliament may listen to Mr. Eden's
address.
I feel it is the personal duty of every
honourable member of this House to uphold
the dignity and standing of the Senate as one
of the important branches of Parliament. This
Senate is in no sense an annex to the Government. We are an independent body whose
rights are specified in the British North
America Act. Control over the Senate is
vested entirely in the Senate itself. There is
really no justification for members of the
Senate to be divided into two groups, seated
opposite each other in the House; but we
have followed that arrangement and had a
leader of the Government and a leader of the
Opposition because it has been found that this
makes for a more orderly conduct of business.
Members who come here from the other House
notice that contrary to the rule prevailing
there, when a senator rises he does not address
the Speaker; instead, he addresses the senators.
That is because the control of the Senate is
vested entirely in the Senate itself.
Our
Speaker has not the sarne control over us as
the Speaker of the Commons has over that
body.
My point is that when we go to the House
of Commons to hear Mr. Eden we should go on
terms of equality with the members of that
Hon. Mr. KING.

House. We know that in the Commons there
are honourable gentlemen who speak rather
disrespectfully of the Senate at times. One
member from my own province of Ontario
referred to us as a fifth wheel on a wagon. I
feel that simply indicated he had not a
thorough knowledge of the British North
America Act or of the functions and duties of
the Senate. Another member, frorn British
Columbia, made some disparaging remarks,
suggesting, I think, that our principal business
was listening to divorce cases through a keyhole. I am of opinion, of course, that these
gentlemen were simply seeking publicity, and,
not having the mental equipment necessary to
make a speech that would command publicity
in the Press, they resorted to the old habit of
criticizing the Senate. When I was sitting in
the House of Commons thirty-five years ago
I heard a member criticizing the Senate; so it
is not a new thing at all.
My purpose in rising is to protest against
the idea that we should go to the House of
Commons, for this joint meeting, on anything
less than terrns of equality with the members
of that House.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Will the honourable
gentleman read again what the Prime Minister
said about where senators would be seated?
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: This is what the
Prime Minister said:
Members of the Senate will be accommodated
in their gallery and also on the floor of the
flouse in such seats as may not be occupied by
honourable members.
We come in after the members of the other
House, apparently.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: There might not be any
seats at all for us.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Except down at the end
of the Chamber.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: We do not want
to show any disrespect to the Foreign Secretary or to the Government that he represents.
But for that, I would suggest that we decline
to attend the meeting under the proposed
conditions.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Go on strike.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: Out of respect to
the Right Hon. Anthony Eden and the Government he represents, I intend to go to the
meeting. However, as senior member of the
Senate in attendance to-day, I feel it my duty
te make this protest.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Honourable
senators, if I remember correctly, when the

127

MARCH 31, 1943
Right Hon. Winston Churchill addressed both
Houses of Parliament, seats were reserved for
senators in the Commons. I understand that
now no seats at ail are to be reserved. On
the contrary, according to the Prime Minister's
words as quoted by the honourable senatoi'
freim South Bruce (Hon. Mr. Dennelly), when
Mr. Eden speaks to-morrow any senator ms.y
have a'seat in the Commons if hie is able to
find one, but it is possible there may hot be
seats for us ail.
-sufficient
Hon. Mr. KING: As I have explained to
honourable members, the nxatter is now being
considered, and I hope arrangements satisfactory to the Senate will be made. That is
the only assurance I can give the Huse. There
is no useful purpose that I can see in arguing
the matter here. I arn making representations
to the Government and placing before it for
consideration the viewpoint of this bouse. We
may assume, 1 think, that the Government
wants to compfly as far as possible with the
desires of honourable senators. This does flot
mean honourablýe members of the other House
will 'be subjeet to removal from their regular
seats in order that senators may be accommodated. That would nlot be asked for by the
Senate, I feel sure.
When Mr.
Hon. M.r. BAILANTYNE:
Churchill spoke, seats were reserved for senators. The honourable leader (Hon. Mr. King)
has a good deal of influence, naturally, but
we are not asking for special reservations. It
is only fair, though, that certain seats be set
aside for senators.
bon. Mr. KING: That is the idea.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: That is what
was done for Mr. Churchill's visit. But now I
understand the honourable leader to indicate
that every member of the House of Commonrs
will be entitled to the seat he occupies when
that bouse is in session. That means, in plain
English, that there will be no sekts for us.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I beg the honourable
member's pardon, but hie is rwrong about the
arrangements that were made for Mr.
Churcbiil's visit. On that occasion we had to
hustle for seats and get them. as best we
could.
Hon. Mr. KING: That was the trouble.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: We had to hustie
for seats. Some senators took the seats of
important members of the House of Commons
and refused to let those members sit there.
That is what has caused. this difficulty. I know
that when Mr. Churchill was here a good many
senators, including myself, had to take what
we could find.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: I arn afraid that is
what is going to happen to-morrow.
bon. Mr. KING: I hope not.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: And probably there
will be no seats at ail for some senators. I
consider it exceedingly unfortunate that this
difflculty bas arisen. Let us look at the matter
once more. It is supposed, to be a joint
meeting of the bouse of Commions and the
Senate, yet we are told that members of the
Gommons may occupy the seats to which they
are entitled when their House is in session.
If we are to have a joint meeting of both
Houses, and the Gommons is simply the place
wvhere the meeting is to be ýheld, have we no
rights in that meeting place? What becomes
of our supposed rights? From what has been
said, there is every likelihood that some
senators 'will not be able to get any seat there,
yet accommodation will be provided for many
people who are not members of either bouse.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: This is a matter that
could be settled very quic*kly and definitely,
and there should not be the slightest hesîtation
about it. There is no need for any controversy in connection with this thing. If
we are to have a joint meeting of the House
of Commons and the Senate, let us have it.
There is plenty of room in the other Chamber
for every member of either House.
Hon. Mr. OOPP: bonourable senators, if
the meeting at which Mr. Eden wiil speak is to
be a joint meeting of members of both Houses,
held ini the Commons when that House is
adjourned, I question very much whether a
member of that bouse would have any more
rîght to the seat lie ordinarily occupies when
the bouse is in session than any senator would
have to it.
Some Hlon. SENATORS:- Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, I
move thatwhen the Senate adi ourns to-day it
stand adjourned until to-morrow at 2.30 in
the afternoon.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at

MRl. EDEN'S VISIT TO PARLIAMENT
DISCUSSION

0F ARRANGEMENTS

On ýIîe Orders of the Day:
Hon. J. Il. KING: Before the Orders of the
Day are proceedcd with, 1 desire to refer to
a niaiLer ivihich lias been under discussion, in
regard Lo the accommodation to be provided
in [lie House of Communs for honourable
senators who may be desirous of hearing the
Righi Hon. Anthony Eden, Foreign Secretary
of Great Britain, wxhen bie speaks in. that Chamber this afternoon. 1 intimated yesterday that
the d.flculties which seemed in the way would
be ir-uncdl out, and arrangements made which
would be satisfactory and fully meet the wishes
of honourable senators. 1 regret that the
Prime !vhni,,ter's naine entered into the discussion, becalîse, as any of us who know him are
awaie, nobody is more punctilious than he is,
and lie would be the first to resent any attempt
to disparage or throw a alur upon our parliamentary institutions, and the Iast to cause any
embarrassment to any individual senator or to
senators as a body. I feit certain that when
we consulted the officers of the House of
Commons our difficulties would disappear.
This inorning the Hon. the Speaker of this
bouse. the Clerk and 1 were able ta visit the
officers of the House of Coimmions, whum we
found most courteous and solicitous to meet
the desîres of the Seniate. An arrangement bias
been made. as was suggested here, wbereby
senators will be provided with seats in the aisie,
and those seats will be protected by our awn
officers, who will stand at the door to identify
senators and will see that when they arrive
tbey are properly placed. We know that on
similar occasions there bias heen difficulty by
reason of the crowd breaking in. It is hoped,
howevcr, that the arrangement made to-day
will be carried throug-h without an 'v disturbance or turmoil, and to the satisfaction not only
of the members of this House, but the publie
as well.
lion. Mr. KING.

I may say it is the intention of the Speaker
of the Senate, at the joint meeting, to extend
a welcome froma this Chamber to the Right

Hon. Anthony Eden.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. KING: I have already informed
my good friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) that if bie feels disposed, Mr. King
would. be glad to have him take a seat just
behind Mr. King's in the buse of Gommons; and the Prime Minister has asked me,
as leader of the Government in this Chamber, to occupy a seat beside him.
1 think the arrangements that have heen
made will prove satisfactory; at least I hope
tbey will. I believe alI tbe suggestions made
to me by the whips and by other senators
have been carried out, and I am satisfied
that a precedent will be set and there will
be no recurrence of our previous experience
on occasions of this kind.

Some Hon. SENATORS: ilear, hear.
Hon, C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I desire to express, not only for
myself, but also for other members on this
aide of tbe bouse, our thanks for and appreciation of the arrangements which have been
made. I am sure they will prove satisfactory.
I would ask the honourable leader of the
Government in this House to be kind enough
to convey my personal thanks to the Right

Hon. the Prime Minister for bis courtesy in
oifering me a seat directly bebind bis ownan honour whicb I bighly appreciate. I am
sorry to, say that, as 1 am still suiffering

from a beavy cold and bave to leave for
home on the 4.10 train, I saal not be able
to, attend in the bouse of Gommons this
afternoon. Otherwise
only too happy to

I should bave been
accept witb grateful

thanks the kind offer of the Prime Minister.
Hon. Mr. KING: In view of my bonourable friend's statement that bie bimself will
be unable to attend the meeting, perhaps the
honourable gentleman to, bis right (Hon. Mr.
Calder) would occupy, as acting leader of
that aide, the seat suggested by the Prime
Minister. I bave pleasure in extending an
invitation to bima to do so, knowing that
the Prime Minister would wish that done.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable members, as one who did some stirring in the
pot the other day, I feel I must congratulate
the bonourable leader of the bouse (Hon.
Mr. King) upon wbat hie bias done in
straightening out what was a somewhat difflcult tangle. I sincerely trust that nothing
of tbe kind will occur again, sbould we bave

Hon. J. H. KING: flonourable senators,

That the address which the Riglit Honourable
Anthony Eden, Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs and Leader of the House of Commons
of Great Britain, delivered bef are the memnbers
of the Senate and of the flouse of Commons of
Canada in the Cliamber of the flouse of Commons on April 1, 1943, be included in the Senate
Debates and farm part of the permanent records
of this Parliament.
I make this motion, whîcb is similar to

REPORT 0F THE PROCEEDINGS

A joint meeting of members af the Senate
and of the flouse of Commons was held in
the flouse of Commons Chamber, Ottawa,
on Tliursday, April 1, 1943, at 3 p.m.
Hon. James Allison Glen, Speaker of the
House of Commons, presided.
Riglit Hon. W. L. MACKENZIE KING
(Prime Minister): Mr. Speaker, on behaif
oi honourable members of botli flouses of this
Parliament of Canada, it is my privilege
and pleasure to extend a very warm, welcome
72542-9

129

to the Right Honourable Anthony Eden,
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the
United Kingdom, who lias honoured us with
lis presence on the floor of flua Chamber
this afternoon and very kindly consented to
address the members liere assembled a littie
later in the course of fthe afternoon.
.May I say to Mr. Eden that I extend this
welcome, not only on behalf of fhe members
of fthe fwo flouses of Parliament, but on
behaîf of tlie Canadian people as a whole,
wbose representatives we are.
When we learned tIat *Mr. Eden had
accepted the invitation extended to him by
the Government of the United States to visit
tlie United States to discuss witî the President
and lis colleagues matters pertaining to the
war, we were delighted to learn tliat lie lioped
f0 be able to visit Canada before returning
to the United Kiuigdom. I should like at once
to thank Mr. Eden most warmly for having
accepted so promptly the invitation whidh
upon his arrivai in Washington was extended to
him by the Government of Canada-nof anly
for lis kindness in accepting the invitation, but
also for agrceing in flie course of bis stay to
address boti flouses of Parliament and to
speak fo thie Canadian people ovier our radio
broadcasting system- and may I add, for his
courfesy in sparing the time to spend fwo
or fhree days wifh us ini the capital.
I am not going to refleat upon tlie intelligence of members of tlie two flouses of
Parliament by litfempting f0 review even in
briefest outline the oufsfanding attainments
of Mr. Eden's very notable career. They
are known nýot on]y in fhis country and in
all British countries, but in ail parts of the
world. .I would liowever say to Mr. Eden
that we specially welcome him in our Parliament to-day because af the important place
which lie lias filled for some twcnty years
past in the Parliament af Westminster, and
for the position lie now liolds as Secretary of
State for Foreign Affairs in the United
IKingdom and as Leader of the British flouse
af Commons.
In lis twen.ty years in
Parliament Mr. Eden lias been more intimately
associated witl fIe work oi the Foreign Office
(han most of lis disfinguîshied predecessors in
that higli position. I believe if is true thaf
the present Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs lias visited more countries in Europe
and in other parts of the wo>rld, lias visited
more parts of fIe Britisli Commonwealth of
Nations, knows personally more of those who
are direcfing fIe aiffairs of botli the allied
countries and tlie enemy nations, than any
Previous occupant of lis higli office. It is
certainly true that no Secretary cf State for
Foreign Aiffairs lias lield fIat ail-important
position at a time more crifical in the affairs

SENATE
of the world. He bas brought to his high
office exceptional qualities-qualities, may I
say to him, which have been reassuring to all
who are members of free assemblies.
We welcome him not only for his position
as Secretary of State and for all of high
attainment that it signifies, not only for his
position as Leader of the House of Commons
of Britain, which be holds at the present time;
we welcome him as well because of the
high and important mission on which be bas
come to this side of the Atlantic. Mr. Eden
himself bas told us that his mission was to
undertake a general exchange of views with
the President of the United States and his
colleagues on all aspects of the war situation
and to discuss the most effective method of
preparing for meetings between the governments of all the United Nations to consider
questions arising out of the war and questions
which will continue to confront the United
Nations as they seek to work oflt the problems
of peace and of the post-war world. It is net
less gratifying to us than I am sure it bas
been to Mr. Eden himself and to the
President, the Secretary of State, Mr. Cordell
Hull, and other members of the Government
of the United States, to know that he and
they were in such complete agreement in
respect of the many important subjects they
discussed.
Mr. Eden bas come to us to discuss similar
problems. As honourable mnembers are aware,
since the time of his arrival on Tuesday
afternoon he bas been meeting, almost continuously, members of the War Cabinet and
others of my colleagues. We have been discussing the same subjects and problems. May
I say to him that I think we have found
ourselves in measure of agreement with him
equal to that in which he and the President
found themselves in relation to matters they
discussed.
In his memorable address at Annapolis,
before leaving the United States, Mr. Eden
spoke of the British Commonwealth of Nations
as affording a pattern for the better organizatien of the United Nations and for more
effective means of consultation and conference
between them in carrying out the great purposes they have in common. In making that
as
statement I think I may say that he
spoken for Canada as well as for the United
Kingdom. I am sure he bas spoken for all the
self-governing parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations.
We welcome Mr. Eden not only for his great
accomplishments, for all that he bas so successfully achieved in the twenty years of his
public life, for his wide experience and his
wisdom in public affairs and his knowledge of
men, but also and most of all for what he is
Rt. Hon. Mr. KING.

in himself. There is no doubt that the new
order, which we all hope is going to follow the
termination of this war and prevail in the
period of peace, will take on the character of
the men who are at the head of affairs and
who will have te do with the shaping of that
new order. It is fortunate indeed for the world
that a man who holds the high standards of
thought and purpose which Mr. Eden has so
consistently upheld, one who bas been so
strong a champion of the rights of free men,
and of justice as between nations, shouldbe one
who will be a foremost figure in the shaping
of that new era. It is, I say, a fortunate thing
for the well-being of mankind, for the relations
between individuals and between nations, that
one who possesses so eminently the high
qualities of integrity and justice and love of
human freedom, the belief in the oneness of
the human family, and so strong a sense of
brotherhood, should be of those who will have
a commanding voice in the shaping of the new
order that is to come.
In conclusion, may I ask you, Mr. Eden, if
on your return to Britain you will take with
you the most loyal of greetings and expressions
of devotion of His Majesty's Canadian subjects to the King and Queen. Will you also
take with you the warmest and best wishes
to the Prime Minister of Britain? Tell Mr.
Churchill how rellaved we all were at his
speedy recovery after the unfortunate indisposition he suffered on his return from North
Africa, and tell him we do hope and pray that
he will continue to the end te enjoy the
vision, the wisdom and the endurance which
he as manifested from the beginning in his
conduct of the affairs of this war. And tell
him and tell all the people of Britain that
Canada is heart and soul with them in this
struggle, and that we shall continue so te
remain until the fight itself is ended and
victory and peace have been achieved.
Mr. GORDON GRAYDON (Leader of the
Opposition): Mr. Speaker, speaking on behalf
of the members of the Progressive Conservative party, may I add a word to what bas
been so eloquently said by the leader of the
Government of Canada, the Prime Minister
(Mr. Mackenzie King). I should like to
join in the welcome he as extended to our
distinguished guest and to say that we in this
Chamber are honoured and privileged to have
with us, net only the voice of Britain itself.
but a distinguished world figure.
Mr. Eden fought valiantly, courageously and
heroically in the dark and trying days of the
last war. He was decorated by His Majesty
for those services; and throughout the period
between the last war and the present one
his years of contribution to the preservation

APRIL 2, 1943
of the peace for which he and so many others
fought, shone as a beacon light in a confused
and stormy international sea. At times he
stood- almost alone in that period. But may
I say this, Mr. Speaker, that while he may have
stood almost alone, he has seen, in the events
of recent years, that stand fully justified.
To-day our distinguished guest continues the
fight. As the Prime Minister has said, we welcome him not only for what he has done, but
for what he is doing. We welcome him for
what he represents, and because of what he
stands for. We welcome him, too, for what lie
is. What the Prime Minister has said I need
not repeat; but it augurs well for Mr. Eden's
position in the structure which will be developed
in the world after the war that friendliness,
humility, honour and devotion to duty are
some of the outstanding but not all the fine
characteristics which distinguish him.
Mr. Eden's loyalty to the cause of justice as
between little nations and big nations, his
loyalty to that cause so far as "little" men and
"little" women throughout the world are concerned, have been characteristic of him ever
since lie became a spokesman for Great Britain
in the field of international politics and international law. He has had many gifts at the
hands of his Government and his people. He
was Secretary of State for War in Great
Britain when the fateful decision had to be
made whether or not Great Britain itself
would have to be denuded of its strength in
order that the action taken should be a favourable one with respect to holding the Suez
canal. He was also Secretary for War when
our Motherland and Empire went to the aid
of the heroie Greeks. And I.say now that we
shall always look back with a great deal of
pride on the daring move that was made on
that occasion.
As Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs
Mr. Eden is on a mission to arouse us and our
fighting allies in this war to the realization of
the need of fighting for common aims and formulating common plans both for victory and
for peace. Our honoured guest has made a
notable contribution to democracy through
these last twenty years of service, but, thank
God, lie is still a young man as years of public
life are counted. Having that youth, and having had such wide experience, two very important qualifications, we may, I think, in the
days that lie ahead, look for a contribution by
the Right Honourable Anthony Eden to world
affairs that perhaps will eclipse even his previous record of outstanding service. As the
Prime Minister said a moment ago, Mr. Eden's
attachment to the pattern of the British Commonwealth of Nations, in so far as the structure
72542-9j

131

for world peace is concerned, is one of course
to which all of us subscribe.
The Prime Minister has asked that Mr. Eden
take back to Their Majesties, to the Prime
Minister of Great Britain and its people our
best wishes and goodwill. I re-echo his sentiments. But I wish also to ask the right honourable gentleman if lie will carry back to the
Canadian armed forces overseas an expression
of our recognition of the part they are playing
and the sacrifices and services they are making
and giving, and are prepared to make and te
give, in order that we in Canada may have
security and freedom. My only hope is that
we in Canada, in our deliberations and our
work, shall be worthy of their sacrifices andtheir services. To the people of Great Britain
I would ask Mr. Eden to carry back this message from the Canadian people: We are prepared to fight to the last, with Great Britain
and the United Nations, until every vestige of
terrorism and danger to freedom is crushed
and dead.
And may I say in simple and heartfelt
language to our distinguished guest, when lie
leaves our soil: bon voyage, good luck, and
may God's richest blessings rest upon him and
his giant undertaking in the interest of a
better world, in which freedom .and justice
shall be the unassailable right of all.
Mr. M. J. COLDWELL (Rosétown-Biggar):
Mr. Speaker, we of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation are pleased to join in the
welcome extended to the Right Hon. Anthony
Eden. He represents to us a brave people who
stood steadfastly together, and, almost alone,
when many thought that our cause was lost.
We remember that throughout his public career
he has stood consistently for the preservation
of peace by means of collective security. Nor
do we forget that because in 1938 he believed
that the Covenant of the League of Nations
involved certain obligations lie resigned the
high office lie held at that time.
We have noted with considerable satisfaction
his timely assurances that we are fighting today not to preserve the status quo, but rather
in order that there may be a possibility for
future world progress. As a free nation in the
British Commonwealth of Nations our people,
too, are prepared to go forward to ultimate
victory in the high hope that in association
with our allies of the United Nations, we together, when victory is won, may lay the
foundations of a world in which there shall be
freedom from fear, freedom from war and
freedom from want.
That, sir, is the message that I would ask
you to convey to the British people on behalf
of the party for which I speak.

SENATE
Mr. J. H. BLACKMORE (Lethbridge): Mr.
Speaker, the Right Hon. Anthony Edel represents the people of a country, one of the
great poets of which sang these noble words:
The old order changeth, yielding place to new;
And God fulfils Himself in many ways,
Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.
It has fallen upon Mr. Eden's shoulders in
these trying times to preside, as it were, while
the prophecy which was voiced in those words
is being fulfilled. We desire that he shall be
inspired and guided in the performance of all
he does, and that wisdom, vision and courage
shall be his, as they have been in the past.
Members of the Social Credit group wish to
join with members of other parties in expressions of loyalty and devotion to the great
cause which is symbolized by the British Commonwealth of Nations. Whenever great changes
are about to be brought into being there is
always the danger that we shall go from bad
to worse. It must be our constant endeavour
to see that we shall go from good to better.
We were greatly comforted when it was
reported to us the Right Hon. Anthony Eden
had said that the blue-print of the future was
to be the British Commonwealth of Nations.
We recall that in the memorable document
known as the Balfour Declaration it was set
forth explicitly that members of the British
Commonwealth of Nations are to be "autonomous communities within the British Empire,
equal in status, in no way subordinate one to
another in any aspect of their domestic or
external affairs." We believe that in the new
world and the new order that principle should
prevail. We desire that, with respect not only
to members of the British Commonwealth of
Nations, but also to other nations which may
join themselves together in an endeavour to
improve matters, it will be possible for each
nation to say truthfully in the words of
another great English writer:
Daughter am I in my mother's house,
But mistress in my own.
We ask that the Right Hon. Anthony Eden
will take back to Great Britain our congratulations, our sympathy, our assurance of devotion and association with themTill danger's troubled night depart
And the star of peace return.

You have come to us, sir, as a knight in
shining armour. We know the important part
you have taken and are still taking in the
momentous struggle of the United Nations to
ensure the final victory of right over might, of
justice over iniquity, of liberty over tyranny
and oppression. We shall be for ever thankful
that, amidst your innumerable occupations, it
has been possible for you to visit us. And we
may tell you in advance that your stay in
Ottawa will leave in our minds an imperishable memory, and that the speech you are
about to deliver will be to us an inspiration
and an incentive of the highest order.
May I add that the example of duty and
devotion which you have set to the Empire
and the world in the present war is already
engraved in our minds in a most ineradicable
manner.
(Translation): Mr. Eden, I take much pride
in being the spokesman of my French Canadian
compatriots to welcome you to our country,
and I feel gratified in acknowledging in my
own tongue, on behalf of the French Canadian
members of the Senate and of the House of
Commons, the inspiration and encouragement
that will flow from the speech you are about
to deliver and which will remain engraved
in gold both in our public records and in our
hearts.
Since 1848, French has been one of the
official languages of our country. I may therefore use it to state that the French Canadians
have done their full share in the prosecution
of this war; that they are happy to be British
citizens and to live under a form of government under which they enjoy the greatest
freedom; that they always have remained
faithful to the parliamentary and democratic
institutions which they enjoy. Their sole
desire, to the fulfilment of which they apply
their best efforts, is to ensure the triumph of
our armed forces and to bequeath to the coming generation an enlarged inheritance, which
can be assured only through an Allied victory.
You appear to us as a fearless and faultless
knight; and I wish to convey to you the
gratitude we feel for the commendable part
you have always played in promoting the
triumph of right over might, of justice over
evil and of freedom over tyranny and oppression.

Hon. THOMAS VIEN (Speaker of the
Senate): Mr. Eden, honourable members of
the Senate and of the House of Commons, it
is indeed a great honour and privilege to extend
on behalf of the Senate of Canada to the Right
Hon. Mr. Eden a most cordial welcome on the
occasion of his visit to our Houses of
Parliament.

Hon. J. A. GLEN (Speaker of the House of
Commons): Honourable members of the
Senate and the House of Commons, we are
met this afternoon to receive a very distinguished visitor, the Right Hon. Anthony Eden,
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and
Leader of the House of Commons. Mr. Eden
is no stranger to the forum of the House of

Mr. M. J. COLDWELL.

APRIL 2, 1943
Gommons. H1e, like Mr. Churchill, is a House
of Gommons man; and it is therefore emmnently fitting and proper that Mr. Eden should
give bis first public address ini Canada from
the floor of the Ganadian Huse of Gommons.
It would be a work'of supererogation for
ire to recite the many virtues which have been
expressed to-day by members of the Huse
regarding Mr. Eden. Ris name is a familiar
one in Canada. His career is known. to many
people through.out our Dominion. And I
believe that on this occasion-and none could
be more appropriate than this gathering of
members of both bouses of ParliamentCanada through its Parliament would'i wish to
express to Mr. Eden the deep-souled appreciation and unstînted, admiration of the courage
and fortitude of the British people during those
tragin months of 1940 a.nd since. We who
understood the desperation of those times will
ever be thankful that there was a noble band
of leaders in the United Kingdom who., when
it seemed that the last bastion of freedom
in the European world was crumbling in ruins,
stood stead.fast and, firm, neyer faltering; and
that they and the British people gave an
example of courage and determination greater
and more heroic than that ddspl.ayed at any
other time in the long history of Britain.
Mr. Eden was anl outstandîng leader among
those leaders of whom I have spoken.
To us in Canadia it is a most comforting
thougbt that in that crisis Canada and, the
other nations comprising the British Commonwealth neyer swerved from their steru and implacable purpose to support the United Kingdom and to resist with, all their strength and
rüsources the forces of evil ranged against
democracy. The Commonwealth, let it neyer
be forgotten, stood alone in those days. We
now have allies of the most powerful nations
in the world. And although the roadi may be
long and dreary, and the end not yet in sight,
there is no, doubt now as to the issue.
Now, sir, I hand over to you the members
of hoth bouses of Parliament. The listening
world is eagerly awaiting your address. You
are not bound by the rules of this House-you
may even read your speech. And our rule
limiting speeches to forty minutes is with
unanimous consent, now given, suspended
entirely.
Honourable members of the Senate and the
bouse of Gommons: I present to you the
Right Hon. Anthony Eden, Secretary of State
for Foreign Affairs in the United Kingdom.

Right Hon. ANTHONY EDEN (Secretary
of State for Foreign Aflairs in the United
Kingdoma): Mr. Speaker, I arn deeply grateful
to you and to the members of the Parliament
of Canada for the compliment which you have
paid me in thus inviting me to speak to you
here from the floor of the bouse. I understand,
of course, that the compliment is not paid to
me personally, but to our own bouse of
Gommons at home, of which I happen to be,
for the time being, the unworthy leader. 1
feel sure that my colleagues in the House of
Gommons at Westminster would wish me to
express to you here and now their warmest
thanks andi gratitude for this truly thoughtful
gesture. There 15 no0 compliment, as you, sir,
have hinted, that could appeal more te the
heart of any bouse of Gommons man.
Sir, this procedure and these surroundinge
are familiar to me, though I confess that your
House is at once more spacious and more
generously fitted-and, let me add, less battered-than our own. As you are perhaps
aware, our own chamber at Westminster has,
been destroyed, and as an act of granious
generosity we now ment in what was formerly
known to us as "another place." None the
less I nan assure you with ail conviction that
the spirit of the House of Gommons lives on,
undismayed by enemny action or even by its
present more august setting.
I should lýike to take this opportunity, sir, to
express to my old friend the Prime Minister,
to bis colleagues and to other friends here in
Canada my warm thanks for the kindness and
hospitality they have shown me since I have
been in t.his great city. The Prime Minister
referred, just now to the work we have done
togeýther in a few crowded hours. I almost
thi*nk that he and I have been keeping the
kind of hours that are usually assoniated with
my own, Prime Minister. bowever that may
be, I share with him the full satisfaction at
the resuIt of the work we have been able to
do together.
Some very generous things have heen said
about me this afternoon. If I thought there
was any danger of your believing a*ny of them,
I should be highl*y nervous, but I am comforted by the reflection that there is no risk
of that.
I wouki preface what I say to-day by giving
you this assurance, if 1 may. Those who have
preceded me have given many generous messages to my country. I shail regard myseif as
privileged to take back to Their Majesties the
Ring aad Queen, to our great Prime Minist.er,
Mr. Winston Churchill, and to the people of

134

SENATE

Britain, the encouraging, the heartening and
cheering words which have been uttered, in this
Parliament to-day.
To think of Canada in these times is to
tbink of hier armed for-ces by land, sea and
air. and it is of these that 1 would speak to
you first. It so happens, by the chance of
events, that I have been lucky enough t.o
see something of the Canadian forces since
the earliest d-ays of the war. As Dominions
Secretary in the opening months of the war
it was nîy privilege to travel to a certain port,
there to welcome the first contingent of your
army to reach the shores of the Old Country.
Sir, I coul-d neyer forget that. scene. It was
a heautiful winter morning, sucb as wve do
have in Britain sometimes, at, a famous port
whieh I suppose must stili remain anonymous;
such are the rules of censorsbip. I was the
spectatur of the seene from the flagship of the
commander-in-chief of the home ficet. As the
great armada of ]iners swung into sight under
the cscort of the Royal Navy, cheering Canadian troups Iined the decks, and the band of
the flagship played "O Canada." 1 suppose
that, seldomn in human bistory have so many
great transports and, so, many powerful ships
of war beca assembled together at one time.
That was Canada making lier contribution in
the hour of iuced, and that ivas only the beginning. -Many contingents of your army have
follow cd the forerunners.
Wlien in April,
1940, a few brief wecks before the drama ot
Dunkerque, the Prime Minister, Mr. Winston
Churchill, forîîîcd bis Gox ernment, lie asked
me to take over the War Office. There again
I had the opportunity of meeting officers and
men of the Canadian forces. Those were the
dark days of 1940 to which you, sir, have just
referred, wbcn the presence of your troops
was at. once a safeguard te our threatened
citadel and an inspiration to our own efforts.
Since those day s the Canadian army in Britain
has biad to endure a long period of training
and waiting. No experience can be more
exacting for the morale of any army. Its
officers and mcn have sustained this ordýeal
with a patience and a senise of discipline that
lias won the admiration of us ail. Save for
the attack at Dieppe, carried, tbrough witb
that brilliant d"sb and daring which the
world bas come to assuciate witb Canadjan
arms, the lot of your fellow countrymen in
Britain has been one of waiting for the bour
that will come. This message I should like
you to give to the people of Canada, in aIl
sincerity :As the montbs and tbe years have
passed, the affection of the British people for
their Canadian guests and comrades bias grown
until we have corne to regard them not as
Rt. Hon. Mr. EDEN.

x isiting kinfolk, but as our very own-men
whoma wo respect and admire. We k-now tbat
one day their distinguishod- commander, General McNaughton,, will lead tbem to, victory.
Now, sir, lot me speak for a moment of the
undying achievements of the Royal Canadian
Air Force, made possible by tbe well-planned
execution of the Commonwealth Air Training
Seheme. It su happens that as Dominions
Secretary I also saw tbe flrst conception and
early execution of that sleeme. I do not tbink
that any of us thon quito reatized-I freely
admit that, I did not-the extent to wbicb its
developmoent migbt influenice the whole course
of the war, even though its potentialities did
inspire us aIl to do wbat we could to ensure
the success of its early beginnings. Well, sir,
if Canada hiad done nothing eb.ze in this war,
bier predominant share in the Commonwealth
Air Training Scheme would ensuro for her an
enduring place in. the roll of famne.
I had a fortunato oxperience this rnorniag,
such as seldom falîs ta, the lot of those ef us
wbo bave to bear political burd-ens in this time.
I took, a couple of hours off, and I went not
far froîn this city to see one of those training
centres. It was a truly inspicing experience.
Clearly the work that is being done tbere bias
much more than merely wartime importance.
In one fliglit I saw young mon, fcom Canada,
from Australia, fcom New Zealand, fcom the
United States and frum the Old Country working together in complete cemradeship and
understanding.
It doos not require mucb
imagination to understand the sigaificance that
oaa have for the future. These young mon
are gotting ta know and respect one another.
They are bceaking down somo of the old
barciers. Some of the old prejudices are heing
removed by this groater cornradeship of the
air. Ail the instructors to whom I spoke gave
me evidence of this. Su, sir, I say that these
young pilots may ho the best ambassadýors of
the future. If we can only capture and keep
the spirit wliich tbey bave learned in these
sehools there is nu international prohlem which
we cannot resolvo.
I arn going to ask bonýourable membors of
these two Houses if for a moment now tbey
will cast thoir mindýs back ta the early days
of the wac, because I sbould like ta tell tbem
that thece is in the minds of ail my countrymon one recollection above ail whicb stands
out from -thoso days. We oaai neyer forget
that when we wont ta war to redeem our
pledged word-a fact that I like ta keep presenit
in my mind-wbenwe did tbat, you stood, with
us.
Four self-govecning Dominions of the
Blrtish Empire took their stand in partnership
with us. That event is part of recorded

APRIL 2, 1943
history. No man can change it. It is an
event of which the British Commonwealth wil.
always be, I trust, supremely proud. This
close association in the hour of danger was
the outward expression of the inner meaning
of the British Commonwealth..
Let us for a moment consider its significance,
because I am of the opinion that we do not
talk about ourselves enough. What did it
mean? It meant that a number of selfgoverning communities scattered all over the
world realized as clearly as we did, who were
very much closer to the scene, the peril that
beset not only them, but mankind. Understanding full well that the threat ta one was a
threat ta all, ,they rallied unanimously in
defence of the- common cause. That event is
all the more remarkable when we reflect that
the citizens of this Commonwealth are not all
of one common stock. Here in Canada are
millions of French descent, whilst in South
Africa the majority is in fact of Dutch origin.
Moreover, India and the colonial territories of
the Empire have from the first day takentheir
place at our side. When, therefore, all is
measured, there has been no more striking, no
more inspiring episode in human history than
this free and spontaneous action by all the
peoples of the British Empire.
Since those days we have battled through
some pretty stern times together. We have
known dark days and, on occasion, brighter
hopes. To-day when we survey the world
scene, we are conscious of the support of many
and powerful friends, so that if we hold tagether and persist until the end, the issue is
not in doubt. In recent months encouraging
reports have reached us from many theatres
of war. We are entitled ta rejoice at them, ta
take fresh heart from them, but there would
be an element of danger if they were ta
cause us for one moment ta relax our efforts.
The better news must not tempt us to
underrate our enemies' strength; it must only
nerve us ta greater efforts. Our Turkish friends
have given many wise sayings ta the world.
There is one in particular which I would commend to you as being a suitable motta for the
stern business of war-"Though thine enemy
be an ant, imagine that he is an elephant." Sa
it is our duty ta concentrate all our strength
upon the first task in hand, which is the utter
defeat of the enemy. It is well, very well that
we should take thought and counsel together
as ta the future problems that may beset us.
It would be bad if we were ta allow such necessary preparation ta dim for one instant our
vision of the work at hand and our determination ta see it through.
Sir, even as I speak at this hour, the battle
of the Atlantic is raging. It is yet undecided.
In the struggle that has ebbed and flowed

these months and years, the Royal Canadian
Navy has played a glorious part. The epic of
the convoys is never ending; it would require
libraries to do justice ta it; the words of the
greatest poets that ever lived would not
suffice. We must regard the U-boat as our
greatest menace. It is the ceaseless task of
our navies to protect our life-lines, and ta
fight a way through for our convoys. The
enemy is clearly staking heavily upon his
U-boat offensive. We must not only continue,
but intensify our efforts against this desperate
challenge. You may be confident that we shall
do sa.
Sir, having uttered this warning, perhaps I
may yet speak to you for a little of the future.
As the war progresses we see the conception
of the United Nations gradually taking shape.
I believe it is better that this development
should come about in this gradual way. Caoperation which is born of stern necessity and
forged by experience has the best chance ta
survive into the years of peace. It is better ta
build as we go along, ta test our mutual understanding and ta develop it rather than
ta devise all at once some elaborate structure
into which we shall seek ta fit the component
parts as best we may. In this sphere of international endeavour the Commonwealth has its
specific contribution ta make.
Sir, it has been our practice for many years
ta allow and encourage co-operation ta grow.
We have neither rigid rules nor precise formulS between us, but we have the spirit of
understanding and we know the road that we
would travel. Can we infuse something of this
same spirit into the sphere of international
relations? If we can, we shall have made an
essential contribution ta a peace that can
endure.
(Translation): One thing I should like you
ta know about our British people is that, after
three years of war, they show no sign of
weakening. The British are united in a stubborn determination to see the struggle through
ta a finish, for they are armed with strength,
courage and fortitude. The enemy's pre-war
slander about the British being exhausted and
done for has been disproved with a consummate vigour unparalleled in history. Above
all, the British have a very youthful spirit and,
both east and west, you may depend upon
them until the end of the conflict and until
triumphant peace.
Many a nation has painfully suffered in this
war. France has known a particularly hard and
bitter ordeal. Throughout my life I have believed in the greatness of France and, to-day,
my faith in her future remains unehakable.
For our part, we have but one wish: ta
witness a renewal of the bond which unites all

136

SEINATE

Frenchmen who have sworn to fight our common enemy. We will always be ready to help
them achieve that purpose, for it marks the
first step toward the regeneration of France
and the opening of a new chapter in her
glorious history.
(Text) Sir, when we consider the unhappy
years, the d'istressful years between the two
wars, we should surely do so in the determinalion to learn the lessons of our failure. I have
myself had some experience, as have your
Prime Minister and others of your Canadian
statesmen, of the attempts which have been
made to keep the peace by international
machinery. Well, sir, one lesson is predominant in my mind.
The League of
Nations suffered, no doubt, from a number of
human failings and shortcomings. We all do.
However, what above all it lacked was a
sufficiently wide international authority to
express its decisions with conviction and an
adequate force to sec them executed.
So it was that the gangster nations,
Germany, Italy and Japan, could test their
strength and work their will. Mr. Speaker,
we must never be in that position again. It
is essential that when this war is over the
United Nations should maintain sufficient force
to ensure that neither Germany nor Italy
nor Japan can ever plunge the world into war
again. The experience through which I have
lived is similar to the experience which many
of you have known. I have taken part, as
you have done, as a soldier in one war
which we had hoped, as I have just been
reminded, was a war to end war. I now watch
my son prepare to take part in a second war.
Mr. Speaker, it is our duty to sec to it that
this cruel and inhuman lot is not also the
heritage of our children's children.
For my part I, therefore, say definitely that
I am not prepared to take risks again with
either Germany, Italy or Japan. I have no
faith in the promises of their statesmen or in
the smooth assurances of their apologists.
There is only one security for mankind in
respect of all of them-to ensure that they
shall be totally disarmed and in no position
ever to try their strength again. And then
indeed peace may have its chance. After
the bitter lessons which we have learnt we
must insist upon the fullest precautions. Sir.
to say these things is not to show a iack of
humanity, but to clarify our thought on
issues upon which the future life of the
world will depend.
It is no easy task to co-ordinate the action
of the United Nations in war, nor will it be
simple in peace; but if the basis which I am
propounding is accepted, as I am sure it will
Rt. Hon. Mr. EDEN.

be by us all, then the task can be achieved.
I have myself been greatly encouraged by
the conversations which I have had upon
these matters a year ago in Moscow and more
recently in Washington. They have been an
inspiration to me. Admittedly there will be
differences and divergencies amongst us. Five
per cent, I think, the President allotted to
them, and of course there always will be
such. But they are not insurmountable,
because at heart we want the same thinginternational security, so that all of our
peoples may live and develop their lives in
freedom and at peace.
Let me then sum up my message to you.
For this task we shall need not only a close
understanding among the nations of the
British Commonwealth, the United States,
Russia and China, but the full co-operation of
all the United Nations. Together we can win
the war and win the peace, and nothing less
shall content us. It is our duty to hand on to
our children a world in which freedom eau
live and a man command his soul, free from
that constant dread which shadows our own
time. To that task we have set our hands and
will dedicate our lives. Let us give this pledge
this afternoon: We will neither falter nor fail
until we have redeemed our word and opened
to future generations a peace and promise that
we have never known.
Hon. J. A. GLEN (Speaker of the House of
Commons): I do net propose to add anything to the address to which we have just
listened. All I shall do is to express to you,
sir, the profound thanks of Canada and of both
Houses of Parliament here assembled, for a
speech memorable in phrase and style, and
moving in its appeal. And I would seek te
express the prayer of multitudes of people in
all parts of the world that you and your colleagues may be given strength and wisdom to
complete the high task to which you have been
called and that, through victory, peace and
happiness may return soon to this war-torn
world.

in all human probability resulted in ber
husband's death. If that evidence satisfies the
judge, be may decree that the man be presumed to be dead, and that as a consequence
of this presumption the marriage be dissolved.
There is another branch in this case, relating
to presumptive evidence. I think all members
of this House, whether lawyers or not, are
familiar in a general way with what is meant
by "presumptive evidence." Certain facts are
produced from which presumptions may arise.
This Bill, if enacted, would apply equally to
either sex, and would provide that if a man,
say, bas been absent for seven continuous years
and his wife has known nothing of him during
that time, and, to use the language of the
Bill, "has no reason to believe that the other
party has been living within that time," the
court may-not shall, but may-if satisfied,
without any detailed evidence of a ship's sinking or an explosion or anything else, make,
first, a decree of presumption of death, and
second, on the basis of a continuous absence
for seven years under such circumstances as to
raise a presumption of death, a decree of dissolution of the marniage.
That is the scope of the Bill under the first
two headings to which I call attention.
The next point is that this Bill is limited
to provinces now baving jurisdiction to grant
a divorce a vinculo matrimonii; that is, a
divorce as distinguished from an annulment.
So, in the result, it would not apply to the
province of Quebec.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Nor to Prince Edward
Island.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Nor to Prince Edward
Island; but in putting in this provision I bad
in mind more particularly the province of
Quebec. Honourable members will understand
why. I might elaborate to this extent. In the
first place, under the Bill the machinery of a
divorce court is required, and of course there
is no such machinery in the province of Quebec.
And just here, if I am permitted to digress,
having in mind some of the discussion that
occurred the other day, I would say that
within the four corners of the law as it now
exists, the court which sits in this end of the
building dealing with divorces from the province of Quebec is, in my opinion. one of
the most efficient courts in any part of Canada.
I asked a question the other day to bring that
out, when it was suggested that jurisdiction
might be given to the Exchequer Court rather
than to the courts of Quebec. In my opinion,
the Exchequer Court is the last place in the
world to which that jurisdiction should go.
It is not equipped in any way to do the work.
If the jurisdiction should go from the Senate,
I should prefer that it go to the courts of
Hon. Mr. FARRIS.

Quebec; but I can see no reason why it should
not remain where it is, with a court which
has functioned competently and efficiently for
a great many years. But that is a digression.
To return, I say, first, that the machinery
necessary is not available in Quebec. In the
second place, coming as I do from the province of British Columbia, I would not for
one moment presume to move that a bill
of this kind should apply to the province of
Quebec. If in days to come there is any
modification along this line, it should come
from the representatives of that province and
no others.
The fifth point wbich is outstanding about
this Bill, and which honourable members should
consider, is tbat the Bill is taken verbatim,
as far as local conditions permit, from the
provisions in the English Divorce Act of
1937, about which I shall have something to
say in a moment.
I next present to you my reasons for introducing this Bill. In March, 1942, I received
a letter from my friend the Hon. Mr.
Maitland, Attorney-General of British Columbia, who had received a letter from one of the
judges of the Supreme Court of the province
expressing the unanimous views of the judges
of that court on this question. Mr. Maitland,
who is now not only Attorney-General, but
also Vice-President for Canada of the Canadian
Bar Association, says in regard to this
measure:
I feel such an amendment is both reasonable
and necessary, and for that reason I am forwarding a copy of this letter to you, and I would
appreciate it if you would advise me what
further I can do to initiate this legislation.
Honourable senators, of course, must make
their own decision, but the opinion of an experienced Attorney-General should assist them.
Mr. Justice Robertson, who next to the
Chief Justice is the senior judge in the
Supreme Court of British Columbia, wrote on
the 4th of March, 1942, a letter, which Mr.
Maitland enclosed to me, as follows:
At a meeting of the judges of the Supreme
Court, held yesterday in Vancouver, I was
asked to lay before you certain facts with a
view, if you thought it advisable to obtain
necessary federal legislation, to permit a married person to apply for a divorce where the
other party has not been heard of for seven
years. Applications are frequently made to
the court by a married person for a declaration
that the other party to the marriage "be presumed dead," the reason being that the applicant desires to remarry. See In re Carlson
(1923) 32 B.C. 24, where an order was made
declaring that the wife of the petitioner was
presumed dead and that he should be allowed
to remarry.
With all due deference to whoever the
judge may have been, every lawyer would
agree that he had no jurisdiction to make the

APRIL 2, 1943

order. The only possible effect it might have
wouid be to make it a littie easier for that
petitioner Vo satisfy the Crown authorities in
case hie were prosecuted for bi gamy.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Is that the Alberta
ceue?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: No; a British Columbia
case.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I understand that
there was a case decided the other way in
Alberta.
Hon. Mir. FARRIS: Yes, that is right.
Ail that Mr. Justice Robertson is seeking
to do is to bring before the authorities the
puzzling predicament wjth which judges are
confronted in regard to this very trying
situation, and to give the, benefit. of their
eiperience and viewpoint as a reason why
Parliament shouid, change the iaw in this
connection. He goes on to say:
In the case of Re Jesse Warren Bail (1923)
33 B.C. 162, an order was given granting leave
to presume death. In that case the petitioner
desired to be at liberty to reniarry.
From time to time some of our judges have

has been the practice in Ontario.-See Re Seli
<1924) 56 O.L.R. 32.
I would point out to honourable members
that I do not think that bas any relation to
the problem at ail. It is true that if a man
is absent and the woman wants probate,
which cornes e.ntirely within the jurisdiction
of the provincial courts, the woman may
apply to the court for a declaration of death,
as Vo such matters as are within provincial
jurisddction; but the order, after being made,
would have noV the slighteet effeet so far as
the valjdity of the marriage is concerned,
if the party who bas disappeared should at
a Inter date reappear on the scene.
The Court of Appeal of Manitoba held that
their courts had no jurisdiction to grant such
a declaration where the petitioner's only reason
for asking it was a wîsh Vo remarry.
1 am a littie surprised that the court based
the decision on the ground that purely dýeclaratory judgmemts without any specific
object in view should not be gra.nted. I
should have thought the obvious answer was,
"If your only reason for making the petition

is a desire to remarry, we have nothing to
do with that, and cannot grant your
application."
The letter continues:
See In re Morgan (1939) 2 W.W.R. 156Pee also an interesting article on this question
in volume 17, The Canadian Bar Review, page
685.
I have that volume here, but it really only
re-suxumarizes the situation as Mr. Justice
Robertson bas stated it, and I wili noV read
it. His letter continues:
This difficulty bas been soived in England by
an amendment to the Divorce Act.
-and hie gives the quotation. This is identical
with our Act except for two things. In
England there is a King's Proctor, an officer
who, if you feel bis existence is justified, is
highly desirable. It is noV the practice in our
provinces Vo have a King's Proctor. But that
does not initerfere with the principle of the
Bill before us. The other thing is that in
England they have provision for an order nisi
for six months--unless good reason is shown
within six months. That is not the usual
custom in Canada, though I arn inclined to
thmnk it is the practice in Ontiirio.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: What is the practice at the
Coast?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: We used Vo have that
procedure, but we have it no longer. IV was
just decided to discontinue it, and now we
do not have it. I have an open mind as Vo
which system is best. However, that is a
collateral matter, and I do not want Vo confuse
the very simple issue of the Bill which 1 am
asking honourable senators Vo consider.
The conclusion of Mr. Justice Robertson,
speaking for the Trial Court Bench-and that
is where ail the grief occurs-is as follows:
We therefore beg to suggest Vo you that steps
ba taken Vohave the Dominion Parliament enact
legisiation along the lines of the English Act
of 1937.
I think I shouid say also that the Law
Society of the city of Vancouver, where the
great bulk of the iawyers of British Columbia
are and -where rnost of the cases in the province
would arise, knew th'at I had this matter up
lasV year, and, in November of 1942, it
appointed a committee Vo confer with me on
the question. In Jaiûuary of this year the
executive of that law society, whieh is a representative executive, passed a unanimous
resolution. I wili not bother Vo read it, but
wili simply state that it endorses the Bill I arn
now sponsoring.
Then, noV long ago, 1 Vook the liberty Vo
write Mr. Conant, Prime Minister of Ontario,
who, as yoli know, has been for a number of

140

SENATE

years Attorney-General of that province. As
the chief law officer of our largest province he
has had a great responsibility and a large
experience in the administration of justice. On
the 27th of this month I received from Mr.
Conant a reply, which I think honourable
members would wish me to read in full. It is
as follows:
Dear Senator Farris,
This will acknowledge your letter of the 22nd
instant enclosing copy of a bill extending the
grounds for divorce. This Bill in the form
submitted is, with necessary modifications,
similar to section 8 of the English Matrimonial
Causes Act. Furthermore, it would if enacted
bring the law with respect to divorce for
desertion in line with the provisions of section
308 (3) (b) of the Criminal Code.
I ask honourable members to keep that
in mind, because I intend to refer to it again.
Desertion as a cause for divorce bas, I am
informed, existed in Sceotland for about 400
years and prevails at the present time in
Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Denmark, France, Germany, The Netherlands,
Norway, Portugal, Rumania, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States (with the exception
of South Carolina and New York).
It seems an anomaly to me that divorce
should be granted for a single act of infidelity
while it is denied at present in this country
when the whole purpose of marriage has
been frustrated by deliberate and permanent
desertion.
The proposed Bill would afford relief principally to the poor people on whom the present
law and grounds bear particularly harshly. A
poor woman deserted by ber husband lacks the
means to discover his whercabouts or to prove
his infidelity. She is in the cruel position of
being neither a wife nor a widow, with the
obvious results.
For the reasons above briefly stated and
others which could be set ont with equal force,
I am of the opinion that the amendment to the
divorce law, as proposed in your Bill, should
be enacted.
Respectfully yours,
G. D. Conant.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN:
Before the
honourable senator goes further. may I ask
him a question?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS:

Certainly.

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: If this Bill became law, what would happen to a husband
or wife who reappeared after having been
divorced because presumed to be dead?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I shall deal with that,
if I may, in the course of my remarks. This
seems to me a matter as to which all the
different points should he dealt with in sequence, and my notes have been arranged
accordingly.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS.

As I have mentioned, and as Mr. Conant
mentioned in his letter, this Bill takes its
form from a section of the English Act of
1937, the Matrimonial Causes Act. I want
to deal with that statute for a few moments.
It was introduced in 1937 by Mr. A. P.
Herbert, M.P., following upon the study made
by a royal commission appointed in 1909,
which made its report three years afterwards,
in 1912. This report, which I have in my
hand. contains a great many contentious
things that as an advocate I should be very
ill-advised even to mention bere, because they
would only sidctrack the discussion and make
for unnecessary controversy; but in regard
to the question we are now dealing with,
the report contains nothing controversial.
The members of the commission included a
long list of very distinguished men and
women. I will mention a few of the nanes.
There was Baron Gorell, the late President
of the Probate and Divorce Division in Great
Britain, who of course, because of the many
years he occupied that position, would have
a wide experience in connection with divorce
problems. Then there were the Archbishop
of York, the Earl of Derby, Lady Frances
Balfour, Sir William
Anson-whom
all
lawyers know as tie author of the work,
"Anson on Contraets"-Sir Rufus Isaacs,
afterwards Chief Justice of England, and many
others, representing all classes and walks of
life in Great Britain.
The commission reported, as I bave said,
in 1912. There were a majority report and
a minority report. The minority report seriously challenged some recommendations of
the majority report, but I call the attention
of honourable senators to what the minority
said, as found at the bottom of page 190 of
this document, on the point we are concerned
with:
We concur in the recommendations of the
majority report with regard to presumption
of death.
So that on this subject the royal commission,
a highly competent and most cosmopolitan
tribunal, which held sittings over the years
I have indicated, was unanimous.
In outlining the features of this Bill I have
of necessity indicated the arguments in favour
of it, but perhaps I might support those
general observations with more detailed
reasons for sponsoring the Bill. In the first
place I want to call the attention of honourable members to the fact, as I understand it,
that the State to-day has not the courage of
its convictions in this matter; that the law
as it now stands on this question is neither
one thing nor the other. I would also point

APRIL 2, 1943
out that in every other province of Canada
the restrictions with«regard to the legal presumption of deatb are gréfater than tbey are
in the province of Quebec. My honourable
and learned friend from De Salaberry (Hon.
Mr. Gouin) was good enougli to give me a
memoe on the Quebec law, a.nd I was in hopes
that lie miglit address the House in this connection; but lie ie flot here to-day.
Let us confine ourselves at the moment
to the other provinces, te which this Bill, if
enacted, would be applicable, In every one of
those provinces one of the parties to a marriage rnay, upon giving satisfactory evidence,
obtain frorn the courts a declaration of death
of the other party to the marriage, so as te
justify probate, or to justify payment of insurance rnoneys, or to satisfy legal- requiremente in other matters witbin purely provincial
jurisdiction. To that extent the provincial
laws recognize what 1 rnay terrn a de facto
divorce as distinguîsbed from a de jure divorce.
The declaration is for ail practical purposes
regarded for the time being-I arn keeping in
mind the question asked by my honourable
friend frorn St. Jean Baptiste (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien)-a de facto divorce.
Then we corne to the Criminal Code of
Canada, section 308 of which makes it an indictable offence for a married person to rnarry
again when t.he other party to the marriage is
living. A person oonvicted, under this section
is hiable to a penalty of seven years' imprisonment. But subsection 3 saye:
No one commits bigamy by going through a
formn cf marriage
(a) if lie or she in good faith and on reasonable grounds believes hie wif e or hier busband
to be dead; or
(b) if hie wife or lier husband lias been
continuahy absent for seven years then hast
past and lie or she je net proved te have knewn
that hie wife or lier liusba2ld was alive at any
time during those seven years.
The present Bill uses almost exacthy these
werds.
Now, I say that proposition is neither fleeli,
fish nor fowl. What does the State say te a
wornan -who for seven years bas not lieard frorn
lier husband, whomn sic believes te be dead?
The State says: "Aithougli bigamy is a serieus
crime and we will punish 'bigamîste, you bave
our permission, se far as the criminal iaw je
cencerned, te marry again." And te clergymen
and authorized Isymen it Baye: "Se far as the
criminal law is concerned, you are permitted
to performi the marriage cerernony in a case
sucli as this."
Let us suppose tliat a wornan cornes under
the first clause of this subsection 3, that je,
that in good faith and on reasonable grounds
she believes hier husband to be dead. Suppose

141

she lias every reasen te believe that lier
busband was on a ship which was sunk in the
Atlantic, and that lie was drowned. WelI, the
proceedinge te have hier busband legally preeurned dead will net be initiated by anyone
but herseif. A wornan wlien acting in good
faith in a matter cf that kind wili net jump
in burriedly and ask fer a declaration. If slie
did proceed witb undue baste, it wouid be a
pretty good indication that she was a person
who, wben unable te get lier way legally,
would net worry about the moral implications
cf getting it otberwise, and ebe certainly would
be eut cf luck in the courts. But let us
assume the ordinary case cf a wernan with
attachient for lier busband, a wornan wbo for
a long time could net believe the news cf bis
death and wbo lived in hope that sornething
would turn up. Sbe would be the hast person
in the world te admit bis deatb. But, in the
normal course cf events, time je a great bealer.
New affiliations take place, and, if she is a
young weman, she rnay meet some man wortby
of bier affections, and rnarry him, in tbe belief
tbat lier husband is dead. Under tbe criminal
law that je permitted to-day. A bappy borne
rnay be establisbed and cbjîdren bor cf tbat
second marriage. At the ceremony tbe clergyman wouldî bave given again the solemn warning: "Wliorn God hafli joined together let ne
man put asunder." But suppose Enocli Arden
cornes back. This rarely bappens, and I bave
an idea that if it should bappen tbe first busband would deern hirnself better off te find bis
wife legalhy and happily rernarried than to be
confronted, as bie would be undier tbe present
law, with the proposition cf declaring that she
had heen living in adultery and that tbe
chiîdren were illegitimate.
Then let us take the otber case, wbere there
is this seven years' presumption cf deatb. This
means that the man lias left hie wife for seven
years. She bas neyer beard from. him during
alI tbat time, bis absence being under sucli
conditions tliat she at no time during the
seven years even knew tbat lie was alive.
Sbe may stili be a young woman. She is told it
je net illegal, and she marries to-day under the
law-this betwixt-and-between kind cf lawand a clergyman performes tbe ceremony. A
comfortable home is establisbed and tbey liave
a f amily. Then the first busband cornes back.
To do what? To destroy a borne that lie lias
no dlaimn on, a home tbat lie deeerted. He
lias absolutely failed to live up te any of bis
marriage obligations. He bas corne back to
put asunder these wliom God bath joined tegether, and to have it dechared that the woman
whorn lie deserted lias been living in aduhtery
and that bier cbildren are net legitimate. It

SENATE

seems to me, honourable senators, that all the
instincts of humanity revolt against such a
condition of things, and I submit that the
experience in England points to the conclusion
that this proposed legislation is necessary and
proper in the provinces I have referred to.
May I say in conclusion that if this Bill
passes this House and goes to another place, I
hope it will be dealt with there. We hear
remarks and read newspaper editorials about
what the Senate does not do. There is one
thing, honourable members, the Senate never
does: it never allows a bill to be buried so that
certain issues may not be faced.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I hope that after the
Bill leaves 'this House the issues will be faced
and there will be a discussion and a decision
on it in another place.
Hon. A. MARCOTTE: Is this Bill to be
referred to one of our standing committees?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: If honourable senators
so wish. There is just one issue involved, the
principle of the Bill, in view of the fact that
after long consideration similar legislation was
enacted in England, and we have the benefit
of England's five-year experience so far as its
practical aspects are concerned. However, if
any honourable senator feels there are details
that might be considered, of course the Bill
should go to a committee.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: The matter is so
important and the reasons for the measure
have been so fully stated by my honourable
friend from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) that I think we should have a little
time to consider the Bill. If I remember
rightly, a couple of years ago a bill was presented to enlarge the grounds for divorce.
To my mind, this is another way of securing
a further ground for dissolution of marriage.
Unless there is particular urgency, I would
ask that the debate be adjourned so that we
may have a chance of examining the Bill.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable members, before the debate is adjourned I desire
to say *a word or two. I think it will be
generally agreed that we have had a very
clear exposition of the Bill frem its sponsor.
Similar legislation has been in force in
England, but, as he has definitely pointed
out, it would 'be a new departure in this
country. I am not able to discuss the nice
legal points involved, in this Bill; I leave
that task to lawyers of repute; but it seems
to me the honourable gentleman has made
out a good case for extension of the causes
for granting divorce in those sections of
Canada where divorce is recognized. I rise
Hon. Mr. FARRIS.

now merely for the purpose of indicating
that certain persons and organizations may
desire to appear before a committee of this
House in order to express their views on this
important matter. I remember some time
ago reading about the tremendous discussion
that took place in England over a long period
of years regarding this, in one sense, very
contentious matter, before agreement was
reached and legislation enacted. I think it
would do no harm to refer this Bill to a
committee, where those interested would
have an opportunity to present their views.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, I rise, not to speak on the motion, but
to recall a bit of history. Three or four
years agoAn Hon. SENATOR: Five years.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:-we had a divorce bill
before us, but we kept it in our committee
so long that it got into a jam in the
Commons. Goodness knows, I am not here
to defend the other House, but I do say
this: Let us face the issue here so that we
can give the other House a reasonable time
to consider the Bill. That is only fair.
While I agree with the principle of the Bill,
others may be opposed. Those persons may
wish to come before a committee of the
Senate and present their views on what they
regard as a very important piece
of
legislation.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I thoroughly agree
with the view that if the Bill is to go to a
committee of our House it ought not to be
there for any length of time. A day might be
fixed on which those who desire to be heard
should be present. I think that a day or two
of work on the part of the committee would do
all that should be necessary in that respect.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: There is a motion
by the honourable senator from Ponteix
(Hon. Mr. Marcotte) to adjourn the debate.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I understand my
honourable friend from Ponteix desires that
the Bill should go to a standing committee.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: The honourable
gentleman from Vancouver South has made
out a very good case, but you will notice that
he has stated the Bill would not apply to
the province of Quebec at all. We have
several lawyer senators from Quebec, but I
do not see any of them here to-day except
the Speaker. It seems to me they should
at least have a chance to speak on the principle of the Bill.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: That can be done best

I have some knowledge of this matter, but
the information furnished me by the solicitors
is as follows:
The churcli bas been in existence for a period
of fifty years under the naine "The Church of
God" in the United States of America. The
central organization of the church is located in
the State of Indiana.
The belief of the adherenits and mnembers is
stated to be similar to the be]ief of the
Baptists.
I hope honourable members wilI not think
that is why I object to the namne.
It is based on the New Testament.
The applicants and proposed members in
Canada are largely Polish and Ukrainian, and
on investigation have proven to be good people.
It is desired to incorporate in order that the
affairs migbt be more properly administered
across Canada.
I would ask honourable members to give this
Bill second reading on the distinct understanding that if in committee some satisfactory
naine cannot be arrived at, that will be the end
of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

THE ROYAL ASSENT
Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators,

will be sent to us immediately, and there will
not be any great delay in dealing with it here.
There then would be an opportunity to have

SENATE

owing to delay in another place the Minister
found it necessary to have section 3 amended
to read as follows:
Notwithstanding the provisions of the Consolidated Revenue and Audit Act, 1931, the
amounts appropriated by this Act may be paid
at any time on or before the thirtieth day of
April, one thousand fine hundred and fortythree, and such payments shall be deemed to
have been made in and be chargeable to the
fiscal year ending the thirty-first day of March,
one thousand nine hundred and forty-three.
The items set out in the sohedule concern
many departmnents of Government, and hionourable members will find an explanation given
opposite each item.
It is flot customary for the Senate to delay
the passing of a bill of this character. Assuming, therefore, that we shaîl follow the usual
proced-ure, 1 have advised the Government
that it will be acceptable to the Senate to have
Royal Assent given to-day, not oniy for this
Bill, but also for the other two financial bills
which reached us from the other flouse some
days ago. If agreeable to honourable senators, Royal Assent will take place at a quarter
to six this afternoon.
I do not think I have anything to add in
regard te the Bill.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: ilonourable seaators,
it is quite customary to have a bill of this
character at this stage of the session. I am
sometimes inclined to think that a good many
people entertain the idea that supplementary
estimates are ail nonsense; that Parliament
sqhould flot be bothered with them. llowever,
as we ahl are aware, it is absolutely impossible
for Ministers and their chief officiaIs to propare their estîmates in such a way as to take
care of ail the ordinary expenditures of the
public service, for the reason that, though the
estimates are very carefully prepared, expenditures that could not be anticipated have to ho
provided for.
Hence we have the supplomentary estimates.

In glancing throughi theso, I find they total
about $2,700,000, and that somne throe or four
estimates take care of the largcr part of that
sum. For instance, I think that under the
Maritime Freiglit Rates Act there is a vote
of somotbing over $700,000, wvhich is in a
sense statutory, as an agreement was rcached
and must be carried out . Again there is the
cost-of-living bonus, which also is statiîtory,
whother granted through Order in Council
or by statute. At any rate, it is a provision
that has been made and must be takon care of.
That accounts for another $700,000. Then
there is a provision for about $100.000 for an
mecrease in the vote for the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police force. I take it that that
also is necessary.
There is an amount
approximating 8100,000 for the Post Office.
Hon. Mr. KING.

Goodness knows, the facilities of the Post
Office must have been extended vory greatly
during the last year. And s0 it goes with
othor services of the Govornment. I can see
no reason why the supplementary estimates as
prosented should flot be passod by this flouse
without aoy îîndue delay.
While on my foot I should like to say just a
word in roforence to another matter which has
arison during the past few months. As everyone know,,, there is an idea abroad that there
is a good deal of waste and extravagance
in the public service. I think those of us who
have had any dopartmental experience at ail
will agroe that somothing of the nature of
extravagance is contioually occurring. Some
months ago the Goveramont, realizing that
soch was the case, appointed Colonel John
Thompson to take care of that, or try to
take care of it. We ail know what happened.
Colonel Thompson is not now on the job, and
I understand that very shortly an inquiry
Nvill be held elsewboro as to why hie is not. 1
do flot iotond to discuss the matter at ah, but
I wish to say that after my exporience. both
provincial and federal, with what is ordinarily
callod the public service, I have the gravest
doubt as to the possibility of a reform being
mado, se, far as the Civil Service is concorned,
by an outside agoncy. I know the Civil Service thoroughly. I was a civil servant myseif
for a good many years, and as a Minister of
the Crown, both in Saskatchewan and horo,
I hîad utany dealings with civil servants. I
know their attitude, their montality, their
rosorvations, their idcas. As I have said, I
doubt vory much whetlier it is possible for any
outside agency appointod by tbe Govornmont
to deal successfully with any condition in the
Service which involvos wasto or extravagance.
The Government's idea of attempting to control anything of that kind is perfectly sound
and propor, but the Govornment must have
confidence in the hoads of the Civil Service,
and get into contact with those hoads and
place the situation squarely and fairly before
them. Ouît of that sbould corne an organizatien within the Service itsolf.
No person cao tell me that there is not
throughout the Civil Service a dosire to avoid
and prevent unnecessary extravagance and
undue wasto. So it socms to me-this is
nieroly a suggestion on my part-that if the
Government dosires to deal effectively with
tbe situation it should. after consulting such
sections or officors of tbe Civil Service as it
doems desirable, set up an organization for
economy within the Service itself, make the
necessary attachments to that organization,
and se thiat it has branches in every cdepartment of the Sexvice. I have no douht

147

APRIL 5,1943
at all that if that is done considerable economies can be effected in that field. 0f course,
the field is smail, the amnount of money involved is not very great, but I arn sure
everyone will agree with me that' in the
present circumstances every dollar saved. is
valuable.
Let me give you a very simple illustration. When I came down here as a Minister,
in the yeair 1917, some person connected with
one of the departîments that I was dealing
with conceived the idea of adding some
furnishings to the room I occupied. I did
The matter
flot know anything about it.
was flot discussed with me in the remotest
sense; I gave no authority to do anyth-ing,
but in my room there were placed certain
furnishings, which I did flot even notice.
In due course the public accounts were
printed, and some very vigilant, enthusiastic
political trouble-digger got busy and in that
department's estimates found an item of $25
for a waste-paper basket. Then there was
a miniature storm, and in the flouse I had
to explain-though not to justify-what
happened. I had nothing to do with ordering
the furnishings, and did not know any had
been ordered; yet $25, or a sum in that
neighbourhood, had been paid for a wastepaper basket for my room. Well, I think
every person within the hearing of my voice
will agree that that was simply gross extravagance of the worst kind, and it should
neyer have occurred.
It seems to me that is but a simple illustration of the character of waste that may
go on. in the Service unless there is a proper
check put upon it. That check can be supplied only by members of the Sdrvice itself.
They have a thousand ways in which to
block any attempt by an outsider to correct
any gross extravagance within the Service and
they will use those ways if any such attempt
is made by an outsider.
As to these estimates now before us, I
know of no reason why there s9hould be any
delay in passing themn. All the money has
been spent. and, so far as I can see, the
votes are all neýcessary for the services for
which they are provided.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Honourable senators, I move that these three orders be taken
together, and that the Bills be now read the
second time.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bills
were severally read the second time.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK:
Honourable
senators, as a layman I want to refer as briefly
as I can to some statements that were made
by a distinguished legal gentleman the other
day when he moved second reading of a Bill
to make it possible for a married person to
obtain a divorce if the other party to the
marriage had disappeared and been unheard
of for seven years. The honourable senator
from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris)
saidHon. Mr. ROBINSON: We are not on that
Bill now.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I am not speaking
on that Bill. I am referring to what he said,
in order to lead up to what I want to say on
the motion for the second reading of the three
Bills now before us.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I should like
to make clear the stage that has been reached
in these proceedings. Hon. Senator Robinson
moved, seconded by Hon. Senator Sinclair, that
these three Bills be considered together and be
now read the second time. These Bills have
been taken together and have been read the
second time. The next stage would be a
motion for third readings.
THIRD

READINGS-DISCUSSION ON DIVORCE
AND ON WORK OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I would move third
readings of the Bills.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable Mr.
Robinson moves, seconded by Hon. Mr.
Sinclair, that these Bills be now read the third
time. Is it your pleasure, honourable senators,
to adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Your Honour, perhaps I am too slow. I tried to get the floor.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The honourable
senator was too quick.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I tried to get the
floor before the Bills were read the second
time, because it is on the motion for second
readings that with propriety I should speak,
but I was not in time.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Go right ahead.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I take it that the
honourable senator has unanimous consent to
speak now.
Hon. Mr. SPEAKER.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The distinguished
legal gentleman from Vancouver South (Hon.
Mr. Farris), last Friday, in support of his
motion for the second reading of the Bill
which he sponsored, said, in part:
And just here, if I am permitted to digress,
having in mind some of the discussion that
occurred the other day,when the honourable senator from Pictou
(Hon. Mr. Tanner) raised certain questions
about divorce-I would say that within the four corners of
the law as it now exists, the court which sits in
this end of the building dealing with divorces
from the province of Quebec is, in my opinion.
one of the most efficient courts in any part of
Canada. I asked a question the other day to
bring that ont, when it was suggested that
jurisdiction might be given to the Exchequer
Court rather than to the courts of Quebec.
In my opinion, the Exchequer Court is the last
place in the world to which that jurisdiction
should go. It is not equipped in any way to
do the work. If the jurisdiction should go
from the Senate, I should prefer that it go to
the courts of Quebec; but I can sece no reason
why it should not remain where it is, with a
court vhich has functioned competently and
efficiently for a great many years.
That, honourable members, I use as the text
for what I, as a layman, want to deal with.
In May last, when I was sitting as a member of the Divorce Committee, before it was
determined that I was too insistent in developing facts, and so should be relieved of my
duties as a member of the committee, we
handled what was known as the Traver case.
It originated down around Drummondville,
Quebec.
The
respondent,
the
husband,
opposed the petition for divorce. I think it
was fortunate that he did, because he brought
out certain information that to me is valuable
in deterinining whether the divorce court
"which sits in this end of the building" is all
that my honourable friend from Vancouver
South holds it to be. We discovered that the
detectives who were engaged in that case
had perjured themselves. There is no question of that, and I do not think my statement will be contradicted. For example, in
their evidence to the committee they both
swore that when they were in a little cottage
lying alongside a lake, where the respondent
was living with a young lady, the niece of
his wife, they, the detectives, turned on the
electrie light. Later it came out in evidence
that there were no electric lights within five
miles of the cottage. It was also disclosed
that those two detectives never had the
door opened to them, but that they had
looked through the window with another kind
of light, and had sized up as best they could,
and to their own satisfaction, the compromising situation to which they testified.

APRIL 5, 1943
Now, honourable senators, I arn only a
layman. and I do not know-w-hat legal gentlemen ini this Chamber probably do knowwhether, if a competent judge bad beard the
case, charges would flot have been preferred
against those detectives for perjury. Nothing
was done bere, tbougb. I ar nfot criticizing
that particularly. However, no action was
taken. But what was the result? On the
25th day of Mardi we gave second and. third
readings to forty-two divorce bills. If you
look at Senate Hansard you will find those
forty-two buis are given about one inch. of
space. No buman being in Canada could tell
what they mean-except, of course, sorneone
who bad actually been connected with framing
up the statement put in Hansard. But Jet
me draw your attention to this fact: one of
those two detectives who gave perjured evidence in the Traver case in May, 1942,
appeared as a witness in fifteen of those
forty-two cases.
With ail due respect to the compliments
paid by the honourable senator from Vancouver South to the Divorce Cornrittee, I
doubt wbether he has ever been presenit when
the committee was functioning and seen what
goes on. I have done that, and I can well
recali this particular detective putting on lis
bat and, with the Bible in bis hand, taking
an oath which, to me d*id flot appear to mean
anything. Maybe I arn unduly preiudiced,
maybe I arn mistaken, maybe I don't know
what I arn talking about, but the fact remains
there was perjured evidence in the Traver
case, and then out of the forty-two cases
paased in this House the other day fifteen
were cases in whîcha this saine detective presented the evidence for securing divorce.
I corne now to another question, which bas
something to do with the procedure in the
Divorce Committee. Canada, as we ail know,
is at war. Canada needs rnoney. Over the
radio, during the last couple of days, we have
been told that in three weeks frorn now our
people will be asked to subscribe one billion,
one hundred million dollars to another war
boan. I have for some time wondered whether
we in this Senate should be as profligate as
we are with the funds that properly belong to
the State. What do I mean by that? As I
recaîl, my honourable fricnd from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Copp) towardis the end of last
session told us that tbe Divorce Committee
had handled some seventy cases during the
session then-about tô close, and that in forty
of them there was a remission of fees. What
did that rernission of fees amount to? It
arnounted to $5,075 of the money that belongs
to the treasury of Canada. And we are
continuing our liberality this session. In the

149

forty-two cases that the Divorce Committee
had dealt with up to the 25th of March, and
in two of the cases that I arn speaking on
now, the petitioners were given donations
totalling $1,430. Personally I do flot believe
ths,t the fee remitted goes to the petitioner,
who may be in bard, luck. I have no way of
confirxning my belief, but, as I say, I doubt
very much whether the petitioner gets the
remitted fee. I have in mind one particular
case heard by the cornmittee last year. But
I desire, before going into that, to place on
record one of the Senate rules. There is moas
on it, and it should be brougbt to our attention. I refer to rule 142:
The Committemeaning the Divorce Committee
--shall examine the notice of application to
Parliament, the petition, the information endorsed upon or appended to the petition, the
evidence of publication of the notice, the evidence of the service of a copy of the notice and

I arn told, in the presence of my distinguished
seat-mate (Hon. Mr. Robinson) here, that

information and boping to do the rigbt tbing,
I should like to know wby. I bave in mind
one particular case wbere I saw a clerk corne
before the committee witb a file of correspondence and beard him read what, it seemed
to me, be thought 'we were entitled to bear,
but not by any means ahl that was on the
file, the result being that in the case of one
dear old lady we cut the fees from $210 to $75,
witbout tbe slightest knowledge of tbe fact
tbat there were tbree grown-up sons, all over
twenty-onc years of age, and that one of
those sons-as I have di.scovered since upon
investigation-was, I sbould judge, far better

to many of the other cases where remission
of fees bas been granted. I ask any legal
gentleman in this House to tell me, would a
remission of fees be grantcd by the courts of
Ontario or by those of any other of tic
provinces where divorce cases are bandled, or
would not an applicant for divorce pay tbe
freigbt? Wby, then, in this Canada of ours,
needing every dollar tiat it can get, should
we make a cut rate bere for tbose wbo want
to, get their marital ties severed?

Donnelly) told the House that he did flot

words, thougb appointed and paid as a senator
of Canada, yet hoe was flot willing to assume
such responsibilities as possibly onsued in investigating to see whiether in these cases the
propor thing was done by the individual and
by Canada as a whole.
Whon I heard my distinguished friend, that
high-class legal gentleman fromn Vancouver
South (Hon. Mn. Farris), make se eloquent
and clean a statement on, the divorce, question,
I decided that thene were some othor phases
to it that, a layman should bring before this
House to ascertain whether we are going to
keep on as we have been doing in the past.
Most of these remissions were for $110, but
four of them were for $160. This means that
instead of a fee of $210 onJy $50 was paidý.
Again 1 say, I do net believe the applicant
for divorce got that reduction. 1 cannot confirn my belief, but stili 1 feel it is Weil
founded. I bolieve that the focs so remitted
went somewheno else, andI that tho applicant
paid the freight, namoly, $210, for comîng
before our committee andI getting the divorce.
Thon thonre were six cases in which theno was
a nomission of $135, which mczant that, the
fee was eut d'own te $75. Most of the remissions amotinted to $110; so ail that was charged
was $100. In other words, last year thintyseven applicants for divorce got, remissions,
and three who could flot sustain thein cases
got bark cvenytbing. just as though thcy had
been fratcrnal or chuncb onganizations that
wcre building up a reputation for something in
their loeality. It seems f0 me, honourable
senators, that somei of these tbings ought to
ho giv en consideration, and that if we cannot
get a divorce court in Quebec or elsewhere
f0 handie thes:e cases, w e should stop this
bus5iness of cutting rates andI making Senate
divorces clîeap.
I would also suggcst f0 the mnembers of the

respect, tlîat thcy seriously coo'ider the fact
that a gentlemnan who camre befone thema in

Hon. G. LACASSE: Honourable membens.
I want te say just one word, and, to put it in
tho form of a question. Apparently this is a
day of atonement for my honounable friend,
and 1 hope ho wvil1 permit me te proceed. I
seldom mix in debates regarding divorce, and
Hon. Mn. MURDOCK.

you know why. I Wonder whether my honourable friend, inasmuch as hie was a member of
the Divorce Committoe for some time, will
be candid and,' fair enough to assume and
acknowledge bis share of responsibility for
the so-called generosity of the Divorce
Committee.
,Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I frankly admit that
in many cases last year I voted for the remissien of fees. I voted for the cutfing dlown te
$75 of the fee for the dear old lady to whomn
I have referned. Why? Because. as I have
stated. I dia net know of ride 142. OtherWise I ýwould not have done se. It was only
during the last few minutes of the hearing of
the case that we get the evidence that there
weno tb.ree grewn-up sons, over twenty-one
years of age, and it was afterwards that 1 got
t he evidence that at least one of them rwas
substantially well enough off te take care of
the dlaims of bis mother.
Hon. W. M. ASELTINE: Honourable senators, in my opinion the honounable senator
froma Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) bas been
veny unfair in bis remarks about the committee. Thoro is no cemmittea of this House that
sits more faithfully than, or does as much bard
work as, the Divorce Committee. Funthormore, the bonourable gentleman bimacîf, wben
be was a memnber of that committee, was one
of these who iusisted on poor persons getting a
reduction in the filiog fee of $210, wbich quito
frequently is neduced to the cost of prinfing
and advertising wle the applicant is oarnng
from $10 te $15 a week and lias no opportunity
of saving enough f0 pay the fuîll foc. The
honounable gentleman knows very well tliat the
average cost te the applicant in an undefendied
divorce case is $555. He knows also that the
Sonate Cominittee-Panliamont. in fact-has no
autbority te deal witli the questfions of costs,
alimony. custody of childnen or anything of that
sont, and that even affer Panliamnent bas passed
a bill dîissolving the marriage thesoe mattens
liave to ho docided by the courts of the provinco. tlue resuît, being tlîat in many cases the
total cost to the applicant runs as higb as
$1.000. Why sîjould not Panliament. or the
Sonate Committee, in the cases of very poor
persons wbo are unable to pay, reduce the focs
and allow such persons f0 re-estaýblisb fbomselves in life in a preper manner?
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Where doos the
$500 come in?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE:
$210.

That inclucbes the

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I nover hoard that
before.

APRIL 5, 1943
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Tbere is the $210
filing fec, and in addition there are the cost
of bringing witnesses bere to give evidence, and
the fees of counsel.
Hon. Mr. COPP: A.nd advertising.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: The Clerk o! the
Committee, bas worked out the average. He
gave me these figures some time ago, and I
tbink lie would lie glad to itemîze tliem.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Ia there a uniform
set of fees for legal services?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Oh, no. Tlie fees
cliarged are biglier in some cases than in
others. I presume a counsel coming from
Montreal would charge by the day. The cost
of getting witnesses would run into hundreda
of dollars. Sometimes it might be less.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: But $500 is about
the average?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Five hundred is
about the average for an undefended case.
0f course, in a defended case it would *be
more; and if the parties then lad to go to the
courts, the case would'ah lie fouglit out again
and the costs miglit run as higli as $2,000.
The lionourable gentleman from Parkdale
referred to the fact that there is no reduotion
o! fees in the courts of the varins provinces.
That is a simple matter to explain. It costs
only about $250 to try a case in the province
of Ontario, or in my own province of Saskatchuewan. In tbirty years of practice at tlie
Bar I have participated in only one divorce
caue in wbicb the cost went up to $30, and
that covered everything, including the getting
of evidence, the costs of the trial and the fees
of counsel, and everything was disposed of,
including the question of costs, tbe custody of
the cliuldren, and alimony. Naturally, wben
the cost -is $250, or $300 at the outside, no
refund can lie made. The only reason refunds
are made liere is that the people are poor.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: In other words,
thie lawyers from Saskatchiewan work miore
clieaply tlian the lawyers down eaut.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: For tliese reasons
I arn in favour of tbe courts handling these
cases; not that we may get out of work. but
because the procedure in the courts is cheaper
and more expeditious. Tliere a case can be
launclied, set down for trial and disposed o!
in a month or two, whereas to, get a divorce
tlirougli Parliament sometimes takes a year or
two.
I repeat that the lionourable gentleman lias
been unfair in bis remarks. I for one have
been giving everything I bave to tbis committee, and I tbink the committee is doing good
work. The members of the coxumittee do not

151

always agree. Sometimes I wo-uld agree with
the honourable senator from Parkdale, and
frequently hie would. not agree with me. But
I arn quite sure the chairman and the other
members of the committee are as faithful as
possible under the circumstances. If occasionally a case goes through as to wbich ail do not
agree, it is the mai ority wbo govern, and
nothing more can be done about it.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask a question? la not one of the important factors in
the cost of divorces from the province of
Quebec the result of a closed sbop among the
legal fraternity in Canada? In short, because.
a Quebec lawyer bas not authority to, practise
in Ontario, hie lias to have a "stoogie" when
the case is heard before the committee.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: No, that is not the
case. It is true that a lawyer wbo is authorized to practise in the province of Quebec
cannot also practise in the province of Ontario
unless hie obtains a licence to do so, or
complies with the rules of the Law Society of
Ontario; but every lawyer in Canada, no
matter from wbat province lie may corne, has
the right to appear hefore, a parliamentary
committee and urge bis case. Tlie reason wby
some of the lawyers do not appear bere, is
that tliey are not famiiar witb our procedure.
They employ Ottawa counsel to appear for
tbem, but tbey tbemselves bave a perfect
riglit to appear.
Hon. L. M. GOUIN: Honourable senators,
may I make just one remark, because of references made again and again to the attitude
of my dear old province of Quebec towards
this matter of divorce? I rise to-day witb
some appreliension, for I realize the imperative necessity for unity at the present time,
and I wisb to, speak as a Canadian and as a
Cliristian in justifying our opinion, wbicli is
not sbared by aIl of you, but wbich I assure
you is absolutely sincere.
We bave inberited from our old Frenchi
law the principle of the indissolubility of
marriage, which is proclaimed by section 185 of
our Civil Code. I know very well that by the
British North America Act t] us Parliament
was given jurisdiction in tlie matter of marniage and divorce, under paragrapli 26 of
section 91 of that Act, and at the saine time
as jurisdiction was given to the provinces in
the matter of the solemnization. of marriage.
Our Civil Code went into force hefore the
proclamation wbich conferred on this country
its present Dominion status, and the article
to which I bave referred is interpreted hy our
courts as admitting the legal validity of tbe
divorce granted hy tlie Dominion of Canada.
But wlien remnarks are made to, the effeet tliat

SENATE
iV would be better for ail provinces to have
divorce courts, we wish to state, with ail due
respect to you, honourable senators, that we
consider the present system. a lesser evil than
would exist if our courts were normally, in
the ordinary course of justice, to be allowed
to grant divorces. If the courts of the province of Quebc were given jurisdiction in the
matter of divorce it would mean that a
petitioner, provided he had the necessary
proof, had the legal right Vo obtain a divorce.
Under the present system divorce is granted
only as what I should eall an extraordinary
remedy, by Parliament, in the exercise of its
discretion.
As you know, honourable senators, we abstain fromn Vaking part in discussions here
concerning divorce cases. Therefore I arn not
at ail familiar with the procedure followed by
the Divorce Committee of the Senate. It
would not be fair for me to criticize this
committee, because, to put it simply, as a
matter of principle I do flot participate in any
way in the decisions rendered 'by the committce, or even in those rendered in this
bonourable House with respect to the committee's reports and bis. In these matters
we are considered as always dissenting-we are,
as it were, perpetuai dissidents--for we believe,
of course, that ruth cannot vary, and that the
principle of the old iawv is the principle which
should stili be followed.
I wish to assure you again, Lonourable
3enators, that it is with the best intentions in
the world that I bav e tricd te ciarify the situation a littie. Professionaliy I wishi to assure
my honourablo colicague froin Parkdale (Hon.
Mr. Murdock) that I hav e a reai passion for
justice, and that I should be willing to make
any sacrifice if 1 could possibly find a fair and
equitabie remedy for a situation which, I
admit aV once, is evidently in certain respects
undesirabie.
lion. Mr. MIJRDOCK: May 1 ask a question? Do you think that the cvidence of a
detective who perjured himsclf last year should
be taken ini fifteen cases this year?
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: I bave noV examined thc
records; so 1 arn not i11 a position Vo answer
that question.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourablo members,
1 rise mereiy to ask a question. In the course

Committee of the Senate Las noV comiplied

As yet we have Lad no rebuttal of that fcom

anybody. There are on that committee a
number of eminent lawyers, and I should like
to have fromn someone a statement with regard
Vo the extent to wbich the rules Lave noV been
complied wiVL, and why.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I present that
point once more? Then I Vhink my seat-mate
(Hon. Mr. Robinson) may Lave a word to say
about it. Last year, when we were near the
close of the session, I Vook particular exception
Vo one divorce case, and intimated that if
rule 142 Lad been compiied with we should
noV have been up against wbat I tbought we
were up against. I was with the chairman of
the committee in the office of the Chief
Clerk of Committees, and the Chief Cierk
dum'bfounded me by saying, "That mile bas
noV been adbered to for Vbirty years."
Hon. Mr. CALDER:

WLsV was the rule?

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Senate mile 142,
wLicb I read into the record a few moments
ago.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:

Ail of it?

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON:
Honoucable senaVers, mule 142 states that the committee shaîl
examine the papers in every divorce case.
This rule bas been in effeet for a great many
years, and the compiaint is tlîat the cernmittee does noV examine in detail aIl the
papers filed before it. WLen tLere is an
application for reluission of fees. the papers
are produced before the committee. We do
noV read over every item in those papers,
but VLe affidavits dealing wiVL the petiVioner's
financial situation are gene over and read
to us, and tLen we decide wLetLer or not
we should recommend a remissien.
TLen,
as a furthec safeguard, when the peVitioner
comes to the stand later on we examine
Lim or Ler pretty carefuily on those affidavits,
Vo find eut just wLat the petitiener's income
is, whethec or net Le or she bas any property,
and se on. In other words, our pnîrpose is
to e e' wbether the reccimmendation we make
as-te remissien is justified.
That procedure is always foiiowed. In one
case Vbi.s yýear we VLought, upen making Vis
furtbec inquiry of the petitioner, that a mislake had been made in our recommendation;
s0 we reduced the amount of the remission,
wbicL meant that the petitiener Lad te pay
more fees than liad at first been decided upon.
I repeat, 50 that it wvili be clear, that every
case is gone into cacefuiiy by the committee.
NoV ooîy are Vbe affidavits read Vo us before
w-e decide in the firsV instance whether or noV
te recommend remission, but a second inquiry
is made by us when the petitioner appears
in person, for w'.e then examine Lim or hem

APRIL 5, 1943
an the affidavits, and try to check upon their
accuracy. The committee has been particularly careful along those lunes.
Reniission of fees has been macle for a
great many years in cases wliere the petitioner
has so littie maney that this course appears
justified. The lionourable senator from
Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) said that ini
one particular case where remission was
granted, one of the petitioners' sono was
worth more money than the honourable
senator is. 1 do flot know how much the
honourable senator is worth, but what he
said as to the son is ta a great extent surmise.
The committee went into that carefully, and
did flot agree with the lionourable senator
froxu Parkdaie. If we made a mistake, it
was hecause of an error in judgment, flot
because we did not gîve this matter ail the
consideration we could. I ar n ot sure that
at the time the com.mittee reaclied its
decision the honourahie senator from, Parkcle did flot agree with it, for lie often wiil
agree with something and afterwarcls disagree.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: He always agreed
about tlie remissian, liecause lie d'id lot want
one iaw for the poor and, another for the
ricli.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: In the Traver case,
I myseif thouglit the dttective 'madle a mistake; but, mind you, it was not proven, by
any manner of means, that lie did, aithougli
it was proven that there was fia electrie-iglit
switeb. We thouglit there were other tbings
surrounding the caseYou knew lie
Hon. Mr. MUI{DOCK:
neyer got into the house.
Hon. Mr. ROiBINSON: We thouglit that
there were surrouncling the case ather things
which warrante,& the recommendation we
macle. Ail the eviclence was taken into consideration by the committee. I miglit say
that the detective in question lias been
before us on numerous occasions, and tliis
was the o>nly case in whicli we were at al
dtubtful witli regard ta his eviclence. So
far as we liave been able to judge, lis
evidence lias been reliabie in ail the otlier
cases. 0f course, we neyer base a recommendatian for divorce on tlie eviclence of
one cletective only. On~e of tlie principiles
we fallow is tliat tlie evidence given by a
detective must be corroborated, in order to
be considered.
The com'mittee is pretty careful in dealing
witli these cases. The witnesses are examinecl
before us, and wlienever tliere is any cloubt
as te tlieir evidence, we question thexu and
try ta get at the trutli. Before making any

-153

recommendation eitlier as te divorce or as
to remission of fees, the committee daes its
best to reacli a proper decision based on the
evidence produced. I do not tliink tliere is
anything in tlie suggestion tliat someone otlier
than tlie petitioner woulcl benefit finaneialiy
because of the remission, of fees. Wlien remission is recommended it is clone openly; so
tlie petitioner knows of it, and I do not see
how lie could be persuacled, to, pay out of remitted- fees anybody wlior lie cees flot liave
te pay.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: How about the
cIosed sliap for iawyers?
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Tliere is nothing
in tbat at ail. Tbe "clased sliap for lawyers"
is only in the provincial courts. Lawyers
from an.ywliere in Canada bave the riglit te
appear before tlie Divorce Committee, and,
as a matter af fact, tlie persan appearing ta

SENATE

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: 1 can answer that
question. The explanation is simply that our
Chief Clerk of Committees bas duties similar
to those of a c]erk of a court, namely, to
receive and examine papers before a case is
set dlown for bearing. H1e examines and checks
ail the papers prior f0 the taking of evidence.
because the committee, under this rule 142, has
delegated to hirn the authority to see ï, if
in advance thaf everything is in order. There
is no divorce rule that I know of thaf bas not
been complied with.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Rule 142 bas flot
been complied with for thirfy years.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: That is not correct.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: The wbole point is,
as explained by the bonourable senator from
West Central Saskatchewan
(Hon. Mr.
Aseltine), that tlie committee bas delegated
to the Chief Clerk, wbo bas bad many years'
experience, the duty of examining ail tbe
papers and of keeping tbe comrnittee posted
as f0 whctber those papers are in order or flot.
Hlon. Mr. CALDER: Tben if is only a
quibble to say that the rule bas flot been
complicd with.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: The file is brougbt
in before the cornmittee at tbe hearing.
Hon. Mr. COPP: In every case.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: At ftle trial of a
case tbe judge neyer examines ail tbe preliminaries. He looks at fthe papers tbaf are
before bim, and that is exacfly as we dýo.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: In the B3ella Wolfe
case rwe were neyer given ftle first intimation
tbaf tbere were tbree grown-up sons.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Wbat dýifference dýoes
that make, so far as tbe divorce is concerned?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: We got tbat information later on, after granting the remission.
Hon. Mr. CiOPP: Tbere 15 no0 legal responsibilify on a son1 f0 provide money to enable bis
moflier f0 petition for a divorce.
Hon. WILLIAM DUFF: Honourable senafors, tbis discussion is not only very inferesfing,
it is also very important.
The lionourable
senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock),
quife properly in bis opinion, lirouglit up fthe
question as f0 certain proceedings in the
Divorce Comrnittee. Not being a member of
thaf committee, and therefore personally nof
knowing what bappened, of course I arn not in
a position to pass iudgment; but in spite of
the fact tbat I arn absolutely opposed f0
divorce, I still fhink that the committee
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

appoinfed by this section of Parliament is
comprised of tbe very best men in this
ChamberSorne Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. DUFE: -and while, of course,
there are no supermen among them, still I
cannot understand wby those gentlemen, witb
tbeir legal and business experience and their
many years in the public life of this counfry,
some of fbemn baving served as long as thirty,
forfy or flffy years, should not be in a position
to render, on tbe wbole, a fair and impartial
judgment on flie cases brougbt before fhem.
But, bonourable senators, I would nof have
risen bad not fthe bonourable senator from De
Salalierry (Hon. Mr. Gouin), in bis desire f0
prove tbat tbe majority of tbe people in bis
native province are opposed f0 divorce, felt
lie sbould stand in bis place and give fthe
racoio wby fliaf is so. I accord him full credit
for voicing bis views on divorce. But in giving
fliose reasons-and I say this in ail kindnessbe appearcd to apologize, as if were, for the
stand bis own province takes, and fo regret
tliaf tlie rest of us could not sec flie question
as be and tbose of bis province s-ec if. Let me
tell my bonouralile fricnd thaf many people
in thie oflier provinces are opposcd f0 divorce
.1îît as strongly as are flic people of bis province. I tbink in saying tliis I amn voicing fthe
sentiments of moat lionourable members present. Thcre arc, of course, cases where perbaps if is .Iusf as well fliaf man and wife
sbould lic scparated. Ncverflicless, we of flic
oflier provinces liclieve in flic solcmnity of
marriage, we regard if as a sacrament, and we
stand lv flic marital tic. Af odd times there
may pcrliaps lic a littie trouble in flie family,
but wben flic morning breaks, the clouds dis.
perse and the sun shines forth, fliose disagreements pass away. So I say f0 my bonourable
friend: do not gef tlie idea fliaf we in Nova
Scotia, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, Ontario, Maniftolia, and flic oflier provinces to flic wcsf are nof as sincere in our
reverence for flic marriage vows as any of our
fricnds in Quelic.
Wc lielieve in mainfaining marital relations. The only reason for a
divorce court in this Parliament is thaf fbe
provincial aufliorities in Quelic do nof wanf
fo give their courts flie necessary jurisdiction.
I amrn of criticizing fhem for their refusaI f0
recognize divorce; indeed, under flic British
Northi America Acf fliey are probably wifhin
their legal riglifs.
I arn convinced fliat
I arn well advised when I say fliaf flic greaf
mai ority of flic people of flic oflier provinces
are jusf as mucli opposed f0 divorce, and have
as great a reverence for flie marriage fie, as
the people in flic province from wbich my
honourable friend cornes.

APRIL 5, 1943
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators, I
do neot wish to prolong this discussion, nor do
I intend to defend the committee. I do nlot
think it needs any defence.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. KING: I have been a meinher of
the committee for many years. I know no0
body of men appointed by Parliament or by
any other authority who have devoted themselves more seriously to the carrying out of
their duties. My honourable friend from
Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) fisagrees with
certain findings of the Divorce Commaittee, and
I see no0 reason why he or any other senator
should not bring bis views to the notice of this
House, but I think he is rather unfair and
stands on dangerous ground when he undertakes to say that his judgment on divorce
cases is superior to that of the mai ority of the
committee. I~n these circumstances I should
hesitate, as I think wauld most other honourable members, to take such a stand.
Rule 142, to which the honourable gentleman froma Parkdale referred, is intended to
guide the committee, and the objection which
he based on it is, as my honourable friend
from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder) said, a
quibble. In any department of Government
the Deputy Minister from day to day
assembles the facts bearing on any case,
clarifies them, and submits a sumamary ta bis
Minister. That is the deputy's duty. Similarly, as my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) said a minute or two aga, petitions
are received in our courts and examined by a
clerk. So with our Divorce Committee: the
Clerk receives petitions, examines them, and
advises the committee if they are not in order.
Such is the purpose of mIle 142. Certainly the
honourable gentleman from Parkdale should
not seek to cast doubt on the work of the
committee an the ground that it was not
conforming to the mules as laid down by the
Senate. From my experience as a member of
the committee I am convinced that the rules
have always been complied with, and that the
work has been dane with great care and good
judgment.
On the question of divorce itself, as we ahl
know, a large body of the population in one
province and a considerable number of our
citizens scattered throughaut the ailier provinces are opposed to divorce. Undoubtedly,
in the one province the people through'their

modern conditions it bas been f ound necessary
to provide some means whereby h*usband or
wife may be released from conditions that none
of us would like ta endure. Fortunately, the
Fathers of Confederatian placed upon the
Parliament of Canada the responsibility of
dealing with applications for divorce. I arn
sorry ta say that under present-day conditions
these applications have incmeased ta a deplarable extent, and it lias been found necessary ta establish divorce courts in mast of
the provinces. Personally, I wauld nat force
divorce jurisdiction an any province, but surely
it is our duty ta provide proper judicial
facilities far those seeking dissolution of marnage. Persans domiciled in Quebec wha desire
divorce may apply ta the Divorce Cammittee
of the Senate, the mnembers of which, I think
it will be generally adrmitted, deal fairly with
aIl applications caming before them.

PRESUMPTION OF DEATH AND DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING NEGATIVED

The Senate resumed from Monday, April 5,
the adjourned debate on the motion for the
second reading of Bill W2, an Act to enable a
married person in certain circumstances to
apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for
a declaration that the other party to the
marriage be presumed dead and for the dissolution of marriage.

APRIL 13, 1943
Hon. A. MARCOTTE: Honourable senators, before beginning the discussion of this
Bill, may I say how sorry I am to learn that
the honourable senator who presented it is
absent from his place, owing to a slight sickness. I hope he will recover soon and be with
us before the closing of the debate on this
measure, which he so ably presented.
At the outset of his address on this Bill, the
honourable senator frorn Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris) mentioned that it was a
good thing that no chamber dealing with
public matters considers and scrutinizes questions of this kind more carefully than does the
Senate. This being true, I did not hesitate the
other day to move the adjournment of the
debate, so that more time might be devoted
to the study of the proposed measure, which
is so important that the honourable senator
himself said it was with some hesitation he
approached the discussion of it, because he
knew that some senators are opposed to
divorce.
This opposition I do not have to explain at
great length, because the reasons for it are
very well known. We are at war at the present
time to secure, among other liberties, freedom
of thought and freedom of worship; so, if it is
right and proper for people who approve of
divorce to try to create new grounds for
securing the dissolution of marriage, it is just
as right and proper for some of us to oppose
such measures on religious grounds, even if
that should be our only reason.
But there are some features of this Bill
that I disapprove for other reasons. I shall
discuss them very briefly, as I know that
some other honourable senators are to speak,
and no doubt they will go more deeply into
the matter than I.
I will first refer to the statement that this
Bill would not affect the province of Quebec.
I do not agree with that, but I wish to thank
the honourable senator for his statement that
he, coming from the province of British
Columbia, would not for one moment presume
to move that a bill of this kind should apply
to the province of Quebec, and that if ever
any modification is made along that line it
should originate among the representatives of
that province. This is very considerate, and
the honourable senator's attitude is no surprise
to me.
But when I disagree with that phase of the
Bill, it is because it is unfair to those people
of the province of Quebec who believe in their
right to obtain dissolution of marriage. They
would be placedi on a very unequal footing,
as they would be deprived of a ground for
divorce which would exist for people of other
provinces. True, there is no machinery pro-

157

vided in the province of Quebec for the
securing of divorce in its courts, but there is
machinery provided whereby its inhabitants
may secure divorce, and it is right here in our
Parliament. If some other provinces are
granted new grounds for divorce, then this
Parliament should have the same privileges;
and the proposed granting of that inequality
of rights makes it imperative upon us, in my
opinion, to oppose this measure. I do not
approve of divorce, but neither do I approve
of inequality of rights in matters of that kind.
While on this phase of the discussion, let me
say that I agree with the honourable senator
from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) that
the suggestion to give the Exchequer Court
jurisdiction to deal with divorces is not a
good one. That court was created for entirely
different purposes, more especially to adjudicate on matters in dispute between the Crown
and citizens of our country; and obviously
divorces would, not come under that heading.
The proper courts would be the ones which
are now dealing with annulment of marriages,
separation of bed and board, alimony, and care
of children. But it is up to the province of
Quebee to decide on that point, and the
Senate would be ill advised to impose on the
people of Quebec legislation which they do not
desire.
In the meantime, our Divorce Committee
here has been doing very well. There are possibilities of error in the recommendations
made, since the members of the committee are
human and subject to error. Honourable
members must consider that most of the cases
are ex parte and undefended, and you should
be satisfied, with the committee's records. If
I am not mistaken, the greatest reason for
wanting a change of court is that Parliament
stops at the dissolution of marriage and does
not adjudicate any further.
If sometimes we receive a batch of reports
from the committee, it is on account of our
adjournments. The committee, at great inconvenience to its members, works during some
intervals when the Senate is adjourned, and
consequently we afterwards receive in a day
the results of is sittings, extending over
several weeks.
As to the criticism, made elsewhere, that the
Senate wants to get rid of even this work, that
is ridiculous. The Senate has the courage to
face issues, disdains to dodge them, and has
more pity than scorn for its accusers.
Let us study the Bill for a few moments.
The first section reads:
Any married person who alleges that reasonable grounds exist for supposing that the other
party to the marriage is dead, may, in any one
of those provinces of Canada in whieh there is
a court having jurisdiction to grant a divorce

158

SENATE

a vinculo matrimonii, present a petition to such
court to have it presumed that the other party
is dead and to have the marriage dissolved, and
the court, if satisfied that such reasonable
grounds exist, may make a decree of presumption of death and of dissolution of the marriage.
Honourable members will notice that there is
no time limit set within which an application
may be made. The reasonable grounds for the
presumption of death may be invoked in a
few months or a few years.
We are at war. Casualties of all kinds are
happening in different ways. Men disappear
in circumstances where it is impossible to know
of their fate. It is not only in moving picturcs and fiction books that in the past we
have heard of the unexpected return of people
who had disappeared. True, the courts would
be diligent in getting proper evidence. But
we know of the hasty marriages taking place
in these exciting days. The emotions of a
few moments vanish rapidly; reason prevails
and regrets are born: new dreams come. We
have the records left by the last war on the
same grounds, and I venture to say that the
courts would be pestered with petitions of the
kind provided for under the first clause of
this Bill, if it became law.
Subsection 2 says:
In any such proceedings the fact that for a
period of seven years or upwards the other
party ta the marriage bas been continually
absent from the petitioner, and the petitioner
bas no reason to- believe that the other party
bas been living within that time, shall be
evidence that bo or she is dead until the
contrary is proved.
Note the words " until the contrary is
proved." What will happen if it is proved?
Another legal marriage will have taken place,
and the first husband will be deprived of his
legal wife.
Evidence brought under subsection 2 would
be prima facie evidence of the presumed
death. In the first section you have the word
" may," but in subsection 2 you have the
word "shall," and we know what the difference is.
I will not deal with the difference between
the effects of the presumption of death in the
different provinces. It is not necessary for
my purpose. I will merely say that section 108
of the Civil Code of the province of Quebec
specifically states that presumption of death of
one of the parties to a marriage shall not be
a ground for the other party to have the right
to remarry without producing proof of that
death. I prefer to leave these points to our
legal friends from the province of Quebec
who are members of this House.
But the letter of Hon. Mr. Conant and the
explanations given by the honourable senator
Hon Mr. MARCOTTE.

fron Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) indicate very clearly, so far as I am able to judge,
the real purpose of this Bill: to declare
desertion as a ground for divorce. As I have
stated before, I am opposed to divorce, and
therefore I am opposed to any new grounds
on which to base dissolution of marriage.
It is not necessary for me to give any
further reasons on the point. I Would merely
add that it is not always desertion which
causes married people to live apart: there are
and may be other reasons, such as domestic
disagreements, separation agreements and so
forth. I know there are a number of cases in
which unhappiness is brought about by desertion, but it is one of those misfortunes which
have to be borne with courage and fortitude.
In making a comparison between the wording of this Bill and of subsection 3 of section
308 of the Criminal Code, the honourable
senator from Vancouver South said:
The State says: "Although bigamy is a serious
crime and we will punish bigamists, you have
our permission, so far as the criminal law is
concerned, to marry again." And to clergymen
and authorized laymen it says: "So far as the
criminal law is concerned, yau are permitted
to perform the marriage ceremony in a case
such as this."
I beg to differ. The Criminal Code does
not give permission to either party to remarry
in the circumstances; it says in effect:
"Although you are not permitted to remarry,
you will not be punished if you do so in good
faith." There is a big difference between the
two propositions. The presont Bill uses the
same words, but the effect would be vastly
different.
I would not presume to give honourable
senators a lecture on marriage and divorce.
on the blessings of the one and the evils of
the other. History has taught us that woman
owes to Christianity the uplift of her status
as a member of society. To some of us
marriage is a sacrament; but to all of us
it is the most solemn of contracts.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: The family is the
foundation, the essence of society. Marriage
makes the family stable and permanent. It is
its formula, its conception, its binding tie.
If you break that tie, you disunite the fainily,
you disperse its members, you weaken and
destroy the foundation of society. As a
general rule, in this Christian country marriage
is highly respected by the great majority of
our people.
In Canada the percentage of divorces to the
num-ber of marriages is still smalî, but it is
inereasing at a very alarming rate since some
of the provinces acquired jurisdiction to dissolve marriages. From 1931 to 1940 divorces

APRIL 13, 1943

have increased 239 per cent. For instance,
take the three provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba: in 1919, there were
three divorces granted by our Parliament, but
as soon as the courts of these provinces began
to deal with divorces the number increased to
125 in 1919, 175 in 1920, 270 in 1921, until in
1940 the total was 605.
In 1930 jurisdiction was given the Supreme
Court of Ontario to deal with divorce. What
was the result? In 1930, Parliament had
approved of 204 applications for divorce from
Ontario. In 1932, under the new jurisdiction,
the number of divorces increased to 343, and
in 1940 to 916. These figures are taken from
the Canada Year Book of 1940.
I need not mention the other provinces.
These figures are sufficient to show the danger
of opening the door somewhat wider by creating new grounds to secure dissolution of
marriage. So let us be careful in applying this
dangerous remedy.
In citing the hypothetical case of the return
of a long-absent husband, the honourable
senator from Vancouver South said:
But suppose Enoch Arden comes back. This
rarely happens, and I have an idea that when
it does happen the first husband would deem
himself better off to find his wife legally and
happily married than to be confronted, as he
would be under the present law, with the
proposition of declaring that she had been living
in adultery and that the children were
illegitimate.
I disagree with the statement that the
woman, having gone through a legal ceremony
of marriage, would be living in adultery and
her children would be illegitimate. I know
there are provisions covering these cases, more
particularly in the province of Quebec, and
this statement is not in accordance with the
provisions of the Civil Code. There is such
a thing as "le mariage putatif."
Article 163 of the Civil Code of Quebec
reads:
A marriage, although declared null, produces
civil effects, as well with regard to the husband
-and wife as with regard to the children, if
contracted in good faith.
And article 164 is in these words:
If good faith exist on the part of one of
the parties only, the marriage produces civil
effects in favour of such party alone and in
favour of the children issue of the marriage.
To-day millions of our men are ready, in
this terrible war, to make the supreme sacrifice,
to defend our civilization, our way of life, our
society.
Honourable members must have
noticed that one of the first gestures of our
enemies to create their so-called new mode of
living is to make a mockery of marriage, of
this solemn way of creating families, of forming society. They are seeking to revive the

159

practices of pagan times, when women were
treated as just human cattle. We Christians
cannot countenance such a descent to barbarism-not even by gesture.
Those who believe in divorce should regard
it as a kind of special remedy to be invoked
only in exceptional cases of domestic distress.
And we should be very careful so to apply
this remedy that it may not become a dangerous drug. In my humble opinion, measures
like the present Bill are dangerous because
they enlarge the grounds for dissolution of
marriage.
For these reasons, honourable senators, I
shall vote against the Bill.
Hon. E. BEAUREGARD: My first word
will be of thanks to honourable senators for
the courtesy they have extended to their
Quebec colleagues in adjourning to the present
sitting the debate on the motion for second
reading of this Bill. But before taking advantage of your courtesy, I hasten to confess that
owing to the importance of this piece of legislation I feel that I am without a good excuse
for not having been present when it was
introduced.
However, I have read carefully what has so
far been said in this debate, and therefore I
am fully aware that the Bill is limited to
provinces now having jurisdiction to grant
divorce a vinculo matrimonii; which means
that it would not apply to Quebec nor to
Prince Edward Island. But, accepting this
reservation, I would remind honourable members that amendments to the law governing
divorce or procedure in divorce are matters of
no small concern to those responsible for public
legislation in this country.
On many topies we take pleasure in stating
that they are dealt with irrespective of language, race or creed. For obvious reasons,
divorce has been, and will remain, an exception of paramount importance to this rule.
I take it that. on account of my dual capacity
as a Catholic and as a Quebec representative,
honourable members are in no doubt as to my
attitude towards the principle of this Bill.
Though I cannot agree with the majority of
this House on the fundamental principle of
divorce, I have been asking myself if this Bill
could not be amended in such a way as to
achieve its purpose and yet not be objectionable to Catholic elements, who after all represent one-third or more of the population of
-

Canada.

The Bill under consideration proposes that
any court having divorce jurisdiction may, on
the petition of one of the parties to the marriage, decree two things: 1, presumption of
death; 2, dissolution of the marriage. Presump-

SENATE
tions, as everybody knows, are either established by law or based on facts, and these
facts are left to the discretion and judgment
of the court.
If a petition is granted by final judgment on
evidence based on presumption, it becomes
res judicata-a presumption juris et de jure;
that is, a presumption that cannot be contradicted. In other words, as soon as the
evidence of the petitioner, based on presumption of death of his or her consort, bas been
confirmed by final judgment of a competent
court, there is no longer a mere presumption of
death. We are now facing a judicial fact, that
is, the death of one consort, proven for all
legal purposes. It occurs to me that there
is hardly any jurisdiction for the court to issue
a decree operating as a dissolution of marriage
between the petitioner and his legally dead
consort.
With all due deference to the honourable
senator from Vancouver South, I bave come
to this view after reading his comments on the
case of Carlson, (1923) 32 B.C. 24, which was
referred to by Mr. Justice Robertson. In this
case, it will be remembered, we were told that
an order was made declaring that the wife of
the petitioner shall be presumed dead and that
he shall be allowed to remarry. If I, in turn,
may comment on the comments of the honourable senator from Vancouver South, I would
say that it appears to me that his main
objection to the judgment is based on the
opinion, not that it is not a sensible judgment,
but that the judgment was not rendered according to the law. This, I admit, is a good
ground for criticism.
For the purpose of discussion let us consider that judgment as if rendered according
to law. What does it amount to? To no
more and no less than a regular certificate of
death of the absentee. Thus it serves the
main purpose of this Bill, which is to give the
petitioner the status of an unmarried person,
and, as such, the right to remarry.
I can see that a decree of divorce a vinculo
matrimonii between the petitioner and his
judicially dead consort has been resorted to
as a measure of protection against the always
possible return of the missing consort, who in
the absence of a decree of divorce may claim
the benefits of his undissolved marriage, with
all that it means in the event of a second
marriage.
On the other hand, we are no better off
socially with the situation which this Bill is
likely to create in such circumstances. Let us
say that the absentee returns after the petitioner bas remarried subsequently to the
granting of a decree of divorce. He finds
that during his absence the law bas broken up
Hon. Mr. BEAUREGARD.

his home and his family life. The war, which
bas now entered into its fourth year, will no
doubt increase the number of absentees in
the legal sense of the word. What about those
unfortunate soldiers who, on the faith of an
inaccurate or incomplete report as to their last
whereabouts, will find that a new law bas disposed of all that was dear to them? We cannot
charge them with desertion. Desertion in itself
implies an intention on the part of the consort
to forgo his marital obligations, which mere
absence does not imply in se. It appears to
me that a decree of divorce, within the limited
scope of this Bill, affords protection only
in the case of the return of the absentee after
the remarriage of his consort, and that even
in such a case, especially after four years of
an unfinislied war, this protection is liable to
work against the returned soldier.
The danger of the possible return of the
absentee would no doubt act as a deterrent to
the petitioner. It would inject into bis mind
a dose of prudence sufficient to prevent him
from lightly contracting anotber union. Such
a possibility would also serve as warning to
the court to ponder the evidence most carefully, and would tend to prevent laxity on
the part of both the petitioner and the judge.
Laxity by both or by either of them might
easily alter this new ground for divorce and,
in practice, turn the purported ground of presumed death. into the large and dangerous
ground of mere absence of one of the consorts.
Everyane knows that wherever mere absence
is a cause for divorce it lends itself most
readily to collusion.
These are some of the reasons arising from
the wording of the Bill, and showing why, to
my mind at least, it would be preferable to
amend the law in such a way that judgments
similar to the one rendered in the Carlson case
could legally give the relief asked for without
adding new grounds for divorce.
It cannot bc ignored that divorce bas been
most disastrous in the United States, where
each concession bas only led to further concessions. Divorce is law in the forty-seven
states. Causes for divorce vary greatly from
one state to another. In all of them but
South Carolina the primary cause for divorce
is adultery. Most of the states allow divorce
for mere absence for five years or more.
Desertion is a universally stated cause for
divorce or separation. A number of states grant
divorce for desertion for one, two or three
years, and so forth. The social damage resulting from the excessive kindness of the legislators in the granting of new grounds for
divorce may be judged from these estimates
of the United States Bureau of Census for the
year 1940. I have been unable to get the

APRIL 13, 1943
figures for the last two years. That source
gives the following numbers of marriages and
divorces recorded for each of the years
mentioned:
Number of
Number of
Year
marriages
divorces
1890............
542,307
33,461
1900............
685,284
55,751
1910............
948,166
83,045
1920............
1,274,476
170,505
1930 ............
1,126,856
191,591
1940............
1,565,000
264,000
From this table we glean the fact that in
1890 there was 1 divorce for every 16 marriages, whereas in 1940 there was recorded
1 divorce for 5-9 marriages, an increase of
approximately 275 per cent in fifty years.
These figures are appalling, and fully justify
the momentous statement which may be found
in the pastoral letter issued by the archbishops and bishops of the United States after
their meeting at the Catholic University of
America, in September, 1919, namely:
We consider the growth of the divorce evil
an evidence of moral decay and a present danger
to the best elements in our American life. In
its causes and their revelation by process of
law, in its results for those who are immediately
concerned, and its suggestion to the minds of
the entire community, divorce is our national
scandal.
And in this connection I may cite a few
lines from an authority in sociology, F. W.
Forster.
(Translation) : The family is the centre of all
human preparation for social life, that is, all
preparation for responsibility, sympathy, selfcontrol, mutual tolerance, and reciprocal education. And the family holds this central place
solely because it lasts for a lifetime and is indissoluble, and because, thanks to this permanence,
community of life in the family becomes deeper,
more stable, better adapted than any other to
relations among men. It can be said that monogamic marriage is the conscience of all human
social life.
I do not intend to reopen the debate on
the merits and the demerits of divorce, nor to
review even summarily the pros and cons of
this paramount question; but in order to
recall once more that the province of Quebec
at large and the Roman Catholics are not the
only adamantine opponents of divorce and
divorce-facilitating procedure, may I be allowed to cite the words of that great American
Theodore Roosevelt, who declared:
Easy divorce is a bane to any nation. It is
a curse to society and a menace to the home,
an incitement to married unhappiness, an evil
thing for men and a still more evil thing for
women.

soluble union, for better, for worse, of one man
with one woman, to the exclusion of all others
on either side, and calls on all Christian people
to maintain and bear witness to this standard.
Official pronouncements of the General
Synod of the Church of England, and Social
Service of the same Church, are in the same
vein.
The legislation of Great Britain has often
paved the way in the matter of divorce, but
during the last months of 1935 and the first
months of 1936, when divorce raised a question
of national interest, it received from parliamentarians, and newspapermen as well, the
most severe condemnation that I know of in
moder times. The majority report of the
British royal commission was made possible
by reason of the differences of opinion
amongst the Christian forces, the Roman
Catholic Church standing for indissolubility,
the Church of England recognizing divorce for
adultery only, but denying the possibility of
remarriage, and the other Protestant churches
generally recognizing this one ground of divorce
and solemnizing remarriage, the Methodist
Church limiting this by refusing marriage to
the guilty party to a divorce. The minority
report draws attention to the fact that, while
there may have been difference of opinion
among Christian scholars on exegetical points,
" all are agreed that Christ intended to proclaim the great principle that marriage ought
to be indissoluble."
There you have the consensus of Christian
humanity on divorce and grounds of divorce.
I fail to see that absence, even coupled with
presumption of death of one of the consorts,
has been accepted as a ground for divorce by
any of the highest social authorities in the
world. When I oppose the principle of this
Bill I stand in good company.
On Sunday last a woman of Great Britain,
whom I beg permission to identify only as the
first lady of the land, made an appeal over the
radio to women of the Empire for a revival of
religion in the home. Those who were net
fortunate enough te listen to her address have,
no doubt, read the text of it in M.onday's
papers. It is a most inspiring appeal to the
lonesome consorts of the war absentees. The
closing words are as follows:
I feel that in all the thinking and planning
which we are doing for the welfare of our
country and the Empire, yes, and concern for
other countries, too, we women as homemakers
have a great part to play; and, speaking as I
do to-night from my dearly-beloved home, I
must say that I keenly look forward to a great
rebuilding of family life as soon as the war ends.
I would like to add with my fullest conviction
that it is on the strength of our spiritual life
that the right rebuilding of our national life
depends.

EEVISED
EDITION

SENATE
I wish every honourable member would have
that inspiring appeal and those closing words
in mind when he comes to consider the propriety of relaxing the marriage bond.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon. A. B. COPP: Honourable senators,
the promoter of the Bill, the honourable member from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris),
is unavoidably absent, and lie has asked me
te carry on and sponsor the Bill if the Senate
is willing to accept it as be explained it to
us the other day. It would be presumption
on my part to attempt to add to or improve
any argument the honourable senator from
Vancouver South made wben be laid the Bill
before this Chamber and, explained its contents. We all realize, of course, that there is
always a difference of opinion whenever the
question of divorce is raised in Canada; but

the honourable gentleman took particular care
to impress upon the members of this Chamber
that Pe did not for one moment presume to
impose his own particular ideas on any part
of Canada which had not a divorce court
competrent to try divorce cases. The Bill was
to apply only in those provinces which now
have courts competent to deal with divorce.
My Ponourable friend across the way (Hon.
Mr. Marcotte), as well as my honourable
friend behind me (Hon. Mr. Beauregard), has
made a strong appeal with respect to the
religions side of this matter. Well, I am no
fonder of supporting divorce than any other
honourable member of this House, and do so
only upon proper evidence being adduced and
for the purpose of safeguarding the people in
general in the provinces of Canada. Under the
law seven of the provinces have courts competent to try divorce cases. After a law is
passed it is necessary te appoint men to
administer it, and for this purpose judges are
selected from among the members of the legal
fraternity of our provinces. In seven of the
provinces such men have been appointed, and
they are competent to hear and decide upon
divorce applications presented to them. They
may make mistakes, but it is their responsibility
to discharge the duty we have placed upon
them. If this Bill were to pass, applications for
divorce would go before these judges, and they
would consider the evidence. They do net jump
at conclusions, and the Bill would not make
divorce any casier. If, in their opinion, evidence
before them was sufficient to justify a presumption of death, they would so decide, and
their decision would give them the power to
grant a dissolution of marriage.
My honourable friend who introduced this
Bill (Hon. Mr. Farris), and. I think, my
honourable friend behind (Hon. Mr. BeauHon. Mr. BEAUREGARD.

regard), referred to the roya:l commission
appointed in England some years ago-I think,
as far back as 1909. Out of that commission
there came a majority and a minority report.
It must be borne in mind, however, that the
minority report particularly excluded the
features dealt with in this Bill, and was in
favour of making a presumption of death and
of granting a dissolution of marriage in such
a case.
In 1938 this House passed a Bill known as
an Act respecting divorce and matrimonial
causes. Honourable members who were here
at that time will remember it. It was discussed
and debated in this House, was referred to
committee, where some amendments were
made, and was finally passed here, but when it
went to the Commons it was defeated. That
proposed legislation contained the sarne provision as is embodied in this measure, and
neither in this House nor in the Commons was
there one word of objection to that particular
portion of the Bill.
Yeu will remember the instance my honourable friend gave of a man who was aboard a
vessel reported lest at sea, and from whom no
word bad been received for a consideraýble
length of time. In that case, in seven of the
provinces, the wife of such a man could apply
to a court of competent jurisdiction and place
before it evidence which, if deemed sufficient,
would warrant the presumption that the husband was dead. The judge could presume the
man's death and dissolve the marriage.
A similar illustration can be given in the
case of an aeroplane accident. If a married
man or woman was a passenger on an aeroplane
which did not arrive at its destination, and
there was no word of any of the passengers,
an application could afterwards be made under
this Bill by the wife or husband of such a
person.
Passing of this Bill would overcome a difficulty that arises in certain cases under the
present law. A man has net heard from his wife
for seven years or more, let us say, and, presuming ber to be dead, he gets married to somebody
else, in good faith, and is raising a family.
Afterwards the first wife comes back. Under
the present law she could, if she wished,
destroy that second marriage. The same thing
would of course be truc if a man who had disappeared returned some years later, after
his wife had, in good faith, remarried: he could
destroy the woman's happiness. But under this
Bill a judge of a court of competent jurisdiction, in any one of seven provinces, could dissolve the first marriage, upon the application
of the man or woman who produced reasonable evidence for presurning the death of the
other party to that marriage. Surely if a man

APRIL 13, 1943

deserts his wife for five, six, seven or more
years, we need not make it easy for him, if he
comes back, to destroy a home that has been
established in good faith.
In a general way, these are the considerations that appeal to me. These are the considerations that were very well put on the record
the other day by my honourable friend from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris). I have
not the slightest fault to find with any honourable members who oppose the Bill on religious
grounds. But I do say that in those provinces
where we have a court of competent jurisdiction for divorce, it is felt that the provisions
of this Bill are necessary to meet certain situations that arise. That is why the Bill is
brought forward. The other day my honourable friend from Vancouver South placed on
Hansard extracts from the Attorney-General
of British Columbia and a judge of that
province, in support of such a bill as this. He
also placed on Hansard a letter from Mr.
Conant, who is both Prime Minister and
Attorney-General
of Ontario, the largest
province in Canada, supporting this very
measure. Since then my honourable friend has
received a letter from the Attorney-General of
Saskatchewan, who says this:
Dear Senator Farris:
I acknowledge receipt of your favour of the
22nd instant, enclosing a proposed Bill relative
to the dissolution of marriage upon presumption
of death.
I have perused this Bill and believe it is in
the best interests of all parties that such legislation should be passed. It is a problem that
has come to our attention a good many times,
but one over which the province has no jurisdiction. I would like to see the legislation
passed by the Parliament of Canada.
With kind personal regards, I am
Yours truly,
J. W. Estey.
So we have the Attorneys-General of British
Columbia, Saskatchewan and Ontario supporting this measure. Besides, there is a letter
from the Attorney-General of Prince Edward
Island, expressing similar views.
These considerations do appeal to me, and
I believe ,they will appeal to the majority of
honourable members of this House, as reasons
for believing that this Bill would be in the
best interests of all concerned and of the
country. It would be the means of settling a
matter that has been disturbing the minds of
certain people in Canada for a number of
years. I hope the Bill will pass and become
law.

Bill U2, an Act respecting the Canada
North-West Land Company Limited.-Hon.
Mr. Hayden.
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. DONNELLY presented, and
moved concurrence in, the report of the
Standing Committee on Banking and Consmerce on Bill V2, an Act to incorporate the
Ukrainian Fraternal Society of Canada.
He said: I may say that the amendments
made by the conmittee were made with the
consent of the promoters of the Bill, and meet
with the approval of the Superintendent of
Insurance and the Law Clerk of the Senate.
The motion was agreed to.
THIRD READING

Hon. A. L. B3EAUBIEN moved the third
reading of Bill V2.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.
WHEAT ACRE AGE REDUCTION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. H. RING moved the second reading
of Bill 66, an Act to amend the Wheat
Acreage Reduction Act, 1942.
He said: Honourable senators, I think we
are all thoroughly familiar with this measure,
and I will be brief in explaining it. In 1941
Parliament passed an Act permitting the
Government to arrange by regulation for taking iand ont of wheat production. The acreage
used in wheat production in the years 1939
and 1940 was taken as a basis. Under the
regulations the Government paiýd $4 for every
acre taken out of wheat production and put
to summer-fallow or sown to rye or grasses,
and $2 for every acre sown to the coarser
grains, such as oats and barley. As rye and
grasses are sown in the fall and come to
maturity the next season, there had to be a
dating back to the period of sowing in the
fall of 1940 or 1941, for the payments on rye
and grasses, $2 at the time of sowing and
$2 on the 1st of July the following year.
Considerable reduction in wheat acreage was
brought about by this legislation. It is estimated that about ten million acres were taken
out of wheat acreage and put into summerfallow, coarse grains, grasses or rye, and a sum
of $34,500,000 was paid to farmers for this
reduction.
Jn 1942 Parliament passed a measure which
amended the Act and replaced the regulations
Hon. Mr. KING.

of 1941. The object at that time was not so
much a reduction in wheat acreage as an
inerease in the production of coarser grains and
some oil producing plants. The 1942 amendment retained the wording of the regulations
of 1941 in regard to certain matters, more
particularly rye, but rye was removed from
the definition of coarse grains. That was done
unintentionally, because of an oversight, and
when the Government started to pay under
the amending Act of 1942 it was found that the
Act gave no authority to make payments to
farmers who had taken land out of wheat and
sown it to rye in 1941 and 1942. The result is
that a large sum which should have been paid
te farmers has been ield up; and this Bill, in
section 3, authorizes payment to farmers who
complied with what was in fact the intention
of the 1942 amendment.
The plan is that from now on the Government will pay a flat $2 per acre for land taken
out of wheat production and put to summerfallow or sown to grasses, rye or coarser grains.
In other words, there will no longer bc any
payment on the basis of $4 an acre.
Section 6 deals with the matter of relationship between landlords and tenants. Many
farms in the West are, I believe, worked by
tenants, and the payment of money under this
legislation was often divided between landlord
and tenant in certain proportions, based on
the wheat produced. It bas been found difficult
to settle or adjust these payments as between
tenants and landlords. There was some discussion in the other House in regard to that
matter. Section 6 of this Bill requires that a
landlord, to be eligible for any payment under
this Act in respect to wheat acreage reduction,
shall make an application, on which must be
endorsed the tenant's acknovledgment that
the applicant is the landlord, this application
to be made to the secretary of the municipality
not later than the 30th day of June.
I think that is all I need say in explanation.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: If I understood the honourable the leader of the Government correctly, it appears that rye was not
specifically mentioned in the 1942 Act. Therefore the farmsers who sowed rye bave not been
paid, and the object of this amendment is to
enable them to be paid as far back as 1941.
I remember the 1942 legislation referred to
by the honourable the leader. Under it $2
was to bc allowed for summer-fallow. I may
say in that connection that all farmers, whether
in Eastern Canada or Western Canada. summer-fallow a certain amount of acreage for
the benefit of the land. I think the Western
farmers were very generously treated when
they were paid $2 an acre to summer-fallow

165

their land. They would have had to do it
anyway if they wanted to keep the land in
condition to produce grain.

able to give honourable members something
definite, so that they may make their plans
accordingly.

Hon. Mr. KING: It was taken out of wheat
and put into summer-fàllow.

The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at
3 p.m.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: The honourable
gentleman says it was taken out of wheat
acreage. I do not know that it makes very
much difference. The fact is that the land
was summer-fallowed and the farmers were
paid $2 an acre. The legislation also provided
for the payment of $2 an acre for all coarse
grains they might sow.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: It was taken out
of wheat production.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I quite understand that. Probably it was necessary to do
all this for the Western farmer. My only
regret is that more bas not been done in fact,
nothing lias been done-for the Eastern
farmer. I will not touch on the price that
was fixed for flax at the same time, namely
$2.50 an acre. I am under the impression,
though I may be wrong, that the Western
grain grower has fared pretty well this year
with the acreage allowance and the price he
has obtained for wheat and flax; but inasmuch
as the legislation was passed and this relates
only to payment, and those payments have to
be made, there is no comment I can offer
except to tender my congratulations to the
Western grain growers.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
EASTER ADJOURNMENT
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators,
we have reached the end of the Orders of
the Day. Inquiries have been made of me
by various members concerning the Easter
adjournment. I may have misled some of
them, for it was my idea-and it had been
stated-that the House of Commons would
adjourn on the 16th. Some three or four
weeks ago, in making the announcement of
the Easter adjournment, the Prime Minister
indicated that if satisfactory progress were
made with a certain financial bill the House
of Commons would adjourn on the 16th, but
failing to make progress the House would
continue to sit until the 21st. I understand
that an effort is being made in the House of
Commons to complete certain bills this week,
and to that end that House will sit to-night
and again on Friday night. In the meantime
I cannot definitely advise the Senate in regard
to the adjournment. We may have to remain
here. I hope that by to-morrow I shall be

NAZI CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY
MOTION

AND DISCUSSION-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN moved:
That this House views with indignation and
horror the barbarous treatment inflicted by
Nazi Germany on the peoples of occupied
Europe, expresses its sympathy with the unfortunate victims, and urges that stern punishment
ibe inflicted on those who are shown to be
responsible for these crimes against humanity.
He said: Honourable senators, in moving
this motion T have omitted the words "and
ruthless," which preceded the word "punishment" in my notice of motion, for I do not
want it to be thought that we on our side
are .descending to the atrocious behaviour of
our opponents.
I have no apology to make for bringing
the subject of this resolution to the notice
of the Senate. It is a matter of great and
painful moment, on which I think honourable senators should have an opportunity of
pronouncing. The resolution relates, broadly
speaking, to international affairs, and it is
my view that such affairs and the international
relationships of this country are perhaps
better and more fittingly dealt with by this
than by the other Chamber. We are not
primarily concerned with considerations of
party politics or of political advantage, and
questions relating to international policy
should equally be removed from these considerations. This Chamber has been designed,
and should, I submit, operate, as the medium
for the expression of the sober second thought
of the country; and it is in such an atmosphere
as prevails here that our vitally important
international relationships should be considered.
The same principle applies in Great Britain
in relation to the attributes and functions of
the House of Lords. It is interesting to recall
that during the last fifty years most of the
better known and most famous foreign ministers of Great Britain have been members

166

SENATE

of t-hat House. I refer to such noted foreign
ministers as Granville, Salisbury, Lansdowne
and Curzon. The Housé of Lords claims as
its particular province the consideration of
matters of international import.
In that
connection I was iterested to read, and I
shall take the opportunity of quoting to this
House, a short excerpt from the Manchester
Guardian Weekly of March 12 last, dealing
with what the House of Lords was then proposing to consider. This excerpt reads:
The Lords are to discuss post-armistice welfare
and resettleiment on a motion of Lord Nathan's,
economie expansionism on a motion of Lord
Barnby's. and supplies to Russia at the instance
of Lord Beaverbrook. The Bishop of Chichester's
motion urging the Government to make the
same distinction in its war aims between "the
Hitlerite State" and Germany that Stalin has
donc will also be debated at the next sittings.
In December last the House of Lords held
a debate and passed a resolution on the subject
of German atrocities in Poland, a part of the
subject which is embodied in the resolution I
am now submitting. The report of the debate
in the House of Lords on German atrocities
in Poland is to be found in the official report
of the House of Lords of December 15 last,
wbich I hold in my band.
The same principle holds truc in the United
States. There it is the upper House of Congress, the Senate of the United States, which
concerns itself more particularly with international matters. Indeed, without a two-thirds
vote of that body no treaties binding upon the
United States can be made or become effective.
These seem to me to be reasons why this
Senate should concern itself with questions of
this character. But there is a still further
reason. I submit that it is time the voice of
Canada's Parliament should be heard in these
matters. So far there has been little encouragement of either this House or the other
Chamber to engage in discussions of Canada's
international position, and so far during the
present war this country has for the most part
allowed ils came to be used, or allowed itself
to be spoken for, by one or otier and sometimes by both of the two great nations with
which we are more particularly allied, Great
Britain and the United States. That was the
case with the Atlantic Charter; that was the
case with the Casablanca Conference. Canada
has been content in these cases to say in effect,
" Me too." I have no complaint, honourable
senators, about this; I think the Government
of the day has been perfectly justified in that
attitude; but I do say it is now time for the
Parliament of Canada to begin to speak for this
country on matters of international concern.
After all, what is our position to-day? What
is our relative importance with respect to the
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN.

twenty-six or twenty-eight allied nations who
are carrying on this war together? In terms
of total war potential, the capacity to make
effective war, I think it cannot be denied we
rank fourth among the Allies, and are exceeded
only by the United Kingdom, the United
States and Russia; and if you talk in the
restricted terms of man-power alone, we with
our comparatively moderate population of
eleven and a half millions rank sixth in manpowxer, being exceeded by only those three
nations I have already named, and by China
and India.
I say, therefore, we have no
reason to be bashful or backward, or to let
others speak for us, and that Canada should
let ber voice be heard and ber weight be felt
in discussions of international affairs.
Now, I submit that it is particularly appropriate that our views should be heard on the
subject of the German treatment of occupied
Europe. Fo one thing, in the sense that we
are far removed fro
the scene of these
atrocities, we bave no direct interest. Our
country bas nat been invaded or even bombed.
Our men have net been sent into slavery in
Nazi Germany; our women and children have
not been starved. W'e have no territorial
designs and no propaganda interests ta serve.
W'e are nat even in the position in which the
House of Lords found itself when it debated
the Polish atrocities last December; because,
after all, Great Britain did guarantee Poland
against German aggression, whereas Canada
bas not done so. So our only object in considering this question is that of common
humanity and the tenets of the Christian
religion.
I know that objection will be taken to this
resolution. People will say: "What is the use
of passing a resolution of this kind? What
useful purpose can the Senate of Canada
achieve? Will the Nazis pay any attention
whatever? Of course they will not. They will
continue with their brutality and their violence
for as long as it suits them ta do so, and you
will merely have made a completely useless
gesture." Well, to anyone who uses that argument I should be disposed to reply somewhat
like this: " My friend, you may be right; it is
quite possible that you are right; but yet
there may be some small chance that a resolution of this kind will have some small effect in
mitigating the evils to which the people of
occupied Europe are now subjected. Remember, my friend, these two things. News and
opinions travel very fast these days. They
travel into occupied Europe and even into
Germany, by underground and over the air
waves, in spite of all that the Nazis can do

APRIL 15, 1943

to keep them out. And remember this second
point: the German people are just beginning
to realize they will lose this war."
I submit it is quite possible that the German
armies of occupation. in face of the dawning
of this realization, knowing, as they will know,
the opinion of the democratic peoples as to
this sort of behaviour, may be induced in
future to treat the peoples of occupied
Europe with a little less brutality than they
have treated them in the past. They will
know that every act of brutality committed
in the future will inevitably involve them in
trial and punishment at the conclusion of the
war.
But even if a resolution of this kind should
have no effect upon the oppressors, I still
think it ought to be adopted. And the reason
is this. It expresses our' deep and profound
sympathy for those suffering millions of our
Allies. After all, it is for the moment the only
thing that we can do. But it is a little more
than an expression of sympathy; it is an
expression of our solidarity with them, and a
promise that their sufferings shall not go unavenged in the final reckoning. I say that in
the midst of their terrible troubles it is our
duty to do anything we can to encourage them,
to encourage the underground resistance in
which they are still engaging after these three
years, and to assure them that their sufferings
are not being forgotten by their Allies who
happen to be in a more fortunate position
than themselves.
The actual ternis of this resolution may be
divided into three parts. Firstly, it condemns
the inhuman treatment of the peoples of
occupied Europe by the Nazi forces; secondly,
it expresses our sympathy with those oppressed
peoples; and thirdly, it calls for stern punishment of the crimes which have been conmitted against .them.
With reference to the first part of the
resolution, I think it is common ground that
the behaviour of the Nazi conquerors towards
the inhabitants of occupied countries has been
a succession of what may be called the blackest
crimes in al recorded history. I am not referring to individual acts that may have been
done in hot blood in the course of fighting in an
invaded country. I am referring to large-scale,
long-terrm actions that are part of a well defined
policy engaged in by the Nazi authorities in
flagrant violation of all the tenets of international law. Let me enumerate a few of
these actions.
The bombing of Rotterdam in May, 1940,
after the Dutch Government had laid down
its arms, and the slaughter of ten or fifteen
thousand innocent civilians caused thereby.

167

The deliberate machine-gunning of those
pitiable refugees who flocked over the roads
of France and Belgium in the early summer
of 1940.
The continuous shooting of hostages in
France and in the Low Countries.
The forcible removal of many hundreds
of thousands to slave labour in Germany.
The wiping out of the Czech village of
Lidice.
The murder of many thousands of prominent Czechs.
The looting and starvation of the Greek
people.
The policy of deliberate extermination of
whole nations or sections of nations, carried
out in Yugoslavia and Poland.
,
The Calvary which has been inflicted on
the Jewish race in Eastern Europe. With
respect to this last, I wish to read just one
quotation from a statement made by the
Archbishop of York last December. Ie said
this:
ln Poland there is taking place one of the
most appalling outrages that the whole history
of the world has ever seen. We are watching
the deliberate and cold-blooded massacre of a
nation.
These, honourable senators, are only some
of the enormities which have been committed
by the deliberate policy of the Nazi authorities. They stagger the imagination. They
violate every principle of international law,
every concept of humanity, every precept of
religion, everything that distinguishes man
from the brute creation. They add up to
an appalling total of human misery and
human degradation unknown in the history
of mankind. I say it will be welil for us
to remember these things when the Germans
come whining to us for .mercy, as they did
in 1918 and as they will once again.
It is against these almost unbelievable
enormities, these betrayals of the spirit of
man, that we feel called upon, as men, to
protest. And, as men, we are fully justified, on
the record, in branding those Nazis who are
responsible for such policies and such practices
as something less than men; as, in fact, an
obscene gang of mental and moral degenerates,
unworthy of the name of men.
I submit that this House should formally
record its condemnation of these dreadful
deeds. But I think it should go further. And
here I pass to a consideration of the second
part of this resolution: our deep sympathy
with the nations and peoples who have been
victims of these policies. Let us for a few
moments consider these peoples and what we
owe to them.

168

SENATE

I take first the Czechs. They were the first to
suffer invasion and oppression by Hitler.
Czechoslovakia was a model republic, a democratic people, an enlightened and progressive
nation in the heart of Europe. You will all
recall how Czechoslovakia was abandoned by
Great Britain and France in 1938, abandoned
to her fate at the hands of Hitler, in the vain
hope of appeasing Hitler. Appeasing Hitler!
How that word "appeasement" stinks in our
nostrils to this day!
Then the brave people of Poland, the first
who had to suffer armed invasion by the
German might in 1939. Their armies were
destroyed, their cities were razed, and ever
since they have been subjected to the savage
and implacable hatred of the conquerors. But
they still fight on, both in and out of their
country, and some day they will rise again.
Hitler has attempted to exterminate two races,
the Poles and the Jews. I venture to suggest
that neither can be exterminated, and that
some day the ghosts of those whom Hitler
has slaughtered in their millions will rise to
haunt the German people for generations to
come.
Take the Norwegians, a race of people
whom we all admire. We admire particularly
their steadfast loyalty to their king. to their
church and to their democratie institutionsloyalties which they have maintained in face
of all the blandislhments, all the threats and all
the cruelties to which they have been subjected by the Nazi occupiers. The Norwegians
are fighting for us to this day, on the seven
seas and in the air as well.
The next in order of conquest are the
nations of the Low Countries. the Duteli and
the Belgians. These are stubborn and tenacious
races. In the vast majority they have refused
to bave anything whatever to do with Hitler
or his so-called new order. Those of them
wo remain in their countries treat the
invaders with quiet disdain, and look forward
with hope to the day of their deliverance,
while those who have succeeded in escaping
still carry on the war at our side.
Nor can we forget the people of Southern
Europe, the Yugoslavs and the Greeks. We
cive a great. debt to both peoples.
The
Greeks were the first to deflate that malodorous gas-bag, Mussolini, and his Fascist
State. The Yugoslavs, by their gallant if
short-lived resistance in the early summer of
1941, threw the German invasion time-table
out of gear, delayed the German attack upon
Russia, and prevented what might othervise
have very well happened, a complete German
victory on the continent of Europe, particularly
in Eastern Europe, by the autumn of that
year. The Greeks and the Yugoslavs are now
harried and oppressed. Their villages are

burned, their people are massacred or starved,
but they continue to fight on in guerilla warfare with the greatest determination and
gallantry. I for one venture te hope that
relief for those peoples is not very far off;
that after the present campaign in Tunisia has
been brought to a successful conclusion, and
the Mediterranean bas been converted into an
Allied lake, it will be possible to help them
before this summer is out.
But, af ter all, honourable senators, the people
who lie closest to our hearts are the unhappy
people of France. We pity and condole with
their terrible sufferings, both physical and
moral. We are told that the old France, the
France which we knew and visited and loved in
former and happier days, is dead. Well, it may
be so. But is it not true to say that a new
France is being born on the African continent
and is taking up the fight again by the side
of her Allies under the leadership of such tried
and capable generals as de Gaulle and Giraud?
When you talk to me about France being
dead, I am reminded of the phrase used to
announce the advent of a new French king,
which, to meet present-day conditions, I
would paraphrase thus: La France est morte.
Vive la France!
With all those brave but miserable and
unfortunate people' this resolution expresses
our deepest and moost sincere sympathy. That
is all we can do directly at the moment; but
indirectly, of course, we are doing far more.
We are in this war to a finish, with all our
resources of man-power and wealth, and we
are joined with the other Allied nations in a
solemn pledge to set these captive populations free in God's good time.
I come now to the third and final part in
this resolution. It is not suificient that the
enslaved peoples of Europe should be set
frce. Justice demands more than that. Justice
demands that punishment, stern and implacable punishment, should be imposed upon
those wo have abused them. In that regard,
will you allow me to quote a statement made
in the House of Lords by Lord Simon, the
Lord Chancellor, on the 10th of last month,
announcing the policy of Great Britain and
the other Allied nations? I quote:
We mean to do the utmost in our power to
secure that the war criminals are punished for
their wholesale barbarities, perpetrated on
innocent, defenceless people by the Nazis and
their willing instruments, and the mass persecution of people of all ages and both sexes.
The villainies of the Gestapo, the deliberate
extermination of Jewish communities-these are
all things that have disgraced the German name
for ever. They cry aloud for just punishment.
But let it be clearly understood and proclaimed all over the world-we British will
never seek to take vengeance by wholesale mass

Casablanca and the events which preceded their
visit to North Africa. Certainly Canada has,
through the Prime Minister and his Government, expressed ber views on all these very
important international questions, and, although the Prime Minister may not have
given to Parliament in detail the information
that he bas, I think it safe to say that he
and his Government have been consulted, and
that Canada bas played ber full part in this
war both in conference with our Allies and in
her great contribution to the war effort.
Let me conclude these unprepared remarks
by again thanking my honourable friend for
bringing his resolution before the House and
by assuring him that I de.em it a great privilege ta support it. The resolution will, I have
no doubt, have a good effect not only in our
own country, but throughout the world, and
I am confident that his speech in support of
it will reach the cars of the Nazi gangsters
and cause them grave consternation. The exKaiser, when he saw his attempt at world
domination must fail. fled to Doorn in
Holland.
I know of no country that will
grant asylum ta these Nazi blackguards when
they seek to escape the doom that awaits
them, and the dire prospect must add ta
their present disquietude and disappointment.
I desire once again to assure my honourable
friend that it was quite right and proper for
him to bring this resolution before honourable
senators.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Howard, the debate
was adjourned.
ADMINISTRATION OF MONTREAL
ABATTOIRS
ORDER

FOR RETURN

Hon. ARTHUR SAUVE moved:
That an Order of the Senate be issued for the
production of a copy of all representations,
letters, documents and telegrams, from January,
1942, to March, 1943, inclusive, between the
Federal Government or its representatives and
any person who has voiced complaints with
regard to the administration of Montreal
abattoirs and ill-treatment of farmers or producers on those markets.
He said: Honourable senators, my motion
is based on a claim for justice on the part of
an important section of the population in the
Montreal region. I ask for the production of
the documents mentioned in the motion
because I want to know. and the public also
want ta know, what bas been done to remedy
an unbearable situation arising from the illtreatment ta which farmers, producers and
traders have been subjected at the public
abattoirs of Montreal. I myself denounced
the situation to the federal authorities last
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

year. If a satisfactory explanation had been
forthcoming, following my letters of 1942, I
would not ask for these documents. Accordng to a recent public denunciation by the
Liberal member for the Chambly-Rouville
constituency, things are growing worse at the
Montreal abattoirs in spite of protestations
and warnings to the federal authorities.
Here is a fact. On December 2, 1942, I
transmitted to the federal authorities the:
complaints made by various farmers to Mr.
W. A. Peterson, Superintendent of Animal
Production, and ta Mr. L. C. Robitaille, Chief
of Wartime Agricultural Production, Montreal.
I pointed out to them the situation of the
farmers at the abattoirs, and cited to them
the following typical case. A farmer brought
in eight live hogs, weighing one thousand
seven hundred and fifty pounds, the price of
which was $12.60 per hundred pounds. This
farmer should bave drawn $220.50, but instead,
a few days later, be received $202.
He
protested, claiming his due. The Government
nspector nervously made calculation after
calculation, but failed to arrive at the correct
price, or even to explain the difference between
the amount claimed and the amount paid.
Finally be offered $5 ta the farmer as a
settlement. But the farmer insisted on receiving the full amount due him. I then intervened, and Mr. Peterson instructed his
assistant, Mr. Blair, that the matter pertained
to the Markets Division of the Federal Department of Agriculture, adding that the
Government inspector at the abattoir was
responsible for the selection of animals brought
in and for tc
verification of their weights.
He was right. But what bas the inspector
donc, and what is he still doing?
He probably is the man who sent to Mr.
Blair the answer "that the lower returns from
the carcasses were due to abnormal dressing
percentages."
This is merely a pretext, a
subterfuge, an evasion, an abuse of confidence.
If the reasons ho invoked were sound, why
did he offer a settlement of $5 to the farmer
making the claim?
That man, a federal inspector and Government agent, reproached the farmer for having
got into touch with a senator; but after hearing
the farmer's intelligent answer he apologized
and promised to inquire in order to give him
satisfaction. But what bas ho done since that
time? Nothing. There bas been no answer
whatsoever to the farmer's letters, any more
than there bas been to my own. In my 1942
correspondence ta Messrs. Peterson and Robitaille I was asking for the appointment of a
representative of the producer-sellers at the
abattoirs to verify the classifications and

APRIL 15, 1943
weights. I was urging the appointment of a
fair, energetic and impartial representative,
to put a stop to abuses and robbery.
There is a black market in Montreal, as in
all the large commercial centres. The Government says it must be repressed without mercy.
There is a branch of that black market at
Montreal abattoirs, but it appears that very
little is being done to suppress it. Five
months after my request and my statements
were made, nothing bas been done, apparently,
for it is only a few days since the Liberal
member for Chambly-Rouville denounced the
same abuses and graft. This member for a
rural constituency, a district close to the
Moutreal market, had to repeat the same
complaints, denunciations and requests that I
myself made in my 1942 correspondence. I
am glad that my friend from ChamblyRouville bas, in a discreet way, offered me his
assistance, and I am thankful to him. I did
not know be could se accurately guess the
contents of my correspondence with the
Here is an
Government and its agents.
excerpt, taken from La Presse of Montreal,
of what my honourable friend from ChamblyRouville said:
Speaking about bacon hogs, I must say that
I am not satisfied with the treatment meted
out te farmers in that connection. However, I
feel that if the Government knew the facts as
they have been reported te me, they would
endeavour te straighten out the situation. The
bonus is paid on bacon hogs only if they weigh
from 180 te 220 pounds, I believe. If a hog is
one pound over or under weight, net only is
the bonus net paid, but the hog is placed in a
lower grade, and such a low price is set on it
that it does net pay the farmer te put it up
for sale, considering what the farmer bas te pay
for the feeding and the care of those bacon
hogs. The Government should appoint bacon
hog producers, as representatives of the farming
community, who would be stationed at the
slaughter bouses where they would check the
weight of those bacon hogs, thereby protecting
the farmer's interests. I do net mean that the
abattoir owners rob the farmers, but I do say
that the latter must accept the arbitrary
decision of interested people. Were the Government te hold an inquiry in this matter, perhaps
they would find that even in the cattle trade,
and in the abattoirs, there may be trust
operators against whom the farmers should be
protected.
When a farmer, through a trucker or a hog
dealer, sends one hundred or one hundred and
fifty hogs te the Montreal market, there is no
one in a position te decide how many of them
fill the conditions required by the Government
te warrant the payment of the bonus. The hogs
are net weighed in the presence of the farmer
or the trucker at the abattoir. They are told
to return a week later te ascertain what amount
they are entitled to, how many animals command
a premium, and how many are subject te a eut.
When the farmer or his representative returns
the following week, he finds out that perhaps
sixty out of one hundred hogs did net entitle
him te the bonus, but were subjected te such
72542-12j

171

a eut that no profit can be derived from raising
them. This condition should be remedied at
once.
If such a situation is maintained, the
farmers, I fear, will refuse to sell their
products at those abattoirs and will reduce
or change their production.
Such abuses not only provoke criticism
detrimental to our production, but confirm a
feeling spreading among our rural populations
against the impotence of our political regime
to protect the good elements of the community and give justice to honest producers.
Since there is a heavy imposition of war taxes
upon onr people, who are most desirous of
contributing according te their resources and
their vision of the future, they can rightly
demand from the Government efficient protection against waste, against graft of any
kind, and against vexatious dealings of incompetent and partial officials. In order to obtain
the greatest production we must see to it
that the producer, the labourer and the taxpayer do not feel they are being frustrated
and robbed.
With the member for Chambly-Rouville,
Mr. Dupuis, I reiterate a request for an
investigation, an impartial inquiry. Notwithstanding my withdrawal from active politics,
I am still living in the midst of a rural
population, for whom I have the deepest
esteem and respect. I will not fail to serve
them in serving my country. "What is bred
in the bone will never come out of the flesh."
Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, I
am not in a position to reply te my honourable friend now. He has said a good deal. He
accuses Government officials, I take it, of being
dishonest and inefficient.
So far as the resolution is concerned, I see
no objection to it. It asks for the production
of representations, letters, documents, and telegrams from January, 1942, to March, 1943,
between the Federal Government or its representatives and any person who bas voiced complaints with regard to the administration of
Montreal abattoirs and ill-treatment of farmers or producers on those markets. I see no
objection to that. If there is correspondence of
that character, let it be brought down. But
my honourable friend has gone a little farther
than that. Under the guise of asking for
papers, he bas suggested irregularities without
producing any proof of them. We know it has
been the policy of this Government and of all
governments to see to it that there is proper
regulation or inspection of the people who
are engaged in the slaughtering of animals.
There is probably no more thorough inspection done by Government officials than that of
the work carried on in these abattoirs.

I will not say any more. So far as I am
concerned, the resolution itself is acceptable.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Honourable senators, it
seems to me the wording of the resolution is
improper. No proof bas been given by my
honourable friend of ill-treatment of farmers.
If he would strike out the word "ill," so that
the reference would be simply to the treatment of farmers, there would be no objection.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable senators, it is nioved by Hon. Senator Sauvé,
seconded by Hon. Senator Blondin:
That an order of the Senate be issued for the
production of a copy of all representations,
letters, documents, and telegrams, from January,
1942, to March, 1943, inclusive, between the
Federal Government or its representatives and
any person who Las voiced complaints with
regard to the administration of Montreal
abattoirs and ill-treatment of farmers or producers on those markets.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Mr. Speaker, I am submitting that the word "ill" should be left out.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: "Unfair" treatment.
Hon. Mr. COPP: No.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it moved that
the word "ill" be struck out and the word
"unfair" substituted?
Hon. Mr. COPP: No, Your Honour. The
suggestion is that the word "ill" be stricken out.
The correspondence will show what kind of
treatment there has been.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Honourable senators, I
do not know wbat the purpose of the motion
would be if neither the word "il]" nor the
word "unfair" were included. The honourable
senator's reasons for wanting the correspondence brought down is that he knows, or fears,
or suspects, that there has been unfair treatment or ill-treatment of farmers. I for one
think his motion is perfectly in order. The
correspondence will show whether there bas
been unfair treatment or ill-treatment. If there
has been none, he will have no case; on the
otlier hand, if the correspondence does show
unfair treatment or ill-treatment, there will be
a case. Perhaps the word "unfair" should be
substituted for "ill."
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Honourable senators, I am certainly not going to support a
resolution which states that there las been
unfair treatment or ill-treatment of farmers,
until I have seen the correspondence. If we
pass the motion as it is worded, we shall all
be responsible for what it says. I do not know
whether the farmers referred to by the honourHon. Mr. KING.

able senator have Leen unfairly treated, and I
cannot come to any conclusion in the matter
until the documents are before us. If we
support the motion as it reads, we are saying
that there has been ill-treatment of farmers.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: The resolution does not
say that; it says there have been complaints
of ill-treatment. Evidently the honourable
senator from Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Sauvé) has
evidence that complaints of ill-treatment have
been made by some person or persons, but he
does not say as a matter of fact that there
has been ill-treatment. The motion asks for
correspondence "between the Federal Government or its representatives and any person
who has voiced complaints witL regard to the
administration of Montreal abattoirs and illtreatment of farmers or producers on those
markets." That does not say that farmers
have actually been ill-treated.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: But the honourable
senator said so in his speech.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: We are dealing now
with the wording of the resolution, not with
the honourable gentleman's speech.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, I think that the point of the honourable
senator from L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Léger) is
right-that the purpose of the resolution is to
ask for correspondence from persons who have
voiced complaints of ill-treatment of farmers.
It seems to me the difficulty could be easily
overcome if the resolution were slightly
changed, so as to ask for correspondence, etc.,
" between the Federal Government or its
representatives and any person who has voiced
complaints of ill-treatment of farmers or producers under the administration of Montreal
abattoirs."
Hon. Mr. COPP: When the correspondence is brought down we can conclude what
kind of treatment the farmers got.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I do not think it
was the intention of the mover to establish
by this resolution the fact of ill-treatment.
The resolution could easily be interpreted as
Laving that meaning, I know, but it seems
to me that wbat is desired by the honourable
senator from Rigaud would be made clear
if the wording were changed as I have
suggested.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: That would do it very
well.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable senators, this is not the first timeHon. Mr. SAUVE:
The word "ill" could
be stricken out, and then the reference would

Hon. Mr. SAUVE: The farmers are complaining. Their complaint, which has been
expressed by Mr. Dupuis, the member for
Chambly-Rouville, was established in my correspondence of 1942, and I am reiterating it.
If the word "ill"
Hon. Mr. HOWARD:
were dropped, the motion would be all right.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable senators, this is not the first time in the present
session that we have beard about conditions
not being altogether right in the stock-yards
of Canada. On the 5th of February the
honourable senator from Saskatchewan North
(Hon. Mr. Horner) said, as reported on page
57 of Hansard:
What purpose do the stock-yards serve now
that we are at war? The farmer takes in a
load of cattle for sale. He finds a whole army
of men assembled there, and they pound the
animals with canes to separate them and weigh
each one in order to take advantage of the odd
pounds and the break of the beam. I have
killed my own beef and I can tell what weight
an animal will dress, and what it will be on
the hoof. After the cattle have been weighed
as I have described, they are presumed to be
sold to the commission men, but after you go
back home there is a resale to the packers.
That is the way our public cattle markets are
being run. Packing companies buy cattle at
9 cents a pound and sell as though they had
paid at the rate of 12 cents a pound. The
Government should take over the yards, put in
inspectors, send the cattle to the slaughterhouses as they can handle them, and credit the
cattleman with the proceeds. Our people are
dissatisfied with the manner in which the stockyards are conducted to-day.
I do not know anything about it.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE:

I know something.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
that on record.
Hon. Mr. COPP:

I am just putting

It is already on record.

Hon. Mr. KING: The honourable gentleman is dropping the word "ill" from bis
motion?
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: Yes. That is acceptable to the honourable leader of the Government and the leader of the opposition on the
other side (Hon. Mr. Copp)?
Hon. Mr. KING:

Hon. Mr. SAUVE:
presumes too much.

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: The difficulty arises
because of the belief of some honourable
members that the motion as now worded refers
to complaints of ill-treatment of farmers,
whereas other bonourable members consider
the motion to be a statement of fact that there
bas been ill-treatment. The difficulty could be
solved, I suggest, by placing the word "presumed" or "suspected" before the word "illtreatment."
Hon. Mr. COPP: The correspondence will
speak for itself.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable senators, I should like to point out that this
discussion is a little out of order. A motion
made by an honourable senator and seconded
by another honourable senator must be considered in the form in which it is presented
to the Senate. A mover, with the approval
of the seconder, and with unanimous consent
of the House, may amend bis motion. But
in this instance we have had a series of suggestions as to how the wording of the motion
could be changed, and it is that procedure
which, I am afraid, is not quite correct. Furthermore, I do not believe the motion lends
itself to the objections that have been raised,
because what is asked for is the production of
documents in which complaints have been
voiced with regard to the administration of
Montreal abattoirs and ill-treatment of farmers
or producers. However, I understand that as
a result of suggestions that have been made,
the honourable mover (Hon. Mr. Sauvé), with
the approval of bis seconder (Hon. Mr.
Blondin), is willing to drop the word "ill"
from the motion. Is that so?
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: I am not willing, but
I have no objection.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It is moved by
Hon. Senator Sauvé, seconded by the Hon.
Senator Blondin,
That leave be given for striking out the word
"ill" from the fifth line of the motion.
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to
adopt the motion?
The motion was agreed to.

Yes.

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Honourable senators,
one can easily see where the difficulty is. I
suggest it would be eliminated by the insertion of the word "presumed" before the
word "ill-treatment."

My honourable friend

The Hon. the SPEAKER: The motion now
is:
That an order of the Senate be issued.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Dispense.
The motion, as amended, was agreed to.

I think I should try to clarify as far as possible
the time of adjournment to be proposed this
week. Yesterday in another place this question
was asked of the Prime Minister:
Did I understand the Prime Minister to say
that if we did not conclude on Friday evening
we would sit on Saturday?

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 60, an Act to amend the
Customs Tariff.

To that the Prime Minister replied:
No; I said if we did not conclude on Friday
evening we would continue on into the next
week. In making reference to Saturday I was
assuming that discussions might be concluded
by Friday night; if not in time for assent at
night, we might arrange for assent to the Bills
on Saturday. But that would have to be by
consent of the House, or by a formal resolution.
Otherwise we would continue on into Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday.
In view of this statement I must ask that
we 'adjourn until to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Do I understand the honourable leader to say that this
House will adjourn to-morrow?
Hon. Mr. KING:
until to-morrow.

I cannot say definitely

The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at
3 p.m.

BUSINESS

OF THE SENATE

DELAY IN SUBMISSION OF MEASURES FROM
COMMONS

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, on the Orders of the Day, may I say
a few words with reference to the manner in
which legislation of the most important
character is sent to us in the expectation that
we shall rush it through without proper consideration. I have been twelve years in this
honourable Chamber, and my grievance is the
same against all the different governments that
we have had during that time, and also against
honourable members in another place. There
will be submitted to us shortly, perhaps next
week, the most important and by far the
largest budget ever placed before the Parliament of Canada. Net only does it provide for
four and a half or five billion dollars for war
expenditures, but it contains a very long list
of heavy taxes. The people, I may say, are not
complaining about this, because they are ready
to do their full share in the war; but I protest
as vehemently as I can against the situation
we are in at the moment. This Chamber
probably will adjourn to-day until next Monday. It is desired by the Prime Minister, and,
I am sure, by all honourable members in
another place, that on Thursday of next week
Parliament may adjourn for the Easter holidays. What does that mean so far as this
Chamber is concerned? It simply means that
by Wednesday, or possibly Thursday, the
budget, its resolutions and other legislation
will be hurriedly delivered to this House and
we shall be expected to pass upon those
measures in a matter of a few heurs. The delay
will prevent honourable members of this
House from giving to the proposed legislation,
as is their right, the consideration which it
deserves and which the public expect it to
receive.

APRIL 16, 1943
There seems to exist in this country a wrong
impression, namely, that the Senate of Canada bas no constitutional jurisd.iction over
money bills. I am not an authority on that
question, but a year or two ago I consulted
one of the most brilliant lawyers, who expressed the opinion that under our Constitution the Senate of Canada can refuse a budget,
or reduce the amoun.t of it, thôugh it cannot
increase the amount.
In this connection I am reminded that I am
old enough to remember what happened in the
British House of Commons a great many
years ago, when Mr. Asquith was Prime
Minister of Great Britain. The Chancellor of
the Exchequer at that time happened to be
the Right Hon. Lloyd George. He introduced
into the British Commons what was regarded
at that time as a very radical budget. It would
not be so considered to-day. On three consecutive occasions that budget was rejected
by the House of Lords. The Prime Minister
then appealed to the country, and his Government was sustained at the polls. He then went
to His Majesty the King and asked that one
hundred additional peers be appointed in order
that the budget might be put through the
House of Lords. An Act was then introduced
-I cannot give you the details of it-the substance of which was that when the flouse of
Commons in Great Britain had three times
passed a budget or any other bill it was
obligatory upon the House of Lords to accept it.
I cite that instance merely to set as clearly
as I can before the people of Canada our
jurisdiction in this Huse. We are especially
qualified here to give thorough consideration
to the budget. I make that statement for this
reason. In this Chamber we have many
honourable senators who were members of
another flouse for a long term of years, and
some who were Ministers of the Crown. Besides, some of these and others of our members
have had wide experience as agriculturists,
b'usiness men and financiers, and we have
here a galaxy of legal talent. Where could the
budget and other important legislation be
better considered than right in this Chamber?
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: But we cannot
properly consider important legislation under
circumstances such as I fear will exist next
week. I do not believe the budget and the
resolutions will reach this Chamber before
Wednesday, or possibly Thursday. Then the
hurry-up call will go out to us to give these
measures first, second and third readings in
time for the Royal Assent to be given them not
later than Thursday, so that Parliament may
adjourn on the eve of Good Friday until after
the Easter holidays.

175

I say that is outrageous treatment to accord
to this Chamber, and I believe the time bas
arrived when it must cease. I have a suggestion to make to my hônourable friend (Hon.
Mr. King), who is a member of the Government; a suggestion with which I hope he will
agree. It is this: that when this Chamber
adjourns to-day it stand adjourned until after
the Easter holidays, and that when we resume
we take ample time-all the necessary time.;
days or weeks, if necessary-to give proper
study to the budget, its resolutions and whatever other measures may come before us then.
I have another reason for making this suggestion. Some of our honourable members,
who were here for a considerable length of
time, have gone away-especially those from
the far West and the far East-and they may
not be here again next week. So I hope the
honourable leader will consult the Prime
Minister and that my suggestion for adjournment from to-day until after Easter will be
agreed to.
I trust honourable senators will not feel
that the sentiments I am voicing are too
strong. Really, when one considers the prestige, the dignity and the usefulness of the
Senate of Canada, its history, and what it is
prepared to do, one can regard it as nothing
but an affront to this House if we are asked
to meet next week for the purpose of having
literally thrown at us at the last moment the
budget and other important legislation that I
have spoken about, and if we are expected to
rush it all through so as not to delay the
Easter adjournment.
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators, I
may say that I have some sympathy with my
honourable friend's remarks. I have been a
member of this Chamber for about twelve or
thirteen years, and I cannot recall one session
in which at some time it did not become
necessary for the Government to ask us ta
assent to legislation. on what might be deemed
short notice. But the situation, as one finds on
giving it the thought it requires, is not as it
appears on the surface. Parliament-by which
I mean the Senate and the House of Commons
of Canada-met on the 28th of January. In
accordance with the usual procedure, the
Speech from the Throne was delivered and
afterwards debated in both Houses. Since
then, we in the Senate have dealt expeditiously
with the measures that have been brought
before us. When legislation is introduced in
the House of Commons it becomes public
property and we, by reason of our status as
members of Parliament, are in a preferred position to know its character and purpose. Usually
legislation is initiated in the House of Commons, and whether it consists of Government

176

SENATE

or of private measures, we have full opportunity of familiarizing ourselves with the
bills and of hearing them debated in the other
House, or, if it is not convenient for us to
attend, the Commons Hansard is available to
us. So it is hardly fair to say that the Senate
is not informed with respect to legislation
when it reaches us.
On the 2nd of March Mr. Ilsley, the Minister of Finance, brought down his budget for
the current fiscal year. Since then the resolutions based on that budget have been fully
discussed in the other House, and any senator
who so desired bas had ample time not only
to study those resolutions, but also to go to
the various Government departments and secure any information he might need to clarify
any doubtful points.
Early this session, in order to avoid just
what my honourable friend is now complaining
of, I suggested that, as in connection with the
war we might expect financial measures which
probably it would not be desirable for us to
deal witb in the same way as with the usual
financial measures of peace-time, full opportunity should be given to honourable senators
to make a special study of those war measures
in anticipation of the formal transmission of
the bills to this Chamber. Accordingly on
March 3 last I moved:
That the Standing Committee on Finance be
authorized to examine expenditures proposed by
the estimates laid before Parliament and by
resolutions relating to war and other proposed
financial measures of which notice lias been
given to Parliament, in advance of the bills
based on the said estimates and resolutions
reaching the Senate.
We have proceeded along that line and
enlarged our Standing Committee on Finance
from seventeen to twenty-five members. Yesterday the three measures which have just
been given first reading were very carefully
considered by the committee at morning and
afternoon sittings. Officers of the Departm&nt
of Finance were in attendance and fully explained the measures and the purpose of the
amendments while they were under discussion
in the House of Commons. In effect, the
Senate is in the position of having had a preview of the legislation which is now before
us. J hope that after those bills have been
debated and given second reading next Monday, my honourable friend opposite will agree
to their reference to the Committee on
Finance. The members of that committee,
having, as I have already said, carefully studied
the bills yesterd-ay, will be in a position to
deal with them with full knowledge of their
details, and, I hope, to report them to this
Chamber next Tuesday.
Hon. Mr. KING.

Now, since our Finance Committee of
twenty-five members has had these Bills under
careful consideration, I submit it cannot bo
said that the Senate bas not had an opportunity to study them. True, there may not be
time for lengthy debate on the merits of the
legislation, but we shall have at least the whole
of Tuesday afternoon and, if it is desirable, it
may be possible to devote Wednesday afternoon to further debate.
I come now to the Income Tax Bill. This
probably is of more importance than the other
financial bills to which I have referred. It is
a lengthy measure and the resolutions on
which it will be based are still being debated
in the other House. To-day our Finance Committee, taking advantage of its authority,
spent a great deal of time with officers of the
department in going carefully over these
resolutions, and of course those members of
the comnittee who attended are fully conversant witi the details of the resolutions. I
will venture to say that at no time since I
have been a member of this House lias any of
our committeos been so thoroughly informed
on a Government measure as are the members
of our Finance Committee to-day.
It lias been suggested that we should now
adjourn until after Easter. I do not think my
lionourable friend is really serious.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

I certainly am.

Hon. Mr. KING: I can hirdly conceive
that lie is. These taxation measures, as we all
know, were brouglit into operation at the
time the budget was introduced, but still there
is this situation existing in the Government
departments: the men who are required to
administer this Act are applying it without the
benefit of the legislation that will eventually
guide them. Therefore it is important that
these measures be dealt with as expeditiously
as possible.
If there had been delay on the part of the
Government in introducing the legislation,
then there miglit be ground for complaint; but
such lias not been the case. The budget was
brought down early in the session. The Minister of Finance informed Parliament and the
country that lie proposed to ask the people of
Canada to subscribe to a further war loan of
upwards of a billion dollars, and in view of
the approach of Easter he thought it important
that members should be returning to their
constituencies in order to ensure the success
of the loan. At that time he suggested that if
it were possible for members of the House of
Commons to pass the legislation by the 16th
of this month that House might then adjourn
over Easter; if not, it would continue in session

177

APRIL 16, 1943
until the 21st of this m.onth. It was hoped that
by starting the Easter adjournment on the 16th
members would have almost another week in
their constituencies, with a loss of only two and
a half days of their parliamentary work.
I do not think I need say any more. I
sympathize with what my honourable friend
has said, but, as I have already remarked,
I think that by reason of the work done by our
Finaice Committee its members are well informed in regard to these bills. In addition
to this there will be full opportunity for
debate. It is not the desire of the Government
that these bills should be rushed through the
Senate. The desire is to have the legislation
approved with reasonable dispatch, in order
that the business of the country may be
carried on to the satisfaction of the people.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Maybe honourable senators will be considerate enough to
allow me a word or two in reply. With
all due deference to the honourable leader
opposite, it seems to me he has expounded a
strange doctrine. He says, in effect, to honourable members of this Chamber: "If you want
to know what is going on in Parliament read
the House of Commons Hansard, attend committees So and So and So and So, and then
you will have all the information you need."
I sutbmit that this is the place in which legislation should be debated. All senators are not
on our various committees, and this Senate
will serve no very useful purpose if it is to
appoint a few committees and have a few
senators attend there, so that the honourable
leader may say: "You have all the information you want. Let us get on with the legislation."
ADJOURNMENT
Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, I
move that when the House adjourns to-day it
do stand adjourned until Monday evening,
April 19, at 8 o'clock.
The motion was agreed to.

CANADIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION-SPEAKERS-BOARD
OF GOVERNORS
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. TANNER
inquired of the
Government:
1. Referring to the stated policy of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to "replace on
the air broadcasts by informed, authoritative
and competent speakers as a contribution to the
discussion of current affairs and problems,"
(a) Who were such speakers, other than
members of Government, during the twelve
months next proceeding this date, and what are
their places of residence and occupations?
(b) Did any of them discuss any branch or
phase of policies and administration of Canada's
governmental affairs; and, if so, what speakers,
and what branch or phase of policies and
administration did each one discuss?
(c) What was each speaker paid for his
service?
2. Is it a fact that an appointment to the
board of governors was recently made and that
the board now consists of eight members? What
are the name, residence and occupation of the
recent appointee?
3. What is the number of meetings held by
the board of governors during the current fiscal
year; and on what dates were they held?
4. Is any allowance for travel expense to and
at Ottawa paid to governors; and if so, how
much did each one receive in the current fiscal
year?
Hon. Mr. KING: In reply to the honourable senator's inquiry I would say that to
answer the first question would involve an
analysis of approximately 10,000 manuscripts
of Canadian Broadcasting Corporation talks,
.and, at the present time, owing to a shortage
of man-power and the occupation of the
Corporation staff with essential war services, it
is impossible to furnish the information
required.
The answer to the second question is:
Yes. Two appointments have been made
recently and the board now consists of its full
membership of nine governors.
Howard B. Chase, Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, 1411 Crescent, Montreal.

SPECIAL WAR REVENUE BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading
of Bill 58, an Act to amend the Special War
Revenue Act.
He said: Honourable senators, my good
friend the honourable gentleman from Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Beauregard) has kindly consented te give an explanation of the
amendments te the Special War Revenue Act
contained in Bill 58. I would suggest that at
the end of the debate following my honourable
friend's explanation the Bill be referred to tie
Standing Committee on Finance.
Hon. ELlE BEAUREGARD: Honourable
senators, this Bill 58 is entitled an Act to
amend the Special War Revenue Act-a much
amended Act, as you may see.from the first
page. I may say that our Finance Committee
had an opportunity to study the Bill, before
it was submitted to the committee in the other
House. Fortunately for our committee, the
Bill was not amended over there; so it stands
to-day as it did at the time we had it under
consideration. Furthermore, we had the privilege of receiving explanations of the Bill from
a few representatives of the Department of
National Revenue, and we were given, I should
say, all the information asked for.
This Bill, as honourable members will see
upon reading it, concerns some 23 sections of
the law known as chapter 179 of the Revised
Statutes of 1927. Briefly, the amendments are
as follows. Sections 1 and 3 contain two
important definitions. One of these is the
definition of "manufacturer or producer," which
includes any department of the Government
that is called upon te manufacture or produce.
The other important definition is that of "die."
It is a well-known device for impressing an
excise stamp upon a cheque or other document, but up to now there has been no
definition for it.
Sections 5, 6, 19 and 20 have been introduced in the Bill in order te bring the Act into

179

accord with the budget resolutions of March 2,
1943, Sections 7, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 17 repeal
various sections of the Act which, because of
other amendments, are no longer necessary.
And sections 21, 22 and 23 provide exceptions
to the Customs Tariff.
Outside of these
sections that I have referred to, there is not
much else in the Bill for study.
I could not describe the Bill better than
was done in the other House by the Minister
of National Revenue. He said:
This Bill relates almost entirely to matters
contained in the budget resolutions. One or
two administrative items have been added for
the purpose of elarifying the Special War
Revenue Act.
The most important parts are the schedules
concerning stamps, cigars, cigarettes, sugar,
tires, and se forth.
I should also like to draw the attention of
honourable members to section 16, which
covera deductions, refunds and drawbacks.
Formerly various sections of the Act provided for the refunding of claims for sales
tax where overpayments had occurred, but
there was no similar provision in the case
of overpayments of other taxes. This new
section is a consolidation of those sections
and applies te all such refunds.
I do not think I need add anything further
to the explanatory notes. These, I think,
honourable senators will find very helpful in
their study of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. KING moved that the Bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking
and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
I have no
objection te the motion, but in view of the
fact that the Bill has been se satisfactorily
dealt with by the honourable senator who has
just taken his seat (Hon. Mr. Beauregard), I
should not think any useful purpose would be
served by referring it te the Banking and
Commerce Committee. However, if it is the
wish of the honourable leader opposite, I am
quite prepared te agree te the course proposed.
Hon. Mr. KING: The only thing I have
in mind is that earlier in the session we authorized our Standing Committee on Finance
te deal with financial bills in anticipation of
their reaching the Senate. As we have followed that procedure in this instance, I think
it would be better te refer the Bill te that
committee for consideration and report.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: There is apparently a misunderstanding as to which conmittee is to deal with the Bill. I understood
the honourable leader to say the Banking and
Commerce Committee.

The explanatory notes to the Bill are quite
complete and make abundantly clear the purpose
of each amendment.
(Signed) J. F. MacNeill,
Law Clerk and Parliamentary
Counsel.

Hon. Mr. KING: No; the Finance Conmittee. In peace-time we do not worry much
about budget resolutions and bills based on
them, but, as stated before, we must now deal
with war budgets. It will be found that the
amendments contained in this Bill have to do
largely with measures relating to the war.
Therefore I think it better to refer the Bill to
the Finance Committee.

The motion was agreed to and the Bill
was read the second time.

The motion, as amended, was agreed to.

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. KING: I would move that the
Bill be referred to the Committee on Finance.
The motion was agreed to.
CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL
SECOND READING

EXCISE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading
of Bill 59, an Act to amend the Excise Act,
1934.
He said: Honourable senators, my honourable friend the senator from Wellington (Hon.
Mr. Howard) has been good enough to consent
to explain this Bill. I move the second reading.
Hon. C. B. HOWARD: Honourable senators, this is an Act to amend the Excise Act of
1934. As was stated a moment ago in relation
to the previous measure, this Bill has been
before the Finance Committee, where questions have been asked and answered, and the
Minister and the proper authorities of the
department have given the fullest explanation.
The changes in the Act are most clearly set
forth on the right-hand pages of the Bill,
opposite the text. The note on section 43
explains most of the changes. The purpose of
the Bill is, first, to bring the Act up to date,
and, second, to give effect to the changes in
the budget, according to the resolutions of
March 2, 1943.
The Bill has been referred to the Law Clerk
of the Senate, who has examined it, and wiio
gives the following opinion on the matter:
I have examined this Bill tharoughly and
found it to be a routine departmental enactment to bring the basic Act up te date.
The net results of the Bill of this session are
the deletion of a few words here, the addition
of a few words there, the removal of obsolete
sections from the basic Act and the addition
thereto of two sections to bring it in line with
the 1943 budget.
I have checked the references te the basic
Act and amending Acts and found them all to
be in order.
In a few words, the Bill is a well drawn one
which well and clearly effects purely routine
amendments. I have, therefore, no amendments
to propose to it.
Hon. Mr. KING.

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading
of Bill 60, an Act to amend the Customs
Tariff.
He said: Honourable senators, my good
friend from Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Beauregard)
has consented to give the explanation of this
Bill also. I have asked him to do this because
I think he is well qualified, and because the
phraseology is of a character that sometimes
worries me. I have no doubt lie will make the
Bill clear to you.
Hon. ELIE BEAUREGARD: Honourable
senators, there is not much to be said about
this Bill, which amends the Customs Tariff.
The main feature of the Bill is contained in
the schedule annexed, which refers to some
six or seven articles and which I shall not
read. The second item provides for an increase of $2 per gallon on liquor. This is
completely summarized, I think, by what was
said in the other House by Mr. Castleden and
Mr. Ilsley. Mr. Castleden said:
The question I asked was whvether the effects
of this section will be merely to increase the
duty on the goods mentioned by $2 a gallon.
To which Mr. Ilsley replied:
Yes, that is it.
I do not think there is anything else in the
Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. KING: I would move that this
Bill be referred to the Finance Committee.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable members,
it strikes me that the procedure being followed
is, in a sense, quite unnecessary. As I understand it, these bills have all been before the
committee, which has approved of them.

APRIL 19, 1943
Hon. Mr. KING: No. They were not ready
for approval. They were only before the committee in anticipation of their coming to this
House.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: They have been before
the committee.
Hon. Mr. KING: In an informal way.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: In more than an informal way, I think, because the aspertion has
been made that the committee had the benefit
of the presence of officials and others to explain the Bills.
Hon. Mr. KING: Right. That was in pursuance of the resolution the Senate passed the
other night, in order that we might have a
preview of the legislation.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: May I inquire whether
this Bill will come before Committee of the
Whole House?
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes, to-morrow.
The motion was agreed to.
ADJOURNMENT-BUSINESS OF THE
SENATE
Hon. Mr. KING: I would move that the
Senate do now adjourn.
* Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: May I ask the
leader whether he has any idea when the
budget and the resolutions will reach this
House? And has he in mind what day this
week we shall adjourn, or whether we shall
adjourn at all?
Hon. Mr. KING: I think the Minister and
the Government are largely in the handa of
the House of Commons as yet in regard to
budget matters. I wàs talking to the Minister
before dinner, and he hopes the Bill before
the Commons will pass to-morrow, or possibly
this evening. If it does, we should have it
either to-morrow afternoon or to-morrow evening. It is the -desire of the Government to
secure the Royal Assent to these financial
measures on Wednesday afternoon at a
quarter to six.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: That is not
allowing very much time.
Hon. Mr. KING: No, but there has been a
great deal of time devoted to- them in the
other House.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: May I inquire what is

Hon. Mr. KING: The important measure
that is yet to come to us is the Income Tax
Bill, which is still being debated in the House
of Commons.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: There are no estimates?
Hon. Mr. KING: No.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That is what I

INCOME WAR TAX BILL
SUSPENSION OF RULES

Hon. J. H. KING moved:
That Rules 23, 24 and 63 be suspended in so
far as they relate to the Bill intituled: "An Act
to amend the Income War Tax Act."
He said: In moving this motion, I think I
should inform the Senate as to the possibility
of our adjourning to-morrow afternoon. Parliament has been in session for about three
months. The bills which are gradually coming
to us from the House of Commons relate
largely to amendments to various Acts. These
amendments are necessary for administrative
purposes in order to meet war conditions. It
is the hope, in fact the intention, of the
Government to ask for Royal Assent to the
bills that we may pass this afternoon and tomorrow prior to six o'clock. Naturally, the
Government desires to have these measures
enacted before Parliament adjourns for the
Easter recess, but it is not throwing t'bem at
the Senate with the idea of crowding us. I
think the bills which the other House passed
last night we shall be able to deal with in
time for Royal Assent to-morrow. The Income
Tax Bill is still under debate in the Commons.
but I have reason to believe it will probably
pass that House and be available for us tomorrow morning, if we meet-as I think we
should-at 11 o'clock. I would suggest that
after we have given the Bill second reading
we take it up in Committee of the Whole.
Fortunately, the resolution pertaining to the
Bill has been before the Committee on
Finance, and a number of members who attended the meeting of that committee are
familiar with the objects of the resolution and
of the Bill based on it.
If we are
in a position shortly after four o'clock to
return the Bill to the Commons. with or
without amendment, we can probably proceed soon after to the Royal Assent.
If that is net possible, and the members of
the Senate desire more time, I would suggest
that we adjourn during pleasure, that the
Royal Assent be given to those Bills which
are ready, and that we meet at eight o'clock
to-morrow evening and go on with our discussion on the Income Tax measure and carry
Hon. Mr. BEAUREGARD.

it over to Thursday. If we are not through
by Thursday, I would then propose that we
adjourn over Good Friday and meet on
Saturday, by which time, I should think, we
ought to be able to conclude our consideration of the Bill. I think it should be our
effort to clear the slate of these important
measures before the Senate adjourns for
Easter, se that we may decide definitely at
what time we shall return after the recess. If
things break as we hope they will, and we
receive the Bill to-morrow morning, we should
be able to conclude our deliberations on it
without undue hurry or rush.
That is the
position I am taking in regard to the bills.
Last night I gave notice of this motion in
order that we might be ready to proceed from
one stage to another without delay until we
complete our deliberations, and for that reason
I would ask to have the motion put.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE:
Honourable
senators, I am quite pleased to hear the leader
say that we are not going to be rushed. I
am still of the opinion that we are going to
be very much rushed, and that it may be
necessary to sit on Saturday. It may also be
necessary for some of the important bills,
espccially the one relating to the extension of
the powers of the Department of Munitions
and Supply, to stand over until after Easter.
As I understand the effect of the suspension
of the rules, as moved by the honiourable
leader, bills can get first. second and third'
readings without waiting for the usual time to
intervene between two stages.
Hon. Mr. KING:
the Senate.

With

the consent of

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Quite so. The
honourable leader can be sure that in performing our full duties in regard to these
bills, and in obtaining the information desired by members of this Chamber, we shall
do everything we can to expedite matters.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Wbiie the excess

necessitated by the great war expendituýre; sa
I do not see that any abjection can be made

the war is over there will be considerable
modification in the excess profits taxes, as an
incentive ta the manufacturers of this country

a goad many jobs for the large number of

aliowances and exceptianal considerations of
that kind. I do flot presumne it does. but I
sbould like to have the point cleared up.
Hon. Mr. KING: I think flot.
I have very littie to say on this Bill, honourabie senators. It is a departmental Bill containing certain amendments, one of whicb deals
with cil and gas royalties and was much
discussed inanother place. The arnendment is
intended ta bring the relevant section of this
Act in line with the corresponding section of
the Income Tax Act, I understand.
Then there is a departrnental amnendrnent
regarding the paying of taxes by instaiment.
And there is a section covering reference to
the Treasury Board. This has to do with cases
wbere there is a dispute and the Treasury
Board suspects the taxpayer bas not made a

wbat it considers to be the proper order, wbicb

section in the Income Tax Act, was also rnuch
discussed in another place..
I wouid suggest that, if it is agreeabie ta

reading and send tbe Bill to our Finance Committee, wbich could consider it to-marrow, with
the beip of departrnental officiais, and report
ta us in tbe afternoon.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Honourable senators,
this question of ail and gas royalties bas been
much discussed and is one of great importance
in respect to tbe development of our own
production in Canada. If departmental officials
are to corne before us to-marraw they sbould
be in a position ta give us information in detail.
A great many people in Western Canada are
much interested in having some chan ge made.
in the present situation. I presumne this Bill
provides for a change; so a fuit expianation
in committee would be very helpful.
Hon. Mr. KING: We shail try to have the
officers there to expiain this.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Honourabie
senators, if 1 rnay be ailowed to rise again, I
migbt say that I bave read the discussion in
another place, and it is of course manifest that
Parliarnent is divesting itseif of a great deai of
authority, whioh is being given ta the Treasury
Board; but at the sarne time I have considerable sympatby with the Minister of Finance in
bis attempt ta block up the baies, as be puts it.

in the present circumstances, and on account
of the reason advanced by the Minister, I do
not feel justified in offering any objection.

OTTAWA

AGREEMENT BILL

FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 70, an Act to authorize an
agreement between His Majesty the King and
the Corporation of the City of Ottawa.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND

RIEADING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading
of the Bill.
He said: Honourable senators, I do not
think this Bill requires any long explanation.
It is a hardy annual, which has appeared in its
present form since 1925.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: No alterations?
Hon. Mr. KING: No alterations. In 1925 a
new contract was made with the City of
Ottawa, extending the payment from $75,000 to
$100,000, and the term to 1930; and since 1930
the agreement has been renewed annually. This
sum of $100,000 that the Government pays the
City of Ottawa every year is not in lieu of
taxes. If one looks back in the records for the
occasion when the Government first recognized
some responsibility towards the City, it will be
foiind that in 1898, I think it was, Sir Wilfrid
Laurier suggested the setting up of a commission for the beautification of Ottawa, and at
that time a grant of some $60.000 was made.
It was assumed by the Covernment that the
sprinkling and other care of certain streets
would be looked after out of that grant. In 1920
it was agreed that the annual payment should
be increased to $75,000, and the Government
undertook to pay for certain services rendered
by the City-so much for water metered into
buildings, for example-but never at any time
has there been an agreement to pay anything
in lieu of taxes. I make this statement because
the question is always brought up when the
agreement is before Parliament for renewal. I
followed the debate in the House of Commons
last night. It was not long, and I gleaned
lion. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

from it that there is an understanding between
the City and the Government to have the
present contract renewed annually until the
end of the war.
Hon. W. RUPERT DAVIES: Honourable
senators, I should like to ask the honourable
leader of the House a question. I read very
carefully in Hansard the discussions that occurred on this Bill in another place last night,
and I notice that in addition to the $100,000
which the City of Ottawa receives from the
Dominion Government under this agreement,
it gets $333.000 annually through the Federal
District Commission, which amount is largely
spent in the city. That is a total of $433,000 a
year. However, we will deal with the $100,000,
which is a lot of money. It means that in ten
years the City of Ottawa has received $1,000.000 of the taxpayers' money for certain services which were supposed to be supplied to
the Government of this country. I notice that
a large part of the $100,000 is presumably contributed for fire protection, and I should like
to ask whether this House bas any information as to how well equipped the city's fire
department is to cope with a big fire in one
of the Government buildings, say the Parliament buildings.
Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, I
do not know that I am able to give an authoritative answer. At one time I did know, for I
was Minister of Public Works when the contract was made in 1925. We satisfied ourselves
then that the equipment and facilities available
in Ottawa were of a character quite suitable
to a city of its size.
Hon Mr. McRAE: Honourable senators, I
think it right be well to mention that this
grant is a special provision for Ottawa. The
Government lias property in various other
cities, which supply water and fire protection
and the usual services, and exempt the buildings from taxation. I am not objecting to the
Bill, but, following up the remarks of the
bonourable senator from Kingston (Hon. Mr.
Davies), I merely want to point out that this
grant is a special faveur to the City of Ottawa,
which it should very much appreciate.
The motion was agreed te, and the Bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. KING moved the third reading of
the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

The Orders stand.
BUSINESS 0F THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, we
could perhaps adjourn now until this evening.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The motion for
the second reading of Bill 7, the Department
of Munitions and Suppiy Bill, was lef t in
abeyance.
Hon. Mr. KING: In deference to the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne),
who has said he desires to make a study of
this Bill, I would suggest we adjourn now and
resume this evening at 8 o'clock, to take up
the Bill then. Would that be satisfactory?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Quite.
Hon. Mr. KING: In that case I would fnove
that when the House adjourns this afternoon
it stand adjourned until 8 o'clock this evening.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: Caîl it six o'elock.
It occurs to me that if the honourable leader's
motion were carried, our sitting this evening
would be the second separàte sitting for to-day,
and that would be a little bard on bonourable
members wbo are absent. I think the proper
procedure would be for His Honour to eali it
six o'clock, and then we should meet at eight
as a matter of course.
Hon. Mr. KING: Tbank you.
Hon. Mr. CALiDER: We could adjourn
during pleasure, on the understanding that
we meet again at eigbt o'clock.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: Either procedure
would do.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: The best pro cedure, it
seems to me, would be to cal] it six o'clock.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes. Then we sbould
not need a motion to meet at eight.
Hon. Mr. KING: Ail rigbt.
At six o'ciock the Senate took recess.

The Senate resumed at eight o'clock.
GASOLINE RATIONING DISCRIMINATION AS BETWEEN COMMONS
AND SENATE
QUESTION 0F PRIVILEGE

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Honourable senstors, I rise to a question of priviiege. I am
informed that members of the Parliament of
Canada are not ail treated alike in regard
to gasoline rationing. My information, whicb
I believe to be autbentic, is that members of
the 'House of Commons, in addition to tbeir
AA rating, are entitled to a category A coupon
book. This gives themn sixty units more than
members of the Senate. Members of this
Chamber, I am confident, are doing just as
much as members of the other House in
furthering the war effort, and undoubtedly during tbe Easter recess every senator will be
actively engaged in the war loan campaign,
doing bis best to induce our citizens to buy
war bonds. I fail to see any valid reason for
this discrimination between members of the
two Houses of Parliament.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Hear, bear.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Last year 98 per
cent of my automobile travel was for purposes similar to those for wbich members of
the House of Commons use their cars. I hope
the honourable leader of the House (Hon. Mr.
King) will convey to the powers that be my
submission that there should be no discrimination between members of the House of
Commons and memibers of the Senate in
regard to gasoline categories.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: Hear, bear.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Surely we are ail
making our full contribution to the war effort,
and the Oul Controller sbould treat us ail alike.
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable members, I
tbink we appreciate the remarks of tbe
honourable senator from St. Jean Baptiste
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien). I myseif have littie
knowledge of the allotment of gasoline to
motorists. Having been for many years in no
position to own a motor-car, I am not; worried
about gas rationing categories. But if tbere
is discrimination of the character alleged by
the honourable gentleman, I think bis point is
well taken, and I shall be pleased to bring
tbe matter to tbe notice of the Minister, so
tbat he in turn may bring it to the attention
of the Oul Controller. Probably no persons
realize more than members of Parliament bow
essential it is to conserve every ounce of
gasoline, and I am sure that if members of tbe
Senate are put on the same basis as members
of the House of Commons they will use their

186

extra supply of gasoline wiîh the greatest caro.
In fact, I tlîink we iriglh well assuire the
Ministor and the Controller Iliat, being older,
wve are likely 10 ho extremely moderate in the
use of our cars.
Hon. A. D. MeRAF: We«get most of our
gasoline fromi the United States. and their

DEPARTMENT 0F MUNITIONS
SUPPLY BILL
SECOND

AND

READING

Hon. J. H. KIN_ýG moved the second reading of Bill 7, an Act to amend the Department of Munitions and Suppiy Act.
H1e said: Honourable senators, Ibis is
probabiy one of the most important buis
to be enacted since the war began. The
Department of Munitions and Supply Act
came into being in 1940 for a lirnited period,
which expires in April of this year. It is
necessary that it be re-enacted to make provision for the conditions that exist to-day.
The resuits under this measure have been
astounding. An expenditure of some eight
hundred million dollars bas 'been made by the
G3vernment of Canada in equipping buildings
and rnaking arrangements for the manufacture
of war materials, and Canada bas become one
of the world's great nations in the production
of implements of war.
The purpose of the Bill introduced to-day
is to enable continuance of the operations
carried on under the Minister of Munitions
and Supply. I am asking Mr. Kennedy, an
officer of the department, to coame to the
floor to chcck and advise me as I go along.
Is it the inHon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
tention of the leader to move the House
Committee of the Whole?
I had not thought of
Hon. Mr. KING:
doing that now. I thought that we might
go over the sections of the Bill as they occur,
that I might givè the explanations, and then,
if necessary, we could go into committee.
Had we not
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
better continue the debate on the second
reading hefore going into the details of the
Bill?
Hon. Mr. KING: I ar n ot entering into
great detail. I arn just going over the Bill
from section to section. I do not intend
to make a speech on the Bill. My remarks
are merely bo caîl attention to the importance of the legislation and the necessity
of this Bill in order that the activities carried on under the original measure may
continue.

By section 6 power is given to the Minister

articles that his department is dealing witb,
and penalties are provided against persons who
refuse to provide storage. There are also provisions for an appeal from the ordcr of the
Minister, and for hearing of the appeal, and
50

on.

Section 9 embodies an amend.ment which in
the Act will be section 17. This is the section
in which my honourable friend is interested.
In the original Act provision was made for its
termînation in April of this year. There is no
provision of that kind in the present Bill. My
honourable friend bas spoken to me personally
on this point and urged that a date of expiry
should be set.
1 have consulted the Minister in this regard.
He advises me that it would at present be
impossible to fix any date when the work of
the department should cease, and I think, anyone on reflection ivill appreciate the Minister's
difficulty in fixing a date in 194,5, 1946, 1947,
1948, 1949 or 1950. -A good deal of property is
involved. The department will be functioning
at least during the war period. After the war
the salvage and disposal of the department's
properties to the best advantage will take a
considerable period to work out. Then there
are certain functions which it might be considered proper for the Government to retain
after the war is over, such as control of
arsenals and the manufacture of munitions.
Whether these would remain entirely under
Government operation is not yet known. The
Minister feels that nothing would be gained by
the provision that the Act should terminate in
April, 1946. If by that time the war i* ovr
the Parliament of Canada can pass legisiation
repealing the Act and setting up whatever
authority may be required to carry on the
work of the department. I am speaking on
this question in adx ance of my bunourable
friend, because he bas intimnated to me that
he is most desirous of having a date fixed for
the expiry of the Act.
I think the Bill should go to the Committee
on Finance, to be thoroughly considered section
by section. I move that the Bill be now read
a second timne.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I kn-ow that every honourable member of this House is seized of the fact that
this is the most importaiit legislation that bas
ever come before Parliamnent. By this measure
Parliament is relinquishing virtually ail its
rights and privileges to the Minister and the

department. I do not objeet to that being
done during the war, because it is necesseary.
I do feel, however, that there ought to be a
date fixed for terminating the legislation.
In 1945 the if e of this Government and of
the House of Commons expires. We cannot
foreteli wbat Government may be in office
then, and therefore I shudder to think of the
consequences of conferring such tremendous
powers as those granted by this measure, with
no provision for their termination. I do not
agree with the reasons which my honourable
friend bas advanced, and which. have been
furnished bim by the Minister, to show why a
date could not be fixed for the expiration of
this measure.
I intend later on to move in amendment
that the powers to be granted by this Bill
shahl ceaie in April, 1945. If at that time the
war is still going on, the Government can
proceed under the War Measures Act. There
is no need of rushing the Bill through at this
sitting of the Huse, for an Order in Cotincil
bas been passed under the War Measures Act
extending the authority and power of the
Minister to carry on until the end of this
Parliament. The Minister would be well
advised to allow this tremendously important
Bill to stand over. It is too important to be
rushed through- juat before the Enster recess.
The honourable leader has stated that be
intends to move that the Bill be referred to
thie Finance Commiittee. With ail due respect
to that coanmittee, I should, much prefer that
it be dealt with by the Conimittee on Banking
and Commerce. After the Easter recess most
of the senators not now in their seats will have
returned. AIl the skill and ability of the
legal gentlemen who are members of this
bouse will be needed wben we examine the Bihl
section by section. I do not say that under
the Bill in its present form irreguýlarities wihl
arise, but they miglit. In any event it is the
duty of honourable senators to have so important a Bihl considered clause by clause in
the Banking and Commerce Committee hefore
it is examined by Committee of the Wihole.
Again I urge the Minister to have the Bihl
referred to the Banking and Commerce Commîttee, to be taken up after the Easter recess.
The honourable leader bas pointed out that
the Minister of the department and persons
aissociated with him have under their control
expenditures amounting to the vast sum of
$800,000,000. Under this Bill as now drafted
Perliament will get on.ly such information
relative to those expenditures as the Minister
may be disposed to give. As I said a moment
ago, ahl the powers of Parliament are contained
in the Bill. These powers are of course necessary for the department during war-tîme, but

SENATE
thcy will nt
*be necessary under post-war
conditions. With grave appreheosion I view
what mav happen to the industrial life of this
country after the war ceases, if a Goverroment
cornes inte power that does ot see fit to repoal
this legisiation. Therefore I believe that in
ail fairness t.o the Minister and te those associated with bim it is absohitely necessary th-at
a date be fixed for the termination of the Act.
The Department of Munitions and Supply
hias donc a very gond job and should be
given full credit; but ton little credit lias bcen

truly rerrnarkable how our captains of industry

before been produced in this country. They
desorve tbe fci11cst credit net only from the
Gov errnent and Parliament, but also from the
people of Canada.
Another tribute 1 wisb to pay te those

that thcv have nt soughit te make any profit

criticizing the "huige'" profits that Canadian
industrialists are mnaking, and they are sortetumes referred te> as " profiteers." This attitude
is a1together unfair. The so-called profiteers
have made a very fine recrd for bnth the
quality and quantitv of their war production,
and 1 arn confident they will strive te improve
even on that fine record.
In moving my anrdmnt I trust that
honourable scnators on the other side of
the Houýe wiîll appreciate that 1 arn net doing
so w'ith any ulterior political motive. Certainly I liave mie I bave in rny minci net

APRIL 21, 1943
Honourable senators,
Hon. Mr. LEGER:
may I call attention to rule 65, which, although it deals with the reconsideration of
clauses, would imply that a senator may at
any time move almost anything. The rule
says:
A senator may, at any time before a bill is
passed, move for the reconsideration of any
clause thereof, already passed.
This would indicate that even after a bill is
given third reading, a motion can be made in
relation to it. As I read the rule, a senator may
move at any time, at any stage of a bill, any
amendment he chooses; and I take it that that
is why there is no restricting clause specifying
at what time an amendment should be moved.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: If His Honour
the Speaker will allow me: he no doubt has
noticed, as I did when I first came into this
honourable Chamber, that the rules of the
Senate are entirely different from those of
the other House. In moving my amendment I
think I am within the somewhat lax rules-if I
may so describe them-that at different times
have prevailed in this House. However, I
do not want to create a precedent, and if it
suits Your Honour and other honourable members better that I move in Committee of the
Whole, that is quite satisfactory to me.
Hon. Mr. KING: The honouraible gentleman has indicated that it would be satisfactory to him to move his amendment in
committee. Such, I believe, has been the
usual practice in this Chamber. In view of his
suggestion that he will postpone his motion,
I would now propose that we continue the
discussion on the Bill.
These war measures have all been going to
the Committee on Finance. I-t is well organized,
there is very good legal talent on it, and its
members are here to-day. It is a large committee and can very well go over this Bill,
which requires careful consideration. Therefore it is my intention to move that the Bill
be referred to that committee.
As soon as the discussion here is concluded,
we should, I think, adjourn during pleasure.
Then, if it is convenient, the committee could
meet at two or two-thirty, give the Bill careful
consideration-which should not take more
than an hour or so - and report it to the
House. We can then go into Committee of
the Whole on the Bill, and my honourable
friend can move his amendment if he so
desires.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: The honourable
the leader has made no response to my urgent
request that this House do not proceed with
this Bill, and that it stand over until after the
recess.

191

Hon. Mr. KING: I am speaking only on the
point of order.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: There is no
urgency for the passing of this Bill. It will
do as well after the recess.
With regard to the committees, may I point
out that the Standing Committee on Banking
and Commerce, which is very much larger
than the Finance Committee, always deals
with matters of this kind. While I am not
criticizing the Finance Committee or its able
chairman, I do think it would be a mistake to
refer this Bill to that committee. I would
urge my honourable friend to have it referred
to the Committee on Banking and Commerce,
if he will not agree to a postponement.
Hon. Mr. KING: After Parliament has been
in session for three months, it would be, in my
opinion, a lamentable thing that the Senate,
knowing the character of this Bill and the difficulty the Minister had in getting it before the
House of Commons, should adjourn for a
period of two or three weeks without reaching
a decision on its merits or demerits. I think it
should be assented to this afternoon, along with
the other measures that are ready. It would be
bad for the country to learn that this Bill,
which is so important and has such an effect on
the production of munitions and war supplies, had been delayed for any length of time.
If its principle is right, and if the legislation
is doing the work intended-and I think we all
agree that it is-in my opinion we should see
to it that the Bill is ready for Royal Assent
to-day.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: As Your Honour
will note, what is going on now is entirely different from what would occur in the other
House. The Leader of the Opposition there
would be allowed to speak only once on the
motion for second reading. Here we have not
followed that rule, but have carried, on the
debate on the motion for second reading as
though we were in Committee of the Whole.
Therefore I have no apology to offer for rising
so often.

I cannot follow the honourable leader's logic.
We are not delaying the Minister of Munitions and Supply or his department.
Hon. Mr. KING: The Bill should pass.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: There is no particular reason why this Bill should pass to-day
or to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. KING: I think there is very great
reason.
No reason in
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
the world.. The Minister and the department have until the end of this session all

192

SENATE

the power that the Bill can give. Whiat
reason is there why the measure should be
rushed through now? I am serious about
this. The Bill is a tremendously important one.
Parliament is asked to abandon virtually all
its authority and rights to the Minister and
the department, yet in face of that the honourable leader says it is urgent that the Bill
be rushed through now. I strenuously object
to that. I say the honourable leader would be
wrong to insist on this Bill being passed
immediately. To hold it here for further
consideration would certainly not delay the
Minister or the department; for, as I said a
moment ago, they have full authority to carry
on until the end of the session.
On this side of the House we have a
number of good legal men, and I do not suppose they are members of the Finance Committee. That is another reason why I urge
that the Bill be delayed: I want it to go
before flic B3anking and Commerce Committee. Honourable members of this House who
are lawyers will take one day, or probably
two days, to go through this extremely serious
piece of legislation. My honourable friend
is treating the Senate and Parliament lightly
when he says: "This is a Government Bill;
it must go through now; we want to have
Royal Assent to-day." There is no reason in
the world, why the Bill should be adopted
to-day, or be assented to to-day. We have
our rights here, and if I had a majority behind
me I certainly would not allow the Bill to pass
this afternoon.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
in the remarks I am going to make I think
J should pay a compliment, a high compliment, to the Minister of Munitions and
Supply. What has been accomplished in his
department is something every Canadian can
well feel proud of. That bas resulted from
three things: first, the Minister's ability as
an organizer; second, the very wonderful way
in which the industries of the country have
adjusted themselves to war production; and,
third, but by no means last, the adaptability
of Canadian labour, and the results which
Canadian labour lias greatly helped to bring
about. What bas been done is amazing. I
am not one of those who quibble about
mistakes here and there down the line. They
always occur in big business, and this is the
largest business Canada bas ever attempted,
We have to take the situation by and large,
and I repeat that we can well be proud of
the results that have been accomplished.
Having said that, I trust honourable senators
will feel that I am approaching this Bill in
an unbiased way. I might, if I am permitted
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

to digress for a moment, refer to the production under our Department of Munitions and
Supply. Our situation is similar to that in
the United States: both countries have produced more war materials than are needed
or can be used at the moment. To realize
the truth of this, one bas only to look at
the munitions and other equipment stored on
railway sidings in this country and in the
country to the south. There are two reasons
why so much material is being held in this
way. One reason, I presume, is lack of
shipping; another is that much of this material
will undoubtedly not be needed until we start
a second front. It is probably net practical
to keep on producing similar material to an
unlimited extent, because within a short time
improveuments may be developed that will
make new types of equipment necessary.
It is evident that if we are going to reduce
munitions production-and that appears to be
in the offing-there will be a great displacement of men; and these men, as I gather
from the Press here and across the line, will
be absorbed in other industries. I think it
might be well if a frank statement were made
as to that in both countries. I recently read
in the American papers that as many as
550,000 men now engaged in production of
munitions and armaments will be let out of
that employment in the next sixty days. So
far as is possible, these men will doubtless
be put to work on the building of ships and
airplanes, the two most urgent requirements.
The third most urgent requirement is agricultural production. As to this, I have no
definite information, but I am sure the Government will be faced with a very hard, task
in taking men out of munitions plants and
putting them back on the farms. Yet, unless
we relieve the farn labour situation, our
agricultural production, whicb is one of our
war efforts, will be disappointing.
I now come to the Bill that is before us.
J must say I was appalled when the honourable leader of the House (Hon. Mr. King)
intimated to us wbat we were expected te do
in the next twenty-four heurs. It is not
humanly possible for us to do that and
properly discharge our duties as members of
this Hoiuse. Personally, as a protest against
the rushing through of measures here, without
due consideration, J prefer to vote against
every bill with regard to which I have not
had an opportunity to do more than scan its
sections. I have the greatest respect for the
abilities of the members of this honourable
House, and I think it would be to the
advantage of the Government and of the
nation-I know it would be-if honourable
members had adequate time to consider im-

APRIL 21, 1943
portant bis such as this. In many cases
there would be no need for our making the
slightest changes in the bis, but we want
time to go over them ail, to make sure they
contain no inconsistencies, that they are in
keeping with other legislation on the Statute
Book. In short, we want an opportunity for
generally improving legisiation, as we have
been doing in this House for the last tweive
years, to my knowiedge.
We are asked to pass on a lot of legisiation.
We are not rubber stamps for the other House.
We are here as mature, thoughtful and; I hope,
intelligent individuals, charged, under our oath
of office, to discharge properly our duties as
senators of Canada. And I submit to every
honourable senator that the programme we are
asked to approve in the next twenty-four
hours does not give an opportunity for the
exercise of our best judgment.
The Senate is the safeguard of legislation in
this country. This honourable House perforrna a valuable service in the interests of
the people; it has proven that over the years.
Are we to forgo even the semblance of reason
by rushing through much legislation in the
next twenty-four hours? If it were, absolutely
essential that the legisiation should be rushed
through, ail well and good; we should meet
the emergency. But the Bill before us can
be deait with after Easter just as weli as now;
it is a measure that wiil not be necessary for
sorne months to come. Why there, should be
a desire to clear the decks before Easter, I do
not know. Ail I arn pleading for is an opportunity to go into these important matters
rntelligently, to use our grey matter, our
common sense, and to discharge the obligations
which we have pledged ourselves to assume.
Other important legislation is to come. before
us to-day. The same rernarks apply to that.
Honourable senators, do flot let us be ridiculous in the eyes of the country. Do not
let it be said that we were a rubber stamp for
the other House. Let us be fair to ourselves,
and we shall be fair to the nation.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I want to have an expression of
opinion 'by this Huse, through a division orvote. I therefore move, in amendment, that
this Bill be not now read a second time, but
that the second reading be postponed until
after the Easter recess.
Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, I
wish to speak briefly to that amendrnent. I do
not know just what rny honourabie friend has
in mind this rnorning. We are dealing with
matters of great importance. This is one of the
most important pieces of legislation that have
corne before us, and, to say it is not urgent
is contrary to the fact. The Bill contains
72542-13

193

provisions that the Minister finds he urgently
needs now. I amn not going to take the position
th-at this Bill must have Royal Assent to-day,
but 1 do know the d-esire of the Govern'ment in
regard to this and other legisiation that will
be before us to-day.
So far as the Senate is concerned, we have
been coming and going; we have not, been
overworked. As I said yesterday, if we cannot get finality on these measures to-day, we
shaîl have assent at a quarter to six to-night
to the Bills that are already passed, and we
shahl adjourn then and carry on to-rnorrow. We
oan also carry on on Saturd-ay, and I think
the Government has a right to ask honourabie
members to remain in their places and dispose
of this legisiation that is before us. To say
it is not important and that it can wait tili'
after Easter is not a fair statement, because
it concerns matters that are of importance, not
only to the Government, but to the whole
nation. If it is not agreeable to the Senate
to pass this measure to-day, I amn satisfied to
let it stand over until to-morrow, when we
can taýke it up again.
If rny honourable friend, (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne) is serious in moving his motion,
we shahl have to vote," I suppose; but I think
it would be better not to. put that motion. I
have no desire, and I know the Governxnent
has no desire, to crowd legisiation. Indeed,
we have aiready shown a disposition againat
crowding, in the fact that we are flot asking
for assent to-day to sorne bis that are ve-ry
important and. would ordinarily have been
rushed through this bouse. We are willing
to wait. But we do think that certain buis
now before us shouid be enacted before the
Easter recess. Even, if we did not ge-t Royal
Assent to the income tax legishation, the mere
fact that we had passed the Bill would give
assurance net only to the Government, but
aiso to those, administering the Act, that the
legisiation is in its final form. But I think
that for appearance sake alone we should, proceed to pass this Bull. It is for the Senate ta
decide whether we shall continue to deaI witli
the mtasure this afternoon. If we are not
prepared to do sa now, we shoud continue in
session until this and the other bis are
properiy dealt with,. takre what time it rnay.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: My motion is
before the bouse.
Hon. Mr. KING: I have spoken ta the
motion. I have intervened, ondy once or
twice in the deýbate.

senators, throughout the session the officiai

by resorting to Orders in Council. The only
reason why the Minister of Munitions and
Supply asked for the Order in Council which
bas been mentioned was the impossibility of
getting this amending Bill passed before the
date of expiry of the original Act. So, if
consideration of this Bill is to be deferred until
after the Easter recess, the delay will have
the effect of continuing the Order in Council
in force, and to that extent taking away from
the authority of Parliament. This Bill does
not differ very greatly from the Act of 1940,
and if my honourable friend on the opposite
side wants to limit its d'uration to 1945 he can
easily move the desired amendment in Committee of the Whole. It seems to me the real
bone of contention is that the powers conferred by this measure can be exercised after
the war is over. That might be a reasonable
objection, but in any event it can be -raised
when the Bill is in committee.
Hon. C. W. ROBINSON: Honourable members, there bas been a great deal of talk about
holidays. After listening to the discussion I
feel that we have work to do in these days
when we are passing through one of the greatest
crises in the history of the world. Why should
we even mention holidays? Why not go on
with our work, sit on holidays, even on
Sundays if necessary, to do our duty?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
many members are absent.

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: It is their duty to
be present. Why do we want to talk about
holidays in these times?
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Question!

Hon. W. R. DAVIES: Honourable senators,
as a comparatively new member I find myself
in a rather difficult position. I have a good
deal of sympathy with the views expressed by
the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne) with regard to section 17. As a
business man, it does secm te me that duratien of the powers should net be limitless, but
I do net altogether agree with the amendment
moved by the honourable leader opposite,
which would extend their operation for five
years.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY:

No; two years.

Hon. Mr. DAVIES: I wonder why these
powers could net be extended from year to
year. I quite agree with the honourable leader
opposite that it might be very dangerous to
grant such powers as would enable any Government two or three years hence-and we do not
know what Government will be in power then
-to carry on business in competition with
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

private industry. I am in agreement, too, with
the honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. McRae) that this assembly should not be
regarded as a rubber stamp, but should give
careful consideration to every bill received
from the Commons. So far as I am concerned,
I should like to see this Bill fully explained,
either before a special committee or in Committee of the Whole. I do not quite understand
the latest amendment of the honourable leader
opposite, but I think I should have to vote
with hi.m on his previous amendment.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

APRIL 21, 1943
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I was paired with the
honourable senator from Lunenburg (Hon.
Mr. Duff). Had I voted, I should have
voted for the amendment.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The question,
honourable senators, is now on the main
motion.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: Before the motion is put, may I make a suggestion to the
leader of the Government? He has expressed
a desire to expedite the business of the
session by sending the Bil to a committee.
In this case I think it is merely a matter
of form to send the Bill to the Finance
Committee, and I would suggest that it be
referred to the Committee of the Whole.
The officers of the department are here.
Hon. Mr. KING: That sounds well, but it
hardly fits into the picture. Departmental
officers on the floor of the House cannot discuss the Bill and cannot be questioned as they
can be in a com.mittee outside of this Chamber.
I think better results wil1 be obtained in the
committee room. All honourable members
are entitled to be present, and can speak,
although only members of the committee can
vote. I am satisfied that the most satisfactory
way to proceed would be to send the Bill ta
one of the committees of the House. The
reason I suggest the Finance Committee is,
as I have said before, that certain other bills
have gone ta that committee. Its members
are just as well qualified as the members of the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce. As a matter of fact, I have been looking
up the names of the members of the committees and I find that many of those who are
on the Finance Committee are also members
of the Committee on Banking and Commerce.
I should prefer that we follow the procedure
of the last two or three days and send this
Bill ta the Finance Committee, where it can
be thoroughly discussed with the officials of the
department, or even with the Minister or his
deputy. When the Bill is returned to the
House, my honourable friend can move his
amendment in Committee of the Whole, if he
still wishes to do so.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. KING: I would move that the
Bill be sent to the Committee on Finance.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable senators, I
have no objection to this Bill going to the
Committee on Finance. On the other hand, the
suggestion has been made by the honourable
member to my right (Hon. Mr. Donnelly)
72542-131

that it be submitted ta Committee of the
Whole House. I rise merely to ask wxhat the
rule is. I inquired the other day whether one
of these bills-I do not remember whichwould be submitted ta Committee of the
Whole, and I was assured that it would be.
While I cannot speak with exactness, in the
case of a bill of this kind I should think that
under our rule there must be unanimous consent for not submitting it to Committee of
the Whole.
Hon. Mr. KING It is my intention ta
submit it after it is returned from the Committee on Finance.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Has this Bill already
been before the Committee on Finance?
Hon. Mr. KING: Nu.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: After it is through
the other committee it wi'll be sunbmitted ta
Committee of the Whole?
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes.
The motion was agreed to.
EXCESS PROFITS TAX BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. BEAUREGARD presented the
report of the Standing Committee on Finance
on Bill 69, au Act to amend the Excess Profits
Tax Act, 1940, with certain amendinents, and
moved concurrence therein.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I suppose the
leader has had from the Law Clerk the same
memorandum that I have received, to the
effect that this Bill should not be passed.
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes. We will not pass
it now. It will stand. We will adpt the
report. This is a companion Bill ta the
Incame Tax Bill.
The motion was agreed to.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: When will the
Finance Committee 'meet?
Hon. Mr. KING: I would suggest that we
adjourn during pleasure and that the Committee on Finance take under consideration
Bibl 7, an Act ta amendi the Department of
Munitions and Supply Act, at two-thirty this
afternoon.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Could the
honourable leader give us any indication of
what progress is being made in another place?
Hon. Mr. KING: The other House will
meet at two o'clock this afternoon.

SUPPLY BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. ELIE BEAUREGARD presented, and
moved concurrence in, the report of the
Standing Committee on Finance, ta whom was
referred Bill 7, an Act to amend the Department of Munitions and Supply Act.
He saidý: Honourable senators, the Committee on Finance beg to report this Bill with
one amendment, namely, that the word "eight"
be substituted for the word "seven" on page 7,
line 40.
The motion was agreed to.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: W/hen shall this
Bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. KING: There was a promise that
we would go into Committee of the Whole
if my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne)
desired. If not, I would move the third
reading now.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I move that the Bill be amended as
follows:
Page 8, lines Il to 34, both inclusive, and page
9, lines 1 to 9, both inclusive.
For clause nine substitute the following:
9. (1) Section seventeen of the said Act, as
enacted by section ten of chapter thirty-one of
the statutes of 1940, is repealed and the following substituted therefor:
17. The foregoing provisions of this Act shall
continue in force for a period of five years
beginning with the ninth day of April, 1940,
and shall then expire.
(2) The said Act is further amended by adding thereto the following as section seventeen A:
17A. No person shall be entitled to damages,
compensation or any other allowance for loss of
profit, direct or indirect, arising out of the
rescission or termination of(a) any contract entered into on or after
April ninth, nineteenth hundred and forty,
by such person with the Minister for or on
behalf of Ris Majesty the King in right Of
Canada, His Majesty's Government in the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, any other of His Majesty's Governments, or the Government of any allied or
associated power, or
(b) any contract entered into on or after
April ninth, nineteen hundred and forty, by
such person with any company all the issued
share capital of which (except directors'
qualifying shares) is held by the Minister in
trust for His Majesty the King in right of
Canada or for any of the Governments referred
ta in paragraph (a) of this section, or
(c) any contract entered into on or after
April ninth, nineteen hundred and forty, by
such person with any other person for purHon. Mr. KING.

poses directly related to or connected with
carrying out any contract described by paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section,
if such contract is so rescinded or terminated,
at any time before it is fully performed, pursuant to a power contained in such contract or
vested under the laws of Canada in the Governor
in Council or the Minister.
Hon. J. J. DONNELLY: Honourable members, the amendment proposed by the honourable leader on this side (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne)
is, I think. one which should meet with the
approval of the Senate. If we pass the Bill
with this amendnient, the Minister and his
department will have for the next two years
all the power that they would have if the
Bill passed in its present form. At the end
of that time, if Parliament wishes to extend
the Bill, it may do sa. But if the Senate
permits the Bill to pass without a time lim.it,
it abandons all control over this measure until
such time as some Government introduces or
some House of Commons passes a measure to
repeal this statute. As was pointed out in
com.mittee by the honourable leader on this
side (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne), we do not know
what Government may come into power.
There are surprises in election results sometimes. We might have a Government which
would be desirous of regimenting us all, and,
unless the amendment were inserted in the
Bill, such a Government could continue the
legislation as long as it liked. In those circumstances the Senate could have no say in
the matter until the Government introduced a
repealing Bill. So I think that if we are to
exercise such control as the Senate ought to
exercise over legislation of this kind, we should
insert a time limit in the Bill.
There is another reason why we should give
some consideration to this. The public of
this country are very much afraid that the
controls which are being exercised now may
extend on into peace-time. It is inherent in
human nature to get a certain amount of
gratification out of the exercise of power. The
controllers and others who are exercising power
at the present time will no doubt be able to
convince themselves and those under them that
it is in the best interests of all concerned to
have their controls continued'. On the other
hand, the people of the country, while quite
satisfied to abide by all the restrictions and
controls that they think will belp the war
effort, are most anxious that such restrictions
and controls should cease at the end of the
war. If we as a Senate set a time limit to this
Bill, we shall show the public, at any rate,
that we are desirous of preventing war measures from being extended into peace-time.

subject from a lega angle, but I think I can
approach it frorn the viewpoint of the isyrnan
or the average man or woman in the street.
I quite heartily agree with what the honourable~ senator who preceded me has just said.
I have heard it said many times, as I amn sure
most honourable members have during this
session, that the Senate was fot d.oing very
muceh; but the people whoù said that to me
were in favour of the Senate continuing,
because they feit it was a body that would

say to me, "We are spending a lot of ýmoney
on you, and perhaps you are flot ea.rning it,
but the dey may corne when there will be a
radical Governmcnt in control in this country
and the people of Canada will have cause to
be thankfuýl for the Senate." Well, if we today pass this legisiation with no time lirnit, we
shall not be acting in our capacity as a check
on any radical Governrnent that rnay corne
into power in this country.
The argument was advanced. in committee
that if there were a time lirnit on this legisiation, and such a group as we have spoken of
should come into control, ail they would have
to do would be to enact this Bill in its original
form. It is true that they could pass it through
the Comrnons, but they could not have it
enacted into legislation if the Senate did not
approve. If we to-day give blanket approval
to this measure, it will be in operation indefinitely and we shal1 have given up all power

of the ISnate ever to check it, no matter what
happens; and we shall be saying to the people
of this country, "We have been unfaithful to

the trust youi have placed in us."
Hon. J. H1. KING: Honourable senators, I
have only a word or two to say in closing the
debate, if other honourable members are
finished. I should like to advise those who
were not present at this afternoon's meeting
of the Finance Committee, to which this Bill
was referred, that Mr. Howe, the Minister,
appeared before the committee, and this question was put to hirn very frankly. He indicated to us, with equal frankness, that as
Minister he felt it would be very dýifficult
and very unwise to place in the Bill a time

friend's fears, nor do I accept thern, in regard
to some Government that may be in power
after the present Governrnent goes out of
office. I think we shah! have to trust the people
of Canada to select the kind of Governrnent
that they want to succeed the present or any
other Administration. There is no use in trying

to put up the kind of bogey that bas been
discussed to-day. That does not convince at
alh. I arn ho-peful that the members who had
the opportunity of hearing the Minister on this

section will not accept the amendment of xny
honourable friend.

APPROPRIATION BILL No. 3
FIRST READING
A message was received from the House of
Commons -with Bihl 73, an Act for granting to
lis Majesty a certain sum of money for the
public service of the financial year ending the
3lst Marcb, 1944.
The Bill was read the first time.

SECOND READING
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shal the
said Bill be read. a second time?
Hon. Mr. KING: With the consent of the
Senate, now.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: May I ask what is the
purpose of the Bill?
Hon. Mr. KING: I should like te make an
explanation of the Bill.
* Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
Bill?

May we sec the

Hon. Mr. KING: The Bill is being
distributed.
This is a very short Bill. Honourable members will find in the main estimates that the
sum of S40,000 is provided for the payment of
parliamentary assistants to the Ministers. It
is desirable that the men whom the Government has in mind should be named and provision made for their payment. One-sixth of
the main estimates has already been voted.
So honourable members will find that in this
Bill the amount is put at $33,333.33, that being
the balance of five-sixths of the item.
The matter of assistants te the Ministers
is not new. During the last war Sir Robert
Borden found it necessary to appoint three
parliamentary secretaries. Mr. McCurdy, Mr.
Hugh Clark and Mr. Keefer. It is net an
unknown practice in Great Britain to have
what are called under-sureetaries. In Canada
we have not used "secretary" except in the
titles Secretary of State and Secretary of State
for External Affairs. The ten men to be
appointed will bear the title of parliamentary
assistants te the Ministers. They will assist
various Ministers, more particularly those
Ministers who to-day are carrying excessive
war burdens. No one will discount the fact
that our war Ministers are overworked and
could be relieved by capable members of the
House of Commons undertaking certain duties.
I think the proposal is a move in the right
direction.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: Will the duties of
the under-secretaries continue after Parliament
adjourns during the summer?
Hon. Mr. KING:

I think so.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: I understand there
is provision in this Bill that when their duties
do net continue tbey are net te be paid.
Hon. Mr. KING:

That is right.

Hon. Mr. CALDER:
I understand that
certain of them will net be employed during
the entire session.
With regard to the Bill itself, since the
beginning of the war I have always taken
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

the stand that some Ministers of the Crown
are excessively busy and that the most
important thing they could do would be to
surround themselves with the necessary staff
and make use of their abilities. I still hold
that view. I say "some Ministers" because
there are others whose work has net been
affected by the war to anything like the same
extent. But take the Minister of Finance,
for instance. If any man ever had a job in
life, the present Minister of Finance has.
The same is truc of the Minister of Munitions and Supply, and it is also true of the
Prime Minister. It was true to a very large
extent of the Minister of Defence for Air;
however, his work has been donc, and done
so well, and is now so organized that his
position must be very different from what it
was a year or two ago. The work of the
Minister
of
National Defence,
Colonel
Ralston, also bas been exceedingly oncrous.
I bave all along taken the position, as J say,
that in a situation such as this the Ministers
should have the necessary help. Without it
they simply cannot function as they should;
and, if necessary in order to provide that
help, expenditures in other directions might
very well be curtailed. Personally I am
much pleased with the provision that is made.
There is only one other thing I should like
te say while I am on my feet. It is my
view that in the selection of the help, geographical or provincial boundaries should net
be taken into consideration. Men should be
selected for their ability, and for no other
reason. There are many able men in the
House of Commons, and se far as possible the
men appointed to these important positions
should be men who are quite capable of
giving te the Ministers the assistance which
they need. I am sure the great majority,
if not all honourable members, will approve
the present proposal.
Hon. A. J. LEGER: Honourable senators,
may I direct the attention of the Senate to a
matter which appears in the schedule of the
Bill? It may or may not be of much importance. Under our law a member of the Senate
may fill any position in the Government, and
in the past we have had at least one Prime
Minister who occupied a seat in this Chamber.
In the schedule of the Bill I sec that members
of the House of Commons may be appointed
parliamentary assistants, and they are protected in regard te their emolument. That
would not be so as regards members of the
Senate, wbo seom to be studiously excluded
by the Bill.
It might or might not be
practicable to have senýators as parliamentary
assistants. However, as these assistants are

APRIL 21, 1943

appointed by the Government, it seems to
me that no distinction should be made, and
that the legislation should, be in such form
that the Government could choose its parliamentary assistants from either House.
The motion was agreed to, and the, Bill
was read the second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable senators, when shall this Bill be read a third
time?
Hon. Mr. KING: Now.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Honourable senators, I
should like to have an answer from the leader
of the Government as to whether it is the
intention of the Covernment studiously to
exclude members of the Senate from appointment as parliamentary assistants. It seems
to me to be discrimination.
Hon. J. H. KING: I am very sorry. I did
not know my honourable friend expected a
reply. I thought he was expressing an opinion.
I can readily understand, and. I think my
honourable friend would be one of the first to
agree, that the work which falls upon Ministers as a result of present-day war conditions
falls upon them largely in the House of
Commons, and that, if they are to have
assistants, those assistants should be members
of the House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Granted.
Hon. Mr. KING: I do not think there is
any desire to exclude senators, but I hardly
think they would be of much use to Ministers
in the House of Commons.
I regret that I did not understand, my
honourable friend was asking a question.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Would it be possible to
amend the wording se that the exclusion would
not be so apparent? I concede what is said
by the leader of the Government; I have the
same conception myself; but what I principally
object to is the apparent exclusion in the
schedule.
Hon. Mr. KING: I think I would leave it
as it is.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I quite agree with the views
expressed by the honourable senator from
L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Léger). We have as good
talents and abilities in this branch of Parliament as are to be found in another place, and
I think senators ought to be included. Out of
the ten assistants we surely ought to have

three. I fully concur in what the honourable
senator has said, and should like to see a
change made, if the leader would agree.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
I quite appreciate what my colleagues have
said in this respect, but J can understand what
the duties of these parliamentary secretaries
must be. They must answer questions in the
House of Commons, and in order to do so
must have a seat there, which would be
quite impracticable in the case of any honourable member of the Senate. I do not see how
a senator could fill the position. On the
other hand, I think that as a matter of courtesy arrangements could have been made as
suggested by the honourable gentleman. However, it seems pretty late now.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I do not want
to disagree with the honourable senator from
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae), but I would
point out that if we did have senators as
parliamentary assistants, they could bring te
this House information which would be of
great value.
Hon. Mr. KING: We are trying to find
members who will be of value to the Ministers.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.
THE ROYAL ASSENT
The Hon. the SPEAKER informed the
Senate that he had received a communication
from the Assistant Secretary to the Governor
General, acquainting him that the Right
Honourable Sir Lyman Poore Duff, acting as
Deputy of His Excellency the Governor
General, would proceed to the Senate Chamber this day at 5.45 p.m. for the purpose of
giving the Royal Assent to certain bills.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. KING: I would move that the
Senate adjourn during pleasure, to reassemble
just prior to the Royal Assent.
May I be
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
allowed te ask the leader of the Government
when we may expect the Income Tax Bill, and
whether he thinks we are going te adjourn
to-day or to-morrow?
Hon. Mr. KING: I hope that when we
meet after this recess I shall be able te give a
definite answer te my honourable friend.

SENATE

GASOLINE CATEGORIES OF MEMBERS
OF SENATE AND HOUSE OF
COMMONS
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. SAUVE inquired of the Government:
1. On the basic book of the Oil Controller of
Canada, are the members of the Senate and the
members of the House of Commons classified in
the same ruling and the same category?
2. If not, why not?
Hon. Mr. KING: The answer to the bonourable gentleman's inquiry is as follows:
1. No. Members of the House of Commons are granted a category "A"; members
of the Senate, category "AA".
2. After careful inquiry and consideration it
was determined that the positions of the
members of the two Houses were somewhat
different and that members of the House
of Commons were called upon to do more
essential driving in connection with their
duties as members of Parliament than were
the members of the Senate. A senator is
eligible to make application for additional
gasoline to be used in any essential driving
connected with his civil employment.
INCOME

WAR TAX BILL

SECOND

READING

Hon. J. I. KING moved the second reading of Bill 72, an Act to amend, the Income
War Tax Act.
He said: Honourable members, I wish for
a moment or two to speak on a matter of
procedure. Honourable senators will find on
referring te page 72 of Senate Hansard of
March 3 that I then moved a resolution to
authorize our Standing Committee on Finance to examine, in advance of their reaching this Chamber, war and other financial
appropriations proposed by estimates and resolutions, and the bills based on them. We all
know from experience that often bills have
reached us from the House of Commons at or
near a time of adjournment or prorogation,
with the result that we have net had sufficient
opportunity to familiarize ourselves with the
details of those measures before giving them
our approval. It occurred to me early in the
present session that. in order to overcome
this difficulty, we might proceed as a group of
bankers or business men would do in dealing
with their affairs. When the Minister of
Finance has brought down his budget it is
usually followed by resolutions indicating
that certain bills will be based on those
resolutions. I thought that we might proceed
to overcome the difficulty I have mentioned
Hon. Mr. KING.

by examining the resolutions tabled in the
House of Commons, and that, once the bills
based thereon bad been introduced in the
Commons, there could be no reason why we
should not have one of our committees
informally consider those resolutions and bills.
This was the purpose I had in mind at the
time I moved that resolution last March.
Now it has been intimated, to me that in
authorizing the Committee on Finance to deal
with such matters we have overlooked the
Banking and Commerce Committee, a very
excellent committee of this House. There was
no intention on my part to side-track it. It
bas a large membership and will continue to
receive for consideration the class of measure
that bas usually been referred to it. But we
had also a Committee on Finance, with a
membership of fifteen; and in agreement with
my honourable friends opposite we decided to
increase its membership to twenty-five. Bills
like the one before us are technical, and in
reading amendments to such legislation as
the Income War Tax Act it is very difficult
for a layman to make good sense of them.
To do so, I think, one requires to be a man
with legal training or a business man accustomed to dealing with matters of taxation.
It bas occurred to me, therefore, that questions arising out of the budget this year,
more particularly those relating to war finance,
might well be referred to the Finance Committee. That is what has been done with the
Excise Bill and the Excess Profits Tax Bill;
and the resolutions upon which the present
measure is founded have also received very
careful consideration by the Standing Committee on Finance, which bas spent some hours
on the work and had before it officials of
the department, who fully explained the various clauses in the resolutions. It is my purpose
to-day, after the second reading, to move tbat
this Bill, which bas not yet been formally
before the Committee on Finance, be referred
to that committee, the members of which,
from the knowledge they have already
acquired in considering the resolutions, will be
in a very good position to deal expeditiously
with the Bill. I hope I have made myself
clear. The idea is a good one, I think, and bas
been profitable to those members of the committee who saw fit to attend. I was rather
disappointed that we had not a larger attendance, but there was a quorum, and the work
was carefully and thoroughly done.
After the Bill is considered carefully by the
committee it can be reported to the Senate
to-morrow afternoon, at which time, I hope,
we shall succeed in giving it third reading, so
that this Bill and the Excess Profits Tax Bill,
which is on the Order Paper-and which is

MAY 6,1943

2U

more or less a companion bill to this onemay receive the Royal Assent at a quarter to six.
I think that is all I care to say at the present
time.
My good friend the honourable senator from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) was a member
of the committee who examined the resolutions.
He has since given considerable thought and
study to the Bill, and has been kind enough to
undertake to explain this very important and
complicated measure to honourable members
this afternoon.

financial measures of which notice has been
given to Parliament, in advance of the bills
based on the said estimates and resolutions
reaching the Senate.
So there is no question in regard to authority
to refer these matters to the Finance Committee. We have that authority from the
Senate.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I wonder whether
the honourable leader could give us some information about the subject-matter which the
Committee on Finance was originally instituted to deal with. On the 3rd of March last
one honourable member said be had been here
for seventeen years and that during this time
the committee had never met. I notice that
the Committee on Finance is the seventeenth
committee to be appointed by this House, and
my understanding bas always been-and I
should like to be corrected if I am wrongthat it was to deal only with such questions
as affected the finances of the Senate.

Hon. Mr. KING: I was not here, either.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Hear, bear.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: If that is not correct, would somebody please put me right?
We ought to have laid down before us what
this committee was originally instituted to
deal with. As I said a moment ago, I have
always understood that it was only to deal
with financial questions that concerned the
Senate, and the Senate alone. Therefore, I for
one could not understand why we were taking
a supernumerary committee, which had not
funetioned for seventeen years, and utilizing
it by having it do work that the Banking and
Commerce Committee had always done. I
should like to be put right.
Hon. Mr. KING: I think my honourable
friend realizes that the Internal Economy Committee. of which he is a member, deals with
matters of finance as affecting this body. The
Finance Committee, it is true, had not been
called upon to do much, but it seemed to me
that here was an opportunity where it might
do some very useful work. I am not sure,
but it is probable that our rules would govern,
and His Honour the Speaker might advise us
on that.
On the 3rd of March I moved a motion,
which was carried and is in efiect to-day. That
motion reads:
That the Standing Committee on Finance be
authorized to examine expenditures proposed
by the estimates laid before Parliament and by
resolutions relating to war and other proposed
72542-14J

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Could we get the
language that was used when the Finance
I of
Committee was originally instituted?
course was not here then.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: One senator said he
had been here for seventeen years and the
committee had never functioned, never done
anything, because there was nothing for it
to do.
Hon. Mr. KING:

It is functioning now.

Hon. Mr. COPP: There was no war on at
that time.
Honourable
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
senators, rule 77 provides that at the commencement of each session a Committee of
Selection shall nominate the senators to serve
on the several standing committees, and rule
78 names the various standing committees and
their quorums; but our rules contain nothing
defining the jurisdiction or the purpose of any
of these committees. Of course, the name of
a committee indicates reasonably well what its
purpose is. For instance, the committees on
Standing Orders, on Banking and Commerce,
and on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours,
have in their names sufficient definitions of the
purposes for whieh they are formed. As there
is nothing on this point in our rules, a committee's jurisdiction is determined by the order
of reference from the Senate, just as the jurisdiction of any com.mittee of the Commons is
determined by the order of reference from
that House. The Senate, acting as a Senate,
can refer any matter to any committee, and
the jurisdiction of the committee is to be derived from the order of reference; because nowhere else-not in the British North America
Act, or the rules of the Senate, or the constitution of the Senate, or the Senate and House of
Commons Act-can you find anything to determine the jurisdiction of any particular standing
or special committee. Therefore, at least until
the rules are changed, it is in order for the
Senate to refer any matter in its discretion to
any committee.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I be pardoned
for a moment, Your Honour? The Tourist
Traffic Committee was instituted here a few

204

SENATE

years ago, and, upon motion of the honourable
member from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae),
the External Relations Committee was instituted, and in each case it was laid down what
the committee was for. My understanding has
been that every committee organized here had,
in days gone by, a background of that kinda detailed intimation of what the committee
was appointed for and what it was supposed to
do. Now, I may be entirely wrong, but I
think we ought to develop this and see what
it was laid down originally that this Committee on Finance would deal with.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Honourable
senators, I thank His Honour for the explanation be has just made, and I thoroughly
agree with it. Assignments given to old committees like those on Railways, Telegraphs and
Harbours and on Banking and Commerce have
been given according to usage. For I cannot
say how long, but for probably the last forty
or fifty years, not only bills pertaining to finance, or money bills, but also many other
bills have been referred as a matter of practice to the Committee on Banking and Commerce. It is customary for the two leaders of
the Senate to meet at the beginning of a
session and decide whom to nominate for what
have always been considered the two most important committees of the Senate-the one on
Banking and Commerce and the other on
Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours-and the
leaders always saw to it that the most experienced senators were placed on these committees.
The honourable leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. King) bas stated frankly that some
time ago, at a sitting in March, he moved a
resolution that made a drastic change, taking
from the Banking and Commerce Committee
bills of the kind I have mentioned, which
have been so efficiently dealt with by that committee for nigh half a century. The explanation that he bas now given of why he
wanted to make this change does eot convince
me at all. He bas stated that the Finance
Committee had a preview of the resolutions
and bills. True, but could that preview not
have been as efficiently had by the Banking
and Commerce Committee? It would, have
been not only as efficient, but, I say, more
efficient, for many members of that committee
have been on it for a number of years, and
others were chosen because in the opinion of
the two leaders they would add to the committee's prestige and ability.
My honourable friend says that, as these
matters have been studied by the Committee
on Finance, he intends to refer not only the
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

Income War Tax Bill but all money bills to
this committee, which, as was truly stated by
the honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon.
Mr. Murd-ock), bas slumbered for the past sixteen or seventeen years. Since I have been
in this House the Finance Committee, I say
with all due respect to it, was not considered
of the same importance at all as the Banking
and Commerce Committee. I did not see
before, and I do not see now, any good purpose that has been served by enlarging this
committee, and certainly it is apparent to
every honourable senator in the House that
the Banking and Commerce Committee bas
been given the go-by.
Hon. Mr. KING: Oh, no, no.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Well, as far as
money bills are concerned.
Hon. Mr. KING: No, net as far as money
bills are concerned.. The resolution sets out
very clearly the type of bill to be referred to
the Finance Committee.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
But my bonourable friend has just stated that the Income
War Tax Bill is to be referred to the Finance
Committee.
Hon. Mr. KING:

It bas been already.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
That is a bill
above all others that should have gone to the
Banking and Commerce Committee.
Hon. Mr. KING:

Not necessarily at all.
Hon. Mr. HARDY:
Will the honourable
leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) say
that the income tax bas anything to do with
banking and commerce? I take it that the
Banking and Commerce Committee is to deal
with banking and commerce, and not with
general finance.
Hon. Mr. COPP: The incorporation and
financing of companies.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I disagree with
the honourable senator from Leeds (Hon. Mr.
Hardy), and I agree entirely with what His
Honour the Speaker stated. What I said a
moment ago I reiterate now, that for nigh half
a century it bas been the usage and custom of
this House to refer these bills to the Banking
and Commerce Committee. There was no
reason that I know of why that practice should
net have been continued; no reason that I
know of why the experts should not have been
called before the Banking and Commerce
Committee to give, as the honourable leader
says, a preview. But he reconstituted the
Finance Committee and threw aside-not altogether, but to a very large extent-the experi-

MAY 6, 1943
ence of members of the Banking and Commerce
Committee, whici lias been presided over in a
most impartial manner, I am sure everybody
will say, by my good friend fromn Westrnorland
(Bon. Mr. Black).
My honourable friend tbe leader (Hon. Mr.
King) can put through in this Bouse any
resolutions he likes, similar to tlie one to
wbich lie bas just referred. Ail I can do now
is to lodge my pro test and say tbat to me
this is a most extraordinary departure. There
was no necessity wbatever for it, and I arn
sorry that the Banking and Commerce Committee is not to deal witb these bills.
Bon. Mr. CALDER: Bonourable members,
1 wish to add just a word to wbat lias been
said on this point. I feel that I am to a certain
extent responsible for wbat lias occurred.
Hon. Mr. KING: The bonourable gentleman
gave it his blessing.
Hon.--VIr. CALDER: At one stage of our
proeeedings on a bihl-I bave forgotten now
wbat bill it was-the bonourable senator from
Prince (Hon. Mr. MacArthiur), if I mistake
not, brouglit up the point that the bill miglit
be referred to the Finance Committee, and
I agreed. I even went so far as to suggest
that the committee miglit be somewbat
enlarged. But I must say tliat I neyer for one
moment tliougbt, wlien I made that suggestion, tbat tbe comamittee, witb its sliglit
enlargemeut, wouhd undcrtake tbe review of
wbat is probably thie most important legîslation to come before us tbis session.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Hear, bear.
Bon. Mr. CALDER: I can say only tliis, as
regards the Banking and Commerce Committee. Every member of this Bouse, particularly
if lie bas been bere about five, ten, fifteen or
twenty years, knows tbat the Senate lias one
comrnittee tbat deals witb ahl really important
legislation, wbetber it refers to banking and
commerce or not. Bis Bonour -tbe Speaker is
perfecthy rigit. in saying tbat the Senate lias
full authority to refer a bill to any committee
it chooses. Make no mistake about tbat.
Under our rules the Senate lias full control
over the matter, and since I bave been in tbe
Bouse ail sorts of bis bave repeatedly been
referred to the Banking and Commerce Cornmittee. Tbere is anotber aspect of thie situation. I bave been a member of this Cliamber
for twenty odd years, and during tbat period
the leaders on botb sides bave always endeavoured to keep tbat committee tbe strongest we
bave.
Bon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Bear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Why? Simply because ail important legislation to be reviewed
muet be dealt witb very largely by men w.bo

205

are recognized as the most capable menibers
of this Bouse. 1 ama sure ail will agree with
me that the legisiation we have been dealing
with is exceedingly important, and that in the
last analysis the judgment of this House must
vtery largely depend upon the judgment and
work of the committee which deals with these
bills.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: AI] the members of
this House do flot attend regularly the meetings of committees. Tbey bave no voting
power on a committee unleas they are members
of it.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I do flot wish to interrupt
my honourable friend, but 1 submit, honourable senators, that the discussion is entirely
out of order. The bonourable leader on this
side said that when the time came be would
move to refer the Bill to tbe Finance Cernmittee. Wben lie bas made that motion will
be the time for this discussion. It is not now.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I quite agree, and if I
wish I can proceed at tbat time. But according to. the practice of this House 1 can see no
reason wliy I sbould not proceed now.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I do not wan't to be
teclinical; I just wish to get the matter
straight.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: There are many things
in tbis Bouse that are not quite straiglit, as
the honourable gentleman knows.
Bon. Mr. COPP: My honourable friend is
making it cro.oked now.
Bon. Mr. CALDER: Perbaps flot balf as

BALLANTYNE:

quita

Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN: Honourable marnbers, I have been chargad with the duty of
giving an explanation of this Bill. It is a
Bill to, amend. the Incorne War Tax Act in
accardance with tha Ways and Means cesolutions introducad in the other House on the
2nd of March last, and it includes also such
changes in and additions to thosa resolutions
as have from time to time been made during
their consideration in that House. It is a
vecy long and complicated Bill, and I must
ask the indulgence of honourable senators while
I attempt to explain its ganaral purpoýrt.
I do not intand to go through the Bill section by section. I tbought that pechaps for
tha information of tha Sanate the cleaast
picture of the purpose of the measure would
be givan by dividing considaration of it into
two parts: one, the changes it effects in the
taxation on individuals; and, two, in the
taxation on corporations.
To deal flrst withi tha taxation on individuais, this rneasure brings into full force the
principle of pay-as-you-earn. Honoucable rnembers will recall that in tha Incarna War Tax Bill
of last session a partial step was taken in the
direction of lavying incoma tax upon personal incomes in the year in which tbay were
aarned. In othar words, under the Act of 1942
taxpayers had te pay towards the end cf 1942
a part of thair incorna tax for that year. Witb
respect to persans other than waga-earners,
honourable senators will rernember that thesa
have already'paid about one-half of their 1942
tax-ona-quartar by an instalment on the lSth
of last October, and the second quarter by an
instalment on the 15th cf January. With
respect to wage-earners, the samae position applies, because wage-eacn.ecs aise bave alcaady
paid about ona-haîf of tbeir 1942 incarne tax
by the deduction for the first. seven rnonths of
1942 of the 7 per cent National Defence tax
and during the last five rnonths of 1942 by the
deduction made by amployers from. their
employees' salaries on the basis of tbe table
of deductions issued by the Dapartment of
National Revenue.
I have the information from the Commissioner cf Income Tax that, genarally speaking,
approximataly 48 par cent cf the personal incorne tax for 1942 bas already heen paid by
virtually evary individual, and the metbod by
Hon. Mr. KING.

which it is proposed to bring tbe pay-as-youeacn principle into complate operation is to
forgive the remaining haîf of the 1942 income
tax. This provision will ha found in section
13 of the Bill. The only exception to that
forgiveness is in respect cf invastrnent incarne
in excess of $3,000.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: A pretty big exception.
Hon. Mc. HUGESSEN: It is a faicly liberal
allowance. Pecbaps I rnisapprebend what my
bonoucable friend means. Haîf the tax on
invastrnent incarne in excess cf $3,000 is not
forgivan, but tha tirne for payrnent is axtended.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Until wben?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSE-N: Until the death of
the taxpayer.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Hear, liear.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: As an alternative,
as honourabla sanators will find on refcrring
te section 13 of the Bill, the executars can pay
the tax on tha taxpayer's death; or the taxpayer hirnself rnay, if bie se wishes, pay it
befere the 3Oth cf April, 1944, at a discount
cf 2 per cent par annurn in respect cf eacb
year which hae might be axpected te liva after
that time.
Dealing still with the 1942 incoma tax, I rnay
say that returos hiave te be filed by the 3Oth
of Juna next, accemipaniad by payrnent cf
ona-third cf any balance that may ha owing.
The remaining two-thirds cf tha balance will
be payable on the 31st cf next Dacember.
With respect te personal incarne tax for 1943
and succeeding years, xve naw travel ino the
area of complate pay-as-yau-aarn. Fac 1943
and succeading years individtîals must file
their raturas on the 30th cf the following April.
Thair tax is payable as follaws: If three-quartacs or more of tha total incarne is derived
fcorn salary ar wages, 95 per cent of the tax is
paid by montbly deductions made by employers
fcorn salacy or wages an the basie of a table
cicculatad by the Departrnant of National
Revenue, and any balance is payable by the
taxpayer himscîf on or beface the 3Oth cf the
follewing April. Pacsons who darive less than
75 par cent of their incarna framn salarias or
wagas hava te pay incarne tax by quarterly instaîrnants in the year in wbicb the incorne is
earnad: 20 par cent by the 31st cf March, 25
par cent by the 301h of Juna, 25 per cent by
tbe 3Oth cf Septembar, and the rarnaning 30
par cent hy the 3lst cf December.
Tha only exception is in the casa of persons
engagad in farrning. Farmers have te pay
twa-thirds of their astirnatad, incorna tax by
tha 3lst cf Dacember af the yaar in wbich the
incorna was earned, and the rarnaining ona-third
on the fallowing 3Otb cf April.

MAY 6, 1943
A provision for the benefit of farmers
will be found in section 6 of the Bill. It
permits them for the purposes of their tax
to deduct losses sustained in the process of
earning income during the two preceding
years. In other words, a farmer, if he has
lost money during the two preceding years
and made a profit in the third year, can
deduct his losses from his profit and pay tax
on any net balance of income lie may have.
Still with reference to taxation of individuals, there is another quite important provision
which affects, I suppose, the vast majority of
income taxpayers in this country. It will be
found in section 13 of the Bill. This provides
for a simplified form of tax return for persons
with incomes not in excess of $3,000, of which
not more than $1,500 is investment income. In
substance, taxpayers in this class need not
make a return of their exact income down to
the last cent or dollar. They are permitted to
pay their tax on the basis of a table which
steps up the income by $10 stages. The income tax payable in each $10 bracket is set
out in this table which I hold in my hand,
known as "T.1-Special 1942." For instance,
if a man's income is between $1,510 and $1,520
in a year, all lie has to do is to look up this
table for the amount of tax payable. This
provision, of course, makes for a certain
degree of unfairness. A man whose income
was $1,510 pays a little more, and a man
whose income was $1,520 pays a little less, than
if they were taxed on their exact incomes; but
I am instructed that the difference is never
greater than $1.70.
On the basis of this table I find, for instance, that a single man without dependents
who earns between $1,880 and $1,890 a year
pays income tax of $274. The table starts with
an income of $660 and goes up by $10 steps
to the maximum of $3,000. It is felt that this
will be of great assistance to a very large
number of income taxpayers who might otherwise have a great deal of diffioulty in estimating the exact tax they would have to pay.
Still dealing with personal income tax, there
are certain provisions which might be described
as tightening-up provisions or new impositions. By section 2 of the Bill allowances are
made subject to income tax; that is, living allowances such as are paid to the so-called
dollar-a-year men are taxable, and allowances
paid to dependents of members of the armed
forces are made subject to income tax as part
of the income of members of the armed forces.
Under section 12 there is a provision which
makes liable to income tax the employees of

207

Canadian companies who are temporarily sent
out of Canada to perform services on behalf
of their employers.
Still dealing with personal income tax, the
next branch which I think honourable members ought to know about is the relief given to
certain classes of taxpayers. The principal
item deals with the active service forces of
the country. There has been a complete
change in the method of computation as
regards members of the active service forces.
Under the old Act, section 4(t), every member
of the active service forces outside of Canada
was exempt from the payment of income tax.
Non-commissioned officers and men inside
Canada were also exempt from income tax,
although officers in Canada were subject to tax.
That sometimes resulted in a rather strange
condition of affairs, whereby the net income of
a first-class warrant officer would be larger than
that of a lieutenant, since he paid no tax on his
income, whereas the lieutenant was subject to
tax. The distinction between officers and noncommissioned officers has been abolished, with
the result that in certain instances sergeantsmajor in Canada, members of the active forces,
who are now not subject to tax, will become
liable to tax in the future. Those of us who
served in the ranks of the army in the last
war will, I am sure, greet with pleasure any
imposition of taxation on sergeants-major.
The new system of taxation upon the active
service forces is as follows. If they are serving
in Canada there is no tax on income up to
$1,600, and there is a diminished scale of taxation on income up to $3,200. If the income
is in excess of that amount the tax is just
the same as that of a civilian. There is, however, this exemption: if in the normal course
of employment a soldier or sailor is afloat or
in aircraft, even while in Canada, he is entirely
exempt.
Then there is a new class brought in. Members of the active service forces who are
stationed outside of Canada in the western
hemisphere, not including Iceland, of which I
shall speak later, pay half the tax which they
would pay if stationed in Canada. The members of the forces who are on active service
fronts in Europe or elsewhere (including Iceland) will continue to be entirely exempt from
the payment of income tax. There is a still
further provision for the benefit of men who
have been overseas, but who have returned to
Canada. By section 4 of the Bill such men on
their return from overseas are exempt from
income tax on their pay and allowances for the
first six months after their return.
There are also some other provisions for the
benefit of men engaged, substantially, in active
service. Under section 4(w) of the Bill, mem-

208
208

SENATE
SENATE

bers of the merchant marine will not be required to pay income tax on the war risk
bonuses they earn; and there is a further provision for exemption from income tax of onethird of the remuneration of civilian flyers
engaged in the R.A.F ferry command.
That deals roughly with the taxation on the
forces.
There are certain other provisions dealing
with the compulsory savings feature that was
brought into the Act last year. Honourable
members will recall that a certain portion of
the tax they now pay is refundable after the
conclusion of the war, and that they are
allowed to treat as part of the tax they would
otherwise pay certain savings they make, such
as insurance premiums, and so forth. One of
these items is the payments which a man
may be making on the purchase of a house
for himself and his family: this Bill contains an
additional provision that ho may benefit even
if ho is purchasing the house in the name of
bis wife. and vice versa. Further, a man may
deduct from the refundable portion of his tax
payments on Dominion Government anûuities
taken out before June 23, 1942.
That, very roughly, deals with the part of
the measure that relates to personal income

One of these, which relates to depreciation,
will be found in section 7 of the Bill. There
are two provisions relating to depreciation.
The first, in substance, provides that the
owner of a corporation may not take depreciation twice on the same property merely
by the process of going through some sort
of reorganization whereby a new corporation
becomes the owner of the property without
there being in effect any real change of
ownership.
There was a case in British
Columbia, what is known as the Pioneer
Laundry case, which illustrates that point.
That was the case of a company which had
depreciated its assets by annual instalments
to the full one hundred per cent allowed by
the income tax authorities. and in order to
get the benefit of a new lot of depreciation
the old company was reorganized and its
assets sold to a new company without there
being any real change of ownership. That
was really a method by which a company
was getting depreciation twice on the same
assets. This provision is designed to deal
with and prevent that kind of thing.

tax.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: The decision is
based on what is the controlling interest in
the company, and whether it is the same as
before. My honourable friend will see that
those are the governing words in clause 7.
If the controlling interest is the same, the
depreciation will not be allowed a second
time. If my honourable friend is interested
in that point, I may say that the reason
why the words "controlling intérest" were
inserted in the Bill was that those words have
been judicially determined, by the House of
Lords in the recent case of British American
Tobacco Company, Limited, v. Inland Revenue
Commissioners, which is very similar to the one
I mentioned a few minutes ago. Perhaps I
may read just the short heading.

I wish to turn now for a few minutes to
the other branch of the subject, the changes
in the tax on corporations. Hereafter corporations will be required to file their returns six
months after the close of their fiscal period.
Up to the present the time for filing has been
four months after the close of the fiscal year.
This additional allowance of time is given on
the ground that it is very difficult at present
to obtain sufficient trained auditors and
accountants to permit companies to complete
their financial statements within four months
of the end of the fiscal year. Hereafter corporations will have to pay their tax in twelve
monthly instalments, and in this connection I
refer honourable members to section 23 of the
Bill. The twelve monthly instalments begin
six months after the commencement of the
fiscal year. In other words, if the fiscal year
corresponds with the calendar year, the corporation will have to pay the first monthly
instalment at the end of June. Eleven instalments have each to be calculated as onetwelfth of either the estimated total tax for
the current year or the actual tax paid for
the preoeding year; and the twelfth and last
payment, which will be made six months after
the close of the fiscal year, will take up any
slack or difference and will complete the payments for that year.
With respect to corporations also there are
what I might call tightening-up provisions.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN.

Hon. Mr. LEGER: Who is to determine
whether it is a new company or not?

Hon. Mr. LEGER:

Where is it reported?

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: It is given in full
in the House of Commons Hansard for the
20th of April, page 2419 and following.
The appellant company held shares in Il
companies operating outside the United Kingdom, which were not, therefore, liable to be
assessed te national defence contribution. In
the case of 4 of these companies, the appellant
company itself controlled more than 50 per cent
of the votes. In the case of the remaining 7
companies, more than 50 per cent of the votes
were controlled by the appellant company in
conjunction with a company or companies in
which the appellant company controlled more
than 50 per cent of the votes.

1940 and made a littie clearer and a littie
stricter. The purpose of the amendment now
before us, section 17, is flot to alter in any
way the principle that bas been in the statuteýs
for five years, but merely to make a littie
clearer just what sort of tax avoidance is envisaged and intended to be caught.
Similar clauses have, been in the British Incorne Tax Act and Excess Profits Tax Act for
a number of years, certaioly since 1935. It
happens that I have before me a copy of the
British statutes fur 1941, and, I see that section
35 of the Finance Act of that year corresponde
very close]y in its wording to the first paragraph of the new section now before us. Peýrhaps bonourable members will allow me to
read the first subsettion of that section 35:
Where the Commissioners are of opinion that
the main purpose for which aoy transaction or
transactions was or were effected (whether
before or after the passing of this Act) was
the avoidaoce or reduction of liability to excess
profits tax, they may, if they think fit, direct
that such adjustinents shall be made as respects
liability to excess profits tax as they consider
appropriate so -as to counteract the avoidance
or reduction of liahility to excess profits tax
which would otherwise be effected by the transaction or transactions.
That is in substance what is contained in the
present amendment, and what has been in

House of Lords held that the appellant coinpany had a controlling interest in ail the
companies within the section. That is the test.
If. the controlling interest remains the samne,
you cannot take depreciation twice on the
samne assets.
There is a second clause which deals with
special war depreciation. It provides, where a
corporation has obtained special war depreciation on a plant built for war purposes, that if
in future years the company should sell the
property for more than the depreciated value,
it must pay income tax on the excess. Perhaps
I can explain that more clearly by illustration.
Let us suppose a company builds a munitions
plant for $1,000,000, and gets it depreciated to
the extent of say $800,000 in two years under
the special provisions for wartime depreciation.
At the end of two years that plant stands in its
books at $200,000. Then let us say that four
or fi.ve years hence the corporation is fortunate
enough to, seil the samne propcrty for $700,000.
Well, what that really means is that the
corporation will have got the $500,000 twice:
first by the accelcrated depreciation, and
secondly by the difference between the depreciated value and the value at which the
property was sold.

MAY 6, 19U3
I can only say, hanourable senators, that
my very short study of this Bill has not been
by any manner of means as comprehensive as
I should have liked it 'ta be. In the discussion
1 shall endeavour to answer any questions that
honourable members might like to put, but 1
cannot guarantee that the answers will be
eithcr sensible or accurate.
Hon. Mr. LEGER:- The honourable gentleman said that provision was made for relief
in connection with certain obligations assumed
by the taxpayer, throug-h a rnortgage on his
home, for instance. What about other obligations incurred for legitimate purposes? Is any
provision made in respect of thern?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Section 7A of the
Act as amended last year sets out the classes
of savings that an individual is allowed ta
deduct from the refundable portion of his tax.
They are stated ta be voluntary savings, and
they comprise superannuation, retirement or
pension plan payrnents, certain life insurance
prem-iums, and payments on home mo.rtgages.
As 1 explained, the relief with respect to home
rnortgage payments has been extended by this
Bill ta cover cases where a man is making
payrnents on a mortgage against a house that
is in his wife's name.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: If a nman borrowed
rnoney ta purch-ase a house and gave a promissory note instead of a mortgage, he would not
get relief?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: That is right. It
bas to be a mortgage or an agreement for
sale.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Honourable senators,
niay I a.sk a question of the honourable gentleman who, has explýained this Bill (Hon-. Mr.
Hugeasen), or of the honourable leader of h
House (Hon. Mr. King), regarding sectio
12? It is noV quite clear to me. It makes
Canadians who are sent out of the country for
a certain length of time, in the employ of
Canadian companies, hiable for taxation i
Canada. There are at the present time, I
should say, twelve, possibly fifteen, Canadian
newspaper coarrespondents in Great Britain.
T-hese men have ta pay incomre tax over there.
Under this amnendment are they al.so hiable for
incarne tax in Canada?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN : It would depend
upon how temporary their employrnent in
Great Britaiýn was. I shouid say that if they
were there more or less pe.rmanently, on a
year-by-year basis, they would not pay the
tax here. I understand this provision is designed principally Vo cover the cases of quite
a large number of persans who are employed

211

by Canadian corporations and are at present in
Newfoundland, wbere there is, I believe, no
income tax.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Honourable senators, regardless of ail the legal phraseology,
the gist of this whole thing is that it provides
for excess profit taxes. The honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen)
referred to subsidiary companies and depreciatian. Well, depreciation is certainly analogous
ta lasses. Large campanies have six, eight or
ten subsidiaries, let us say. Who determines
the depreciation? The bonourable gentleman
bas not gone into th.at feature of the case.
The depreciation affects the lasses, and is an
offset against the Vax. But who appraises the
depreciation?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I did not deal with
the general question of depreciation, because
I was rying Vo caver only the Vwo matters in
which depreciation is altered by this amending
Bill. 0f course, there are twa kinds of depreciation: the normal depreciation andHon. Mr. MacARTHUR:
that?

Who determines

Hon. Mr. IIIJGESSEN: That has been determined for years past by the incarne tax
authorities, on the basis of sa much for certain
classes of assets, depending upon whether they
are wasting or not. It may be five per cent
for certain buildings and twenty per cent for
machinery, and sa on. Every asset that a
company has is susceptible of depreciation at
a certain rate, which is fixed by the incarne
tax authorities on the basis of its wearability
and durability.
The second class of depreciation is the
special wartime depreciation, which bas been
brought in sa as ta enable companies ta
recover the cost of buildings erected for war
purpases, which buildings they would nat normally have required and which will be uselesa
after the war is over.
Hon. Mr. MacAIITHUJR: That is ahI right
in a general way, but suppose the president
and the secretary of a big campany and its
subsidiaries say: "We are noV satisfied with
your rate of depreciation. We want a higher
rate." What do you do then?
Hon.,Mr. HUGESSEN: Any carnpany which
is dissatisfied with any assessment made upan
it by the incarne tax authorities has the right
ta appeal ta the Exchequer Court.
Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH: I do not knaw
whether I followed the honourable gentleman
clearly, but I did noV care ta interrupt him in

the middle of his explanation. Am I to understand that an officer returning to Canada from
a theatre of war is allowed six months' exemption from taxation, and that he pays no taxation at all while abroad?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Perhaps I might
answer my honourable friend's first question
by saying that there is one slight modification.
If an officer bas been abroad for only three
months, he is allowed tax exemption on the
three months; but if he has been abroad for
six months or more he gets six months'
exemption on his return.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That is all right,
but it does not tic into the facts. An officer
may be returned from a theatre of war to
engage in instructional duties in Canada, and
the period that the Department of National
Defence allots for this purpose is eight months.
Why could not the Government consent now
to make the period of tax exemption the sane
as the period of attachment?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I think my honourable friend will see the answer in section 29
of the Bill, which allows the Minister to make
special regulations in cases where the right of
taxpayers to deductions or exemptions bas
varied during any taxation year. This would
deal precisely with the sort of cases my
honourable friend bas in mind.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: What Minister is
the honourable gentleman referring to?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:
National Revenue.

The Minister of

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: But why not put
into the Bill that the period of exemption from
taxation shall be eight months? Then you
have it synchronizing with the period of
attachment.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I am afraid that is
a matter of Government policy which I have
no authority to deal with.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Apparently the
Government's right hand does not know what
its left hand is doing. Probably the Department of National Revenue never heard that
the standard period is eight months when a
man is sent back here for instructional duties.
Why not make it clear that while be is over
here he will not have to pay income tax?

An Hon. SENATOR: Why not make it
apply to the other services as well?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Take the case of
a man who went over with the First Division.
He has had three years over there free of
income tax. Then you induce or order him
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

to return to Canada for instructional duties,
and that period has been fixed at eight months.
The amount of extra tax is so small that you
might as well make the two periods tie in. The
man so ordered back to Canada is a hard man
to get and to keep. We should not hold
income tax over him, for he bas troubles
enough without that additional worry. The
six montha' exemption is some gesture of
encouragement. I doubt whether the Department of National Revenue is aware that the
period of attachment is eight months. If the
discrepancy were drawn to the attention of the
Government it might consent to make the
period of exemption agree with the period of
attachment.
Then everybody would be
reasonably happy.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Perhaps the answer
to my honourable friend would lie in his
remark that the difference between the amounts
of income tax for the six-month and eightmonth periods would be small. I think the
Commissioner of Income Tax would, as he
is empowered to do, maike a ruling under
section 29 to relieve cases of the kind my
honourable friend bas mentioned.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I do not think we
can safely rely on what the income tax man
may figure on. Apparently the Departnent
of National Defence bas not entered the
picture at all. If that department had, jurisdiction in the matter it would be another
story. J doubt very much that the Income
Tax Division would give up a single dollar.
It is reputed to be willing to take the gold
out of a taxpayer's teeth. I should like to sec
the Bill amended on the lines I have suggested.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: The appropriate
time to move such an amendment woulid h
in cominittee, not at this stage.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: All right. I did
not know the Bill was going to committee.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators. I crave your indulgence for a few
moments while J direct attention once again
to the constituîtional authority of the Senate
of Canada to deal with noney bills. In 1918
the Senate appointed a special committee to
determine the rights of the Senate in matte-rs
of financial legislation. This committee, of
x-hich the late Hon. W. B. Ross was chairman,
invited the late Eugene Lafleur, the late John
S. Ewart and Mr. Aimé Geoffrion-who, J am
happy to say, is as active as ever-to give
their views on the question. This is the
summing-up of the conclusions of the comnmittee:
1. That the Senate of Canada bas and always
had since it was created, the power to anend
bills originating in the Commons appropriating

MAY 6, 1943
any part of the revenue or imposing a tax by
reducing the amounts therein, but tas not the
right to increase the same without the consent
of the Crown.
2. That this power was given as an essential
part of the Confederation contract.
3. That the practice of the Imperial Houses
of Parliament in respect of money bills is no
part of the Constitution of the Dominion of
Canada.
4. That the Senate in the past tas repeatedly
amended so-called money bills, in some cases
without protest from the Commons, while in
other cases the bills were allowed to pass, the
Commons protesting or claiming that the Senate
could not amend a money bill.
5. That rule 78 of the House of Commons of
Canada, claiming for that body powers and
privileges in connection with money bills identical with those of the Imperial House of Commons, is unwarranted under the provisions of
the British North America Act, 1867.
6. That the Senate, as shown by the British
North America Act as well as-by the discussion
in the Canadian Legislature on the Quebec
Resolutions, in addition to its general powers
and duties is specially empowered to safeguard
the rights of the provincial organizations.
7. That besides general legislation there are
questions such as provincial subsidies, public
lands in the Western Provinces and the rights
of the provinces in connection with pending
railway legislation and the adjustment of the
rights of the provinces thereunder, likely to
arise at any time, and it is important that the
powers of the Senate relating thereto be
thoroughly understood.
I come now, honourable members, to a consideration of this Bill. When the Minister of
Finance brought down his budget and quite
properly stated that there would be no increase in income tax rates, many people
thought that the cancellation of the tax on
the remaining six months of 1942 would apply
to the income of all taxpayers. Later it came
as a shock to those who depend on income
from investment to find that they have now
to pay the highest income tax of all time. In
other words, they have to make five payments
for the fiscal year 1942-43. On January 15
they made their last quarterly payment on
their 1941-42 income. Then shortly after, at
the end of March, they had to make their
first payment on their 1942-43 income. Tberefore, when they pay the balance for this year,
they will have made five payments.
I am sure the Minister must be gratified
that our taxpayers are not complaining. They
are quite willing ta- assume and carry their full
share of the tax burden. But we must recognize that they have to make a great struggle
to do su. Even the supposed rich are finding
considerable difficulty in meeting their taxation. Their incomes, sufficient for thern to
live upon some years ago, bave now been
greatly reduced by the levying of higher
rates of income tax, and many of them have

213

to do one of two things: either borrow money
from the bank or sell their securities. This
they are prepared to do, but they insist that
Ministers of Finance when imposing additional taxation must see to it that it is levied
equally and fairly upon all taxpayers. Later
on I shall mention a discrimination in this
Bill which has created a good deal of consternation and evoked criticism, especially on the
part of those who derive their income from
investments.
The Minister of Finance when bringing down
his budget had this ta say, first of al, about
the taxpayer who derives his income from
salary:
To put tax payments on a full pay-as-we-earn
basis and avoid unreasonable overlapping of
two years' taxes, the Government has decided to
propose that only one-half the full tax liability
in respect of 1942 income shall now be payable.
The tax liability will be reduced by one-half in
the case of earned incomes. For investment
incomes half the 1942 liability will be deferred
until the death of the taxpayer. Investment
income of not more than $3,000 will be treated
in the same way as earned income.
There is good reason to distinguish between
earned income and investment income in making
this adjustment to the pay-as-we-earn plan.
The reasons for making the change arise almost
entirely from the size of earned income. We
wish to overcome the tax difficulties of those
whose earnings cease or are reduced because
they retire or die, or because they enter the
armed forces or lose their jobs. In these circumstances there are much lower earnings or no
earnings out of which to pay the tax due on
past earnings.
I agree with everything the Minister states
there about these salaried men, but I cannot
understand why the Minister was not willing
to have inserted in this Bill a provision that
on salaries of $10,000 and under, the balance
of the 1942 taxes would be cancelled, and
that salaries in the higher brackets would be
treated in the same manner as revenue derived
from investment. For a salaried man, no
matter how low or how high his salary may be,
the last six months of 1942 taxes are completely
cancelled. There is a provision, however, that
if he has investments as well as his salary,
the revenue derived from the investments will,
on his death, make his beirs liable to pay the
balance of the 1942 tax.
Now I turn to what the Minister has to
say about those who are living on revenue
from investments. He says:
In the case of investment income there is
always capital out of which such remaining
taxes can be paid following the death of the
taxpayer-or in other circumstances. Moreover,
most investment incomes are not so likely to
decline rapidly or to cease as are earned incomes. There is not such great need, therefore,
to tax investment income on a current basis.
Indeed, the question of a change would never

214

SENATE

have arisen, I feel sure, if only investment
income were concerned. It is not practical,
however, to put one type of income on a current
basis and not the other. Therefore we must
make the shift in the collection of tax on investment income even though it is not required on
its own merits. In doing so, however, we do
not need to relieve the taxpayer, or his estate,
of a tax which he or the estate is quite able te
meet out of capital if not out of income. The
course of action proposed is well in accord with
the principle of taxing on the basis of ability to
pay.
I do net know that I need read any further.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Would my honourable friend be kind enough to give me the
date of the quotation?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: It is at pages 880
and 881.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I never could
understand, and do net naw, why the Government persist in calling revenue from investment "unearned." The word is a misnomer
and should never have appeared in any of our
budgets, and I express the hope that we may
net sec it in budgets that are to comee. Think
of the strong men who are no longer with us,
and of those who remain, whose hair is turning
grey and who are not as active as they used to
be-men who have toiled and laboured for
twenty-five, thirty, forty, possibly fifty years,
giving of their brain, their courage and their
capital to develop the mines, the forests, the
lands, the railways and the great industries
and mercantile establishments of this country.
Why, after all these long years, should it net
be said that capital has played a large part
in the development of Canada and that we
hope it may long continue to do so? Why
should we net pay tribute to the men who
have done se much, instead of casting reflectiens on them and on what they have donce?
They are told: "We know that you, and
probably your father before you and your
grandfiather before him, laboured hard and long,
yet net only do we consider you have net
earned a dollar, but we say officially to-day
that all your money is unearned." The only
tiny excuse the Minister of Finance or any
of his experts can offer is that some people
have inherited wealth. In the eyes of some
that is a very great sin, but yeu could count
on the fingers of your hand the number of
men in the city of Montreal-no, throughout
Canada-who are living on income derived
from inherited money.
I am personally
acquainted with all the presidents of banks,
railways and large industrial institutions in
Montreal, and I know of only one of them who
ever inherited a dollar. All the others started
from the bo.ttom rung of the ladder and
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

climbed up.
Only this week the general
manager of one of the banks told me that
te start he got $75 a year, and ha said, "Our
president got $100 a year." I cite that merely
ta show the struggle these men have made,
these so-called capitalists, during the years
that have passed. Why should they not now
leave a fair competence for their families to
live upon? To my mind it is quite out of
place for this Bill to say that all they have
striven for and saved is "unearned" and subject
to a four per cent surtax; that there will be
no exemption for the rest of 1942, and the
heirs will have te pay. I maintain that there is
discrimination between those who are living
on income from investments and those who
are drawing salaries.
Another serious aspect of the case is this.
This budget says to the young men of to-day,
the men of forty who are running our banks
and great industries: " Yeu had better remain
on salary. You see how favourably salaried
men have been treated. We have cancelled
the balance of their 1942 tax, and they do not
have to pay the surtax of four per cent." I
should have preferred to see it otherwise, with
the "unearned" eliminated, and the 1942 tax
cancelled for all, including the widows and
children who live on income fron investments.
Just the other day, as honourable secnators may
have noticed, our neighbours across the border
completely cancelled the 1942 tax. How are
we going to encourage saving? How are we
going to encourage the young men I have
mentioned te invest, net only in the concerns
they may happen to manage, but also in many
other industries, and thereby help to expand
and develop this country?
I do net know that I have much more to
say about this, except that the trust conpanies, which have to look after estates, are
very greatly concerned and worried about the
widows and orphans who receive a small incore froin investments. They are in a very
bad way because, as I stated in the beginning
of my remarks, they have to pay five times
this year instead of four times. I had a firm of
auditors figure for me how much a widow
with two dependents would have ta pay if she
had an income of $5,000 a year. The figures
are as follows:
Gross 1943 tax.......... $1,910 00
Quarterly payment in respect of 1942 tax paid
on the 15th January,
1943 .................

477 50

Gross income.....................

$2,387 50
5,000 00

Net income.......................
$2,612 50
And this widow has two dependents to look
after.

MAY 6, 1943

I suppose it is too late now for me to urge
the Minister to say to his colleague the Minister of Finance that relief should be given to
the thousands of people who are living on
revenue from investments, and that they
should be treated as fairly as those who are
living on a salary. I cannot see the fairness of
the present plan. I cannot see why there
should be any line of demarcation. I am not
criticizing the remuneration that any of these
outstanding executives receive, because I know
very weIl they are worth it. Any man in
business knows that when you are looking for
an executive to run a large business the greatest difficulty you have is to find the man, and
that the salary is only a secondary consideration. These salaried executives are told that
six months of their 1942 tax is cancelled; but
for people living on revenue from investments
the answer is, "No."
I may be told by my honourable friend from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) that it was
the Bennett Administration that brought down
this tax on "unearned" income. I frankly admit
that. We were in power at the time. My good
friend the Right Honourable Arthur Meighen
was leading the Senate then, and I shared the
same desk with him. Honourable senators who
were here at that time will remember that the
leader endorsed the "unearned," and that the
"assistant leader" opposed it. I opposed it on
the floor of the House, and I went before the
Committee on Banking and Commerce and
opposed it there. I said at that time it was
wrong in principle-and it was; and it has
been wrong ever since, and is wrong now. Let
us earnestly hope, as I do, that my honourable
friend who leads the Government in this
House will impress upon the Minister the undesirability of such a thing, and will urge
that we should never see it in a budget
again.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. ARTHUR SAUVE: Honourable sens'tors, I cannot approve without reserve this
budget loaded with billions of dollars. The
province of Quebec, like the rest of the country, does not want anything to hamper a
legitimate war effort, our Victory Loan, or a
greater production; but these objectives must
be attained within the limits of possible and
reasonable sacrifice and of justice for all. There
is no question here of participation or nonparticipation in a supreme war effort, any
more than there is of fanatical animosity
against the Government. But I cannot entirely
approve the new mode of taxation.
At this moment I do n'ot intend to criticize
an illogical and extravagant opponent, but I
wish to disclose the complaints I have heard,

215

and know to be well founded. It is fair to
admit that the members of the Government,
even if they are jointly responsible, are not all
equally guilty of all the blame justly laid
upon the Administration. It is equally fair
and honest to take into consideration the
unavoidable errors that occur in upheavals
caused or rendered necessary by a war administration improvised, unprepared and organized
in opposition to the education which the Government had preached in the past.
Budget debates provide an opportunity for
an expression of serious grievances of the
people. This is the primordial reason for
Parliament, and it is the duty of its two
deliberative Chambers to scrutinize every
action of the Government and to use with
discretion their right of control. This line of
conduct is all the more justifiable when, concerning these matters, correspondence between
a taxpayer or a member of either Chamber and
the Government does not bring about any
noticeable change or satisfactory improvement.
Last week I read a large part of the Senate
Debates of 1914 to 1918, the period of the first
great war, and wes again confirmed in my old
opinion that no one at that time was inclined
to make the Senate a House of the dead or a
"yes men" Chamber.
A fair sense of economy is recommended to
all, but chiefly ta those who find commendable
the eagerness of all provinces and of al]
classes of the Canadian people to subscribe
to the Victory Loan of their own free will and
from a sense of duty or of legitimate interest.
In so doing the people act with great confidence, if not in the whole administration of
the present Government, at least in the
solvency of the country. The fine response
to the Victory Loan has a two-fold result:
it provides for our war effort, and it places
the people's money in security for after-war
necessities. It is a commendable economy.
The waste among some people is still very
deplorable, and is one of the main reasons why
the Government itself should practise economy.
But the people are placing in bonds not only
their present surplus, but especially their
accumulated savings.
The main complaint is concerned with the
unwarranted and burdensome expenditures that
arouse public opinion. A former Minister of
broad experience, Mr. Cardin, and Liberal and
Independent members of Parliament, and
newspapers, have pointed to intolerable waste.
Many war workers also have denounced this
scandalous extravagance. Government inspectors in factories, when they are not altogether
incompetent, are not vested with the necessary
authority and power to put an end to the
misuse and squandering of time and materials

216

SENATE

I know that written representations have been
made to the Government concerning this
matter.
Contracts on the cost-plus basis were severely
condemned by a United States Government
board after an investigation had revealed
theft amounting to millions of dollars. These
are a plague to Canada aise, and we had a
sample of them in Montreal. Because this
prodigality is known of, denounced, and
severely criticized throughout the country, the
people are ill-disposed towards the Government's restrictions on liquor, food, clothing
and recreation, which restrictions have the
good object of imposing a strict economy and
stimulating valuable and desirable production.
No thorough and efficient investigation of
this matter has been made or even yet ordered.
It is only fair that there should be a
rationing system based on conditions of place,
health, labour and cultural obligations; but
all too often ordinances are applied contrary
te carefulness, possibility and common sense.
For instance, the Government sets a ceiling
price on fuel-wood before the lumbermen
have a chance of going to the bush, before
anybody knows about climatie conditions and
wood dealers' terms.
Consequently, this
ordinance is generally met with the following
answer from the wood dealer: "Since the
Government sets maximum prices before ascertaining what the wood will cost us, we will
not cut any." Another instance: the Government set a ceiling price on maple syrup and
maple sugar before knowing whether the crop
would be abundant or deficient, and without
taking into consideration the very special
handicap caused by the accumulation of snow
and ice. As a result many farmers tapped
only part of their sugar bush, and as the
weather was unfavourable there was no maple
syriup on the market.
It is to be fea.red that restrictive measures
a.pplying to farm products cause a lessening of
production. Let us talk of the rationing of
outter. This product is net adequately
raticedi, that is, according to the conditions of
classes and creeds. Some religions compel
their followers to undergo many days of
abstinence from butter, and people of other
religions are on certain days unable to eat
meat, but the rationing takes no account of
these facts.
Neither do the rations make any exceptions
for the workers who take their meals at factories. Everywhere you can hear the same
complaint: the health of these factory workers
is usually affected or threatened.
Representations made to federal authorities
with a view to the solving of difficultiesencounHon. Mr. SAUVE.

tered in transporting workers under winter conditions were net seriously considered.
The
authorities refused to grant a transport service properly adapted to the needs of various
factories and in conformity with sanitary conditions required ty the people. There has
also been refusal to consider claims set up by
workers. This causes uneasiness and threats
of strikes. Once more I say that the Department of Labour should not wait until a strike
is declared before considering the demands
of workers.
When that is done, it is a case
of justice coming too late. This retarding of
justice bas been the cause of many strikes and
heavy losses to the country.
The income tax paid by the working class
is net properly balanced.
A single person
whose salary is incrceased from $30 to $40
receives, after all compulsory deductions, $4.75
more than before. A married man with three
children receives $6.78 more. I will dwell upcn
this matter later. If we induce single persons
to invest their money in Government bonds
as their salary and a sound sense of thrift
permit, their own future will be all the better
assured. But I wish to speak on behalf of
the married man, who has a family, and who
must pay rent or instalments on his house,
besides municipal, provincial and federal
taxes. The Income Tax Branch should reconsider his case, and should net be too deeply
influenced by the annoying bureaucracy which
sets up taxes anti orders.
Public opinion cannot understand why we
are still erecting large war factories or making
extensions to those already in existence, at a
cost of millions of dollars and with the wastage of much building material, which to-day
is se scarce that the construction of private
buildings is seriously hampered.
If the Government saw to it that a stricter
economy was practised in its own departments
and boards, the saving would be sufficient to
render unnecessary the over-taxing of private
citizens and soldiers. On stationery alone the
Government could save a very considerable
sum. The offices of each additional commission become new sources of misuse and waste.
If the Government wishes the people to practise strict economy, it must first of all prove
that it practises what it preaches. The more
we want to contribute to the war effort the
more we should endeavour to stop wasting
the finances and the assets of our countryour man-power and money. The Government
is in duty bound to prove its competence by
putting a stop to the extravagance of administration for which it is primarily responsible.
Those of us who are not against an adequate
participation in the war must be the first to

MAY 6,1943
insist with courage and firmness that the
Government practise strict economy in its
various departments, an economy equal to that
which is demanded from every class of our
people, and which is rendered a'bsolutely
necessary by the astronomical increase of our
national debt, as well as by our other formidable obligations.
The Government is not only loading its war
budget with billions; it is also in effect loading
post-war budgets. It is again promising what
it promised during and since the last war, but
bas not yet fulfilled. It proposes easy and
agreeable ways of living from birth to burial.
This teaching is totally contrary to a return
to normal life as set forth by Christianity.
Instead of helping democracies to revert to
Christian faith and practice, the pedagogues
authorized by the Government to give instruction to legislators in committee and to the
people listening over the radio are bent on
stuffing our brains with impracticable theories.
These can only produce dreams and illusions,
which, in turn, must lead to disillusion, crisis
and revolution. Post-war comfort is envisaged
that would entail billions of expenditure by
this god-state. In trying to kill a capitalistic
trust these pedagogues are working to make
another trust; yes, another trust against trust;
and so this latter and younger trust would
very quickly involve us in greater disaster than
the other.
The abuses of capitalism must be corrected,
but not by killing private capital, which is the
only basis of individual initiative. The social
ladder built by the Creator is still intact, and
those who wish to climb without using it will
break their necks and tumble into the abyss.
The power of capitalism must be controlled
by Government application of laws now in
force, especially those passed as a result of
the Stevens inquiry, or by the enactment of
new laws to meet present conditions.
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable members,
I should like to ask a question of the honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen), who gave an explanation of this Bill.
Personally I am not satisfied with the Minister's explanation of the discrimination between
the income tax paid on salary and the tax
levied on revenue from investments. Nor am
I satisfied with the reasons he gave for tax
exemption. May I put my question in the
forrn of a statement? One man, we will say,
receives an income of $20,000, made up of
$10,000 from investments and $10,000 from
salary. That is not an unusual condition in
this country, but of course the division is
purely arbitrary. On the $10,000 salary he
received in 1942 he has paid half the income

217

tax, and is exempt for all time as to the
balance. On the $10,000 return on his accumulated savings he has paid half the income
tax for 1942, but now or later he has to pay
the balance, or it will be a liability of his
estate after his death. There, to my mind, is
a discrimination which cannot be justified.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: There are many people
in this country who, as explained by the leader
on this side, while they were in receipt of a
small salary laid aside year by year small
savings, with the result that they have built up
a fund that they supposed would take care
of themselves and their families in their old
age. I contend it is an injustice on that class
of frugal people to exempt half the income
tax of a man with a salary of $20,000 while
exacting the last cent of income tax on a part
of the other man's income derived from interest on investments. As I have said, I am not
satisfied with the explanation given by the
Minister, and I should be glad to hear the
honourable senator from Inkerman explain the
reason for the discrimination. I might amplify
my statement. If a man is in receipt of a
salary of $40,000, as a good many men in
Canada are, why should he pay only half the
income tax on that $40,000 and have the balance cancelled for all time, while the man
who has saved sufficient money to bring hiJn
a return of $10,000 a year, and has that income
alone ta live on, is penalized to the extent
of having to pay full income tax? If the
honourable senator (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) or
the Minister can explain that apparent injustice, I shall be well pleased.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: And also the
4 per cent surtax.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Of course, the 4 per cent
surtax is just an additional burden. I leave
that out. The man with a salary of $50,000
pays only half his income tax for 1942, but the
man with $10,000 income on investments pays
the whole tax for that year. I think other
members besides myself would like to have
this discrimination explained.
While I am on my feet, I wish to endorse
what was said by the honourable gentleman
who sits to my right (Hon. Mr. Griesbach).
I know many cases of young men in the armed
forces who have been sent home for training.
Last year I had applications from such men
to get some adjustments in their income tax.
I took the cases up with the department, and
while I got very courteous replies from Mr.
Elliott, he stated that though it was an
apparent injustice, the law unfortunately precluded him from giving any relief. I have

SENATE
three of those young men very clearly in
mind. They came back frorn England for
training purposes and were here just long
enough to corne under the 1942 Income Tax
Act. They had to pay full income tax.
although they had been a year and a half in
Great Britain. I have two close relatives who
are now in Canada for training purposes.
They did not want to come back. They were
doing a good job over there, I am sure, and
no doubt they are also doing a good job here.
But they were told: "You men are useful
for training purposes. We want you to go back
to help train our forces in Canada, and you will
be sent over for an eight-month period." I am
glad the six months' relief has been granted,
but it is not adequate. I agree with my
honourable friend to my right that if the
matter were brought to the attention of the
Minister of National Defence it would be
adjusted.
I do not think the Bill can be
amended at this stage. I suggest that the
leader of the louse take the matter up with
the Minister of National Defence.
If the
exemption period were extended to eight
months it would be a welcome relief to men
who are sent back here for instructional purposes. While there is a provision in the Bill
that a person may make application for relief,
it is difficult for these young officers to do so.
In the first place, they are busy, and they do
net know how to make the necessary application; in the second place, they should not be
required to make it; in the third place, they
have no assurance whatever that the application would be granted.
Now, I have asked what is perhaps an
involved question. The first part is: Why is
the man with a large salary exempted when the
man with small income is taxed? The other
part is about this eight-month period as against
the six-month period.
As Chairman of the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce I have no complaint
whatever to make. I am delighted to be
relieved of work. We are net looking for
work. I have no objection whatever to the
work being taken away from the Committee on
Banking and Commerce and put into the hands
of any other committee. Nobody has ever
heard any complaint from me on that score
at all.
I can substantiate what has been said about
the Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Since I came into this House, twenty-two years
ago, it has beerf the committee to which all
legislation similar to these bills, and general
commercial and financial bills, have been referred. The reason for that has been explained.
The committee is a large one, and when the
leaders meet frorm year to year they place on
Hon. Mr. BLACK.

it those who they think are capable of acting on it and will attend its meetings. I do
net sec any necessity for taking these bills
away from the Committee on Banking and
Commerce, though I make no objection to it.
As chairman of the committee I offer no
apology for the committee, because, as I say,
it has worked sedulously and carefully and
has given close attention to all matters placed
in its hands. Although there may have been
strong criticism of that committee, I have
never heard it. If there are any objections to
the chairman of the committee, I can assure
you that ho would be delighted to resign.
The position is an arduous one. I never sought
it. I was placed there and have given the
best service I could, and I want it plainly
understood that the fact that such bills as
were formerly referred to the Committee on
Banking and Commerce are not now referred
to it does net affect me at all. I am quite
willing that they should be referred to other
committees, and I shall be much pleased to
attend the meetings of those committees and
get whatever information I can.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:
May I deal first
with the second question, about the young
officers who came back from overseas for eight
months' training in Canada. Under the present income tax measure the moment those
young officers returned to Canada they became
liable for the payment of income tax on their
total income, just as if they were civilians.
This amending Bill does two things; it relieves
their position in two ways. First of all, it says
that on return frem overseas they shall be
exempt from the payment of income tax on
pay and allowances for six months. The
second thing it does is to bring them within
the class of people who are on active service
in Canada and who pay no income tax whatever on the first $1,600 of their income, if they
are single. If they are married and have
dependents that amount is increased up to a
maximum of, I think, something like $2,800. So
from that point of view, I do not think the
question amounts to very much. If they were
single men and their income from pay and
allowances was in excess of $1,600, any tax

apparent injustice in that. If the Bill provided

salaries of 310,000 or under, or $12,000 or
under, or $15,000 or under, whicbever figure
might be fixed, tlat would ho reasonable, but

the comparative few with a saiary of $40.000.
There are a great many taxpayers with smaîl
incomes who nover paid taxes before, and
they ccili receive relief that is not afforded to
persons with a large inceme from investments.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I must confess, bonotirable senators, that I still cannot understand
why a 350,000 saiary is exempt from taxation
for haîf of 1942, whereas a $10,000 income from
mnvestments is taxed for the whoie yoar.

DISCUSSION

POSTPONED

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH: Honourable
senators, I should like, with consent of the
House, to refer back to Inquiries, as I have
received from the honourable leader of the
House (Hon. Mr. Ring) a reply upon which I
wish to offer a few observations now, if I may.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I assume that the
honourable gentleman bas unanimous consent
to comment on the answer to his inquiry;
otherwise lie cannot proceed.
An Hon. SENATOR:

Consent.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Could not the
honourable senator defer his remarks until the
rest of us have had an opportunity to read
the answer?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I have just received the answer, and if I do not speak now
I shall never have another opportunity to say
anything about it at all unless I introduce it
in a roundabout way. I should like to finish
this part of the discussion now. I shall take
only a few minutes.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I do not think my honourable friend would be in order to discuss the
matter now. He gave notice of inquiry. His
inquiry bas been answered.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: My point is that
obviously my inquiry bas not been answered
at all.
Hon. Mr. KING: I take exception to my
honourable friend's statement. The Government bas answered the inquiry by saying that
the matter is at present before the Supreme
Court of Canada and therefore cannot be the
subject of comment. That being so, I do not
think my honourable friend can discuss the
answer.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: If my honourable
friend will read the answer he bas given me
ho will find my inquiry is not dealt with. This
last question, for instance, is not before the
court.
Hon. Mr. KING: That is my information,
and it comes from the Department of External
Affairs.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The answer is that
all the nine questions relate to matters which
have been referred to the Supreme Court of
Canada for judicial determination. My eighth
question is:

ALLIED VICTORY IN NORTH AFRICA
RESOLUTION

Hon. J. H. KING: H{onourable senators,
before we proceed with the business of the
day, I think it fitting that we should take
cognizance of yesterday's great event: the
German General, Von Arnim, chief of the
Axis forces in North Africa, threw in his hand
to the Allied commanders. That phrase "threw
in his hand" is a gambler's term, and I use it
because Germany and Italy took a gambler's
chance when they tried over a period of years
to interrupt and sever the relationship that
Great Britain has enjoyed with countries of the
East. The surrender meant the taking by our
side of 150,000 figbting men, great quantities
of guns, and war material of all kinds, and
signified the end of the German and Italian
armies in Africa. From reports in the morning Press, one would judge that the supplies
taken from the German and Italian command
yesterday were almost enougb to equip the
French Army that bas been recently engaged
in Africa.
The North African campaign has extended
over a period of three 3ears. It is estimated
that in that tinie tbe Axis forces have lost
some 600,000 soldiers, either as casualties
or as prisoners of war.
One can well understand the seriousness of
this defeat to the Axis powers by considering
the high value that Germany and Italy placed
on the success of their African campaign. For
years preceding the war they liad sent their
political agents throughout India, Iran, Iraq
and Egypt, hoping to undermine British inflience in those countries. In this they had
some success, as I shall show a little later.
Italy left the League of Nations in order
that she might be free to establish herself in
Ethiopia. The British Government was fully
conscious of the great danger confronting the
situation in North Africa, and knew that if
it was unable to protect this area the whole
situation in the East would collapse and the
sea lanes would be closed to Allied shipping.
We can now more fully appreciate the
determination shown by the British Government when, even after the fall of France and
the evacuation of the British troops from Dunkirk, the threatened invasion of England and
Hon. Mr. KING.

the entry of Italy into the war as an ally of
Germany, Prime Minister Churchill declared
that he would destroy and tear to tatters
Mussolini's African empire. He took immediate steps te put his threat into execution by
ordering the invasion of Ethiopia and Italian
Somaliland.
In that campaign the British
forces were associated with troops from the
Eastern dominions, that is, from South Africa,
Australia, New Zealand, and India. In order
to counteract German influence in Iran and
Iraq, the British and Russian forces moved
into those countries and brought about the
expulsion of Cerman agents and their proNazi sympathizers. In company with the Free
French troops, our army invaded Syria and
placed the government of that country under
the control of General de Gaulle.
We all know the story of the Libyan campaign against the Italians and their defeat by
Genieral Wavell, who was only thwarted of
complete victory by the necessity of detaching from his army a large force to join our
troops on the Grecian front, where, unfortunately, we suffered a serions reverse.
After their successes in the Balkans and
in Russia, in 1941, the Germans moved some of
their best divisions into the Libyan area and
placed the command of their own and the
Italian forces under one of the most distinguished German officers, General Rommel.
As i well kniown, he succeeded in driving the
Britisli forces out of Libya and well back into
Egypt; in fact, almost to the doors of the
great naval port of Alexandria.
But to-day we know that by careful planning
and collaboration on the part of the two great
leaders of the English-speaking world, the
Prime Minister of Great Britain, Mr. Churchill,
and the Pre-ident of the United States, Mr.
Roosevelt, large numbers of troops and great
quantities of war supplies were transported
around the Cape of Good Hope to Egypt.
This enabled Montgomery to defeat Rommel's
forces at El Alamein and to keep them on
tlie run until they were in the trap that had
been prepared for them in Tunisia-a trap
that rlosed yesterday.
I think it is most gratifying to the people
of the British Commonwealth of Nations that
ve threw in our lot with Great Britain, not late,
but early in August and September, 1939. To-day
we have the satisfaction of knowing that, to
this time at least, we have backed the winning
horse. The defeat of the German and Italian
forces and the destruction of their wellplanned campaign in Africa should help us
te realize the feelings of the people living
in the countries of Europe which have been
overrun by the Axis powers. One can imagine

SENATE

the history of this war is recorded, the successful conclusion of the North African campaign will be seen as something far more
significant than a brilliant victory: as an
indication of the unity and solidarity of the
United Nations, of the British, American,
French, Indian, Dominion and native troops
in this great campaign.
My honourable friend bas truly stated that
in the early stages of the war the picture was
not a bright one, especially when materials
and men had to be sent over a route of some
14,000 miles, via the Cape of Good Hope. It
has been a long struggle. I am very glad that
the honourable leader referred to that gallant
soldier, General Wavell, who, with a much
smaller force than the Italians bad when they
were at Sidi Barrani, about two hundred miles
from Egypt, drove them back as far as Tobruk
and almost annihilated them. But for the
crisis in Greece at the time, which necessitated
calling upon General Wavell for large numbers of troops to be sent there, be no doubt
would have gone on in triumph to Tripoli.
I wish also to mention another able soldier
about whom too little bas been heard, that
famous Scottish General, Auchinleck. After
the unfortunate temporary defeat at Tobruk,
when 25,000 of our army were captured, nearly
300 tanks put out of action and we had to
begin a retreat that stopped only at El Alamein,
it was General Auchinleck's skill and the
bravery of the small force he had with him
that held the enemy until such time as General
Montgomery could gather a larger army and
accumulate the necessary armaments and other
supplies, which had to be sent to Egypt net
only from England, but also from the country
of our gallant ally, the United States.
The victory that bas just been concluded is
cally greater than we had expected. We certainly looked for victory, but we could not
foresee all that bas happened. As the honourable leader pointed out, eleven German generals have capitulated, along with a number
of Italians, and the number of prisoners in our
hands is 150,000. We now have absolute control of North Africa. That is indeed a wonderful accomplishment by the Allied forces.
At the outset of the struggle the enemy
occupied all the strategie heights. Some of the
hills were as high as 2,000 feet, and our gallant troops bad te climb up them in single
file. In attacks in those hilly districts it was
a case of man fighting against man. We always
did know, but we know with greater certainty
now than ever before, that, good as the German armies are, the Allied armies are more
than a match for them when equal in numbers
and as well equipped.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

Another wonderful feature about this North
African campaign was the remarkable pursuit
of the enemy for a distance of some 2,000
miles. There is nothing like that in the history
of any previous war. It must have been a
gigantic undertaking to keep the Allied armies
supplied with munitions, food and other requisites over that long stretch of country. We
all join with the honourable leader in paying
tribute te that gallant gentleman, General
Montgomery, and the men under his command.
We know there is a long road ahead of us
yet, but we and all the other Allied nations
are full of confidence. Victory is bound to be
achieved, let the time be long or short. This
war, unlike the last one, will end in unconditional surrender of the enemy. The United
Nations and their forceson land, in the air
and on the sea are imbued with the knowledge
that they are fighting for the freedom of all the
peoples of the world, more particularly those
whose countries have been overrun by a ruthless enemy.
Canada bas played a very great role in this
war. As the honourable leader has stated, we
are looking forward to the day when our
Canadian army will be active. They did great
things in the last war, and they will net disappoint us when their time comes in this war.
We hopc that-I cannot say in the near future,
but probably, without being too optimistie,
by the year -1944-we shall be able to celebrate in this Chamber the Allied armies' vietory, in which the Canadian Corps will have
played a noble and brave part; a victory that
will mean nothing less than the complete
capitulation of the enemy.
I thank the honourable leader for giving me
an opportunity to second this important resolution, and I am only sorry that my remarks
were net better prepared. The victory in
North Africa is an historic event, and it is
fitting that this Chamber, the Senate of Canada, should associate itself with the House of
Commons in paying tribute to all those who
are mentioned in the resolution.
The resolution was adopted.
NAZI CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY
MoTION-DISCUSSIoN

CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from April 15 the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. Hugessen:
That this House views with indignation and
horror the barbarous treatment inflicted by
Nazi Germany on the peoples of occupied
Europe, expresses its sympathy with the unfortunate victims, and urges that stern punishment
be inflicted on those who are shown to be
responsible for these crimes against humanity.

MAY 13, 1943
Hon. S. A. HAYDEN: Honourable senators,
some weeks ago the honourable senator from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) moved this
resolution. There are a few things which,
with your indulgence, J should like to add to
the debate, because I regard it as being a
very important resolution from the point of
view of lending support and encouragement to
the peoples of occupied Europe, who are
undergoing untold suffering and hardship at
the present time, and whose soldiers, free from
German control, are fighting so valiantly in
the cause of the United Nations.
I desire therefore to join with the honourable senator from Inkerman in his condemnatien of the German atrocities in occupied
Europe, and in expressing sincere and wholehearted sympathy with the unfortunate victims.
As Disraeli once saidý:
There are rare instances when the sympathy
of a nation approaches those tenderer feelings
which are generally supposed to be peculiar to
the individual and to be the happy privilege
of private life; and this is one.
We may well say that this is indeed one of
those occasions where sympathy, real and
sincere, such as may exist between individuals,
is the kind of sympathy that we feel for those
oppressed peoples. I think it is good for us
to pause and contemplate their tragic misfortunes and to realize how fortunate we have
been to escape such suffering and misery by
what I may call the mere accident of
geography.
May I for a few moments mention in a
general way some of the atrocities? The
story of German atrocities in occupied Europe
is so shocking and so revolting to our sense

of what is decent and humane that when we
read of them in any detail we are incredulous,
almost unable to accept as true the narration
of such brutal, inhuman and unnatural acts.
Two thousand years of Christian civilization
and cultural development have only made the
German more terrible and more barbarous in
his cruelty to his fellow men; and the expression, "man's inhumanity to man," takes on a
new meaning when we read the story of the
treatment by German military and civil
forces of the peoples of Poland and the other
countries of Europe that have been overrun
by the German hordes. The fortunate persons, I think, were those whom the 'Germans
executede at once.
In Poland, for instance, mass executions and
mass deportations were two weapons used by
the German authorities, both civil and military, to maintain control of the country. They
divided Poland into two parts. The western
half they incorporated into the Reich. It was
net even classified as occupied territory.
There the Poles had no status whatsoever;

229

they were aliens in their own country and were
regarded as usurping the property and positions of those Germans who moved in onthe
heels of their armed forces and took over the
property and business of the inhabitants. The
only thing left for the Poles in that section
was deportation or slow death in prisons and
concentration camps.
The other part of Poland became known as
the Government General, and the only right to
existence allowed the Poles there was the right
to serve the interests of the German people
and the German army. There were mass executions of the business and professional classes,
their only crime being their social standing
and education.
There were executions of old people,
the sick and children, their only crime
being that they were unable to render
any service to their German masters. There
were punitive expeditions against the inhabitants of towns and villages, in which the whole
population, including women and children,
were burned or shot to death. There was the
continued use of prisons and extermination
camps where Poles and Jews were herded together and systematically put to death. There
were brutal whippings, physical violence,
starvation and refined torture that exceeded
the worst efforts of the early barbarian hordes
of Europe. These methods were used by the
Germans against the people of Poland as part
of the policy of extermination.
In addition to all this there was the mass
deportation of hundreds of thousands of men
and women for forced labour in various parts
of Europe, from which they could not shift.
On top of all, there was what is called the
policy of collective repression, that is, the collective responsibility of hostages to ensure
the imposed order of the German civil and
military authorities. For instance, when a
German soldier was shot at, or when a village
failed to meet its levy of grain or other foodstuffs for the German army or for expert to
Germany, thes'e hostages were massacred or
thrown into prisons and concentration camps
specially designed for this type of "crime."
Then again, the Jews in Poland were isolated
in the Ghettoes of Warsaw and elsewhere
throughout Poland and denied any human
recognition. They were treated in the most
brutal and bestial manner; starved to death,
slaughtered in thousands, transported in mass
trainloads in cattle cars to special camps,
where those who survived the trip found torture, starvation and death. The old people
were taken to cemeteries and murdered, for
they were of no use to their German masters.
Only the strong escaped death in those special
camps, to be enslaved as labourers. It is

230

SENATE

reported on reliable authority that of 3,130,000
Jews in Poland three years ago, more than
1,600,000 have since been exterminated. In
order to get some idea of what that mass
extermination means, we have only to contomplate the murder of every man, woman and
child in a city the size of Montreal. Then
only can we realize just how terrible has been
the German visitation upon the Polish people.
In order to illustrate the German point of
view, I desire to cite the remarks of one or
two German authorities.
Dr. Frank, the
Governor of the Government General of
Poland, stated on one occasion:
The Polish State has ceased to exist and will
never return to life.
Herr Greiser, another German official in
Poland:, said:
For the first time in German history we are
politically exploiting our military victories. Not
even a centimetre of the land we have conquered
will ever belong to a Pole again. Poles can
work for us, but not as rulers, only as serfs.
In Belgium, Czecheslovakia, France, Greece,
the Netherlands and Norway, the same policy
of collective repression was and is still at
work. Hostages are used as a weapon to impose upon the conquered people the will and
orders of the German authorities. There is no
justice in these lands but the will of the
German authoritics, and there is no law but the
whim of the German masters. Day after day
we read the story of the slaughter of those
whom I may oall the innocents, which goes
on throughout occupied Europe. We have
mass deportations from these various countries
into the Reich of skilled workers to man the
German industrial machine. All these countries are called uîpon to supply grain and food.stuffs for the German military machine in
order that the war potential of Germany nay
be maintained at as high a level as possible.
The principle sees to be that the serfs must
slave and starve in order that their German
masters may achieve their goal of world
domination. Murder, torture and the concentration camps are used to this end. I think
we may well say that at last Germany has
reached the zenith of military organization.
The resources and lives of the conquered belong to their conquerors to do with them as
they will. It is a sad, commentary that this
condition of slavery and serfdom exists in so
many parts of Europe after two thousand
years of Christian civilization.
Surely out of all this we must draw some
conclusions to guide us in our handling of
this German problem with firmness and iron
will when victory has been won.
Some Hon. SENATORS:
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN.

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN:
First, however, I
desire to express to the oppressed peoples in
Europe, the Poles, Czechs, Belgians, Greeks,
Dutch, French and Norwegians, our sincere
and whole-hearted sympathy with their lot.
I desire also to assure them that as we contemplate their sufferings we are only strengthened in our resolve to overthrow this barbarous
tyranny that has enslaved so many of the
peoples of Europe. By approving this resolution we give assurance that we condemn such
practices, and that we are firmly and inexorably bent on bringing punishment and retribution on those who have been guilty of such
inhuman acts.
But punishment and retribution must be
adapted to meet the German mentality and
philosophy, because the German - does not
think as we do. The German standard of
morality is not ours; it is essentially different.
To the German force is right. To him all that
matters is who is the stronger. To him, good
is German good, truth is Aryan truth. Everyone and everything must be made subservient
to German interests and German progress.
German philosophers have fostered, this doctrine and inculcated it in the German mind,
so that to-day we have it in the form of a
mental ailment or disease, and we must deal
with it as such.
We must therefore at his tiie conidier the

there is more. In the World War of 1914-1918
we were fighting, not for the acquisition of
new territories nor for material gain of any
kind, but simply for the peace of the world
at large. We are now fighting for a still
nobler cause-the salvation of Christianity,
of liberty, of civilization. To this end we
are making sacrifices which should entitle
us to a place among the victorious nations
and give us the right to judge the guilty
nations and punish the leaders of those
nations for their inhumanity and their oppression. But what we do shall be done in accordance with international law.
A small paragraplh in an editorial of the
Montreal Gazette of Saturday, April 24, reads
as follows:
New justification appears, oddly enougi, in
the letter from a Berlin civilian found on a
German war prisoner in Tunisia, and made
public by Allied authorities there yesterday.
"Remember Hamburg, Cologne," he implores
German soldiers. "Be pitiless, for the English
know no pity. Hate, hate, and hate alone must
fill every German's seul."
Hate engenders hate.
Now let us look at the other side. In the
Reader's Digest of February, 1943, there is a
statement made ta a correspondent by a Major
Krechet, of the Red Army, on the evening
before he died of wounds in hospital. It is
as follows:
When we kill Germans now, we are not
taking revenge; we are fulfilling a simple funetion of war. What I am afraid of is that
when we shall begin to take our revenge there
will be found such humanitarians, especially
abroad, who will start to talk about mercy
and morality.
These people have not seen their dearest
oees shot by Germans as they travel on the
wide highways. They have not been shocked
by the smoke of their own burning cities or
found the ruins of their own bouses blocking
their path. They do not know the real woe
of the people.
How will the Fascists be able to repay for
the losses of thousands upon thousands of
Russian families?
The Hitlerites should be
annihilated, by dozens, by thousands, like rats;
for the sake of the future we must cleanse the
world of this black plague.
Thousands are dying with the belief that
there will be such an avenging justice. The
Fascists have made us ruthless, and they shall
feel that ruthlessness on their own skins.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE.

When I state that we should judge and
punish according te international law, it is
because I know that nat hate, but justice,
will dictate our action.
In dividing his resolution into three parts,
the honourable
senator from
Inkerman
addressed the first part ta a condemnation of
the Nazi forces in their inhuman treatment of
occupied countries. To his quotations could
we net add the following queries? What about
the action of Italy in stabbing her neighbour,
France, in the back-to use words that have
now passed into history? What about the
sufferings of Asiatic peoples at the hands of
the Japs? - What about the atrocities in
China? What about the shooting of American
aviators who
had become prisoners in
Japanese territories? What about Germany
attacking Russia after entering into a treaty
of non-aggression with her, the attack being
made without provocation, justification or
excuse, even without notice that the treaty
was broken? WThat about Japan's action at
Pearl Harbour at the sae
hour as ber
ambassador and representatives in Washington
were assuring the Americans of their friendly
spirit? Who has ever read anything of the
kind in history? And what about the hellish
abominations against the Jews?
It may be well to cite sone of the words
of Ben Hecbt, as published in the Reader's
Digest of February. Here they are:
Remember us who were put in the freight
trains that left France, Holland and Belgium
for the East. We died standing up, for there
was no food or air or water. Those who
survived were sent to Transnistria and there
died of hunger, slowly and under the watchful
eyes of the Germans and Rumanians.
We fill the waters of the Dnieper to-day
with our bodies, thousands of us. For a long
tinie to come no one will he able to drink from
that river or swim in it, for we are still there.
And this, too, is held against us, that we have
poisoned the waters with our dead bodies.
Remember us who were in the Ukraine. Here
the Germans grew angry because we were costing them too much time and ammunition to
kill. They devised a less expensive method.
They took our women into the roads and tied
them together with our children. Then they
drove their heavy motor lorries into us.
Thousands of us died with German military
cars running back and forth over our broken
bodies.
Remember us in Ismail when the Rumanians
came. For two days they were busy leading
aIl the Jews to the synagogue. We were finally
locked inside it. Then the Rumanian Iron
Guards blew us up with dynamite.
In Ungheni, Rumania, the Germans accused
us of crimes against the police. Three thousand
of us were tried. The Germans followed us to
our homes. They had been forbidden to waste
bullets on us. We were old and unarmed, but
it took them two days to club us all to death
with their rifle butts and rip us into silence
with their bayonets.

MAY 13, 1943
When the German delegates sit at the peace
table, no sons or survivors or representatives
of these myriad dead will be there to speak
for them. And by that time it will be seen
that the Jews are Jews only when they fall
under German rifle butts, before German motor
lorries,. and lang from German belts out of
their kitchen windows. Once dead it will be
seen that the Jews are left without a government to speak for their avenging, and that
there is no banner to fly in their to-morrow.
One could cite page after page of these
crimes against humanity, of this extermination
of a race-an extermination promised and
planned by Hitler himself. These crimes
deserve punishment, and punishment there
shall be.
When we speak, honourable senators, of the
punishment of the guilty Nazis, we should not
confine our judgment to the military elements.
What about the systematic looting and plundering of the natural resources of the occupied
countries and the confiscation of commercial
enterprises by German authorities? Like myself, you must have read that in the United
States a committee has just been formed for
the protection of foreign owners, to look after
the interests of some two million people whose
properties have been stolen by the German
authorities. It has been announced by the
Office of War Economies in Washington that
the amount of this looting is estimated at
thirty billion dollars--and that does not take
into account the damage donc by the Japs in
Asia, New Guinea and the Netherlands possessiens.
It has been stated that we are far removed
from the scene of these atrocities and that we
have no direct interest in the matter. Are we
so far removed when ships are being sunk
in the St. Lawrence river, on the banks of
Newfoundland or on the shores of Alaska?
We know very well that, were it not for the
splendid work donc by our forces in the air,
on thé sea and on land, our shores would have
been invaded long ago, properties would have
been destroyed and lives would have been
sacrificed.
I have dealt witli the third part of the
resolution, leaving the second for the end of
my address. This second part expresses sympathy for the oppressed peoples. This sympathy is universal. It is deep in the heart of
everyone-man, woman or child-irrespective
of race, religion and language.
The honourable the mover of the resolution
has told yeu in a succinct but complete way
of the sufferings of the nations attacked and
suibj.ugated by the Axis. It is not necessary
for me to repeat his statements or elaborate
the story of abuses, outrages, murders, rape,
destruction. But, as I stated at the beginning
72542-16

233

of my remarks, I will refer particularly to the
fate of France. I do not know whether lionourable members ha-ve read the message of the
French Admirai, Darlan, as publi.shed in Cosmopolitan magazine of last month. I would
not pass judgment on the activities of Admiral
Darlan, for I think it is too soon to do so yet,
since we are not in possession of all the facts
and circumstances that have surrounded or
guided those activities. In that message to
the American people Admiral Darlan said:
In defiance of all international law, Qermany

of means of transport, which really amounted
to downright theft. She threw into prison,
deported, massacred and persecuted in a thousand ways my fellow countrymen, while professing a make-believe collaboration that was but
a further insult to their pride.
. . . The whole of metropolitan France has
been occupied, martyrized and starved by the
troops of the Axis. The fleet that I had the
honour to command, that was the pride of the
nation and the apple of my eye, scuttled itself
in order to avoid falling into Nazi and Italian
hands.
Is France dead? With millions of friends of
this brave nation, I say "No." France cannot
die. The country of Clovis, Charlemagne,
Saint Louis, Joan of Are, Louis XIV, of
Napoleon, of Foch, Joffre, Clemenceau, de
Gaulle and Giraud will not die. In the past
France has known defeat, invasion, revolution
and bloodsbed, and to-day it knows the horrors
of slavery. But France bas always come back
to the rank of a first-class power. The France
that has given to the world scientists, writers,
musicians, missionaries, will not die. Salvation, which came in the past, is again coming;
and the miracle is that it will come firstly by
the efforts and sacrifices of the country which
for centuries was France's worst and most
powerful enemy.
England, at the last moment before the
collapse of France, offered to share with her
al.ly faith, efforts, sacrifices, even citizenship.
This was declined, not by France, but by politicians, who will be judged by history. England
stood by, not only with arms at the shoulder,
but with faith in lier soul and courage in ber
beart. Through the heroisn of her people,
the help of lier dominions and colonies, and

REVIBED EDITION

SENATE
the co-operation of her Allies, she will help to
save France and restore her to the status of
a great nation. With the help of England, the
United States, Russia and the other Allied
nations, France will be rejuvenated. Canada is
one of these other nations, and it is befitting
that Canada should do her share. And she
will do her share with pride, and in the spirit
of love.
That is what I intended to say to you some
little time ago, honourable senators, when this
discussion was adjourned. But let us thank
God ·that we can say more to-day, because
of the glorious news that we have received.
The salvation ýthat we were praying for is
coming. One has only to read General Giraud's
order of the day to his troops to believe that
,the time of ultimate victory and of definite
salvation for the oppressed peoples and for
France is getting doser. Here are his splendid
words:
On Joan of Arc day, IMay 8, Tunis bas been

American army, honour to you soldiers of
France who fought without arms, without
clothes, without boots, but who believed in

Thanks to you, the French armny bas restored

that soon will come the day when we truly
shall be able to proclaim to the world these
words, which are French, but are understood
everywhere and by everyone: Liberté! Egalité!
Fraternité!
Hon. L. M. GOUIN: Honourable senators,
I wish to add a few words to the remarks which
have just been so eloquently made by our
colleagues from Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte)
and Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) in support
of the resolution now before the Senate; and
I desire to congratulate sincerely the honourable mover of this resolution (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) for his excellent address and the
admirable way in which he delivered it.
Following the example of the honourable
mover, I should like at the outset to call the
attention of honourable senators to the part
which should normally be played by this
Upper House in the sphere of external affairs.
In this we should avail ourselves of the precedents set by the House of Lords in Great
Britain and by the Senate of the United
States. I too believe it is time that the
voice of Canada's Parliament should be heard
on international questions. But, as our colleague from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen)
remarked:
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE.

So far during the present war this country bas
for the most part allowed its name to be used,
or allowed itself to lie spoken for, by one or
other and sometimes by both of the two great
nations with which we are more particularly
allied, Great Britain and the United States.
The Prime Minister stated, with a legitimate
sense of national pride, when launching the
Fourth Victory Loan campaign, on April 19,
"We sec Canada now emerging from nationhood
to the position of a world power." And from a
statement made in another place yesterday we
learned with great satisfaction that Canada
will take part in the very important conversations which have already begun, at Washington, between the Prime Minister of Great
Britain and the President of the United States.
The invitation to participate in these conversations proves that Canada is now playing
a role of ever increasing importance among
our Allies. To quote again the great leader
of our Canadian Confederation in the present
struggle, the "Dominion has become a vast
arsenal, fourth in war production among the
United Nations."
Indeed, our achievements are astounding.
Our unexcelled flying organization, the heroie
Royal Canadian Air Force, with which I am
grcatiy lionoured to be now associated in a
humble way, makes us the fourth greatest
military air power among the democratic
countries.
Next vear, under our present
naval programme, the personnel of the viliant
Royal Canadian Navy will be almuost equal
m number to the personnel of the British
Navy shortly after the beginning of hostilities.
And we now have an army of 435,000 men,
without taking into account our very considerable reserves.
In terms of man-power, among the twentyeight Allied nations we occupy, as pointed out
by the honourable gentleman from Inkerman
li
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen), sixth place. Honourable
senators, in view of this almost superhuman
and even miraculous war effort for a country
of only eleven and a half millions of people,
is it not clear that. in the words of our
colleague, "Canada should let lier voice be
heard and lier weiglit be felt in discussions of
international affairs"? I do not hesitate to

answer this question affirmatively.

If you grant these promises, honourable
senators, it follows logically that thc motion
now before us comes at a very opportune
moment. Yes, it is clearly my duty as a
Canadian citizen to protest against the atrocities committed by the Nazis in the oppressed
territories that they occupy. Like my colleague fron Inkerman, I wish to - express
heartfelt sympathy for those millions of our
Allies now undergoing the inhuman treatment
inflicted upon them.

MAY 13, 1943
I quote from an interesting article by
Professor Robert R. Wilson in the January,¯
1943, issue of the American Journal of International Law:
Deportations, forced labour, and shootings of
hostages have been conspicuous features of the
German policy. . . . As of July 1, 1942, the
Germans were reported to have approximately
six millions of foreign labourers in the Reich,
of whom at least half were acknowledged
civilians.
In the same issue there is an ed:itorial
comment by my learnedi friend George A.
Finch.
Under the title, "Retribution for
Crimes," this prominent international lawyer
denounces with a truly Christian indignation:
the evident purpose of the present enemy to
reduce large masses of conquered populations
to permanent subjection and to exterminate
others, including his own, whom he cannot
assimilate into his so-called racial and ideological new order.
Thus, continues Mr. Finch, we witness
an orgy of inhuman brutalities on a scale unprecedented in previous wars, not only in
flagrant violation of universally accepted laws
of war, but which have also, in President
Roosevelt's words, "violated every tenet of the
Christian f aith."
In order to protest before the whole world
against these increasing crimes, the governments in exile of eight European States, and
also the Free French National Committee,
signed, in London, on January 13, 1942, a
solemn declaration.
The signatories are:
Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Luxembourg,
The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Yugoslavia andi Free France. These nine powers
have formallýy placed among their principal
war aims the punishment, tbrough the channel
of organized justice, of those persons gu'ilty of
or responsible for war crimes, whether those
persons have ordered the crimes, perpetrated
them or participated in them. The nine powers
have resolved to see to it, in a spirit of
international solidarity, that those guilty or
responsible persons, whatever their nationality,
are sought out, handed over to justice and
judged, and that the sentences pronounced
shall this time be carried out.
Let me add that Great Britain and the
United States have agreed to establish a commission for the investigation of war crimes,
to be composed of nationals of the United
Nations, selected by their governments. In
making his announcement to the House of
Lords on October 7, 1942, the Lord Chancellor referred to the mistake made in 1919.
At the end of the first world war it was only
after signature of the final peace treaty that
a demand was made for the surrender of the
criminals wanted for war crimes, but the Lord
Chancellor declared that when this war ends
they should be caught and handed over at
72542-16î

the time, and as a condition, of the Armistice,
with the right of course to require the delivery
of all others as soon as supplementary investigations are completed.
Let me remark here that the Treaty of
Versailles contained various provisions for
the punishment of war crimes, but such penal
provisions were not very effectively carried
out. In his editorial comment of January
last, Mr. Finch gives the names of various
notorious German officers whom it had been
decided in 1919 to bring to trial in the
courts of thé Allied and Associated Powers.
But there was so much opposition in Germany against such a course that the accused
were allowed to be summoned before the
German courts. Mr. Finch adds:
Only a few of the hundreds of accused members of the German armed forces were belatedly
tried before the German Supreme Court at
Leipzig and given police court sentences, which
were net seriously executed.
The trial of the Kaiser d'id not take place,
because Holland considered that the charge
against him was political, and therefore bis
extradition not legally demandable.
This time, as stated by our colleague froin
Inkerman, those who are to be brought to
trial are "the criminal gangsters who have
caused untold misery and suffering throughout Europe." No less an authority than
Mr. Finch is of opinion that it is legally
possible to try and punish such ringleaders.
He declares:
If this means the responsible authorities of
the enemy States under whose orders or direction crimes and atrocities have been perpetrated,
their indictment before military tribunals should
be feasible on the well-known principle of law,
respondeat superior.
I have given these citations because the
honourable senator from Inkerman bas himself anticipated objections which may be
made to his resolution. He knew that some
people would describe it as a useless gesture.
I have shown-to your satisfaction, I hopethat such is not the case. Indeed,, it is our
duty to show our sympathy for the people
who are now the victims of the Nazi hordes:
the populations of Austria, Czechoslovakia,
Poland, Norway, Denmark, Holland, Belgium,
Luxembourg, Greece and Yugoslavia.
Of my ancient mother country, France, my
honourable friend from Inkerman bas said:
"La France est morte. Vive la France." I
appreciate the noble feelings which he has
expressed for the .unhappy people of France.
But, for my part, I believe that France is not
dead, that France cannot die. In Tunisia our
common enemies have learned that, side by
side with their British and American brothers
in arms, with the help also of our Canadian

airmen and sailors. Frenchmen have contributed their full and glorious share in literally
throwing the Nazis and Fascists into the
Mediterranean. The combined efforts of the
Allied forces have secured the triumphant
victory for which we are now thanking God
from the depths of our Christian hearts. Next
Sunday morning, honourable senators, at the
request of our Cardinal, a great Canadian and
a most loyal citizen, in all our churches of
Quebec, the heart of New France, the Te
Deum will be sung. From the steeple of our
historie chapel of Our Lady of VictoriesNotre-Dame des Victoires-the old bells which
came from France centuries ago, our dear old
bells, nos bonnes vieilles cloches de Francesoeurs de celles de Louisbourg, chers sénateurs
des provinces maritimes--will be heard once
more, as they ring out our joy and our gratitude, under the protection of the Union Jack,
which floats freely in the wind on Cape Diamond. The voices of our faithful, faithful to
their creed and to thcir race, the voices also of
our sacred chimes, will proclaim triumphantly
to Heaven and to earth that France cannot die;
that her destiny is to survive in old Europe
as well as here in North America; that France
is eternal. Vive la France éternelle!
Oh!
how happy we are indeed, as compared with
our brothers in conquered France!
But in
spite of terrible sufferings the French people
almost unanimously ha ve remained faithful to
their patriotic ideal, which is also ours.
Thanks to General dle Gaulle, Free Frenchmen have always continued to fight on our
side, and in the darkest hour in French
history it could be, said: "If all is lost, at
ieast our honour is safl." To all those who
are now serving under General Giraud, the
glorious veteran of 1914, to all the soldiers,
sailors and airmen of the fighting forces of
France, and also to all rny own countrymen, I
wish to say: Forget all your past differences
of opinion. Only one thing matters now, and
it is victory. Achieve once more, and witlhout
any further delay. because delay might be
fatal, the sacred unity wlhich existed in 1914,
and which is now ahsolutely essential te the
survival net only of the French nation, but
also of all the nations associated with us.
Victory can be secured only through perfect
unity of heart and purpose among the citizens
of each State, and also among the Allied
Nations theinselves.
It is, honourable senators, a great satisfaction
to sec such unanimity among ourselves on the
question of the punishment of war criminals.
It proves that this ideal of justice inspires all
those who are now carrying on their supreme

fight to give again te humanity the blessings
of truc Liberty, true Equality and true Fraternity.
Thanks to our colleague from Inkerman and
others who have just spoken, the voice
of this free land of ours shall be heard te the
remotest ends of the world in this protest
against barbarism, in this eloquent plea for
the restoration of law and order by punishing
the crimes committed against all humanity by
the German military caste.
In conclusion, I wish to make completely
mine the following stirring appeal of my honourable friend from Inkerman:
We are in this war to a finish, with all our
resources of man-power and wealth, and we are
joined with the other Allied nations in a solemn
pledge to set these captive populations free in
God's good time.
So may it be, honourable senators, with the
help of our heavenly Father.
Hon. C. E. TANNER: Honourable senators, I just want to add a few sentences to
the di-cussion. I am thoroughly in sympathy
with the mo-tion. I congratulate the honourable
inember from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen)
on introducing it. I believe tlat he, as well
as those who ha ve spoken in support of the
motion, is thoroughly serious, and J expect
that evcry honourable senator will give it his
whole-h-earted. support. I should net like to
think for a moment that any honourable
member is considering otherwise than seriously
the matters which ha-ve been mentioned during
the discussion.
This is not a mere paper
resolution, to be placed in the books of the
Senate and then forgotten. It should, in fact,
be a guiding star to the leaders of this counfry, and J think that in this instance the
Senate mnay well be proud of giving leadership.
My only regret is that the matter has net
gone further. I should like to hear this House
declaring itself net only in favour of the
policy of this resolution, but also in favour
of the other policies enunciated by the great
men who lead our Allies: the policy of unconditional surrender by our enemies, for
nothing else is good enough; the policy that
those enemies shall be stripped to the bone
of everything that goes to make up material
for carrying on war; the policy that the
United Nations will see te it, by force if
necessary, that the totalitarian powers are
never allowed to re-equip themselves with
materials of war to deluge the nations of the
world with blood again. In these matters our
enemies must be dealt with just as ruthlessly
as they are dealing with other countries they
have overrun. I hope that, the clarion voice
of this House having been heard, the leaders

MAY 13, 1943

of our country will now join their voices with
those of Roosevelt and Churchill and others
in declaring these great policies, and that their
pronouncements will not be considered mere
statements to be forgotten, but that when the
time cornes this country will stand side by
side with its Allies and do its part in seeing
to the punishment of those barbarian nations
by stripping them of the implements of war
down to the smallest pop gun, so that never
again shall they be allowed to equip themselves for such a war as they have waged
since 1939. As I read this resolution and
understand it, and as I understand the other
pronouncements, I take them to mean, not
only that in this Senate are we diclaring for
the language of the resolution, but also that we
resolve and insist that Canada shall play ber
part in the winding up of the war and in the
suppression of those barbarian nations.
In concluding these few remarks, may I
express the hope that my honourable friend
from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) has
lighted a signal that will be seen by the leaders
of the country, and that they will come out
just as openly as he has done and make these
declarations which I have mentioned.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Copp, the debate
was adjourned,.
DIVORCE

PILLS

REPORTS CONCURRED IN

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON, Chairman of the
Committee on Divorce, moved concurrence
in the sixty-sixth to seventy-fifth reports, both
inclusive, of the Committee on Divorce.

Hon. J. MURDOCK: While regretting the
necessity of taking exception to the motion of
my seat-mate, I take the position that it is
entirely out of order. We have here ten
reports, ten petitions, and rule 141 says:
The petition when presented to the Senate
shall be accompanied by the evidenceAnd rule 143 provides
The report-and there are ten here-shall be accompanied by the testimony of the
witnesses examined, and by all documents,
papers and instruments referred to the conmittee by the Senate or received in evidence by
the committee.
I take the position that under the rules we
are not permitted to pass the reports until
the printed evidence on these ten cases is
before us.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Honourable members, I should like to have every consideration
for my seat-mate, but I think his interpretation of the rules is incorrect. He tells us that

rule 141 says the petition must be accompanied
by the evidence. I cannot find that.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The first two lines.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: That is the evidence
of publication. Under rule 136 notice is required. That has been complied with. Rule
143 says:
The report shall be accompanied by the
testimony of the witnesses examined, and by
all documents, papers and instruments referred
to the committee by the Senate or received in
evidence by the committee.
I understand that has been complied with
also; that when the report was submitted it
was accompanied by the testimony of the witnesses, and everything else required by the
rules. But the printing of the evidence is
another matter. After the report has been
received and concurred in, the evidence is in
due time printed; but until the report is
adopted there is no object in printing the
evidence. When printed, the evidence will be
placed in the hands of every member before
the Bill is proceeded with.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I subrnit that never
heretofore has this interpretation been placed
upon the rules; but if we are going to change
the interpretatiorr and dictate to those in another place. who have argued that we are
just a farce, why, let us go ahead and do as
has been suggested. Never mind the'evidence !
Let us go ahead without knowing what we
are dealing with! We are only senators, without any obligations, rights or privileges, and
concerned only with doing what someone sugI object ta
gests and getting out of here!
that.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: On the point of
order, honourable senators, I am sorry to say
that I am not familiar with the practice of:
this Chamber, but I should think that the
wording of the rule would be a sufficient guide
to enable me to make a ruling. Rule 141 is
as follows:
,
The petition when presented to the Senate
shall be accompanied by the evidence of the
publication of the notice as required by rule
136, and by declaration in evidence of the service of a copy of the notice and of a copy of
the petition as provided by rule 137.
Rule 136 requires every applicant for a Bill
of Divorce to give notice of his or her
intended application, and to specify from whom
and for what cause such divorce is sought.
I understand from the chairman of the committee that the report is accompanied by the
evidence of publication of notice.
Secondly, the first paragraph of rule 143, to

which reference
follows:

has been made, reads as

SENATE
After such hearing and inquiry the committee
shall report to the Senate, stating whether the
requirements of these rules have been complied
with in all material respects; and, if it shall
have been then found that any such requirement
has not been so complied with, stating in what
respect there has been default. . . .
I understand with respect to these reports
that every rule has been complied with.
Furthermore, paragraph 2 of rule 143, to
which the honourable senator (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) has just referred in support of his
point of order, reads as follows:
The report shall be accompanied by the
testimony of the witnesses examined, and by
all documents, papers and instruments referred
to the committee by the Senate or received in
evidence by the committee.
I sec there nothing that requires the printing of the evidence before the report of the
committee can be considered. If the honourable senator desires to speak to that aspect
of the question, he may do se. It may be
that I have not grasped the point he is making.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
This is entirely
new. I have been here for only thirteen
years, but never before have I heard of any
such position being taken with regard to one
of these bills. I as only one member of
the Senate, and shall have to comply with
tlie decision.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I bave not made
a decision. I am inviting the honourable
.senator to state whether ny reading of the
rules is correct.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: "The report shall
be accompanied by the testimony of the
witnesses examined.'
1, as a member of the
Senate, want to iview and read that testimony.
I want to see that printed record. Always,
up te this thirteenth day of May, 1943, on
every divorce case regarding whici
contention ias been made, I have been privileged
to sec the evidence. But there is a particular reason why I should like to sec the
evidence in these cases.
e have before
us ten petitions or ten reports of the Divorce
Committee. For the past two or three weeks
we have been canvassing the people of
Canada to donate their funds to the Government, but in these ten instances this conmittee bas donated $770 to the lawyers and
the gum-shoe mon who handle these cases.
I should like to read the evidence and know
why in each particular case. Always heretofore I have understood that I was entitled
to do so, and had the right to get out of
my box in the Senate post office a copy of
the printed record and digest it before I
came here.
The Hon. the SPEAKER.

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I do not like to
press this matter upon the Senate, but in
view of the fact that the Senate may adjourn
for quite a long time, and that the printed
rules are so clear, I do not sec how we can
go against thens and postpone this matter
over and over again when there is no
necessity for postponement. It is quite clear
that there is no requirement that the evidence
shall be printed before the submission of the
report. The ionourable gentleman is quite
at liberty to see the evidence, which has been
on file with the Clerk since the report was
submitted.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: What nonsense!
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON:
It is net nonsense; it is an absolute fact. I am sure the
honourable gentleman can get it any time he
wants to read it.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
May I say one
word more? My distinguished seat-mate ias
never taken this position before, and I think
I am safe in saying it bas never before been
taken. The rule says the report shall be
accompanied by the evidence of the witnesses.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: And so it is.
Hon. Mr. LECER: May I ask the mover
of the motion if the evidence as taken in
the committee will be available to the Sonate
before the bills couse up for second reading?
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON:
Oh, yes. That
would he perfectly in order. I would agree
with that.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: According to
the rule, the point of order raised by the
honourable senator frorm Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) cannot be sustained.
There is
nothing in the rule requiring that the printed
evidence be available at this stage of the
proceedings. Of course, the point raised boils
down to a question of expediency, of whether
these reports of the committee should be
considered now or not until such time as the
evidence bas ben printed and distributed, as I
understand will be donc in due course.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Yes.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The question
before the Senate at present is only consideration of and concurrence in the committee's
reports. After these reports have been concurred in, bills will be introduced and, as usual,
the evidence will be printed and distributed.
As I say, the point boils down to whether the
Senate desires to proceed to concurrence in
the committee's reports now, or to defer action
on the reports until the evidence is printed.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Your Honour, may
I say one word? We are asked to adopt ten
reports. Paragraph 2 of rule 143 says:

239

MAY 13, 1943
The report shall be accompanied by the
testimony of the witnesses examined. . . .
Are these reports accompanied by the testimony?
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Yes.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Where?
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The ten reports
have been tabled. Each report is accompanied
by the testimony of the witnesses examined,
and by all documents, papers and instruments
which were referred to the committee. Each
report is in book form, and the testimony and
all the other documents are bound in with it.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Then, Your Honour,
have I a right to ask that before these reports
are adopted I be permitted to examine the
testimony of the witnesses?
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Yes.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: All right. That is
what I ask.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The motion before the House is consideration of and concurrence in the reports of the committee. It
is open to the honourable senator to move
contrary to the motion.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I would not do
that, Your Honour.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Otherwise, I have
to ask honourable senators if it is their
pleasure to adopt the motion.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Carried.
The motion was agreed to.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Apparently there is
no possibility of our receiving in the near
future the Bill that is now under consideration
in another place?
Hon. Mr. KING: I 'have made inquiries
and am hopeful we shall get the Bill next
week. I had a consultation with the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne),
and it was felt that even if the Bill did come
over to-morrow there would hardly be time
for its consideration this week, and that in the
circumstances it would be better for us to
adjourn until Tuesday.
The motion was agreed to.

Hon. Mr. HAIG inquired of the Government:
1. Since'the outbreak of war, on September 9,
1939, the Government floated certain loans with
the public, from time to time. What was the
amount of each loan asked for?
2. The amount subscribed by individuals, and
the amounts subscribed by corporations and
others.
3. The same information for each loan, including the last.
4. The amount subscribed in war savings
certificates and sold by the Government since
the outbreak of the war up to, say, March first.
If that date is too late, then not later than the
first of January, 1943.
5. How much of the loans have been resold
to, or cashed with, the Government since they
were issued by individuals and by corporations
and others?
6. How much of the war savings certificates
have been cashed since the war began?
Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, this

NAZI CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY
MOTION ADOPTED

The Senate resumed from May 13 the adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Hugessen:
That this House views with indignation and
horror the barbarous treatment inflicted by
Nazi Germany on the peoples of occupied

Europe, expresses its sympathy with the unfor.

tunate vietims, and urges that stern punishment

be

inflicted

on

those

who

are shown

to

be

responsible for these crimes against humanity.
Hon. CAIRINE WILSON:
Honourable
senators, first I should like to express my
appreciation to the hénourable senator from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen), who moved
this resolution. Not only. did he make an
eloquent contribution himself, but he enabled
us to enjoy the benefit of some other very
fine speeches on the subject. Few of us who
claim to have any human feeling could listen
to these speeches unmoved, particularly the
tale of atrocities cited by the honourable
senator from Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte).

241

But I should like to ask if we cannot do
something more than express our sympathy.
It will bring little comfort to the victims of
these persecutions to know that the perpetrators of these crimes may be brought to
judgment, though their relatives may derive
a little satisfaction from knowing that the
guil-ty ones will not go altogether unpunished.
I think I have had more to do with the
Immigration Department than any other
honourable- senator in this Chamber, because
four and a half years ago I assumed the
chairmanship of the National Committee on
Refugees. At that time most of the people in
Canada were rejoicing over the settlement of
Munich; and I, quite innocently believing that
we had secured at least temporary safety by
this measure, thought we would be willing to
aid those who had suffered and had saved us
from a fate similar to theirs. However, there
seemed to be no eagerness on the part of
Canada to admit these refugees from the
Sudeten countries. After some negotiations the
Government here agreed to admit five thousand
settlers, who were to be financed by funds from
Great Britain; but the delays were so great
that very many of the original number were
trapped in Czechoslovakia even before Hitler
took possession of that country on March 15,
1939, and as a result only 1,200 of the original
five thousand ieached Canada.
We alIl know that settlers from Czechoslovakia have been highly esteemed here. I
was interested in some figures published in the
London Czechoslovak newspaper on the 26th
of March, 1943. In the period between 1920-21
and 1925-26 there came to Canada as immigrants 5,402 of these people; between the years
1925-26 and 1929-30 there were 20,736; between
1930 and 1935 there were 4,024, and between
1935 and 1942, 4,837. The point I wish to
make is this: included in these figures are the
1,200 who came to northern Alberta and northern Saskatchewan, to Wahlberg and Tupper
Lake.
I do not know whether all honourable
senators are aware of the extreme restrictions
on immigration into Canada at the present
time. There are perhaps only these three
classes admissible: genuine agriculturists, who,
I think it is stipulated, must have at least
five years' standing-a requirement which
would exclude young graduates of agricultural
coHeges; relatives of the firet degree; and
persons with capital. Occasionally exceptions
have been made for specially qualified persons, such as those with certain scientifie
training and othere whe might be useful in
our war industries; but, broadly speaking,
the three classes I have mentioned are the
only ones eligible.

242

SENATE

In the summer of 1939, just before the outbreak of war, we were finally given permission
to bring 100 refugee children from Europe
to Canada. They were to be between the
ages of five and thirteen years, and orphans,
or orphans in the legal sense of the term,
that is, children to whom their parents had
abandoned all claim. The outbreak of war
caused a change in the regulations, which
meant that these young immigrants were to
be brought, not from Europe, but from among
the refugee children then in Britain. There
were between nine and ten thousand refugee
children in Britain at that time, but despite
the employment of a social worker and careful
examination of all these children, only about
thirteen cou.ld be found to comply with the
Government regulations.
We spent many
days of that vinter of 1939-40 considering
arrangements with the federal and provincial
governments, the Department of Immigration, and social agencies. The result of our
efforts was that two children were sent to
British Columbia. and this was done because
an English woman who was living there had
asked for th'em some months, if not years,
prev.iously.
However, our efforts were not altogether
wasted. The investigations we had made into
the homes that were offered, in very generous
measure by citizens of Canada bore some
results, for at the beginning of the movement
of English evacuated children to Canada, all
the information we had obtained, was made
available, and it helped very materially. But
the failure of our efforts was a great disappointment to every one of us who had been
so anxious to furnish safe and permanent
homes in Canada for . European children
driven from their own homes.
Another subject with which we have been
very much occupied for the past three years
is that of friendily aliens who went to Great
Britain and who, in May and June of 1940,
when invasion seemed imminent, were, perhaps with a certain degree of panie, rnterned
and shipped to Canada with prisoners of war.
There was nothing against those people.
They had been allowed their freedom in
Englnnd, but they lived in certain areas that
were considered danger spots, and the sending
of them to Canada was only a precautionary
move.
His Majesty's Commissioner
of
Prisons cited the case of a doctor who on
a Monday had been officially thanked by the
Admiralty for some special service performed,
I believe, under fire, and on the next Wednesday found himself among prisoners of war
en route to Canada.
It was not until some months later, when a
special senior official was sent over here, that
Hon. Mrs. WILSON.

we found out about those people. At that
time there were in Canadian camps Nazis and
anti-Nazis side by side. One story, which- I
know to be true, relates to one camp where
young men were told they could nôt be
supplied with any water unless they heiled
Hitler. They did without water. Some of
these young men, who were among the original
refugees we wished to bring to Canada, were
later released from the camps, because funds
were available for sending them to universities
and they were able to comply with the regulations governing student permits.
We know of the good work that is being
donc in our country by some of the refugees.
The Bata Company, for example, and others
who established themselves here with the
greatest of difficulty and against very stiff
opposition, have furnished and are continuing
to furn:ish materials of war and other necessities in no small measure. One refugee from
Austria has set up in British Columbia a
plywood factory that is the second largest in
the world.
As honourable senators will recall, in the
depression years there was widespread fear
that every new-comer to the country would
take a job from somebody already here. That
was not the case in England, and we know
now that it bas not been the case in this
country. Prior to the war Englandi suffered
severely from unemployment, yet refugee
industries that were set up there brought
relief to many distressed areas. And the
mayor of one of our smaller niunicipalities
said that, thanks to the glove industry established by a refugee from Czechoslovakia, there
was no unemployment in the town.
Last autumn it was arranged to bring from
France a thousand refugee children whose
parents had been deported, we know net
where; but with the total occupation of that
country it became impossible to carry out the
arrangement.
However, there were many
refugee children in Spain and Portugal who
could have been brought here had we been
willing to give them sanctuary.
In this connection I sbould like to read a
cable from Lisbon, Portugal, which I received
last January.
It is from Mrs. Elizabeth
Dexter, who has worked there with the
Unitarian Mission, and is as follows:
Understand Canadian Government authorized
visas for refugee children under 18. No information available here. Could details be sent
appropriate British Canadian authorities? Many
fine children Spain Portugal over 16, therefore
ineligible United States, in dire need; some in
prison. Philip Conard just returning American

at a disadvantage in comparison with the
United States in our attitude towards this
refugee problem, and I for one, even at this
late date, should like to sec some steps taken
towards a practical expression of our sympathy with the unfortunate victims of the
Nazi tyranny.
The second point would be to state our views
in relation to future international policy
directed to preventing the recurrence of such a
world catastrophe as has occurred during the
past four years. In other words, why not
express our position in unmistakable language
in favour of a system of collective security,
whether in terms of the old League of Nations
set-up or in favour of a system which would
take advantage of the experience of the League
of Nations organization? Let this country
at any rate associate itself with an international
policy which we hope will become the spearhead of the Allied Nations to secure mankind
froin a repetition of the terrible consequences
that followed the complete failure of the
nations of the world to profit from the lessons
of the last war.
I associate myself with the sentiments of
the honourable senator from Rockcliffe in ber
plea for favourable consideration of the
refugee problem. I think she herself might
have gone further in her remarks, for she has
been as actively engaged in the movement for
collective security as she bas been in trying
to solve the refugee problem. She might have
urged that Canada should in the future be
identified very definitely with the cause of
international peace and security through the
establishment of an organization which might
properly be described as the Association of the
United Nations.
I hope my words will not be taken as
critical of the resolution at all. I am wholeheartedly in agreement with the spirit of the
resolution, but I would suggest that it carry
with it, by implication at any rate, implementation of the two points which I have
mentioned.
Hon. J. H. KING:
Honourable senators,
I am not sure that I should speak just now.
I had not intended to do so. I am thoroughly
in sympa'thy with the resolution moved by

there bas been built up a war jurisprudence under which, in time of war, civilHon. Mr. LAMBERT.

ized peoples and nations of the world observe
certain rules, not only in regard to the soldiery
of the belligerent countries, but also in regard
to the treatment of civilians. In the present
war apparently all rules, regulations and covenants have been swept aside by those who are
trying to establish a so-called new order in this
world. Only to-day we have received word of
an atrocity in the Pacifie. A hospital ship bearing the insignia of the Red Cross and complying with all the conditions set forth in the
international convention signed by Germany,
Japan and other countries, was torpedoed, and
non-combatants, both men and women, were
sent to their graves. It is proper that we in
this Senate should indicate our abhorrence of
such things in a world which we thought had
made some progress in icivilization.
I am very sympathetic towards what bas
been said by the honourable senator fromî
Rockoliffe (Hon. Mrs. Wilson). I know she
bas laboured hard in order to do something
for the unfortunate people of Great Britain
and the occupied countries of Europe. It was
in 1940, if I remember aright, that a committee of the Senate considered the situation of
the refugee ehildren of England. England had
been bombed at that time, and it was thought
and hoped that many of the children of that
country could be brought to Canada. I am
sorry to say that, even though our peaple
were desirous of offering relief, it was not
possible to carry out the programme that
the Government of Great Britain, Canada
and the United States had contemplated. For
confirmation of this we have only to refer to
what the ex-President of the United States,
Mr. Hoover. bas been trying to do to relieve
distress in France, Belgium and other countries of Europe.
The Government of the
United States was of the opinion that the conquerors of those countries could not be trusted
sufficiently to permit the distribution of goods
there. It was undoubtedly feared that any such
undertaking would be of aid to the enemy.
Even the influential Mr. Hoover, who did so
much after the last war to relieve distress in
Europe, bas not succeeded in convincing his
Government that it would be safe to attempt
such a distribution at the present time.
It is true that the Canadian Government,
through the International Red Cross, has been
able to send cargoes of food-stuffs and medicines to the people of Greece, and in that way
some relief bas been given.
But one must look at the whole picture, and
it is not a pleasant one to contemplate. I am
satisfied that if the governments of the Allied
countries had thought the way was open and
that these refugees could be brought to our
shores in safety, they would have been quickly

received and taken care of here. It would
seem that, unfortunately, this has not been
possible.
The honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert) is asking that there be a declaration of policy. It is early yet to make declarations. There will be a tremendous problem
ahead of us after the war is over. When
peace comes, it would seem that the first thing
to be thought of is the provision of food and
other comforts for the peoples of Europe.
Then the great problem of migration from
those countries to Canada and the United
States and other parts of the world must be
considered by the governments of all the
Allied Nations, who are to-day endeavouring
to defeat the enemy, who has brought such
hardship upon the world. This being so,
I would ask my honourable friend not to infer
that thought is not being given to the future.
I have no doubt that very serious consideration
is being given to the whole problem; and I

Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators, I

the proclamation issued thereunder. This
Order in Council and the proclamation relate

WAR APPROPRIATION (UNITED
NATIONS MUTUAL AID) BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading
of Bill 76, an Act for granting to His Majesty

aid for the purpose of making available Canadian war supplies to the United Nations.
He said: Honourable senators, I think the
members of the Senate are fairly familiar with
the contents of this Bill. It is not a long
Bill. It has been very carefully drawn, and
its objeets and purposes are clearly set
out. Early in the session, on February 8,
the Minister of Finance, in outlining to the
House of Commons the proposed financial
measures in relation to the war, dealt especially with this one. Under the terrms of the
Bill, the Government is asking for powers
to borrow one billion dollars and to expend
that money in making available to the armed
forces of the Allied countries our surplus of

production over and above the requirements
of the Canadian armed forces.
Section 2 defines "war supplies" as meaning:
() any weapon, munition, aircraft or ship;
(ii) any machinery, facility, tool, material or
supply necessary for- the manufacture, production and processing, repair, servicing, or
operation of any article described in this
paragraph;
(iii) any component material or part of or
equipment for any article described in this
paragraph;
(iv) any agricultural product; and
(v) such other commodities, articles or services as may from time to time be designated
by the Governor in Council as essential to the
conduct of the war or to the relief and maintenance of any United Nation.
That definition is very broad. It includes
not only those things that are ordinarily
known as instruments of war, such as guns
and airplanes, but also ships, agricultural products and other commodities. Rare metals that
are being produced in Canada would be made
available under this Bill.
It will be remembered that last year we
passed legislation granting one billion dollars
as a gift to Great Britain. Under that measure large quantities of war supplies not
required for the Canadian forces were placed
at the disposal of and given to the Government
of Great Britain, which distributed them
throughout the world. Many of those supplies went to Russia, some to China, some to
the Malay Peninsula, and some to North
Africa. 'In short, Canadian war supplies were
pretty well distributed throughout the war
areas. It is intended to proceed under this
Bill along the lines that were followed last
year, except that this time the Government
is being given power to set up an allocation
board or committee composed of five members
of the Cabinet: the Minister of Munitions
and Supply, the Minister of Finance, the
Minister of National Defence, the 'Minister of
Agriculture and one other Minister.

246
Hon. Mr. COPP:

SENATE
The Minister of Justice.

Hon. Mr. KING: Yes, the Minister of
Justice. The board will be empowered under
this Bill to allocate war materials to places
where, in the board's opinion, they will be of
the most strategic importance. We are in the
fortunate position this year of having a representative of the Government of Canada on
the United Nations War Board. Through this
representation we obtain a thorough knowledge of what is in the minds of that war
council, which meets from time to time at
Washington. The Canadian Mutual Aid Board
will make its recommendations, which must be
approved by the Governor in Council. There
is also provision in the Bill that within a
reasonable time after the assembling of Parliament a report shall be made to Parliament of
the allocation of these materials.
The Bill was discussed at some length in
another place, and it was suggested that it
would be better to follow the practice laid
down in the legislation of last year, namely,
that these supplies should be given to Great
Britain and distributed by her. The Government did not adopt that suggestion, and the
fact that the principle of the Bill in this
regard was accepted by the other House is
conclusive proof of its soundness.
There was also a suggestion that as the Bill
provides for Canada to advance large sums of
money to supply equipment for Great Britain,
the Government of Canada should receive
from the British Government certain Canadian
securities held by the people of Great Britain,
in lieu of the money expended or equipment
supplied. That proposal did not appeal to the
members of the other Chamber. In going
through the discussion there I find that Sir
Kingsley Wood, Chancellor of the Exchequer
of Great Britain, discussing in the Imperial
House of Commons the American Lend-Lease
Bill as it appertained to Great Britain and
the United States, is quoted as follows:
It rests on the principle that in the common
war all shall give all they can for the common
task.
I think that very well expresses the feeling of
the people of Canada, whose safety and
security are at stake just as much as the
safety and security of our Allies; and I notice
that Mr. Ilsley, Minister of Finance, in
criticizing those who sought to press home
the viewpoint that Canadian securities held by
British investors should be returned to Canada
in payment for the loan or lease of munitions
to Great Britain, said:
The position was a little too much like this:
England's extremity is Canada's opportunity.
Hon. Mr. KING.

I believe that neither the members of this
Chamber nor the people of Canada generally
desire to be placed in that invidious position.
The main criticism of the Bill in the other
Chamber was d'irected to the section covering that principle. The Bill was not amended
there.
I understand it was very carefully
drafted, and I hope its principle will also
be accepted by this Chamber.
In the definition of war materials, I notice,
the item of ships is mentioned. I took
occasion to read what the honourable Minister
of Munitions and Supply had to say in regard to this, and I will briefly review his
statement. When the war broke out the
Government found that little, if any, shipbuilding was being carried on in Canada,
though there were some shipyards capable of
building small craft. These yards were immediately put to work on the building of
corvettes and mine-sweepers.
This activity
was continued up to the beginning of 1941.
At that time it became evident there would
be a shortage of merchant ships for the carriage of munitions and supplies from Canada
and the United States to the war zones. To
help neet this shortage it was suggested that
we should extend our shipyards in order to
undertake a larger shipbuilding programme.
Immediate navy requiremonts having been
fairly well taken care of, lhis suggestion was
adopted and an extensive shipbuilding programme entered upon. At the end of 1941
some two or three ships had been completed.
In 1942 we were able to construct nearly a
million tons of shipping, composed of two
types: small ships of 4,500 tons and larger
ships of 10,000 tons. These shipyards have
done a remarkably good job, and it is to the
credit of ihose whose enterprise developed
these yards that we have been able to accomplish so much in so short a timne.
Under the Hyde Park Agreement an arrangement was made whereby the United
States is to purchase ships constructed in
Canada. The agreement is of two-fold advantage: it enables the United States to
secure extra tonnage, and it enables Canada
to secure American dollars, which are very
important to her in the matter of exchange
beftween this country and the United States.
The Government has retained the ownership of all ships manned in Canada. They
are within Canadian control. The difficulty
Las been to find trained officers to take them
over when built. As we all know, oiur merchant marine has not been large; nevertheless, we have been able to take from that
service a number of oficers. and our ships
have been manned. It is the hope of the
Government that after the war the ships

MAY 19, 1943

being lent to Great Britain, and those
which under this Bill will be lent to other
countries, will on their return, afford an
opportunity of employment to the men of
o.ur Navy. We have a large naval force at
sea, and although the Minister was very careful not to indicate the post-war policy, it is
hoped that when the men retire from the naval
service after the war they will enter the
merchant marine.
The Government has set up what is known
as the Clark Shipping Company, which is
charged with the responsibility of chartering
vessels. Those which go to Great Britain come
under the control of the British Admiralty,
but a number are being leased to companies
who for years have-maintained lines of steamships between Canada and various parts of
the world. The charge for operating these
ships is very small. The profits made on the
voyages are credited to the ships, and it is
the expressed hope of the Minister that the
ships will not only have provided service during
the war, but will also have virtually defrayed
their capital cost by the time they are returned
to Canada.
So far as this Bill is, concerned, I think we
could quite properly call it Canada's LendLease Bill. Its purpose is such as the American Government bas accomplished by the lendlease arrangement under which that Government bas authorized the expenditure, if necessary, of thirty-five billion dollars, of which
eight billion dollars, I believe, have been spent
up to the present time. The operations under
that arrangement have not been all "lend" nor
all "lease"; and neither will our operations be.
Such a measure is reciprocal in character.
Through the United States Lend-Lease Bill,
Great Britain bas had the use of much equipment; on the other hand, Britain bas rendered
many services to the United States, and I do
not think the ledger account is debited as it
would be in an ordinary commercial transaction. It is felt by the nations which have had
experience of debts arising out of the last war,
that there is not much use in accumulating a
large indebteiness out of this war, but rather
that the people should give all in their power
in order that the common cause may receive
the support it requires.
At half-past twelve to-day we heard another
excellent speech from the Prime Minister of
Great Britain. No doubt many honourable
senators had an opportunity of listening to it.
What he had to say was inspiring, but it was
also grave. He stated that although it would
seem that we had reached the turning point
in this war, and the success in Africa had been

247

a magnificent one, there were still great
obstacles in the way; the task of the United
Nations was still of great magnitude and its
accomplishment would require a considerable
period of time. He was careful not to make
predictions, but assured us in no uncertain
terms that if we had the persistency and courage to continue we should win this war. As
to that, I think there is no doubt. But in
order to win, not only Canada but every one
of the United Nations must give of its courage
and its goods to overcome the great evil that
bas been forced upon the world.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, when this global war broke out the
leaders of the Conservative party in both
branches of Parliament pledged their loyal
support to the efforts of the Government in
prosecuting the war. That pledge has been
faithfully kept, and will continue to be kept
until final victory is won. It is therefore a
pleasure for me, speaking as I do for those on
this side of the House, to say that we wholeheartedly support this BillSome Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: -reserving, of
course, our right to seek further information
with regard to it.
It bas sometimes been said that Great Britain
has not donc enough in this war and that
Canada has done too much. I find myself
very much at variance with that statement. I
need not tell honourable members of this
Chamber of the glorious part that Great
Britain, the overseas dominions and the
colonies have played in this war. They are
as familiar with what has been accomplished
as I am. But when the history of the war is
written many pages will be devoted to the
gallant efforts of the Mother Country, and
will be read by our children and our children's
children, who will learn how, in the -dark days
in 1940, Great Britain, standing alone, saved
not only herself and the Empire, but all the
democracies of the world. Therefore I say
that any extra effort which the Government of
Canada can make to strengthen the hands of
Great Britain and our Allies has the full
endorsement of those on this side of the
House.
In the discussion, in another place, of the
resolution upon which this Bill is based, I find
an astounding statement which I should now
like to read. It is as follows:
I have referred to the generosity of the
Mother Country toward Canada, and we must
also remember what Britain bas done for the
United States under lease-lend. After Pearl
Harbor whole products of all war factories
were shipped from Britain to the United States,
together with weapons and other war materials.

248

SENATE

Some of the details were given on May 5.
This is the statement that appeared in the
Press:
After Pearl Harbor, British arms were rushed
directly to the U.S.A. Thousands of barrage
balloons and AA guns, predictors and other
protective appliances were shipped across the
Atlantic.
The latest machine tools were stripped from
British factories and dispatched te the United
States. One entire shell-making plant-one of
the most modern in the world-was dismantled
and shipped, and a gun-making factory went
the same way.
No charge was made.
During the North African landings the
American forces were provided by Britain with
160 Spitfires, more than 500,000 anti-tank mines
and grenades. 130 reconnaissance boats, iedical
supplies for 100,000 men, and one U.S. division
was conpletely equipped with the famous British
25-pounder guns.
All this, too, was free of charge.
Among other military supplies that have been
or soon will be furnished by Britain te United
States troops as reciprocal aid are
500.000 hand grenades
15.000 bosbs, many of then one ton in weight
70.000 six-inch shells
1.000 parachutes
300.000 caimouflage nets
500,000 flashligit batteries a nients (in short
supply ile Britain)
20,000 hindred-pound reels et barhcd vire
4,000.000 pairs of socks

2.000,000 blankets.
As J said last y-car, speaking on the gift te
Britain. that was a verv fine gesture, giving an
answ er to those who thought we owed nothing
tu the Mother Countryv and believed only in
home lefence. If it had not been for Britain.
what would have lappeecd to Canada?
I quote that only te substantiate further
what I said a moment ago, namely, that the
statement that Great Britain had done too
little and Canada had done too much was
made by persons who were not fully informed.
Now, honourable senators. I turn to the Bill
itself. Heretofore Canada bas been in quite
large measure furnishing war equipment and
food supplies te Russia, to Great Britain, and,
through the United States, te China; and now
the Government of the day has decided to set
up a mutual aid fund of one billion dollars
under the direction of a board of five Ministers, of which the Hon. Mr. Howe is chairman.
Therefore from now on Canada will deal
directly with its Allies that need aid.
This sum of one billion dollars is net to be
considered as a giftt from Canada. As the
honourable leader has stated, the matter is on
a reciprocal basis. If our Allies are able to
pay for what we send them, they will do se;
and if they are net able to pay, Canada will
expect that whatever equipment remains in
their handa after the war will be returned to
this country.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

I presume that when Canada gets a request
from any of her Allies, the Ministers on the
board here will first consider whether or net
Canada has a surplus of the material required;
and, if she has, the matter will have to be
taken up with the board that Mr. Howe says
is now functioning at Washington. On May 6
the Minister stated in anoher place:
I am a member of the combined Production
and Resources Board. That is a board made
up of three men, the other two being Mr.
Oliver Lyttelton, representing the United Kingdem, and Mr. Donald Nelson, representing the
United States. We each have a deputy, and
the three deputies are in continuous session in
Washington studying the planning of the war
production of the United Nations. There is a
counterpart of the board in London, each having
a deputy in London, and' the board is sitting
there viewing the situation from London.
I take it. therefore. that after a request
reaches the board of five Ministers here and
it is found that we have the war equipment
or agricultural products or whatever it is
an Allied nation might want, the board will
have te confer with Washington. It might
well be that the board there would seretimes considier it better that other supplies
be sent than the particular ones asked for,
or that one of our Allies could fill the order
more expeditiously than we could. The question of shipping also will have te be considered. All these matters have to be attended
to through the co-operation and co-ordination
of the bodies that I have just referred te.
Perhaps-I hope I am wrong-this Bill will
not result in as speedy action as the old
system d!id. However, no doubt every effort
will be made to get necessary information
as quickly as possible and te rush supplies
to the Allied countries that require them.
I was particularly interested in what my
honourable friend the leader (Hon. Mr. King)
and also Mr. Howe lad te say about ships.
I hope honourable senators will not become
weary of hearing me talk about ships so
often. It is very gratifying to me that the
Government are now duplicating what for a
quarter of a century their members were
pleased to term a tremendous blunder on the
part of the Union Government during the
last war. Strong criticism was made not only
of the Union Government, but also of myself,
and the critics were goodi eneugh to refer to
the ships that we built in the last war as
Ballantyne ships. The Government had a
lot of them tied up in the eastern part of
the port of Montreal, as an everlasting monument to the folly of the Union Government
and their Minister of Marine. And now, in
this war, I do feel considerable pleasure because of the fact that the present Government

MAY 19, 1943
are building ships. The.y are miot building as
good ships as we buit in the last war; neither
are they building slips with as great speed.
The honourable leader and the Minister of
Munitions and Supply have stated, with-you
will pardun me for saying, so-a certain degree
of exaggeration, that in this building of ships
the present, Minister started from. scratch;
that we had no yards in Canada. I ask my
bonourable friend the leader and the Minister:
Where do they tbink Canada built sixty-tbhree
slips in the last war? We built tbem. in the
shipyarde of this country, -and did not construct a single new yard for the purpose. We
hýad shipyards at Halifax, at Point Levis, Montreal, Three Rivers, Vancouver, Victoria and
Prince Rupert. So it is a littie unfair to
say to the public now that we had virtuýally
no shipyards ýat ail. I know, of course, that
the Government have extended the yards.

against the appropriation granted under this
Mutual Aid Bill. Well, bonourable senators,
you see the position in whicl that places
members of Parliament and the public. They
do not know anytbing about the cost of these
slips, and they cannot find out anything. The
Minister should inform Parliament and the
country how much money is being used in the
construction of; these ships, and say tbat in
order to reduce tbe hîgh cost--and I am
afraid it is very high-it is proposed to adopt
certain metbods. The bonourable leader bas
said that all tbis comes under tbe Mutual
Aid Bill. It is difflcult for me, to iinderstand
how tbe building of sbips, which Canada
needs, sbould be clarged against a MutuaI
Aid Bill, but apparently such is the policy to
be followedt.
The spelîhinders of the last war-if 1 may
refer once again to that period and to the
Union 'Government-said: "We can understaad
the Minister building ships during thc war,
but rwbv should bie bave built ships after the
war?" Well, we built slips after the war
because there was sa mudli unemployment in
this country. Then those critics went on to
say, "We sbould bave promptly got rid of
the shîps." But, honourable senators, what
is happening now? The Minister does not
say it definitely, but lie indicates clearly that
after the war we are going to bave a merchant
marine, manned by Canadians and under the
Canadian flag. A similar statement was made
by me about a quarter of a century ago.
When the Minister sold our fastest slips,
whicha had a speed, of eleven and a half
knots--and two of tbemn were capable of
thirteen knots-it was said that they were
altogether too slow; that in tbis age we must
have fast slips. But now it appears that the
best speed of our after-the-war fleet will be
nine knots.

A complaint I have always had against the
Minister of Munitions and Supply is that, for
some reason I could neyer understand, be, bas

building of ordinary cargo ships, which in

SENATE

Here again Parliament and the public are
in this position, that they will be given only
what information the Government think they
ought to get. I know that no suggestion of
mine will change the opinion of my honourable
friend opposite, or cause the Government to
reod'ify this provision. But I strongly believe
all Governments should be as frank as they
possibly can be, in times of peace and of war,
and I do hope that the Ministers comnprising
the board set up under this Mutual Aid Bill
will net wait until Parliament meets before
releasing information, but will give to the
Press from time to time statements of what
they are doing, and in this way follow the
example set by the authorities in the United
States and Great Britain; then give Parliament a full and complote report. Parliament
does not expect the Government to give away
any secrets that may benefit the eneny, but
I do hope that when this Mutual Aid Board
is organized it will net hold back information
in the report which it is required to submit
to Parliant.
Let me reiterate once more, honeurable
senators, that there is nothing too much nor
too good that we can do for grand old
England and our gallant Allies. The other
day, quite properly, we passed a resolution
of congratulation on the great Allied victory
in North Africa. As the honourable leader
opposite has told us. and as we know, Mr.
Churchill expects that there will be a long
war before the enemey is reduced to unconditional surrendor, and that we shall have
to rake great sacrifices before that goal is
eacched. Great Britain and Canada and our
Allies will make tbose sacrifices cheerfully
and to the fullest extent. Finally, let me
assure the Government and the country that
in the war effort they can always count on
the ut-most support of the Conservative
party.
Hon. P. R. Du TREMBLAY: Honourable
senators, this legislation is essentially a defonce contribution of one billion dollars to
the United Nations. Being at war, we should
rmake every possible contribution towards
victory, and there is no doubt that to ensure
success it is necessary that the prodiucts of
Canada's war industries should be made
available, net only to our own forces, but
also to those of the United Nations in such
a mranner that they may he used to the best
advantage in the common cause. This is a
total war and each member-nation of the
Allied association is called upon to make its
utmost effort to defeat the enemy.
This Bill authorizes the Government to
supply to the signatories of the Declaration

be charged witlh the administration of this
legislation, te

Supply to be the chairman of the board.
This board may, in accordance with the
strategic needs of the war, contribute, deliver,

war supplies will be available for use in the

For this purpose a sum net exceeding one

are to be supplied upon the request of the
Allied Nations. This money will not go out

are aware, first instituted the syster of leaselond, and it met with great success. Under
it all sorts of war supplies have been sent

Harbor, sent war materials to the United
States.
In this country we are in the relatively
happy situation of being able to produce or
manufacture war supplies free froin flic constant thrcat of hombing raids or other enemy
interference, and to date we have attained
great success in this direction. It is not only
our duty but it is also in our interest that to
the utmost of our ability we should supply war
materials to thosexwho are fighting for us at
the front, and we are happy to be in a
position to do se.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Du TREMBLAY: This grant has
been criticized, but in my view we must not
hesitate to help those who are fighting our
battles. In giving the necessary weapons to
our Allies we are really helping ourselves, and
we should feel deeply grateful to those who
are using those weapons to bring victory to
our common cause.

He said: Honourable senators, I have net

$40,307,998.90. Except for an item of $40,000

SECOND READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading
of Bill 96, an Act for granting to His Majesty
aid for national defence and security.
He said: Honourable senators, I have only
a word to say about this Bill. This is the
second interim supply bill relating to war
expenditures. It is for one-sixth of the total
amount required, and is similar to the bill
passed some two months ago.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I have very little to say in regard
to this Bill, but I wish to place before this
Chamber certain viewpoints that I mentioned
some weeks ago. I would refer particularly to
what is called the army for the defence of
Canada. We have never been told how many
men there are in Canada who are signed up
for overseas service, or the number who have
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

signified their desire to serve only in Canada.
I am sorry we have not been able to get that
information, because the iack of it leaves me
in the position of having to use estimated
figures, and they may be incorrect. I believe
that we have in Canada about fifty thousand
or seventy-five thousand men who have signed
up for the defence of Canada only.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Sixty thousand.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: My honourable
friend to my right says sixty thousand. The
Minister of Defence is quite right in maintaining a sufficient armed force for the defence of our Atlantic and Pacifie coasts, but
I am, sure all honourable senators- will agree
with me when I say-and this is net my viewpoint alone, but that of thousands of people
throughout this country-that Canada is in
no danger of an armed invasion unless we
lose the war overseas. The cost of providing
camps, staffs, equipment, food and clothing
for sixty thousand men in the, interior of
Canada is tremendous. When I refer to "the
interior of Canada," I mean Quebec, Ontario,
Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. It is
unfair to put such a load upon the shoulders
of the taxpayers at this time.
I want to repeat what I said on a previous
occasion, and to ad-d to it. After one year
of training these men should net be discharged
from the army in Canada, but should be placed
upon farms. At the present time a great
crisis exists in this country by reason of a
shortage of farm labour. It is almost impossible for the farmers to get help, and when
they do get it the wages asked are such that
they are usually beyond the capacity of the
farmers to pay. Furthermore, to make this
critical condition worse, this year the season
is from three to four weeks late, and the incessant rains which we have had have not
yet dried out sufficiently to enable the
farmers to put in their crops. It may beI hope not-that we shall net have a very
good crop this year. In any event it is urgent
that these sixty thousand men who have
signed for service in Canada, but net for
overseas, should be released from the forces
for the time being, subject to call, and placed
on farms.
Hon. Mr. COPP:
What guarantee have
we that they wil.1 go on the farm?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
If they do net,
then I would say, put them into industry.
Only the other day the Prime Minister announeed that there was an emergency in the
coal industry. I agree with him in that; but
I maintain that a still greater emergency exists
in agriculture. Of course, not all the men that

MAY 19, 1943
I refer to will understand farrxwing, but a large
number will, and the rest could.be placed in
industry. The other day the Minýister of
Labour issued another order caliing, upon al
men born since 1902 to register by June 15.
This shows that there is a shortageocf manpower, and I for one cannot understand why
the Ministor of Defence, at such great cost to
the country, should hold sixty thousand men
who are not needed. I hope that unless they
choose to enlist for overseas service they will
be put into more profitable employment.
Hon. Mr. KING: What we are passîng
to-day is only an interimi supýply bill. I had

254

SENATE
SENATE

254

Hon. A. MARCOTTE:
Honourable senators, I shall take just a few minutes of your
time to make some remarks before the motion
is adopted. In supporting the gift of one billion
dollars last year, I mentioned that in the
opinion of some people it would have been
better to supply the maney and, leave the
settlement of accounts until after the war,
according to the circumstances then prevailing.
The present Bill follows that suggestion, except that its scope is broadened to cover aIl
the United Nations instead of being confined
to Great Britain alUne.
The main complaint against the Bill is the
lack of information on the spending of the
billion-dollar gift of last session. In reply
to inquiries and criticism, somewhat lengthy
explanations were given in the other House,
but these were vague and lcking in the
detail necessary ta satisfy the natural desire
of the people's representatives to know how
that vast suin of money Lad been expended.
To judge from the wording of this Bill, it is
almost safe to say that no adequate information on the way it is administered can be expected. But this is a matter for the Government to decide, and the public will hold it
responsible for -whateverdecision it may reach.
In my view our action on this Bill should
be based on three main propositions: First, is
this appropriation necessary and advisable?
Second, if it is, are we able te supply this
huge sum of money? Third, if we are able,
are we willing to do so?
As to the necessity, the Government, which
has the responsibility of directing our war
effort, and knows aIl the circumstances and
conditions, says, "Yes. the appropriation is
necessary." Se we have to accept that answer.
The billion-dollar gift of last year was taken
up in nine months. This year more money
will be needed because of the extension of
war operations. The expected invasion of the
European continent will require more men,
machines and munitions and larger food supplies. Liberated countries \will need help of
ail kinds, and it is fitting that Canada, having plenty, should contribute with her Allies
to supply these needs. Canada has not known
the sufferings, the destruction of property, the
domestie disasters, wbich have been the lot of
the unfortunate people in invaded countries.
Is the appropriation advisable? If you read
the preamble of the Bill you will find the
answer in the following words:
.

.

.

and

wvhereas it

is expedient that the

conditions upon which Canadian war supplies
are made available to other United Nations
should not be such as to burden post-war
commerce or lead to the imposition of trade
restrictions or otherwise prejudice a just and
enduring peace.
Hon. Mr. KING.

The foundation of these mutual aid bills is
the desire of the United Nations to avoid the
mistakes of the last post-war period and to
assure the restoration of peaceful trading between nations. This measure will be a safeguard against the ambition and greed of some
nations willing to risk war te satisfy their
passion for world domination.
Are we able to supply the money? ''he
answer may be found in the reply which was
given to the inquiry of the honourable gentleman from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig), and
which appears in our Debates of last Tuesday.
Add to the amounts there stated the subscriptiens ta our recent victory loan and you find
that our people have lent the Government
more than four and a half billion dollars.
Besides this huge total of war loans, we must
bear in mind the terrifie amounts levied in
taxes of ail kinds since the beginning of the
war. I am sure that when confronted with
these impressive figures honourable members
will agree with me that Canada well deservethe compliment paid her yesterday by the
indomitable
Prime Minister of England,
Winston Churchill, when Le said that the contribution of Canada was massive and invaluable.
Truly, Canada is just beginning to
realize her possibilities.
Lastly, are we willing to make this contributien of mutual aid to the United Nations to
carry on and fight this war until victory is
won? Are we willing to free the world from
tcrrorism, to liberate shackled nations, to
bring back oppressed people to normal life
and civilization, to save Christianity? We know
that the answer of our people is almost
unanimous, and that it is "Yes." Yes, we are
willihtg to make sacrifices, to contribute Our
share alongside our Allies to ensure the peace
of the world, to make Canada a matured and
vigorous nation, a country where our people
will know the blessings of peace and liberty.
Sir Wilfrid Laurier was not a visionary when
he said that this century wold be the century
of Canada. We have done marvels in wartime. Let us win the war, and do better in
peace-time!
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

INTERNEES IN FRANCE

MOTION AND DISCUSSION-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

Hon. JULES-EDOUARD PREVOST moved:
That this House deems it proper to call the
attention of the Government to the situation of
Canadians incarcerated in France by German
authorities, on the mere ground of their being
British subjects, whereas Germans who abide.

MAY 20, 1943
by the Iaws of Canada peacefully enjoy their
freedorn in this country; and that this flouse
believes and trusts that Canadian authorities
will be able, by taking appropriate steps, to
secure the liberation of our unfortunate
compatriots.
Hie said (Translation): Honourable senators,
may I briefly urge the adoption of the motion
which I have had the honour of introducing
in this flouse.
We ail know that, since 1940, hundreds if
not thousands of Canadian civilians, pastors,
priests and members of religious orders have
been arrested and interned in France. Under
the Nazi yoke, that unfortunate country is no
lo nger, and wiIl not be until the day of its
deliverance, the land of liberty, equality and
fraternity.
Those Canadians were not caught carrying
weapons, for they are not soldiers,
rioters,
insurgents, nor agitators; for had they been
involved in sabotage or spying activities.
Peace-loving people, they had gone to France,
according to a century-old -custom, in search of
intellectual enlightenment. Their purpose was
to admire the artistic and historical treasures
of Europe, particularly those of France, to
acquire scientifie and literaýry knowledge, or to
devote themselves to some religious and
Christian work, every one of them penetrated
with the inspiring tbought: "Peace on earth
to men of good will." The Germans have deprived these Canadians of their liberty for
the sole reason that they are British subjeets.
In the meantime Germans living in Canada
who abide by our law enjoy their freedom
unmolested.
We know several who, whether naturalized
or -not, live amongst us in full liberty, go
about their own business and are even trusted
with responsible positions.
We do not ask that these German subjects
be imprisoned or interned in concentration
camps, but we deeply regret that our fellowcountrymen who happen to be in France
sbould be troated as guilty evil-doers by the
German authoritine soiely because of their
British nationality.
For the past three years those Canadians
have been detained in French barracks,
prisons or concentration camps. Stripped of
ail their liberties, they have had to suspend
their studies, their religious life, their professiona! career, and have endured ail sorts
of hardships. They cannot communicate with
their families, who are in anguish, not knowing
what has become of them.
The anxious
parents of those Canadians, whose sad lot we
should keep in mind, wonder whether the
prisoners are stili alive.
We earnestly beg Canadian authurities to
take ail appropriate steps, or pursue any

measures aiready hegun, to secure the liheration of our countrymea who have been treated
so barshiy.
Such steps could ho taken j ointly with the
United States, whose subi ects are deait with
like our own in occupied France.
I know that in 1940 some Canadian women
in France were also imprisoned by the
Germans. A few months later they were
released.
Without indulging in vain illusions, may we
not hope that Canadian men will also ho
restored to liberty?
Let us leavo nothing undone to kindle the
spark of justice that will secure for our fellowcountrymen detained in France the same treatment as is given to, German subjects in
Canada.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Gouin, the dehate
was adjnurned.

ADDRESS OF PRESIDENT BENES TO
MEMBERS OF SENATE AND HOUSE
OF COMMONS
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators,
before proceeding with the Orders of the Day,
I should like to refer to the visit paid to
Ottawa last week by a distinguished international statesman, His Excellency Dr. Eduard
The Hon. the SPEAKER

Benes, President of the Czechoslovak Republic, who addressed members of the House of
Commons and such senators as were fortunately in the Capital at the time. Since he is
recognized as one of the great statesmen of
the world and is the official head of one of our
Allied nations, I think we might well follow
the practice of the flouse of Commons and
have his speech recorded in our Official
Report of the Debates. I therefore move:
That the speech of His Excellency Eduard
Benes, President of the Czechoslovak Republic,
delivered on June 3, 1943, before the members
of the Senate and the House of Commons,
together with the speeches of the Right Hon.
the Prime Minister and the Hon. the Speaker
of the Senate and the Hon. the Speaker of the
House of Commons, be included in the Senate
Debates and form part of the permanent records
of this House.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: You include the remarks of His Honour, our Speaker, do you
not?
Hon. Mr. KING: Oh, yes.
The motion was agreed te.
REPORT OF THE PROCEEDINGS

Members of the Senate and of the House
of Commons assembled in the Gommons Railway Committee Room on Thursday, June 3,
1943, at 12 o'clock, noon.
Right Hon. W. L. MACKENZIE KING
(Prime Minister): We in Canada are indeed
greatly honoured to have in our country today His Excellency Doctor Eduard Benes, the
President of the Republic of Czechoslovakia.
I wish at once to extend to Doctor Benes the
warmest of welcomes on behalf of the Government, the Parliament and the people of
Canada. Doctor Benes is such a well-known
international
figure and has played so
prominent a part in world events over the past
three decades that he does not come to us in
any sense a stranger, and needs no introduction to any democratic audience in any part
of the world.
I should like to say to Doctor Benes what I
said in the House of Commos yesterdaythat he will have noticed a very close sympathy
between the people of Canada and the people
of the Czechoslovak Republic. The agreement
at Munich, which had the effect of partitioning
his country, and caused great sacrifices on
the part of his people, sacrifices made, it was
thought at the time, in the interests of the
whole of Europe, but which have since proved
to have been on behalf of the whole worldthat agreement was never recognized by
Canada and is not recognized by Canada today.

JUNE 8, 1943
We share in regard te Czechoslovakia the
view of the British Government tbat the
Municb agreement bas ceased to exist as a
factor eitber in present or post-war relations.
We look forward to tbe day, which we bope
is coming speedily, wben tbe Czechoslovak
Republic in its entirety will be restored te, its
f ull independence.
One expression, Mr. President, wbich we
bave sought to give te, our feelings of close
relationsbip witb the people and Government
of Czecboslovakia bas been to welcome to
Canada Doctor Frantisek Pavlasek, who is
seated to my leSt, as Minister of tbe Republic
of Czecboslovakia, and to appoint in London
a Minister fromn Canada to tbe country of
whicb you are presently the bead. I would
take advantage of this opportunity to say how
greatly Doctor Pavlasek as Minister oS Ozeeboslovakia bas endeared bimnself to ail those wbo
bave had tbe privilege of making bis acquaintance wbile bere. As you yourself told me, Mr.
President, wben we recently talked together in
Washington, Doctor Pavlasek was a close
friend of Masaryk, the founder of your great
republie-of wbicb you are a co-feunderand tbat be was one of tbe most cultured
gentlemen in Czecboslovakia. We bere bave
ceme te appreciate tbrough tbe personality
cf Doctor Pavlasek and in bis public utteran-ces
net onJy much oS tbe culture of Czecboslovakia, but also the bigh ideal.s cf yeur
country.
1 arn not going te take time tbis merning
to say more tban one otber word by way cf
welcome te Doctor Benes. It is tbat we welcerne him, net only as representing tbe brave
people of Czecboslovakia and tbe great services
they bave rendered te democracy, but we
welcome bim also, and in great measure at tbis
moment, on acount oS bimself. H1e bas a
career of public service tbat bas been paraIleled .by very Sew men in tbe world's history.
As ail present know, he was co-founder cf tbe
Republic of Czecboslovakia. H1e was the first
Foreign Minister of tbat country and bas
been its President for many'years. H1e bere
the beaviest responsibilities tbrougbout tbe
trying period of tbe Munich discussions and
the years wbicb followed, a time wben bis
country was passing tbroug-h a terrible erdeal.
H1e did ail witbin bis power te keep united
the forces cf freedomn in bis own and other
lands. It is ef interest te knew tbat he came
at tbat very time te America and was for a
short peried associated with the 'University cf Chicago. H1e found tbere a spbere
fromn wbicb, as President in exile fremn bis
country, be migbt be able te, direct its affairs
in ifs titanic struggle fer freedemn. He bas, as
72542-17

257

you know, been responsible for the organization of the different forces of Czecboslovakia.
I sbould like to say to him bow much the
people of Canada, in comrnon with people
who love liberty everywhere, appreciate the
great services which Czechoslovakia rendered
to the cause of freedom in the last great war,
and tbe great services she bas neyer ceased, to
render to the cause of freedom since and in
the present war.
Czechdslovakia bas bad to bear some of
the beaviest burdens any country bas ever
been called upon to endure by way of sacrifice
for a great cause. These she bore at the time
of Munich. Tbese sbe bas 'borne ever since.
Tbese sbe is bearing beroically to-day. Notwitbstanding tbat at present tbe country is
occupied by tbe enemy, ber forces, botb witbin
Czecboslovakia and in different parts of tbe
world, are figbting ini tbe cause of freedomn
witb tbe allied and united nations of tbe
world. Tbat is a great tradition for a nation,
and we know tbat tbat beroic effort is going
to win its due reward.
I need not toucb on otber aspects of Doctor
Benes' career, of bis presidency of tbe
Assembly of the League of Nations, and of
course bis leadersbip at the present time of bis
Government in exile. From tbe beginning and
ail tbrougb bis life be bas been the expenent
of higb and noble ideals and of tbose great
aims, purposem and practical measures wbicb
seek flot only tbe bigber development of the
peoples of bis own country, but also fraternity
and unity among ail nations.
Wtben I was recently at Wasbington I asked
Doctor Benes bow it was tbat be came to
venture on some of the propbecies tbat be bad
made, prophecies wbicb are giving much in tbe
way of bope to the world at this time. H1e
said to me, in reply, tbat tbe so-called propbedies *were flot in reality prophecies, tbat as a
matter of fact be bad the good fortune,
in tbe many years be bas been in public liS e,
te form intimate friendsbips witb men in many
countries, and bad been particularly fortunate
in being able for tbe most part to keep up
tbese friendsbips tbrougb the period of tbe
war, and tbat from information ha bad
gatbered at first band in tbis way be bas
ventured to give open expreasion to some of
the vîeiws which be bolds regarding tbe present
and tbe future.
I should like in this cennection to read
a statement that Doctor Benes publicly made
before the war actually took place. AIL of
us would, 1 tbink, regard it as a prophecy.
Doctor Benes bimself wouid say tbat it is
based on logic and pbilosepby and expresses
SEID EDITION

SENATE
only a sequence of facts gathered from the
confidences of the acquaintances be bas
maintained.
In November, 1938, the gentleman who this
morning is seated to my right made the
following statement in regard to what he
believed was likely to happen within a short
time after the Munich agreement had been
entered into. He said at that time that he
believed war was inevitable after Munich.
He went on:
I do not know when it wilI break out, possibly
in a year, perhaps in two or three. I personally
doubt whether it will take more than a year.
This was in November, 1938. The attack
on Poland came on September 1, 1939.
The first to suffer the blow will be Poland.
. . . France will pay horribly. . . . Hitler will

attack all-in the west, and even Russia-and in
the end America, too, will be in it.
I do not think I need say anything further
by way of introduction of the President of
the Czechoslovak Republic as one who is
entitled to speak with great authority on
international affairs.
Dr. EDUARD
BENES
(President of
Czechoslovakia): Mr. Prime Minister, Mr.
Speaker of the Senate, Mr. Speaker of the
House of Commons: Let me first thank you
very warmly and sincerely for the kind words
with which I have been introduced to this
distinguished audience.
It is the first time in the history of
Canadian-Czechoslovak relations that a President of Czechoslovakia bas the honour of
addressing the Canadian Parliament. I am
cognizant of the great historical significance
of this event, and I am profoundly grateful
that the honour is mine.
The great contribution of Canada to the
struggle of the world for the defeat of
German Nazism and for the re-establishment
of liberty, the achievements this country bas
made in the war, the organization of ber
army, navy and air force, industrial and
especially financial success in solving extremely difficult war problems, the steadiness
and the spirit of this country, evoke a deep
and sincere admiration.
The sympathy of the Canadian Government
and people for Czechoslovakia, expressed in
words and deeds during the past four years,
has been an encouragement and inspiration
in this darkest period of modern Czechoslovak history.
You know that for centuries, beginning with
the Middle Ages, this small nation in the heart
of Europe had been a glorious independent
Hon. Mr. KING.

kingdom and a prosperous state-the state
that first began the fight for religious freedom
in Europe.
In the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries, Prague, its capital, was a great
centre of learning, contributed largely to
European cultural, spiritual and material
development, and played an outstanding role
in European history and particularly in the
history of the Holy Roman Empire and the
Austro-Hungarian monarchy.
Perhaps your
Government knew, too, the famous declaration
made by the German Chancellor Bismarck
after bis victory over Austria in 1866:
Whoever is master of Bohemia is master of
Europe. Europe must, therefore, never allow
any nation except the Czechs to rule it, since
that nation does not lust for domination. The
boundaries of Bohemia are the safeguard of
European security and ho who moves them will
plunge Europe into misery.
In my estimation there can be no better
comment on the position of my country even
to-day.
The recognition of our cause here in this
country in 1918 was also undoubtedly due
to the unmistakable determination of our
people to live as a free and independent
nation. More than one hundred and fifty
thousand Czechoslovak soldiers, many of
whom came from Canada to Europe, fought
for their country's liberation in the first
world war in Russia, France and Italy. When
the war was drawing to a close, the epic
march of the Czechoslovak legionnaires across
the Siberian plains to Vladivostock fired the
imagination of the Canadian people as well
as the rest of the world. The first unit of
our legionnaires made its way across the
Pacifie from Russia to the battle-fields of
France, landed in Vancouver and was enthusiastically welcomed by the Canadian people.
Czechoslovakia's twenty years' record as a
free and independenL democratie state is one
of which we are justly proud. Surrounded
on all sides by authoritarian countries and
governments, she remained faithful to the
democratic traditions which came to ber
very largely fro'm the western hemisphere.
Her social legislation and ber educational
system were progressive and advanced; ber
financial system was stable, her currency one
of the soundest in Europe; ber general
economic standard was very high and ber
import and export trade greater than that
of Italy. Until 1938 this republic was one
of the most prosperous and happy countries
in Europe. Even the concentrated campaign
of Nazi Germany, beginning in 1936, using
corruption and lying propaganda and threatening war and violence, failed to shake the inner
harmxxony of the Czechoslovak Republic.

·

JUNE 8, 1943

In her foreign policy Czechoslovakia resolutely and consistently followed the policy
of peace, international arbitration and collective security. She fostered and encouraged
friendship
with her neighbours-Austria,
Poland, Yugoslavia, and Rumania. She was
the most loyal member of the League of
Nations. She supported the Locarno policy,
was an original signatory of the BriandKellogg pact, and was ready to play the part
demanded of her in any generally accepted
system of collective security. In Geneva she
resolutely opposed the Japanese invasion of
Manchuria and China; I was President of the
Assembly of the League of Nations when we
voted the sanctions against Italy upon ber
invasion of Abyssinia. Czechoslovakia was
ready to oppose militarily the occupation of
the Rhineland and Austria. Our army and air
force were ready and thoroughly efficient. Up
to the year 1939 we did our duty completely,
not only to our nation, but to Europe and
democracy as well.
Czechoslovakia was in mortal danger from
the moment that Hitler and the Nazi leaders
came to power. When Hitler saw that the
policy of sanctioning against Italy was not
strictly applied, and when the German remilitarization of the Rhineland was not
opposed by force, he thought that the countless seeds of bitterness and mistrust sown by
the dictators would permit him to reap a
harvest of destruction of democracy in Europe
and bring about the realization of his panGerman plan. The success of the annexation
of Austria in March led to the September
crisis in 1938.
My own view then was that Hitler's demands
and attacks against Czechoslovakia should
have been rejected even at the cost of a war.
We had ready one and a half million splendid
soldiers. But the Western powers were not
ready for war in 1938, either morally, or
materially. Through the sacrifice made by
Czechoslovakia, Europe and the world gained
a year's time in which to prepare better for
the defence against the coming onslaught. In
my opinion, the second world war began with
the criminal occupation of Prague. And from
the very day of occupation, March 15, 1939,
all Czechoslovak citizens have been at war
with Germany.
Since 1938 the Czechoslovaks at home have
endured great hardships, sorrows and suffering. They know that many of their soldiers
and airmen who escaped from their enslaved
homeland lost their lives while fighting for
its liberation in Poland and France. They
know that after the Franco-German armistice,
Czechoslovak soldiers and airmen reassembled
72542-17J

259

in Great Britain, and that in the decisive
Battle of Britain Czechoslovak airmen played
an honourable part. They know that Czechoslovak soldiers are now fighting in Russia and
in Africa and manning the defences of Great
Britain even while they see their own coun-

try being converted into an arsenal for a war
against the United Nations. Many are now
working as forced labourers in Germany and
elsewhere. Those who resist the oppressors
are either executed in masses or tortured in
prisons and concentration camps. Their country is pillaged and Germanized, their national
education completely destroyed. The undying memory of the martyred village of
Lidice forbids us ever to relax in the worldstruggle now waged against the powers of
evil and darkness.
We know what we are fighting for. Our
every effort is, first of all, spent for the
restoration of our democratic way of life, for
those moral values that are fundamental to
it, as opposed to the Nazi creed which deprives individuals and nations not only of
freedom, but of human dignity and equality.
We are fighting, too, for the return of international order, in which the sanctity of
treaties and the pledged word will prevail, in
contrast to their deliberate violation whenever
the Nazis consider it expedient. We are fight.
ing for some sort of international charter-a
charter which shall embody the rights of man
and be applicable to the people of all countries; in short, for a world that is new and
free. In my opinion, this entails the punishment of all those people who are guilty of
perpetrating numberless crimes and cruelties
of the past four years-not in the spirit of
vengeance, but with a full measure of justice.
Secondly, we are fighting for a social and
economic reorganization of the European continent, which will be in great danger of chaos
and disruption after the present war. The
consequences of this war will be far-reaching,
and social and economic difficulties far greater
than those of 1918 in Europe. The democratic United Nations will have the duty to
remain politically and militarily together even
after the present war. But the peace which
comes after this war will necessitate their new
close collaboration also in the social and economic spheres.
Thirdly, we are fighting for a more lasting
peace in the future, one which will be guaranteed effectively by an international organization. A new system of collective security
must be prepared and established, one which
will be more practical and function more
effectively than the last. The first steps have
already been made in the treaty signed by the

260

SENATE

United Nations, but more discussion and preparations on the far-reaching questions of
peace will be necessary before unity among
the United Nations will be achieved.
This is directly connec.ted with the fourth
fundamental aim of the present war, the one
which will perhaps be the most difficult and
at the saine time most decisive to realize: a
new political reorganization of Europe and
the world. All these aims are interrelated
and inseparable.
All the United Nations-the great British
commonwealth in which Canada has so vital
a part and which has played such a glorious
role in the present war; your great neighbour,
the United States, whose friendly three-thousand-mile boundary is an example of good
neighbourliness to the rest of the world;
Soviet Russia, who first broke the legend of
Nazi invincibility; China, whose strength
seems incredibly increased as we look back on
her heroic fight against the Japanese aggressors, as well as the smaller United Nations-all
share in this global struggle and all agree in
these four great peace aims, which must be
achieved in this second world war. Poland,
the
Greece,
Yugoslavia,
Czechoslovakia,
Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, Norway, Austria, as well as France--al] have to be
liberated. France bas had to come to humiliating terms with the eneny. Even to-day the
enemy bas not exacted his last full measure of
Germany bas
humiliation and vengeance.
torn up the armistice agreement, imprisoned
France's manhood, or compelled it to work at
forced labour. Yet France has never ceased to
be capable of greatness. I believe that before
very long France will rejoin ber allies as a
fully sovereign and belligerent nation. She
will take ber place at a council table of
Europe. Europe needs a strong and regenerated France-and the same is true of the
other subjugated nations-and without ber
there will be no lasting peace on the
European continent.
After the collapse of Germany the United
Nations must, in my opinion, remain, an
organized body which will create the basis for
the new post-war international order and for
the new system of international collaboration
and security, in which every member will play
its due and proportionate part.
All Czechoslovaks are greatly indebted to
Canada as well as to Great Britain and to the
British commonwealth for the magnanimity
with which she received Czechoslovak citizens
who fled from their homeland in the past
several years. They only followed their fellowcountrymen who came years before to estabDr. BENES.

lish themselves permanently in Canada and
are now faithful Canadian citizens and true
Canadian patriots. I firmly believe that they
are fully sharing Canada's effort in this war
and will always serve to promote and
strengthen our mutual understanding and
friendship.
Canadians of Czechoslovak origin are now
fighting in the Canadian and partly in the
Czechoslovak army abroad. Many flyers,
Canadian and Czechoslovak, trained here in
your great country, are bravely fighting
together to defeat our common enemy, who
brought this war upon us.
Czechoslovakia's gratitude for Canada's consistent policy toward Czechoslovakia since 1918
is boundless. Mr. Mackenzie King's repudiation of the wanton German aggression against
Czechoslovakia in the House of Commons on
March 20, 1939, Canada's refusal to recognize
the occupation of Czechoslovakia on April 7,
1941, and the granting of full recognition to
the Government of Czechoslovakia in England
on July 17, 1942, have been the rounding out
of this mutual relationship. These are ties that
bind Canada and Czechoslovakia together and
will bind them for ever; and my thanks for all
this, Mr. Prime Minister, to you, to your
Parliament, and to your great country.
Czechoslovakia's policy bas not changed
since 1918. Nor will it change after victory is
ours. I feel authorized to declare on behalf of
my nation that after the final victory in this
great war is achieved, the Czechoslovak nation
will reconstruct its old home rapidly and successfully by its untiring efforts, remaining
faithful-as it always was during the difficult
periods of its long, chequered and glorious
history-to the democratic way of life, to the
principles of spiritual and religious freedom
and to the ideals of peace and peaceful international collaboration, of which Canada, with
its brave and freedom-loving people, was
always one of the most typical and courageous
representatives in the policy of the whole
world.
Mr. MACKENZIE KING: I would ask the
Speaker of the Senate and the Speaker of the
House of Commons if they would express on
behalf of the members of Parliament our
appreciation of the memorable addmess to
which we have just listened, by the President
of the Czechoslovak Republic. May I say to
Dr. Benes that we follow in our Parliament the
practice he followed as President of the League
of Nations, and speak in either one of two
official languages. I know, had time permitted,
the President, as was the custom at the League
of Nations, would have wished to repeat in
French the address which he has just delivered

JUNE 8, 1943
in English. I would suggest that one of the
two gifted gentlemen wlio will express aur
thanks ta Doctor Benes might take notice of
the fact that we are a Parliament which
recagnizes more than anc language.
Bon. Mr. VIEN, Speaker of the Senate
(Translation) : Your Excellency, it is for
me a privilege whieh I highly prize
ta lie called upon ta convey to you the
warmcst tlianks of the membcrs of the Senate
and af the Bouse of Commans for the
honour you have conferred upon us by your
presence liere ta-day and for the memorable
addrcss which you have just dclivcred.
In discharging this vcry pleasant duty i
my' mother tangue, anc of the two official
languages of this country, I derîve added
satisfaction from the fact that you, sir, spcak
it yourself with such fluent clegance.
We have for a long time ardently desired
the privilege now so cliarmingly cxtendcd ta
us liy Your Excellency. For more than a
quarter-century we have witnesscd your
achievements and closely followed your rapid
accession ta a foremost rank in the political
world.
We warmly cheered at the bîrth of the
Czeehaslovakian Republie. We have shared
lier happiness, admired thc heroic courage of
lier people, and shed burning tears,! as we
still do, over hcer misfartunc. On their return
from Geneva, your fricnds, aur Prime Minister and aur late lamented Senator Raoul
Dandurand, often spoke ta us with admiration
of your illustriaus master, Mr. Masaryk, and
of yourself, lis worthy successor. Your worldwide reputation lias preccdcd you here. We
admire in Your Excellcncy the wisdom and
caution of the statesman, the vigilance and
valour of the patriat, the indomitable courage of tlie apostle disscminating tlirougliout
the world tlie immortal principles upon whicli
are founded truc dcmocracy, liberty, order
and pcacc.
On anc of the memorable occasions which
marked yaur brilliant ýcareer, you declared
yourself a citizen of this young Europe which
had sprung from the cmbers of the most
disastrous conflagration the world lias ever
knawn, and of a new state whici lias dcvoted
its strength and energy ta the reconstruction'
of a world perpetually in the making.
Like ourselves, you are sceking an ideal,
a symbol, a formula for a civilization capable
of guarantccing to liumanity as a whole the
complete enjoymcnt of its riglits and of
freeing it for evermore from fear and want.
Wc thank you for having given, by the
warmth of your eloquence. a new and more

vivid ardour to our faith in truth, honesty and
human fraternity. We shall keep an, everlasting memory of yaur visit, and this day
will remain deeply graven, in letters of gold,
in our annals and our hearts.
Hon. J. A. CLEN (Speaker of the Bouse
of Commans): Mr. Prime Minister, Mr.
President and ladies and gentlemen: There are
many occasions, Mr. Prime Minister and Mr.
President, during a man's if e when the hopes
and dreams of the past become the realization
of the present. 1 think that Doctor Benes
is in that position to-day. Be to-day sees in
the immediate future the realization of those
hopes. Everyoiic will remember Doctor Benes
during those days of Munich of 1938, and how
hie canducted himself with cool and calm courage, with steady judgment and with a definite
purpose in mind. Be held for himsclf during
that time a high honour-I think hie will consider it a higli honour-that lie incurrcd the
most bitter hatred of Bitler. For aIl of us
will recaîl those days of the Sudeten incident
when Doctor Benes was leading his people,
how Hitler chose him as public enemy No. 1
and reviled him ta the wliole world as a
traitor ta Czechoslovakia and, therefore, a
traitar ta Germany! I shall always recaîl
the steadiness witli which that challenge was
met, and the determination with which Doctior
Benes carried on his high office in behaîf of
his country.
The Prime Minister has told you of the
prophetie utterance by Doctor Benes in
November, 1938, which was fulfilled ta the
last word. Now Doctar Benes has given us
another prophecy, thoughlihe himself knows
and says thie is in a very dangerous field. He
predicts the end of this war; I think the
words hie used werc: "ini the wintcr of 194344." May hie sce the fulfilment also of that
prediction. Doctar Benes' addrcss ta us is an
inspiration ta Canada. It canveys ta us some
measure af the courage and steadfastncss which
wss exhibited by his people and by himself
during thos terrible days. I sliould like ta
recali a liroadcast that was made liy Doctor
Benes some time ago, which has remained in
my memory. I do ndt recaîl hîs exact wards,
but I remember that he asked himsclf onc
question: "What do I want?" The answcr he
gave was: "I want ta go home. I want ta go
ta my own country. I want a free Czcchosiovakia in a free Europe.,,
Mr. President, on behaif of those who. are
gathered here at this joint meeting of bath
Bouses of Parliament, 1 thank you for your
presence here with us to-day. As I stated,
you have again cntered into the realln cf
prophecy, and we do hope that your predie-

262

SENATE

tion on this occasion will come true within
another year. Whether or not, I want to
assure you that all Canada joins with you
and your country, that we shall prosecute and
continue our efforts until this war is successfully finished. On behalf of this joint meeting
I express to you that which has been so evident
from time to time during your address, the
great pleasure you have given us. I express
the wish of every man and woman in this
audience when I say to you that we hope
in the very near future you may return to
your own home, your own country, a free
Czechoslovakian in a free Europe.
WORK AND SERVICES OF THE SENATE
DISCUSSION

Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators,
there is on our Order Paper no business that
we may proceed with, but I have no apologies
to make for that fact. Some people who
criticize the Senate fail to understand the
set-up of .this body. They compare it with the
American Senate, but our whole set-up is
different, as the work we undertake to do,
and do very well, must come from the elective
Cbamber.
It is suggested from time to time that more
work should be given to us and more legislation should be introduced or fathered in this
Chamber. Possibly that is true with regard to
certain bills whieh do not relate to the public
life of the country. But most bills do relate
to matters affecting the general public. Such
legislation as amendments to the Patent Act
might very well be initiated in this Chamber.
Yet there is a limitation upon what may be
done in this way. Many of the measures
which come before us involve Government

policy and are introduced because the Government, or the public, see a need for their
enactment. In such cases a Minister must
convince the Governor in Council of the
importance of the legislation. Having succeeded in doing se, he likes to take care of
his own baby, and naturally introduces it
before the elected representatives of the
people. I cannot see that very much is to be
gained by talking about legislation being initiated in this House, or by deluding ourselves
into thinking it can be done. Useful work,
however, has been accomplished here. Take
the Shipping Act, for instance. It was a nonpolitical measure, whose object was the revisien of our shipping laws. It was a fine piece
of work, which occupied two sessions-work of
a kind that this body could do, and did, very
effectively. But, speaking in the main and
generally, I do net think we may expect to
have Government policy initiated in the
Hon. Mr. GLEN

Senate, unless the Government of the day
appoints more members of the Administration
te this Chamber. In that case those members
would probably be satisfied to introduce here
measures in which they were directly interested, but they would not undertake to initiate
measures sponsored by members of the Government whose seats were in the House of
Commons.
While the Senate was recently adjourned
there was another important visiter to Ottawa,
who spoke to a joint meeting of the reconstruction committees of both Chambers. I
refer to Sir William Beveridge, the author of
the social security plan in Great Britain. Honourable members who were fortunate enough
te hear him must have been convinced, I
think, not only of the sincerity of his presentation, but also of his fairness and his, I
would say, Scotch shrewdness. He indicated at
once that he had not come here te tell the
people of Canada what they should do in
regard to social security, as bis plan was
designed for application te conditions in Great
Britain. And he complimented Dr. Marsh, who
has prepared a report on social security for
Canada and who to-morrow morning will
appear before a subcommittee of the Senate
Committee on Post-War Reconstruction. That
is the Subcommittee on Social Security, presided over by the honourable senator from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen), who, I know,
will want to say a word before we adjourn
to-night. It will be his desire that members
of the main committee itself, as well as members of his subcommittee, be present, and as
many as possible of the other senators
interested in the subject.
There is no doubt that this problerm is one
which should give us great concern. It is being
studied net only in Great Britain and Canada,
but also in other portions of the world.
Honourable members can be well employed
to-morrow morning, I think, in hearing the
evidence that the chairman of the subcommittee bas arranged to bring before us.
With these few remarks, unless the honourable gentleman from Inkerman wishes te make
a statement, I would move the adjournment
of the House.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I am sure we all have been much
interested in listening to what has been said by

the honourable leader with regard to the small
amount of legislation initiated in this Chamber. I do net find myself fully in accord with
his expression of opinion that this House must
in future expect that all legislation will be
initiated in the other House.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

JUNE 8, 1943
Hon. Mr. KING: 1 do not think my honourable friend ig quite correct in attributing
that statement to me.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I want to interpret correctly what the honourable leader
said. 1 did undeTstand him te, say that, so f ar
as he cnuld judge, legislation was going to be
initiated in another placeHon. Mr. KING: It bas been.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: -owing to the
fact that Ministers wanted to sponsor their
own legislation. 1 think 1 am not unfair
when I say he intimated to this Hlouse that
that would be the policy followed by this
Government, and that the Senate of Canada
could not look forward to initiating much
legisiation. I should like to remind the honourable leader that, according to my recollection, during the five years when the Right
Hon. R. B. Bennett was Prime Minister this
Chamber neyer had occasion to adjourn for
lack of business. The Senate dealt not only
with the Shipping Bihl and Insurance Bills,
but also with' so much other legisiation that
it was virtually in continunus session. Honourable senators are aware that legisiation
can be initiated in this House just the same
as in another place. It seems to me that the
responsibility lies more particularly on the
leader who may be Prime Minister at the
time. Certainly Mr. Bennett kept this House
busy. I think that our members, with their
wide and rich experience, can deal with
legislation more carefully, not only in thîs
Chamber, but also in our special and standing
committees. I know that we cannot expect
to get much legislation while we are engaged
in global war, but I do hope that when peace
is restored, whatever Government may be in
power will not follow the view just expressed
by the honourable. leader of the Senate and
have ail iegislation introduced in the other
House. I for one should deplore such a
policy. I hope my honourable friend will use
his good offices to prevail upon this Government, if it is stili in power, to see that a fair
amount of legisiation is initiated in this House
after the war is over.
Hon. Mr. KING: I desire, not to prolong
the discussion, but to avoid being misunderstood. Probably I should have indicated that
we are labouring under extraordinary conditions brought about by the war. Apa.rt from
that fact, we know that only a few years after
Confederation complaints came from the
Senate that it did not have sufficient opportunities to initiate legislatîon. True, legishation of the character of the Patent Act couid
very welh be introduced here, but it is probable

263

that legisiation involving Government policy
wiil, of necessity, be introduced in the elective
Chamber.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: W-hy not here?
Hon. Mr. KING: I do not think any of us
wish to place the Senate in such a position'
as to provoke adverse crîticism on the part
of the public for circumstances entirely
beyond our control. As I have mentioned,
soon after Confederation the Senate complained of lack of business, and I do not
think conditions in that respect have changed
very much in the meantime. However, the
records of the Senate show that there have
been periods when this House has been busy.
Two years ago, on the motion of my honourable friend opposite, we conducted- an, investigation of our railways, and, undoubtedly spent
some mon'ths in a very useful undertaking.
But what I want to make clear to-night is
that we have no reason to apologize for the
present state of affairs, and I do not think
the Senate should be criticized for the lack of
business to-night.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable sens.tors,
I should like to get the opinion of a member
who knows constitutional law and the powers
of the Senate with regard to introducing legislation. My own idea at the moment is that,
with the exception of legisiation involving
expenditureof money, the Senate bas the same
power to introduce legisiation as the Huse of
Commons.
Hon. Mr. KING: That is true. Nobodis objecting to that.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: It seems to me the
present condition of affairs is due directly to
one main cause-that we are at warHon. Mr. HIUGESSEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: -and that the other
Chamber spends virtually ail its time in dealmng with purely war matters.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Money bis.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Very largely money
bills, but not entirely. That condition is
bound to continue until the war ends. Then
we shall have to deal witb the aftermath,
which in a sense will be related to war conditions. So the Senate is passing through a
period during which we cannot expect much
in the way of legisiation; not because we
may not need it, but simply because everybody's thoughts are centred on something else.
In the course of time the war will end, and
then the Senate, I have no dou-bt, will carry
on as it bas done in the past. On any questions
outside of war measures very little legislation

264

SENATE

engages the attention of the Commons, whose
members think they have full power to
initiate legislation. What legislation of any
consequence have we had so far from the
Commons? Very little. And we can expect
very little during the entire session.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: That does not
mean we have not the right to introduce
legislation.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
have that right.

I think, myself, we

SUBCOMMITTEE ON SOCIAL SECURITY
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:
Honourable senators, with regard to the remarks of my
honourable leader, I wish to remind the House
that the Subcommittee on Social Security will
hold its first meeting at half past ten tomorrow morning. At this meeting the witness
will be Dr. Leonard Marsh, the gentleman
who prepared the report on social security for
Canada. I wish on behalf of the subcommittee
to extend to every member of this Chamber a
most cordial invitation to be present at the
meeting.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at

of the applicants another name has been

DISCUSSION

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are called, I
desire to direct the attention of the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. King) to
the following report in last night's Journal:
"In ten days there will be enough potatoes
for everyone, with prices lower than this time
last year," H. H. Hatfield, member of Parliament for Victoria-Carleton, N.B., assured the
Journal to-day.
The reasons are that the heavy new crop
from Virginia and North Carolina will be available here next week and will tide Canadians
over until the new Canadian crop matures in
a month-a month late. The price ceiling, fixed
for old potatoes, will hold.
My object in bringing this dispatch to the
attention of the honourable leader of the
Government is that I think it is perhaps not
yet too late to ship in further supplies of
potatoes from northern Saskatchewan. When
I left there the potatoes that were being
shipped were being culled altogether too
closely. Beautiful potatoes were piled near
the elevator, along the railway track, and I
am sure that if some of the farmers in

JUNE 10, 1943
Saskatchewan who were told to pick out the
so-called small potatoes could sec the little
potatoes served here in Ottawa they would
condemn them as being too small even to
pick up from the field.
We were unable some time ago to deliver
wheat to Mexico because of the freight-car
situation. It will certainly cost something to
bring potatoes all the way froin the South.
If potatoes are in sacks, any old freight car
is suitable for their transportation from
We have from
northern Saskatchewan.
twenty to fifty carloads of potatoes available,
and they could be sent here in from four
to five days at a cost of a cent a paund.
The potatoes of northern Saskatchewan are
the best in the world. When you eat a baked
Saskatchewan potato you do not have to
eut it two ways as you do with the sort
served here; you just break the skin. I have
good reason for saying the potatoes of northern
Saskatchewan are the best in the world.
Some years ago, when a body of English
miners came to the Prairie Provinces to
assist in the harvest, a number of them were
stranded in our village and I undertook to
show them how to stook. At their first meal,
when we placed on the table large dishes of
baked potatoes, those men, to our amazement, dumped the whole lot on to their
plates. I said to them, "I see, boys, you are
fond of these potatoes." They said that they
were, and they had never tasted anything
like them before; in fact they had not believed that potatoes could have so fine a
flavour. I assured them that they should
always have a plentiful supply.
I was telling some of the senators from
the Maritimes that one year we did not
need any bin in the basement for the potatoes; we just piled them up like eordwood.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: If there is any doubt
about getting potatoes from the Maritimes,
we can supply the world from Saskatchewan.
Hon. C. MacARTHUR: Honourable senators, we seem to be learning something every
day. I always understood that Maritime
potatoes, particularly those from Prince
Edward Island, were acknowledged to be of
paramount quality. That was never questioned before.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh,* oh.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: The honourable
senator referred to sixty cents a bushel for
potatoes. That is a cent a pound. Is there
not some regulation about that? We can
get twice as much for Prince Edward Island
potatoes.
72542-18

265

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Before I left Rosetown, Saskatchewan, I bought potatoes at
fifty cents a bag.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: How much to
the bag?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: A bushel and a
half.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Perhaps it is because
they are of poor quality.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: You had better
send them here.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: We have hundreds
of acres of them going to waste.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: I want to ask
why it is these marble-sized potatoes are
shipped. Are they not graded? Are there
no regulations here like those we have in
the Maritimes?
Hon. ir. HORNER: How do these small
potatoes get in here?
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: There -is no doubt
that we are getting very small potatoes in
the hotels and restaurants. Our potatoes
measure from two and a half to three inches.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: They are small
potatoes.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Why the shipment of potatoes that are only fit for pig feed
is allowed is more than I understand. I do
not understand either that Saskatchewan
potatoes are the best.
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators, I
knew the statement that Saskatchewan potatoes are the best in tle world would not
go unchallenged. However, I shall be pleased
to bring the remarks of the honourable senator
(Hon. Mr. Horner) to the attention of the
Minister of Agriculture. I can hardly understand the situation. In this city for some
time there has been a great scarcity of
potatoes. Surely, if potatoes of the quality
and size described are available in Saskatchewan, there must be some reason why they
have not been brought down here.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: If the honourable
gentleman will send down all the potatoes he
can gather up, and they are of decent size and
quality, I will give fifty cents a bushel for
them right here in Ottawa.
Hon. DUNCAN McL. MARSHALL: To
me the difference between Saskatchewan
potatoes and Maritime potatoes at the present
time is that I can get Saskatchewan potatoes
and cannot get the others. So I am in favour
of the Saskatchewan potatoes in the meantime
at least.

CANADIANS

INTERNED IN FRANCE

DEBATE ON MOTION CONTINUED-MOTION
WITHDRAWN

The Senate resumed from May 20 the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Prévost:
That this House deems it proper to call the
attention of the Government to the situation of
Canadians incarcerated in France by German
authorities, on the mere ground of their being
British subjects, whereas Germans who abide
by the laws of Canada peacefully enjoy their
freedom in this country; and that this House
believes and trusts that Canadian authorities
will be able, by taking appropriate steps, to
secure the liberation of our unfortunate
compatriots.
Hon. J. H. KING: Ionourable senators, I
understand the honourable gentleman from
De Salaberry
(Hon. Mr. Gouin), who
adjourned this debate, is not desirous of
continuing it, and I wish to make a few
remarks before the debate is concluded.
My honourable friend from Mille Iles (Hon.
Mr. Prévost) calls attention to the treatment
by German authorities of Canadians interned
in France, and contrasts it with our treatment
of Germans in Canada. We know that the
Canadian Government is living up to international conventions in regard to the treatment, not only of members of enemy forces
held here as prisoners of war, but also of alien
civilians who happened to be resident in this
country. At the outbreak of war all enemy
aliens and persons who were naturalized after
1921 were required to register with the Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police. Persons whom the police suspected, or
whom, for any other reason, they thought it
wise to keep in custody, were interned in the
early stages of the war, and from time to
time others have been picked up in consequence of representations made to the police,
or of decisions made by the police on their
own initiative. Enemy aliens not interned are
required to report at stated intervals to the
police in their community. Such bas been the
procedure followed from the first of the war
until lately. Within the last week or two we
have adopted the United States practice with
regard to Italians, by exempting them, with
the approval of the police, fron registration.
Then we have a number of Japanese aliens
in this country. As is well known, they have
been subject to removal from a certain Pacifie
coast zone that was set aside as a reserve
Hon. DUNCAN McL. MARSHALL

area. With few if any exceptions, all Japanese
have been moved out of that district.
In' regard to Canadian civilians who are
interned or imprisoned in France, I have a
mcmorandum here, which I shall read:
In order to attend more carefully to the
problems raised by the internment of a certain
number of Canadians in enemy countries, the
Department of External Affairs organized a
special section which devotes all its time to
assuring the best possible conditions for
prisoners of war, as well as those interned.
The department keeps in close touch with interned Canadians through representatives of the
protecting power, Switzerland.
These representatives transmit to us at irregular intervals
general reports which inform us on the morale
and the health of the internees, as well as on
the physical and hygienie conditions of the
camps. These reports enable us to secure the
attention of the German authorities to necessary
improvements. Moreover, they give us information on the kind of life which the internees
lead.
We know that certain camps have
organized courses to allow the internees to continue their studies. Some theological students
have been able thus to finish their philosophical
and theological studies and have been ordained
priests since their internment. The protecting
power likewise sends individual reports in case
of sickness or need. Moreover, te permit the
internees to improve their lot, the Government,
through a Swiss intermediary, turns over to
each internee a monthly sum of $10. There is
no doubt that this amount aids greatly in
alleviating the rigours of internment.
Although the life of a camp is hardly pleasant,
it may be stated with assurance that Canadian
authorities spare no effort to make it tolerable,
and also to obtain the liberation and repatriation of the interned Canadians.
I may say that some Canadians, not a great
many, have been repatriated. I think we
probably have been as successful as the other
powers in this regard..
It is deplorable that a large number of priests
are thus prevented from carrying on their
spiritual duties, but the fact that, in certain
European countries, persons in Holy Orders are
subjected to military service, makes more difficult any intervention in their behalf. In the
present situation, the German authorities make
no distinction between clerics and laymen.
Constant attention is being given to the
problem of the internees, and no step will be
neglected which might lead to a satisfactory
solution.
The memorandum quoted indicates what
the Government is attempting to do on
behalf of Canadian civilians interned in
enemy countries.
We know that international undertakings with respect to internees
are not being observed by some of the
warring powers who signed these undertakings,
particularly Germany. Great Britain bas been
able to continue an interchange of prisoners of
war with Italy. At one time an attempt was
made for such an interchange between Great
Britain and Germany. I believe the matter

267

JUNE 10, 1943
proceeded to such a stage that prisoners were
assembled at ports of embarkation wben
negotiations broke down, and I do not think
there bas so far been any exehange between
those two countries.
ilere in Canada we have been fairly
fortunate in dealing with enemy aliens.
Experience speaks for itself. We bave heen
ini the war for nearly four years now, and in al]
that time we have had very littie internai
trouble fromn enemy aliens. There bas been
littie, if any, sabotage, and we must al
agree that our police-I refer flot only to the
Dominion police, but also to those of the
provinces and the municipalities-bave done
an excellent job, and we bave reason to be
proud of the expeditious and efficient way ini
wbiéb tbey bave handled this problem.
I 'hope that I have covered the subject to the satisfaction of my bonourable
friend from Mille les (Hon. Mr. Prévost).
I bave tried to indicate briefly the kind of
treatment we are giving ta enemy aliens, and
also wbat is being doue for our people wbo
are interned in France and Germany.
Hon. J. E. P-REVOST (Translation): Honourable senators,Tbe Hon. tbe SPEAKER: Honourable senators, I wouid point out that if the bonourable
gentleman. speaks now he wiil conclude the
debate. Therefore, if any other bonourable
member wisbes to take part in the debate., be
sbould do so first.
(Translation):
Hon. J. E. PREVOST
Honourable senators, the oniy object of the
resolution I had the bonour ta move was
for this flouse to express tbe hope that al
possible efforts would be made to ensure that
aur numerous citizens wbo are in France might
receive, at the hands of the German authorities, treatment similar to that given by Canada ta German citîzens who are in aur country.
Througb diplomatie channels, by the medium
of Switzerland, aur protecting power, the Canadian authorities are in a position ta notify the
Germans that they have no reason ta resort
ta reprisais against aur citizens who are imprisoned in France, whiie German citizens are
free in this country. Neediess ta say, in bath
cases, I refer ta citizens who are peaceful. and
law-abiding in the countries they inhabit.
I realize that it is difficuit for the Canadian
Government ta communicate with the enemy,
but it is possible and we are convinced that
the Canadian authorities will take more and
more interest in tbe pliglit of our fellow-citizens wbo for the last three years have been
incarcerated in France hy tbe German authorities, for the soie reason that they are British
citizens.

In view of tbis statement and other information just read ta this flouse by the leader of

DROPPED

On the inquiry by Hon. Mr. Sauvé:
1. Ha@ the Government fully inquired into
the motion adopted by the Senate on the l5th
of April ultimo relevant to dlaims f rom farmers,
dealers and butchere against the commercial
operations at Montreal abattoirs?

2. In the affirmative, what stops have been

taken?'
3. Have the authorities taken juta consideratiOn the representations and denunciations of
the member for Chambly-Rouville and of the
senator for Rigaud?
4. In the affirmative, what is the nature and
efficiency of their action in the mattor?
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honoureble sonators, I have h.ad occasion ta give attention ta
the incluiry by Hon. Sonator Sauvé wbicb
appears on the Ordor Paper. In the form. of
a question it reads, in part:

SENATE
Has the Government fully inquired into the
motion adopted by the Senate on the 15th of
April ultimo relevant to claims from farmers,
dealers and butchers against the commercial
operations at Montreal abattoirs?
From the phrasing of this inquiry it is evident
that reference is being made to a motion which
the Senate adopted on April 15 last.
I find' that rule 25a provides as follows:
No question or amendment shall be proposed
which is the same in substance as any question
or amendment which, during the same session,
has been resolved in the affirmative, or negative,
unless the order, resolution or vote on such
question or amendment has been rescinded.
And rule 39 reads as follows:
No debate is in order on a mere inquiry; but
explanatory remarks may be made by the
senator making the inquiry, and by the minister
or other senator answering the same. Observations upon any such answer are not allowed.
The Senate received the inquiry, and on the
15th of April passed it as -an order for a return.
The return having been tabled forthwith, the
matter has been dealt with and disposed of
during the present session, and I am afraid
that under rules 25a and 39, which I have just
read, it is not permissible to make any further
reference to it. The question now on the
Order Paper is in the nature of a discussion of
the action taken by the Senate in directing
that a return should be tabled; therefore I am
obiiged to rule that, as it refers to a decision
alady made by the Senate during the present
se-ien, it is out of order.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: May I ask what procedure should be followed for the purpose of
obtaining front the Government an answer to
the inquiry or some information about the
correspondence that has been tabled? I understand that it would not be permissible to
debate that question.

Hon. Mr. KING: The honourable gentleman asked only for correspondence. He bas
had that.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: Yes, but it is an empty
answer. I cannot get in the correspondence
any information as to the attitude of the
Government.
Hon. Mr. KING: That is what the honourable gentleman is asking for now; but ha
asked for a return of correspondence. That
has been tabled, and I think the order bas
been fully satisfied.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Dropped.

REPORTS OF COMMITTEE

On the Orders of the Day for consideration
of the 77th, 78th, 79th, 80th and 81st reports
of the Standing Committee on Divorce:
Hon. C. W. ROBINSON:
Honourable
senators, the first five items on the Order
Paper to-day are for consideration of Divorce
Committee reports that were tabled the other
day. I should like to get these adopted, and
I know of no ýrule against this being done,
although the evidence has not yet been printed.
If the reports are concurred in, it may not
be deemed to be in order to introduce bills
based upon the reports before the evidence is
printed. Yet, again, so far as I know, there
is no rule preventing the introduction of bills
in these circumstances, and perhaps it would
be expedient to present them to-night. However, as to that I am in the hands of the
Senate. I would move that these five reports
be considered en bloc and concurred in now.
The motion was agreed te.

Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators, I
had intended to call the attention of His
Honour the Speaker te the inquiry of my
honourable friend. The honourable gentleman
is an old parliamentarian and understands the
rules and procedure well, and I am sure
that if he wants information on the inquiry he
will know how to go about getting it. His
Honour the Speaker bas ruled that this question is out of order, but I have no doubt my
honourable friend will find ways and means of
getting the information; and I am sure there
will be no disposition to withhold anything
which may properly be placed before this
House.
I would ask that the question be dropped.

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON:
Honourable senators, now that the reports of the Standing
Committee on Divorce have been concurred
in, I wish to present five bills:
Bill C4, an Act for the relief of Jean Sylvia
Murley.
Bill D4, an Act for the relief of Gertrude
Mantha Hore.
Bill E4, an Act for the relief of Claire
MacLaren Hunter Barlow.
Bill F4, an Act for the relief of Mary Constance Helena Keys Bates.
Bill G4, an Act for the relief of Margaret
Anne Richards Johnstone.

Hon. Mr. SAUVE: But the correspondence
tabled is not an answer to my question.

The Bills were then severally read the first

SENATE
CANADA DECREASING ACREAGE-U.S.A.
INCREASING ACREAGE

Considering all this, it comles as somewhat
of a shock to find that while Canada is drastically reducing wheat acreage the United States
has made plans to increase wheat acreage, and
that farmers in the U.S.A. are actually now
being bonused to increase both winter and
spring wheat acreages, and this at a time when
our Canadian farmers have about 200 million
bushels of wheat on their farms unsold, which
they have no prospect of selling, and which has
cost them money to harvest, to thresh and to
store; and which wheat, moreover, is taking
up valuable granary room and space on the
farms.
Why should this be? If there actually exists
complete understanding, collaboration and agreement, which we have been assured does exist
between the two Governments, would it not be
more sensible, if the United States really requires more wheat, for that country to draw
on the wheat surplus of Canada before enlarging
her own wheat acreage and production, and for
the United States to use ber land to produce
more of those feeding stuffs-oats, barley and
corn-of wihich products the United States fears
there will be a serions shortage this coming
year? Far from this, however, we are actually
informed that at precisely the same moment we
are decreasing wheat acreage and increasing
oat acreage in Canada, the United States is
planning exactly the opposite-to decrease her
oat acreage and to increase ber wheat acreageall as announced recently in Washington by
Mr. Chester Davis, War Food Administrator.
The article goes on to say there would seem
to be room for a simple agreement. It would
seem, honourable senators, that wheat production is one thing upon which there could be
greater collaboration between the two countries.
I think I am stating the fact when I say that
Canada can produce more wheat per acre than
can the country to the south. This is partly
because the United States has been growing a
crop for so many years longer than we have.
I think that on the whole our wheat crop will
probably average 8 bushels per acre more than
the wheat crop in the United States. On the
other hand, the United States, being farther
south, is more successful in growing corn,
second in importance only to wheat, and in
growing soya beans and other commodities.
I bring the subject up at this time, honourable senators, for the purpose of asking the
honourable leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. King) to see that it is called to the attention of the proper authorities. I am quite sure
that the figures mentioned in the article are
correct. This monthly periodical is edited by
Major Strang, of Winnipeg, an accepted
authority on grain matters on this continent,
and a man who once won first prize at the
Chicago Fair for world wheat production. His
figures have always been conservative, and I
am sure that in the present instance his statement of the case can be relied upon. If the
Hon. Mr. McRAE.

matter were taken up with the Government
by the honourable leader it could no doubt be
rectified, to the mutual advantage of both
countries.
While I am on my feet I might say that
I find a great many people in the United
States
actually
fear
a
food
shortage
and are very eager to do everything possible
to meet that situation. In fact, many of
them believe that the best effort we in this
country can make to-day is to increase the
production of food.
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators,
I do not intend to make a reply to my honourable friend at this time. The authority
he quotes is recognized throughout the West
as one of the grain handling companies in
Western Canada. We know that the Governments of Canada and the United States have
been collaborating on most of the war activities of the two countries. I am satisfied that
there have been conferences between the
Canadian and United States Departments of
Agriculture and that certain lines of policy
have been adopted. It is true that steps to
reduce wheat acreage have been taken in
Canada. In fact, a measure with that objective
was passed this year, and that seemed to
be sound policy at the time. To-day the
Government is bringing wheat and coarse
grains into Ontario, in order that the stockmen of the province may have feed at
a reasonable price for their cattle and hogs.
This grain is being moved from Fort William
into various Ontario centres without cost to
the farmers, to encourage a larger production
of pork and beef. I am told by some of the
Western wheat-growers that last year they
found it more profitable to feed wheat to their
cattle and hogs. There is no doubt there
will be a great shrinkage of wheat supplies
in the Prairie Provinces. It is well known
that large quantities of wheat are being imported into the United States for the feeding
of cattle and hogs. I am glad my honourable
friend has raised this question, and I shall
be pleased to bring it to the attention of the
Minister of Agriculture.
Hon. DUNCAN McL. MARSHALL: Honourable senators, I may say to my honourable
friend opposite (Hon. Mr. McRae) that I
read the Searle grain report every week. It
is a useful publication and gives a great deal
of data on the grain situation. I can understand why the publisher is arguing for more
wheat being grown in Canada, but I have not
the slightest doubt that arrangements have
been made between the Canadian and United
States Departments of Agriculture as to the
division of grain production between the two

JUNE 16, 1943
countries. It is a well known fact that a miserable quality of oats is grown in a large part
of the United States; in fact down in Iowa
oats run only thirty-two pounds to the bushel,
as against forty-two pounds in Scotland. Everybody knoîws the superior quality of oats grown
in Saskatchewan and Alberta. There is a
strong demand in the United States for oats
from those two provinces, and last year some
40,000,000 bushels were exported aoross the
line. In Oklahoma, for example, where the
climate is rather warm,:when I was there two
years ago the farmers were wishing they could
grow oats as we grotw them in Western
Canada. They could not grow very good
corn, and their oats were miserable stuif, weighing about thirty pounds to the bushel. They
were, hoping that some arrangements could
be made for them to get a supply of good
Canadian oats.
While the United States is tr, some extent
increasing its acreage of wheat, a great deal
of that may be for the production of what is
known as macaroni wheat, since outside of a
few of the northern States only the softer kinds
of wheat can be grown by our neighbours.
I arn quite sure that the division made by
the officiais of the two Governmnents as to the
respective grain acreages of the two countries
was made with a view to benefiting alI concerned, and particularly to getting in Canada
what oui stockmen want, that is, more and
better oats.
Just this morning I was reading a British
farm weekly in which it was pointed out that
in England at the present time some of the
beef cattle which are being marketed were
fattened entirely on hay, roots and oats, the
oats being brought down from Scotland, where
the best os.ts in the world, barring Alberta
and Saskatche'wan, can be grown.
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: And Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL- Yes, Manitoba
grows good oats, too, but not quite so heavy
as the oats of Alberta and Saskatcewan.
There is a quarrel just now between Manitoba
and Saskatchewan about potatoes, and I should
ncçt like to stir that up. In Toronto we have
stopped eating Saskatchewan potatoes and are
now eating Manitoba potatoes, but we have
not yet decided which of the two provinces
produces the better grade. In fact, we have
to be content with what potatoes we eam buy,
and their origin is of secondary importance.
I think there is no great difficulty or hardship in connection with the arrangements between this country and the United States with
regard to the allocation of grain production.
I arn interestedi, just as my hono>urable friiend.
is, in the Searle report, whieh, as I have said,

Z71

is always in favour of a larger production of
wheat in Canada. Perhaps after the war we
mnay find we have flot too mnuch wheat on
hand, though storing a couple of hundred million bushels on farms is a difficult matter at
the present time.
Hon. C. MacARTHUR: Honourable senators, though 1 have heard a great deal about
grain during the past twenty years, I know
very littie about it; so I wlll leave it to the
Western mnembers to figure out their own
problem. Many of you read this morning
the statement of the Prime Minister that
there would be no more hunger, and that
the situation which existed some years ago,
when large quantities of hogs and grain were
destroyed while millions of people were
starving, would not be allowed to occur again.
With international goodwill there will be a
different situation, and surely we can reach
some intelligent method of distribution so
that nobody need go hungry.
I was rather surprised the other day at what
was said in this Bouse about potatoes. If the
honourable gentlemen from Saskatchewan
(Hon. Mr. Borner and Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
had said the moon was made of green cheese,
I would have believed the statement more
readily than that you can buy good potatoes
for seventy-five cents the bushel-and-a-half
bag. One honourable senator said the potatoes
were piled up like cordwood. What I cannot
understand is why they have not been sent to
the Southern States for seed. We want someone to look after intelligent distribution from
one country to another, or from one part of
Canada to another. Many people are going
in for victory gardens, and if there is an
intelligent distribution of good, wholesome
food no one will go hungry. But these
gentlemen from. the West are falling down on
their job.
Hon. Mr. HIORNER: Some people need to
be educated as to where that good food is to
be found.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Surely you have
a Minister of Agriculture; and with the
newspapers it should not be difficult to disseminate the information. In the Maritimes
ahl these things are regulated as to sîze and
quality. I amn told that lu the West potatoes
are growa a foot and a half long. They are
no good. Neither are the small ones any
good. The medium.-sized potatoes are the
best. It is the saine with sheil fish. If they
are over or under a certain size, they are not
iu the samne category with the medium-sized.
ones. I arn going to ask these two, honourable
gentlemen fromn the West to see that these
potatoes are sent where they are needed. I

272

SENATE

should like to hear from the honourable senator from Cardigan (Hon. John A. Macdonald),
who is an expert, or the honourable senator
from Royal (Hon. Mr. Jones), just what is
going on in the potato business.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I should like to say
that my statement as to Saskatchewan potatoes has been amply substantiated by a dealer
in the province of Quebec. He says that I
was absolutely right; that last year he had a
carload and they remained firm until August.
He found them much better than the Maritime potatoes.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: As to wheat, there is
one point that bas not been made. In a large
area of Western Canada where there is a
shortage of rainfall wheat is the best and
most profitable crop that can be grown. It
stands drought better than oats. For that
reason we should be given a chance to grow a
great part of the world's wheat.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Honourable senators, the
honourable gentleman from Peel (Hon. Mr.
Marshall) offered what, in his opinion, might
be an explanation of present conditions. But
a very definite statement has been made, and
I rise to ask the honourable leader of the Government if he will not, during our recess,
ascertain the facts in order to give us information on the existing arrangement. In my opinion, in the interest of co-operation and coordination, the matter should not be allowed
to stand. I share the honourable senator's
confidence in our authorities, but a definite
statement has been made and published, and I
think we should have some information in
regard to it.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable senators,
may I add one word to the discussion? In
dealing with this acreage problem we should
not overlook the fact that something may
happen to the crops. You will understand
what I mean. I have seen a first-class crop,
extending over large areas, virtually disappear
overnight. We are at war, and there are
many millions of people dependent upon the
crops that will be grown this year. I was
amazed to hear from the reading of the Searle
report that there is a possibility of a food
shortage this year. If that is so, it seems to
me that the Government should do everything
it can to reduce the risk to which I refer. A
drought may hit Ontario, it may bit Western
Canada, it may hit large sections of the United
States, and in two or three weeks the crops
grown in such areas will be far short of the
need.
Hon. G. B. JONES: Honourable senators,
in response te the call from the honourable
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR.

senator from Prince (Hon. Mr. MacArthur),
may I express my regret that I was not in the
House when the question of potatoes arose a
few days ago. All I have to say in that
connection is that if the price and quality are
as stated by the honourable members from
Saskatchewan, it is hard to understand why the
potatoes have not been shipped east to be
marketed. The statement was that they could
be bought for fifty cents a bushel.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: A cent a pound.
Hon. Mr. JONES: Sixty cents a bushel would
mean a delivered price here of about $1.50
for a seventy-five-pound bag. We are selling
large quantities of potatoes here at from
$2.12 to $2.20 a bag. What I should like to
know is why the Saskatchewan potatoes, if
they are fit to eat, are not brought here and
sold for nearly double the price tbey are bringing in the West.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I may say that probably one hundred and fifty earloads have
arrived.

have notice here from the Chairman of the

ADDRESS 0F MLAfAME CHIANG KAISHEK TO MEMBERS 0F SENATE
AND HOUSE OF COMMONS

Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators,
bef are we proceed with the Orders of the Day,
I thinlc it would be only right and proper
that we as a body of Parliarnent should
recognize what appealed ta me as a mernarable
event in aur parliarnentary life. I disoussed
the matter with my honourable friend
opposite (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne),, and we
agreed it would be apprapriate for this Chamber ta incarporate in its records the proceedings that toak place in the flouse of Commons

Chamber yesterday.

I refer ta the address

delivered by that distinguished and remarkable
persan, Madame Chiang Kai-shek, who has
been an a visit ta the United States and is at
present in Canada. She represents the people
of the great Republic of China, which has,
been engaged in seria-us combat for the last

six years, withstanding the attacks of the
Japanese Empire, one of the world powers
against which we ourselves are contending
I think that the graceful and conto-day.
vincing manner in which she dehivered ber
address yesterday irnpressed not only parliamentarians of long experience who were

present, but also Canadians generally who
had the gaod fortune ta hear the radio broadcast of ber speech. We learned frorn her
what the people of China have accomplished in

their heroic. fight against a well-equipped
barbarous military power, and as well
vital importance of China as ane of
United Nations now at war with the

and
the
the
Axis

p.owers.

In, conjunctian with my honourable friand
opposite (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) I move:
That the address of Madame Chiang Kai-shek,
delivered before the members of the Senate and
the flouse of Cammons of Canada in the
Chamber of the flouse of Commons an the l6th
Joue, 1943, and the record cf the praceedings,
be included in the Senate Debates and form

in the galleries were profoundly impressed
net only by ber charming personality and
ber gracious manner, but also by the authoritative information that she gave us about
ber country, our gallant ally, China; and
ber vast radio audience throughout Canada
must have been equally impressed. What struck
me more than anything else was ber unshaken
faith in ultimate victory and ber ability to
make her audience share in that faith. It certainly was a unique occasion in the parliamentary history of Canada, for it is the
first time that a lady bas ever addressed a
joint meeting of our two Houses, and I think
those honourable senators who were present
will bear me out when I say that net one of
the distinguished gentlemen from other countries who on various occasions have addressed
a joint session of Parliament bas excelled
Madame Chiang in persuasive eloquence and
graceful delivery. This inspiring address by a
lady from one of the greatest countries in the
world, a country with traditions reaching back
thousands of years, will greatly strengthen our
hope of victory over the Axis powers. I can
foresee that a better world will evolve as a
result of having China associated with the
other Allied nations in the solution of postwar problems, and in bringing about such a
state of world security that never again shall
humanity be plunged into another such desperate war as we are now wagng.
I thank the honourable leader of the House
for moving the resolution, and let me add
that it gives me great pleasure to express the
approval of everyone on this side of the
House.
The motion was agreed te.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I presume that
the records of the Senate will contain not only
Madame Chiang's eloquent speech, but also
the remarks of the Prime Minister and those
of our Speaker and the Speaker of the House
of Commons.
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes, that is the intention.
REPORT OF THE PROCEEDINGS
Members of the Senate and of the House
of Commons assembled in the House of Commons Chamber, Ottawa, on Wednesday, June
16, 1943, at Il a.m.
Right Hon. W. L. MACKENZIE KING
(Prime Minister): Mr. Speaker of the Senate,
Mr. Speaker of the House of Commons, bonourable members of both flouses of Parliament: Our country is honoured to-day by the
presence in its capital of a gracious lady who
is one of the great personages of the world.
To Madame Chiang Kai-shek I extend the
sincerest of welcomes on behalf of the GovernHon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

ment, the Parliament and the people of Canada. We welcome Madame Chiang for what
she is in herself. We welcome her as the
devoted wife of Generalissimo Chiang Kaishek, the great leader of the Republic of China.
And we welcome ber as the.interpreter of the
needs and the virtues of the patient and
heroic people of China, the first great power to
resist Axis aggression.
I should like to thank Madame Chiang anew
for having promised, some little time ago, to
visit Canada before her return to China; and
for having consented, while in Ottawa, to
address the members of Canada's Parliament
from the floor of its House of Commons.
Madame Chiang was obliged to postpone ber
return to her homeland for some weeks in
order that ber health might permit ber to
fulfil the promise she had made. We are
deeply conscious of ber kindness in so doing.
Madame Chiang speaks to-day as it has been
given to few individuals in all history to
speak. She speaks for the struggles and sufferings, and equally for the bighest aspirations, of
an ancient race. She speaks for an immemorial
culture. :Combining with dignity and grace
great spiritual courage, she stands in our
midst fully mindful of the toil and sacrifice
which, over many cruel years, sbe bas shared
with China's valiant defenders. No recital
of the noble qualities of ber mind and heart
could add to the respect and admiration with
which we receive ber in our halls of Parliament
to-day.
The inspired leadership of Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-shek and his brilliant wife personifies the spirit of China's fight for freedomfreedoin not only from aggression, but from all
the forces of evil. Moreover, it is freedom not
for China alone, but freedom which, through
understanding and mutual aid among men and
nations, will further the well-being of mankind
Generalissimo and
throughout the world.
Madame Chiang Kai-shek voice and exemplify
the spirit which animates the defenders of freedom everywhere.
We would ask you, Madame Chiang, to carry
to the Generalissimo the expression of our
high regard for him, and the assurance that
the people of Canada have unreservedly joined
with the people of China in putting forth their
utmost effort to destroy the evil forces that
now seek to dominate the world.
We should like you to tell the men and
women of China how unbounded is our
admiration of their unswerving fortitude.
Their uncomplaining courage has not been
surpassed in the annals of human resistance.
Canada, in common with all the United
Nations, is increasingly conscious of the debt
that freedom owes to the unconquerable spirit
of China.

JUNE 17, 1943
We are proud to-day to recall that within
the expanding circle of the United Nations,
Canada and China, through the exchange of
Ministers, have strengthened the ties of friendship between our two countries.
It is the earnest hope of all Canadians,
Madame Chiang, that to you and to the
Generalissimo may be granted the health and
Divine guidance which will enable you
together to continue your magnificent work
for the unity of your own country and the
liberation of all its people.
Our prayers are joined with yours that the
day may not be far distant when China,
wholly free, may take her rightful place
among the free nations of the world.
Hon. J. A. GLEN (Speaker of the House
of Commons): Madame Chiang Kai-shek,
Mr. Speaker of the Senate, honourable members of both Houses of Parliament: In these
war days this Parliament has in its deliberations and affairs created many precedents, and
to-day we are making further progress. Never
before in our history have we heard the voice
of a woman, not a member, address us from
the floor of the House of Commons. The
occasion which provides so unique an event
must have attributes and meanings so outstanding and so deep as to render this
gathering appropriate and most befitting.
In all grave crises in national and international affairs we have seen great figures
and great personalities arise who seem to
embody in themselves the issues to be decided.
History abounds with such figures. In the
records of this present struggle, to the generic
term "mankind" must be specifically attached
the term "womanhood."
Certainly in no
ather war of magnitude have the power and
service of women been so universally employed,
and inevitably there have arisen women
leaders and world figures who by precept and
example have set the standard of devotion,
duty and -sacrifice-safe guides in an unsafe
world. Our distinguished guest to-day is one
of those great world figures.
Madame Chiang Kai-shek has honoured us
by her presence and it is our privilege to
receive that honour. During almost six years
she has borne the toil and sorrow of unceasing

inflicted on ber beloved people unparalleled

alive the high spirit of her people in a manner
truly amazing, commanding the wondrous
admiration of the whole world. Her very
presence with us lto-day is an illustration of
the spirit which bas sustained ber through
those years which the locusts have eaten-the
triumph of mind o'er the ills of the body.

Honourable members of both Houses of
Parliament, it is with modest pride that I, a
mere mortal, present one of the immortals,
Madame Chiang Kai-shek.
MADAME CHIANG KAI-SHEK: Mr.
Speaker, Mr. Prime Minister, members of the
Senate and members of the House of Commons: J deem it a privilege and pleasure to
be here in your midst to-day, for I have been
long looking forward to visiting you and your
country. I am conscious of the honour of
addressing your Parliament, because your
national assembly, as an institution, dates
in unbroken lineage from that ancient and
worthy institution, the Anglo-Saxon Witenagemot. It is an institution which has proven its
mettle in weather fair or foul. Parliamentary
government to you and to me means that it is
built on the basic laws of the land and the
common consent of the people, carrying out a
policy within the mandate given by the people.
Based on this authority of ancient usage and
the legislative enactment of the supreme
authority in the State, we have custom which
connotes "unwritten law," and law which is
"written enactment." I think it was well put
when a great Roman writer of the first century B.C. said: "A people is not an assemblage
of men brought together in any fashion, but
an assemblage of multitude associated by
consent to law and community of interest."
We would all agree that a truly parliamen,
tary form of government is the most nearly
perfect system of government human reason
could ever evolve. And we say that parliamentary government is run by the "rule of
law." In other words, it bas its foundation
on immemorial custom and right reason. No
single individual, no group, no class is above
law. Parliament has final competence in expressing laïw, and men can be punished o-nly for
breach of law. In this way every individual
citizen is within the framework of the law
and is thereby protected.
But these ideals and principles were not
immediately practised upon their formation;
rather they came into being through the passage of time. If we remember, there were
indeed fearless men who did not hesitate to
speak out their convictions through the centuries. In the sixteenth century, Sir John
Eliot, in his celebrated impeachment attacking the favourite minion of Charles I, compared Buckingham to Sejanus. To us, whether
Charles I was implied to be a Tiberius or not,
matters little. What stays our attention is
the implicit demand that a Minister should
possess the confidence of Parliament.
Whatever we may think of Milton's unprincipled opportunism in vacillating between
Cromwell and Charles Il, we must recognize
that Milton did contribute to the fight for the

276

SENATE

principle of freedom of speech as seen in his
"Areopagitica."
Much later the Quarterly
Review, the Westminster Review, and the
Edinburgh Review, as exponents of freedom of
speech, grew and flourished and became journails of excellence. They achieved their great
purpose inasmuch as they brought publie questions before a wide audience. The public
became conscious of affairs outside the compressed bounds of their personal lives and
voluntarily absorbed their accepted discipline
as a great power in the world. Men like
Wilberforce and Buxton took their stand and
worked against slavery and advocated the
freedom of man.
Others like George Grote and John Stuart
Mill worked for the freedom of institutions.
These are merely a few names amongst the
many social and political reformers of your
great Mother Country. I need nnt, however,
tell you that it was due to centuries of incessant struggle by your people against the
strongly entrenched absolute powers of unreason that your present parliamentary system
of government came into being.
It may be interesting to contrast the system
of parliamentary government with Axis tyranny which once threatened to engulf the
civilized world, and to examine the Fascist
philosophy and see wherein it differs fundamentally from yours.
Germany during the Weimar republic 1had
all the outward "appearance" of a democracy,
but it degenerated and became extinet after
an existence of less than two decades. In its
place grew up a demoniac Mephistopheles
nurturing persecution and miasmie hate. That
such a retrogression could take place shows
that the majority of the German people ere
not aware of the true essence of a constitutional form of government and that the integrants of making it a lasting and true democracy were wanting. Sone people conjure that
democracy implies that individuals may be
allowed to engage in activity even when it is
directed against the interests of the State.
Others deem democracy to be "a charming
form of government full of variety and disorder." By permitting activities subversive to
democratic ideals that nation denies to itself
the right of self-defence, while those who
think that chaos lends charm to democracy
deny to democracy the right of self-preservation.
Never for a moment should we confuse
democracy with ochlocracy. Democracy is
disciplined self-rule. Democracy may be
likened to beautiful architecture; for every
part of the tracery and sculpture, supreme in
its individuality, claims a permanent place on
its own merit and then sorrenders it to the
entire composition, thereby enriching the
Madame CHIANG KAI-SHEK

whole and relieving it from the tameness of
mere qualitative perfection. Ochlocracy, on the
other hand, is but the inchoate rococo of mob
rule bred on febrile emotions and unrestraint.
Present-day Germany has become an immane dictatorship because it precludes the
right of the governed to forensic dialectics.
The Fascists believe that a preponderance of
force constitutes all legal requirements and
justification of a government. They have
dragooned and deluded the people into a
belief of superstition in the infallibility of
their leadership. They have refused the people
the right to challenge the fallibility of men
holding power in the government. We of the
United Nations. on the other hand, accept the
challenge of query permitting divergent views
the right of discussion so that all ideas in
the deepest recesses and nethermost corners
of the human mind are re-examined and
weighed; for we think that this is " a method
which produces a better average of humanity
and the most scientific of despotism."
Besides the excellent pattern of parliamentary government which Canada represents,
i am impressed by the fact that here in your
country one finds the greatest examiple of two
steadfast peoples, the French and the British,
who in the history of their development of
tlie country were net unmarred by wars and
who have now come to live side by side as
one people in concord and harmony. In
achievement the descendants of the French
settlers, as well as those of Anglo-Saxon
origin, have contributed in full measure to the
progress and prosperity of Canada. This
record is indeed noteworthy.
When a part of your vast country was
colonized in its early days, the French colonial
authorities of Lower Canada instituted in
every parish a militia captain chosen from
among the "habitants."
Truc enough, this
nominee was appointed by the Governor. But
the commissions were given or withheld
according to whether people apiproved or
rejected the nominee at the regular Sunday
assembly. That was an outstanding example
of public representation, a practice to follow
the will and wishes of the people. The natural
good manners, social ease, and never-failing
liveliness characterizing the French people
made them eminently suitable for the adventurous life of early colonizers.
One never
fails to be reminded in one's travels in the
United States that such names as Detroit,
St. Louis, Vincennes and Louisiana all bear
impress of the adventurous spirit of the French
Canadians. The coureurs de bois with their
fortitude and understanding of the Red Indians
instilled into the new continent a priceless
heritage-the opportunity of liberty.
The

JUNE 17, 1943
French peasants who came to Canada with
their frugal traits worked up to become landowners. Here it was not uncommon for the
lord of a manor, his lady and his children, to
toil together in the fields. They developed
respect for labour and, unlike some countries
of the time, they looked upon manual work,
not as degrading, but rather as the natural
expression in whieh every man must participate, and recognized that every labourer is
worthy of his hire. Such was the levelling
influence of frontier life.
The Gallic church also played a large part
in the development of your country. Some
of the most colourful and glorious chapters of
Christian missions began in North America.
The Jesuit priests were explorers, cartographers
and teachers. It was Père Marquette who
with Louis Jolliet explored the Mississippi.
It was the Catholic Fathers who produced the
first maps of lake Superior in 1671 and the
northern parts of Michigan and lake Huron.
It was the Jesuits who first preached Christianity among the Hurons and aspired to
convert and civilize the whole continent of
Red Indians.
I recall also the intendant, Jean Talon, who
was blessed with vision and foresight. Not
content that a few people should profit by
the land of milk and honey, he advocated the
idea that Canada should be opened up to
take the pressure off the increased population
in Europe, the great majority of whom were
then living in squalor and poverty further
accentuated by heavy taxation raised to
finance the private wars of kings and princes
motivated by selfish ambition of aggrandizement.
Canada, and the world as well, owe a debt
of lasting gratitude to men like Poulett
Thomson, the first Baron Sydenham, for his
wise statesmanship in adopting moral suasion
rather than brute force in carrying out his
policy during his tenure of office as Governor.
Later, Lord Elgin, while representing the
Crown in Canada, accepted the Liberal party
in the formation of the Canadian cabinet,
thereby recognizing responsible representative
government. Since then your country has
made steady and logical progress in unity of
government, and your people have evolved
cohesion of purpose and action so that to-day
you are an effective member of the United
Nations in the fight against aggression.
In my address to the Congress of your great
neighbour, the United States, I 'mentioned
that in the common interest of the United
Nations, Japan must not be permitted to have
undisputed possession of the territories she
has seized in China and elsewhere, for, with

zit

the help of time, she is accumulating added
resources to continue the Axis war of aggression. The material she has commandeered
during the past twelve months reaches staggering figures. From occupied territories
within the great wall of China, on the average, every month, three million two hundred
thousand tons of raw materiale were shipped
to Japan, whilst two million eight hundred
thousand tons were shipped from the occupied
territories in Manchuria to Japan. In addition,
each month, she transported from territories
inside the great wall two million three
hundred thousand tons of material for the
heavy industries she is building in Manchuria
and other parts of Asia. In short, within the
last year, Japan has seized and carried away,
in round numbers, one hundred million tons
of raw material for the use of ber armed
forces. This figure does not include the foodstuffs her army in Ohina's occupied areas
consumed. The importance of driving Japan
from China can be further seen when we
consider that from Malaya, Japan, the past
year, had only shipped approximately six
million tons, the ratio of about one to
sixteen as compared with what she appropriated from China. She is continually consolidating ber position as a vicious world
threat and increasing ber exploitation of
China's resources, aimed at the United Nations.
My country, China, for six years bas hung
like a millstone around the neck of the
Japanese military, and has succeeded in preventing Japan from utilizing several millions
of ber armed forces and workers in other
parts of the world. With ill-equipped men
we have fought with small arms, flesh and
blood, and the will to battle. Until a few
weeks ago, the Chinese army never had the
sort of consistent air protection necessary for
even small-scale offensives. The fact that
our army with the help of a few planes in
the combined American and Chinese air
forces was able to rout the enemy in the
last up-river Yangtze invasion proved conelusively that comparatively much can be
done with comparatively litte. The danger
to China and the United Nations, however,
is not past; the magnificent will to resist
of the Chinese people and army, implemented
only by inadequate fighting material, must
not be strained beyond human endurance,
for if Japan should succeed in subjugating
China, the repercussions to the cause of the
United Nations would be the greatest cataclysmic disaster civilization has yet to face.
Like that of China, the contribution which
Canada has made to our common cause has
not been of the spectacular. I am constrained

While the splendours of Egypt, Greece and

Your people have been an ingenious people.
It was they who more than four thousand
years ago invented the compass, and discovered the means of making silk. It was
they who fine centuries ago invented gunpowder. They devised and used the printing

SENATE
THE SUPPLY OF POTATOES
ANSWER TO INQUIRY

Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators,
before moving adjournment of the House I
should like to make a statement in response
to the inquiry of my honourable friend from
Saskatchewan North (Hon. Mr. Horner), regarding the movement of potatoes from that
province to Eastern Canada. I have some
information that I think should be placed on
record and made available to honourable
members. On the 2nd of June this year a
circular to inspectors was issued, by the Assistant Director, Marketing Service, Department
of Agriculture, read'ing as follows:
The Foods Administration of the Wartime
Prices and Trade Board have requested, as an
emergency measure, that we permit the shipment and sale in Eastern Canada of some 100
carlots of potatoes from Saskatchewan, whieh
quantity would be considerably reduced if
graded out to the requirements of Canada No. 2
grade, mainly for reasons of (a) the minimum
size requiremcent and (b) the "similar varietal
characteristics" requirement.
We have agreed that until June 30 these
potatoes may be shipped interprovincially under
the obsolete grade mark "Canada No. 3," which
provides as follows:
"Canada No. 2" shall consist of potatoes which
do not conform to any of the foregoing grades,
but the minimum diameter shall not be less
than 1l inches.
The tolerance clause reads that "not more than
5 per cent by weight of any lot may be below
the prescribed size .

Mr. GLEN.

ADJOURNMENT
Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, I
move that when the Senate adjourns to-day
it do stand adjourned until Tuesday, June 29,
at 8 o'clock in the evening.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, June
29, at 8 p.m.

. and not more than

1 per cent by weight of the entire lot may have
the flesh affected by soft rot."
Inspection and certification is not required
(at clause 1 of the Inspection Regulations under
the Fruit, Vegetables and Honey Act) for
potatoes grown in Saskatchewan and to be
shipped to any other province.
Inspectors in Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec
are hereby authorized:
(a) to take no exception te Saskatchewan
potatoes
narketed under the grade mark
"Canada No. 3";
(b) to inspect to the above grade requirements in event of any request for destination
inspection of such potatoes.
I have a further memorandum, relating to
subsidizing by the Wartime Prices and Trade
Board of part of the transportation costs,
which I should also like to read:
In order to facilitate the movement to Eastern
anada of scattered surplus stocks of potatoes
mu the hands of farners in Saskatchewan and
Manitoba, the Wartine Prices and Trade Board
has approved of a temporary policy Of subsidizng part of the transportation costs involved.
Only shippers of potatoes who have been

apply for this subsidy to the Commodity Prices

applicant and addressed to the said Corporation,
setting forth full particulars of the amount
claimed.

price as described in Order No. 236 at the
Eastern Canadian destination is in respect of
deliveries prior to June 1, 1943, less than $2.23,
or in respect of deliveries on or after June 1,
1943, less than $2.33.
Applications must be supported by an exact
copy of the shipper's invoice to the consignee,
which must be signed by the consignee acknowledging receipt of the shipment, and stating the
date and place of delivery. These documents
will be retained by the Corporation for its
records.
It wil.1 be seen that the department bas been
subsidizing the shipment of potatoes from
Saskatchewan to Eastern Canada, to relieve
the shortage in this part of the country.

POSTPONEMENT OF REDISTRIBUTION
NOTICE OF RESOLUTION

Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators, you
are all aware that a Redistribution Bill would
under ordinary circumstances be introduced
into Parliamen-t this year, following the last
census; but, as the Prime Minister has indicated in another place, it would probably be
unwise to proceed with such a bill at this time.
In order to secure the right to delay the
measure, it is necessary that the British North
America Act be amended. This requires a
resolution of both Houses of Parliament. I
therefore beg leave to give notice of the following resolution:
That, whereas provisions of the British North
Americâ Act require that, on the completion
of each decennial census, the representation of
the provinces in the House of Commons shall
be readjusted; .
And whereas such readjustment involves in
fact the determination of the number of members to represent each province and the number
of electoral divisions within each province and
the delimitation of such electoral divisions;
And whereas Canada bas been at war since
September 10, 1939, and hostilities may continue for an indefinite period;
And whereas the census of 1941 was taken
during the progress of hostilities;
And whereas the effect of enlistment in the
armed forces of Canada and of employment in
the production of munitions of war has been
to remove large numbers of the population from
their homes to serve in and with such armed
forces either in other parts of Canada or overseas or to reside temporarily in other parts of
Canada;
And whereas experience has shown that such
readjustment may give rise to sharp differences
of opinion as to the appropriate delimitation of
electoral divisions, which differences it is most
desirable to avoid while Canada continues at
war;
And. whereas in these circumstances it does
not now seem desirable that readjustment of
representa-tion on the basis of the census of 1941
should have to be made during the continuance
of the hostilities in which Canada is now
engaged,
A humble address be presented to His Majesty
the King in the following words:To the King's Most Excellent Majesty:
Most Gracious Sovereign:
We, Your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal
subjects, the Senate of Canada in Parliament
assembled, humbly approach Your Majesty,
praying that You may graciously be pleased to
cause a measure to be laid before the Parliament
of the United Kingdom to be expressed as
follows:

An Act to provide for the readjustment of the
representation of the provinces in the House of
Commons of Canada consequent on the decennial
census taken in the year One thousand nine
hundred and forty-one.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE

THE SENATE

Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators,
our expectation that we should have some work
to do at this sitting has not been realized;
but, honourable members being present, we
will take advantage of the opportunity to
hold a meeting of the Standing Committee on
Finance to-morrow morning in order to obtain
further information regarding the War Appropriation Bill. Up to the present we have heard
from Mr. Abbott, Under-Secretary of the Department of Finance, and his officials, and also
from the Department of National Defence. It
is proposed that to-morrow we should hear
from the Hon. Mr. Power, Minister of
Defence for Air, and his officials, and Hon.
Mr. Macdonald and the officials of the Naval
Service. Further, if the members of the committee find it convenient, I think the committee should sit to-morrow afternoon, after
the House rises, and hear Hon. Mr. Howe, the
Minister of Munitions and Supply. I am going
to suggest also that if we continue on Thursday morning, we couid, I believe, hear from
the repiesentatives of the Departments of
Agriculture and Labour. If we carry on in
that way we shall by the end of the week have
fairly well covered the committee's work on
the War Appropriation Bill.
J would move that the Senate do now
adjourn.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Is it the intention
to sit on the first of July?
Hon. Mr. KING: The House of Commons
is to sit on the first of July, but I do not think
we shall be in session.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Could the honourable leader of the Government give uý some
information as to whether the adjournment
will be a long one or just until next Tuesday?
Hon. Mr. KING: I am not prepared to speak
definitely to-night, but in view of the resolution of which I have given notice, and of the
necessity for fairly prompt action, I think we
probably should meet on Tuesday of next
week. I will advise you definitely to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: May I ask, then, are
we likely to adjourn to-morrow?

NATIONAL

HARBOURS BOARD

INQUIRY FOR RETURN

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. W. E. FOSTER: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are called I
should like to ask the honourable leader of
the Government to inquire as to when we
may expect the report of the National Harbours Board to be laid on the Table of this
House. I think that last year, although I
obtained a copy, the report did not make
any appearance here. The board, which is a
very important one and performs important
functions, was appointed in 1936 in a rather
experimental way. With the report one would
have an opportunity to find out from the
figures presented whether or jiot the board
has made progress and accomplished the purposes for which it was appointed. Therefore
I should like inquiry to be made with respect
to the report.
Hon. Mr. KING: I shall make inquiry of
the Minister and endeavour to have the report tabled within the next few days.
GRAIN STORAGE IN PRAIRIE
PROVINCES
DISCUSSION

On fle Orders of the Day:
Hon. W. M. ASELTINE: Honourable
senators, before the Orders of the Day are
called I should like to bring to the attention
of the Senate a very important matter. I
have discussed this briefly with the honourable
leader of the House (Hon. Mr. King), who
stated there was no objection to bringing it
up at this time, as we are probably faced
with another short adjournment. I have a
question or two to ask of the Government,
and these questions have to do with the
matter of grain storage in the Prairie Provinces. I do not expect the honourable leader
to answer the questions at this time, but
perhaps at a little later date, as soon as possible, he will make a statement with regard
to this important matter. I intended to bring
it up before our hast adjournment, but I
thought it better to see first what the crops
in Western Canada were like.

JUNE 30, 194328
On my last trip west 1 found that in spite of
the great wheat acreage reduction, a magnificent crop was growing. The district from east
of Winnipeg right througb to, the city of
Saskatoon and farther west is as green and nice
as I have ever seen it. There is some crop
damage in Manitoba, due Vo excess moisture,
but generally speaking the conditions are very
good, and I arn looking for a wheat crop of
between three and four hundred million
bushels. Now, something should be dtne s0
that that crop will be saved. The honourable
senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae),
who sits in front of me, stated when he was
last here that on his last trip Vo New York he
found, in talking Vo people who seemed to
know, that there was going to, be a great need
for wheat before the war was over.
In addition to the wheat crop there is a
magnificent crop of flax growing. Now, flax is
a diffcult crop Vo store. You cannot store it
outside on the ground, or in open bina, or
under wheat or oat sheaves. I do not believe
the Wheat Board will be able Vo take the
whole crop at once, and therefore some provision will have to be made for stoning the
surplus. The present storage position is just
this. We all know that the Wheat Board
released a quota of fifteen bushels per basic
acre noV long ago. Farmers who live close to
the elevators were able Vo get out their whole
flfteen bushels, but thousands of farmers could
geV out only seven, eight or ten bushels, because the elevators and annexes were full. On
one of my farms where there is a basic acreage
of 400 acres I have been able Vo take out only
seven bushels to the acre. This means that
for the remaining eight bushels to the acre, or
3,200 bushels, there is noV the slightest prospect of storage facilities. 1 do not know where
we can store the present crop when it matures,
unless we geV lumber Vo build additional bins.
A few years ago, when we had a bumper wheat
crop, the elevator companies in the Prairie
Provinces built annexes to take care of the
surplus. Those annexes have proved very useful, but to-day they, as well as the elevators,
are full. If the Government would authorize
the elevator companies Vo build more annexes,
those would be a partial solution of the storage
problem. On the occasion to which I have
referred, the elevator companies were allowed
Vo write off the cost of the annexes over a
period of two years. The building of ad-ditional
annexes depends, of course, on an adequate
supply of lumber.
I should like Vo put these two questions to
the honourable leader opposite. First, has the
Governient laid down any policy with regard
Vo allowing the elevator companies to build

more annexes? Second, has the Government
made any arrangement for the release Vo the
farmers of the Prairie Provinces of lumber
with which Vo build additional. granaries and
bina for storing their wheat and flax? Just
before I left home Vo come here a local
lumberman advised me that three million feet
of lumber had been released for the purpose.
Hon. Mr. KING: Three million feet for
what area?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I understood that
was for Saskatchewan. Three million feet represent about one carload for each lumber yard
in the Prairie Provinces. A carload would
noV supply sufficient lumber Vo build the
number of granaries necessary for the storage
of wheat in the Rosetown area alone, and
would be similarly inadequate to, meet other
local requirements throughout the province of
Saskatchewan. I do not know much about
the elevator business, but several senators are
familiar with it and no doubt can tell us what
preparations the big elevator companies are
making for the storage of this year's crop. If
the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mn.
King) could, when we meet again, furnish
satisfactory answers Vo my two questions he
would help Vo relieve the anxiety of the
farmers of Western Canada.
Hon. J. H. KING. Honourable members,
the matter which, the honourable gentleman
from West Central Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) has brought Vo our notice is of great
importance. I know that even. last year the
Government was much concerned about grain
storage fadilities, and no doubt the question
will become more acute this year. I amn sure
we share my honourable friend's hope that
there will be a generous wheat crop and that
it will be properly stored. I would not undertake at this time to, reply to his questions, but
I will bring them to the attention of the
Ministers concerned, and I expect to ha in a
position at our next meeting Vo give him the
information hie desires.

and, if I may say so, a little less of the viewpoint of the Government. I do not think
the Government has any right to suggest what
this House should or should not do. We should
calculate what is to be done, and should act
accordingly.
I shall be here on Tuesday. I admit that
I have been absent at times when this House
was sitting, but, as I say, with the short staffs
it is a struggle to carry on. I hope that
next winter a little more consideration will be
given to the convenience of the forty-eight
members of this House-one-half of its total
membership-4who live in the distant parts of
Canada. This is desirable, especially during
war-time, when we can be useful in our own

have any desire to criticize our work. Once
men and women understand the purpose and
object of the Senate in the system of Confederation there is no longer any question in
their minds. We all know what we are here
for. We are here not to represent popular
public opinion, but, to a degree, to resist
popular public opinion; and I think in the
long run our record will stand inspection. It
is for these reasons I suggest that next session
some such policy as I have outlined be
followed.
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators, the
question raised by my honourable friend is not
a new one; it has been before this body
frequently. So far as the work of this session
is concerned, an effort has been made, not only
by myself, but also by my honourable friend
opposite (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne), to meet the
convenience of the members. We have endeavoured to arrange the adjournments so that
honourable members would not be called back
unless there was business to be attended to.
I think yesterday was the only time we met
when there was not important business to be
done, and on the whole that is not a bad
record. We have been in session about six
months. The matters coming before Parliament have largely concerned the war. As the
honourable senator from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr.
Calder) so well said the other day,-this is not
an ordinary session of Parliament.
We are now reaching the end of the session,
and in all probability there will be an early
adjournment of the House of Gommons. This
being so, I am sure it is the desire of the
Senate to be in session and ready to discharge its duties as soon as legislation comes
from the other House.
It is thought advisable that we should meet
next Tuesday evening. My honourable friend
has suggested that we might move to-day the
resolution of which I gave notice last night.
That resolution deals with the redistribution

of electoral divisions throughout Canada, and
is therefore primarily a matter for the House
of Commons; but under our Constitution it is
necessary that a resolution of this kind come
from both Houses of Parliament, and that is
why I put it on the record last night. I think
that, properly, it should be debated in the
Commons first. For all we know, some amendments may be made to the resolution in that
Chamber, and I think it is advisable for us
to wait until the matter has been dealt with
there. I know it is the desire of the Prime
Minister and of the Government that the
resolution be put through at an early date,
because it must be sent to Westminster as the
basis -for a bill to be introduced into the
British Parliament.
As to the War Appropriation Bill, I do not
think the Prime Minister, or the leader of
the Opposition, or the leader of any other
party, could say when debate will cease. So
we as a group in this Chamber will have to
be guided by what we can learn and conclude
from our own observations as to the time
when we should meet. It is more or less a
guess. But, as I have said, we are approaching
the end of the session, and I think it would
be the desire of honourable senators that if
there is business next week we should be here
on Tuesday evening to attend to it. The
motion, which calls for our adjourning until
Tuesday evening, expresses the best judgment
I can give in the matter.
Hon. CREELMAN MacARTHUR: Honourable senators, we saw in the papers some
weeks ago considerable reference to the
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, and it
was stated that Manitoba wanted to come in
under tlat Act and be on a parity with
Saskatchewan and Alberta in this respect.
Honourable members will recall how strongly
the former leader of the other side in this
House, the Right Hon. Arthur Meighen, was
opposed to that Act on principle. I felt the
same way about it. However, we conceded
that in the circumstances existing some years
ago the Act might give Alberta and Saskatchewan a chance to get along a little better than
they could without it. But, as I say, that was
some years ago. Now we hear about the
bumper wheat crop in the West.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: The potato
crop too.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Yes. Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen pointed out that wheat farming
is different from other businesses, because it
is so uncertain. If you have one year's good
crop in four years in the West you are perfectly satisfied, and you, can make money.
Anyway, the farmer debtors and their creditors

most of the Western Provinces, and if it is
brought in under the Act, the first thing you
know, some people will be wanting to have
the Act extend down to the Maritimes again.
That is the danger, if you open the door.
We looked upon the Act as a temporary
measure, something to tide the farmers over
a difficult period, and thought that by this
time it would have died a natural death.
If it is going to be revived for Manitoba,
there will be another discussion, not only in
this House, but in the Commons as well. I
was talking to several members of that House
and they are pretty well divided on the proposal. Of course a lot of ther will speak in
favour of it, because they will be speaking for
their constituencies, and that will mean votes.
But we are more independent here, and we
shall discuss this thing more from the point of
view of its merits. So if the proposed extension is not killed in another place, it will
very likely be knocked out here. That is
my opinion.
My reason for referring to this now is to
say that I do not sec why a bill has not been
sent over here before this time, if one is
coming at all. If we had received that, we
should have had something to do. At least,
we should have had some interesting discussions. I want to be present when it comes
up, but I am not going to hurt myself to
get here again. I am not going to discard
my railway pass and make Sunday flights and
spend a lot of money to be here by a certain
time. A good many senators are fed up with
this kind of thing, and I am perhaps more
fed up with it than anyone else. I aë1 getting

POSTPONEMENT OF REDISTRIBUTION
RESOLUTION
Hon. J. H. KING rose to move:
That, whereas provisions of the British North
America Act require that, on the completion
of each decennial census, the representation of
the provinces in the House of Commons shall
be readjusted;
And whereas such readjustment involves in
fact the determination of the number of members 'to represent each province and the number
of electoral divisions within each province and
the delimitation of such electoral divisions;
And whereas Canada has been at war since
September 10, 1939, and hostilities may continue for an indefinite period;
And whereas the census of 1941 was taken
during the progress of hostilities;
And whereas the effect of enlistment in the
arnied forces of Canada and of employment in
the production of munitions of war has been
to remove large numbers of the population from
their homes to serve in and with such armed
forces either in other parts of Canada or overseas or to reside temporarily in other parts of
Canada;
And whereas experience bas shown that such
readjustment may give rise to sharp differences
of opinion as to the appropriate delimitation of
electoral divisions, which differences if is most
desirable to avoid while Canada continues at
war;
And whereas in these circumstances it does
not now seeni desirable that readjustment of
representation on the basis of the census of 1941
should have to be made during the continuance
of the hostilities in which Canada is now
engaged,
A humble address be presented te His Majesty
the King in the following words:
To the King's Most Excellent Majesty:
Most Gracions Sovereign:
We, Your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal
subjects, the Senate of Canada in Parliament
assembled, humbly approach Your Majesty,
praying that Yeu may graciously be pleased to
cause a measure to be laid before the Parliament
of the United Kingdom to be expressed as
follows:

An Act to provide for the readjustment of the
representation of the provinces in the House of

Comnions of Canada consequent on the decennial
census

taken in the ycar

One thousand

nine

hundred and forty-one.
Whereas the Senate and louse of Commons
of Canada in Parliament assenbled have submitted an address to His Majesty praying that
His Majesty may graciously be pleased to cause
a Bill te bc laid before the Parliament of the
United Kingdom for the enactnent of the provisions hereinafter set forth;
Be it therefore enacted by the King's Most
Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and
consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal,
and Commons, in this present Parliament
assembled, and by the authority of the same,
as follows:
1. Notwithstanding anything in the British
North Anerica Acts, 1867 to 1940, it shall not
lie necessary that the representation of the
provinces in the House of Commons be readjusted, in consequence of the completion of

JULY 6, 1943
the decennial census taken in the year One
thousand nine hundred and forty-one, until the
first session of the Parliament of Canada commencing after the cessation of hostilities between
Canada and the German Reich, the Kingdom of
Italy and the Empire of Japan.
2. This Act may be cited as the Bri.tish North
America Act, 1943, and the British North
America Acts, 1867 to 1940, the British North
America Act, 1907, and this Act may be cited
together as the British North America Acts,
1867 to 1943.
He said: Honourable senators, this resolutien is self-explanatory, for it gives the reason
why it is thought advisable that at this time
the Parliament of Canada should approach
His Majesty the King, praying that he may
be graciously pleased te cause a measure
to be laid before the Parliament of the
United Kingdom providing for an amendment te the British North America Act. This
follows the procedure laid down in the
Statute of Westminster, 1031.
In order that honourable members may be
reminded of this procedure, I propose te
place on Hansard the reference te the Statute
of Westminster which yesterday the Hon.
Minister of Justice gave te the other House.
He quoted the following from the preamble
of that statute:
it is in accord with the established constitutional position that no law hereafter made
by the Parliament of the United Kingdon shall
extend to any of the Dominions as part of the
law of that Dominion otherwise than at the
request and with th.e consent of that Dominion.
That is the reason for asking that this humble
address be presented to His Majesty at this
time. The Hon. Minister of Justice next
cited the enacting portion of the Statute of
Westminster:
No Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom
passed after the commencement of this Act shall
extend or be deemed to extend to a Dominion
as part of the law of .that Dominion unless it
is expressly declared in that Act that that
Dominion has requested, and consented to, the
enaetment thereof.
Then lie called attention to section 7, subsection 1, which reads as follows:
Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to apply
to the repeal, amendment or alteration of the
British North America Acts, 1867 to 1930, or
any order, rule or regulation made thereunder.
In other words, under the Statute of Westminster the Parliament of the United Kingdom does net iegislate in regard te matters
of concern te the Dominion except by our
consent and at our request. It follows that
in order to secure an amendment to the
British North America Act it is necessary
for the Parliament of Canada te make a
specific request as set out in this resolution.
There have been three amendments to the
British North America Act in the last twenty-

287

five years. In 1916 the Government of Sir
Robert Borden had the Act amended so that
the term of Parliarnent might be extended;
again, in 1930, the Act was amended so that
the natural resources might be transferred te
certain provinces; then, as yeu will remember,
in 1940, in connection with unemployment
insurance, an amendment was required in
order that the provincial-Dominion relationship might be ironed out.
As I have stated, the resolution before us
sets out quite clearly the why and the wherefore of the present proposal. It is understood
that after each decennial census, and before
the next general election, there must be a
redistribution of the representation in the
House of Commons. Under the set-up at
the time of Confederation Quebec was given
sixty-five seats, and that number was the
basis of calculation for the representation of
the other provinces. There have been certain
changes in that regard, te which I need net
refer to-night. When the last census was
taken, in 1941, Canada had been two years at
war; many of our men and women had gene
into the armed forces and been moved away
from their homes or places of residence, net
only te other parts of Canada, but also te
other parts of the world. In addition great
numbers of people migrated from the rural
districts te the urban centres in order that
tbey might give their services te Canada in
munition plants or engage in other war
services. This means that during the last
three te four years there has been a great
disturbance of population. If a Redistribution
Bill were brought in at this time the province
of Saskatchewan, for instance, would lose four
seats, the province of Manitoba would lose
three, and I have no doubt that other provinces
throughout Canada would be affected.
Redistribution is always a contentious
Formatter in the House of Commons.
tunately it comes only after each census. We
know that even in peace-time it takes many
days and much labour te settle this very
controversial question. In view of the great
change in population brought about by the
war, the Government has thought it unwise te
proceed at this time with a redistribution
measure, and yesterday a resolution brought
before the House of Commons for the purpose
of postponing such a measure was discussed
and passed with the support of al parties.
This resolution must be passed by both
Houses, and, inasmuch as we in this Chamber
are not personally or directly interested in
the matter of the elected representation in
Parliament, it seems te me that we could
very well concur at this time in the decision
already made in the elected Chamber.

SENATE

Perhaps ordinarily this would be an occasion
for a very profitable and useful debate in the
Senate on the matter of the British North
America Act, its application t us and our
relationship to the British Crown. But we are
at war to-day, and the House of Commons,
having in its judgment deemed it wise net to
proceed with redistribution, has asked that a
resolution be sent to His Majesty requesting
him to arrange to have introduced in the
Parliament of the United Kingdom a Bill
allowing us to forgo redistribution at this
time.
Personally, I cannot see that any great
advantage would be gained by the extension of
my remarks. The proposition is a simple one,
which comes to us from the elective Chamber,
and I think that in all probability-in fact, I
am satisfied-it will be concurred in by this
Chamber.
I should add that a time factor is involved.
Parliament is nearing the close of this session.
That is, an adjournment should take place
within a reasonable number of days. This
resolution will have to be sent to England, and
a bill will have to be presented to the British
House of Commons and to the Lords. So I
would ask that we proceed as rapidly as possible and net delay what really, so far as those
directly interested in redistribution are concerned, is an urgent matter.
I have no further remarks to make. I take
pleasure in moving concurrence in this
resolution.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, my only object in rising is to ask
whether the honourable leader (Hon. Mr.
King) would be good enough to lay on the
Table of this Chamber the protests and other
correspondence that have passed between the
Quebec and Ottawa governments in regard to
this resolution and the petition to His Majesty
that a bill be presented to the Imperial Parliament to make the change that the honourable
leader has outlined in considerable detail. All
I know about the Quebec situation is what I
have read in the Press. I understand that the
Quebec Government passed a unanimous petition te the Federal Government opposing this
resolution and the petition to His Majesty,
and that the Prime Minister of Quebec said
that on behalf of his Government he had
lodged a protest. I think it might be well for
the honourable leader to lay the correspondence on the Table.
Hon. Mr. KING: In reply to my honourable
friend, may I say that I shall be glad to
make inquiry. He will understand that tabling
of correspondence of that character would
Hon. Mr. KING.

require the consent of the governments concerned. I shall bring the matter to the attention of the Government, and if correspondence
is available I shall be glad to bring it down.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable senators, I crave the attention of this House for
only a few minutes. I should have very much
preferred to keep my seat. However, in my
humble opinion, this is a very serious motion.
I know it comes to us under very plausible
colours. I do not deny that. No doubt there
is merit in the purpose in view. That I do not
discuss. However, if one reflects, the conclusion imposes itself that this is one of the most
important measures that can be adopted by
the Senate.
The purpose of this resolution is to obtain
an amendment to the British North America
Act. This in itself is a very serious matter.
Everybody knows that the Constitution of
our country is a, contract sanctioned by a law
of the British Parliament. It is none the less
a contract. That contract was made in the
first instance on the basis of the representatien of each province in a Federal Parliament.
Without it, I think I can affirrm positively,
there would be no confederation at all. I
know that the province of Quebec gave its
consent, and rightly se, as it was a minority,
on the express condition that its representation
in the Federal Parliament should be such as
was determined at that time, and that it
should never vary except with the express
consent of the province. That, it seems to
me, would appear logical to everybody. I
we had to negotiate to-day the Confederation
of 1867. we would (1o no less. Everybody in
this House understands what might have happened if such rigid articles fixing the rights of
the province of Quebec had not existed.
Now, what are we doing? We are amending the Constitution of the country. That is
serious. But far more dangerous is the fact
that we are making an amendment that
affects the representation of the different
provinces as agreed' upon by the Fathers of
Confederation.
Hon. Mr. KING:

Only delaying.

Hon. Mr. HOWARD:
Hon. Mr. KING:

Only deferring.

That is all.

Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: I am coming to
that. But what I am saying now is that we
are amending the British North America Act.
If elections took place to-day, the relative
influence of the provinces in Parliament
might be very seriously modified. That, in
my opinion, is a very wrong proceeding, and
a very dangerous one to accept.

JULY 6, 1943
Now, the Parliament of Canada bas not
before it the consent of the provinces to the
proposed amendment. I understand, though
I do not know, that, on the contrary, the
Government of the province of Quebec bas
expressed refusal to accept it. Honourable
senators, everybody must admit that the
province of Quebec would be more clearly
and seriously affected by the amendment
than any other province in the country. But
let that go by the board. I do not want to
labour the argument; I lay it before yor.
The first duty of the Senate is to protect the
Constitution, and its second duty is to protect
the minority. I rise now in the naine of the
French minority of the Dominion, and I ask
that, as you are in duty bound, you will protect that minority.
My honourable friend bas said that the
only effect of this amendment is to postpone
a redistribution. I am not going to insist
upon this point. We may -or we may noit
have an election. I do not know. That is
in the lap of the gods and of the Government. Let that question go. What I fear is
that we are now creating a precedent.
Honourable senators, in the practice and interpretation of our parliamentary law we
follow very closely in the footsteps of Great
Britain. The practice of that country, unlike
ours, is not based on a written constitution.
Yet we follow that practice so closely that the
powers of this House have been seriously
affected by one precedent, and perhaps by
others. We have the right, undeniably, to
amend any money measure in this House.
We had opinions by Geoffrion, Tilley and
Lafleur-three more brilliant lawyers could
not be found in the country-and we had
an excellent speech on the subject by the
late lamented Senator Ross, and they all
admitted that according to our Constitution
we had the right to amend money measures.
Will anybody here deny that that right bas
gone by the board? Where is the senator
in this House who would rise and, ask for an
amendment to a money measure? Since I
have been in this House-that means a great
many years, no fewer than twenty-eight-I
have seen not only no proposal to that effect,
but not even any allusion to it. That power
is gone, by desuetude, and will never return
to this House.
For the purpose of having our Constitution
amended in the matter of electoral representation we are now taking a step which,
though probably only a temporary measure,
relates to the most important part of the
Constitution from the point of view of
minorities. If there is one thing more than
another that we, representing minorities, must
72542-19

289

defend, it is undoubtedly their electoral representation. Interference with this particular
may seriously affect the influence of one
province or of several provinces in determining the adoption or rejection of legislation.
Electoral representation goes to the very
selection of the Government, and this selection in turn may in certain circumstances
decide whether there is to be a declaration
of war or of peace.
Therefore nothing can be of more serious
import to the Dominion than this resolution.
I am not offering any factious obstruction. I
understand why the Government is asking for
this resolution, and I have a great deal of
sympathy for the reasons urged in its support.
Large numbers of people have been moved by
the great, powerful hand of war and of necessity, and moved not always for their own
profit or benefit. Members of Parliament have
been powerless to protect themselves or their
constituents against , these movements.
I
sympathize with those who have been affected
by these movements, and I would not rise now
had it not been that we in this House are in
duty bound to see that the purpose of this
resolution shaIlh not constitute a precedent. I
believe that if the Senate puts its authority
behind a declaration to this effect, we shall be
fairly safe against the proposed amendment of
the Constitution being cited in the future as a
precedent. I trust that this House will agree
with me that it should do so, for such a declaration would not impede the passage of the
resolution. Members of the Government themselves say that the proposed amendment is an
exceptional step compelled by the war. Then
why should we not declare that the proposed
amendment of the British North America Act
shall not create a precedent that might be
cited, not only against Quebec, but against any
of ber sister provinces?-for they are aill equally interested in this safeguard. We never know
what the future holds in store for us in whatever province we may live, and I submit that
the people of every province are equally interested in seeing that a contract made by our
forefathers be fully respected and not exposed
in the future to any amendment advocated on
the strength of this resolution, which, as we
have been informed, and as we appreciate, is
brought forward under very exceptional conditions. Although I do not approve of this
proposed resolution, I understand the reason
why it is put forward, and on the grounds I
have stated I would urge the honourable leader
of this House to embody in the resolution a
reservation that will make it clear to everybody, and particularly to the minority that I
represent in the province of Quebec, that we

'n the Parliament of Canada will keep faith

menacedHon. DONALD MacLENNAN: May I ask
a question?
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: I am about to
finish, if my honourable friend will be patient
for another two seconds.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: I need to be.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: -that their rights
shall not in the future be exposed to encroachment, but shall be fully preserved. Now I am
ready to answer my honourable friend, if I can.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: How does the
resolution affect Quebec more than any other
province of the Dominion?
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: It affects every
minority in the country; and we in the
province of Quebec, though perhaps my honourable friend does not know it, represent the
most important minority in the country.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: Minority? I do
not understand why the honourable senator
calls Quebec a minority. A minority of what?
I thought that according to the results of the
last election they were in the majority.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Is that a question
or a double-barrelled retort? Of course, my
honourable friend knows his history well
enough to put a different interpretation on
my words. If he does not, I can show him in
the Library a few books of history which
should convince him that the province of
Quebec, populated by the French race, has
always been, before as well as since Confederation, a minority in this country. It is not
only a question of language; it is also a
question of law and of religion; and nothing
could mark a minority more clearly. After
consultation perhaps my honourabl'e friend
wili have another question to put to me, and
I shall endeavour to answer it to the best of
my ability.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: Honourable senators, as I understand this resolution, it does
not seem to me that minorities in the
Dominion will be any worse off next month
than they are now. What in the world is
protecting Quebec at the present moment,
and what has protected her in the last ten
years? The honourable senator knows the
answer, but it would appear from his remarks
that if this resolution is passed something
extraordinary will happen to Quebec. As the
honourable leader of the House truly implied
a short time ago, there is nothing to be afraid
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

of as a result of the amendment to the British
North America Act to be effected by the
passing of this resolution. Statutes are subject
to amendment at any time. I have often
heard members of Parliament say, "This
amendment will destroy the principle of the
Act."
I infer from what the honourable
senator has said that he believes this resolution will destroy the principle of the British
North America Act.
The British North
America Act created the principle, and if that
Act is amended, the amendment may create a
new principle which may be just as important
as the original one. There is nothing sacrosanct about a statute. As I said before, a
statute is liable to be amended at any time.
It is the business of the Senate to see to it
that no legislation be enacted that would be
inimical to any part of the Dominion; but I
fail to sec that the proposed amendment
could be, and if I thought it would be I for
one would not vote for it. I would reiterate
that, as the honourable leader said, the
effect of the resolution is simply to defer the
passage of a redistribution bill for possibly a
year or maybe two years. What in the world
is going to happen in the meantinm to the
prejudice of any part of this Dominion? J
fail to sec any danger, and I really cannot
understand the reason for the honourable
gentleman's utterance, declaimed in so dramatic a manner. The purpose of this resolution
is to effect a simple amendment of the
British North America Act in regard to redistribution, and no amount of verbal pyrotechnies can make it anything else.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, as a senator from one of the provinces
affected by this proposed resolution, I think in
fairness to the Government I should say that
its purpose is both reasonable and necessary,
and I congratulate the Government on the
proposal, not only because of its fairness to the
two provinces, the number of whose electors
has been reduced by war conditions, but also
because I think it is beyond the ken of man to
say what would happen if at this time a
redistribution bill were introduced in the House
of Commons, for I know from experience in
the Legislature of Manitoba that redistribution will stir up more feeling than any other
subject of legislation.
I appreciate the position of the honourable
senator from Montarville (Hon. C. P. Beaubien), but I must say quite candidly that there
is a wide difference of opinion as to whether
Confederation is a contract in itself or simply
the confirming of a contract. I do not intend
to discuss the matter now further than to say

JULY 6, 1943
that his contention that Confederation is a
contract should not be accepted as conclusive.
In short, I challenge his statement without
debating it. I have grave doubts that Confederation is a contract.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: It is a convention.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It may be a convention.
But as my honourable friend on the other side
said, the legislation speaks for itself. It was
approved by the Parliament of Canada and
acted on.
When, however, the honourable senator from
Montarville says that this Senate was established by the British North America Act for
certain purposes, he is undoubtedly on solid
ground. The first purpose of the Senate is to
protect the Constitution. Its second purpose
is to protect miaorites, whether of language,
religion, finance, or anything else. There is no
doubt about that. In fact, we are to go further
than that; we are to prevent hasty legislation,
passed by the elected body, about which the
electors might not be very enthusiastic after
they had had time to cool off. That is one of
our prime duties. Sir John A. Macdonald
emphasized that-and I think that distinguished
statesman had more than a little vision and
common sense. He said there might come a
day when the popular body would, want to deal
with property rights and in so doing would
take away the rights of certain people, and he
expressed the opinion that the Senate would be
very useful in preventing or deferring such
action. You will remember that about 1934 the
province of Alberta elected a certain party to
power. The apparent reason for so doing was
that it was going to manipulate money in a
way that would be beneficial to the people of
the province; but those who lived as close to
that province as we in Manitoba do knew that
the real cause for the election of that party
was the dissatisfaction of the people with
things as they were, and the belief that, no
matter who were elected, conditions could not
be worse. They voted to get rid of a situation.
But if such a wave were to pass over the
Dominion, and the Government elected were
to introduce legislation similar to that introduced in Alberta, we as a Senate, I think,
should have a right to hold up the legislation
and let the Government go back to the people
on the issue. If the people confirmed what had
been done, of course we should have to defer
to their wishes.
Let me illustrate what I mean. In 1935 this
country 'was confronted with a grave railway
problem. The Government railway was piling
up huge deficits and the other railway was
72542-19j

experiencing many difficulties. In October of
that year there was an election, and among
other planks in the Liberal platform there was
a promise that if the Liberals were returned
to power they would do something towards
so'ving the problem. They were returned,
and in 1936, in accordance. with their pledge,
they introduced legislation into this Parliament. At that time a majority of the
members of the Senate sat on this side of the
House. Some of them thought this legislation
should be rejected. I was not one of them,
and I supported the Government. Why?
Because the question had been properly and
completely submitted to the public. who bad
formed a judgment on it, and in my opinion
we had no right to reject their view. What
we are here for is to protect the people, and,.
if necessary, to reject hasty legislation.
Any practising lawyer in this country who,
lias appeared before our Banking and Commerce Committee will tell you that it is one
of the finest committees he bas ever addressed;
that in it there is little of politics, but much
of an endeavour to produce the best legislation possible on the subject under consideration.
I agree with the honourable senator fronr
Montarville (Hon. C. P. Beaubien) that the
Senate had the power to amend money bills.
He says, however, we have lost that power.
In that I do not agree. We have not exercised
the power, perhaps, but I do not think. we
have lost it. But, as I say, since 1939 very
little legislation bas come before us. The
truth is that of late neither House bas had
very much. Take this session for instance.
How much legislation bas come to us from
the other Chamber? Though itis none of my
business and it is not for me to say anything
about it, for nine weeks the members of that
Chamber have been considering one bill and
discussing how the moneys provided by it are
to be spent. But we are not supposed to go
into that kind of thing.
Now, I have a suggestion to make to this
House. After the war we shall pass through
the greatest period of reconstruction this world
bas ever known. I doubt if in this country we
shal go as far as the optimists hope we shall,
but I think we shall go farther than the pessimists expect. What I have to suggest comes
strictly under the amendment of the British
North America Act. It is that at the beginning of next session we should appoint a'committee of, say, forty members-ten each from
the Maritimes, Quebee, Ontario and the Western Provinces-to discuss what amendments
are needed in the British North America Act

SENATE

or any of its principles to make our efforts at
reconstruction effective. Take for instance the
problems of health insurance, social reconstruction, the re-îmployment of soldiers and the reemnployment of industrial workers. All these
have to be handled by the Dominion. The
premier of the province of Manitoba, a very
able man on financial matters, lias said quite
clearly to the people who are going te reconstruet the world after the war that Manitoba
lias not sufficient earning power to take part in
that reconstruction. If the burden is put on
the provinces, there are only two that can
bear it; the other seven cannot put up their
share. Wiat happened as a result of unemployment relief? Almost every city in Canada
was nearly ruined by it; and every province
except the two larger provinces'; and even they
were affected. The Dominion alone could take
a position on that question.
I suggest that a committec be formed to consider this question and say, if we want to
put health insurance or an employment sceme
into effect, what amendments to the British
North America Act are needed in order to
do so. After we have reached our conclusion,
lot us invite the governments or the people of
all the provinces to come here and, make

would be donc would be of no lega] effect.
Maybe not, but it would have a great effect in
clarifying the ideas of the people in this country on these issues. There is no use in saying
that every man who comes back frorn the war
is going to be given a job, and then leaving
the burden on the provinces. Manitoba for
one could not as-urne any such iresponsibility;
iieither could the Maiitimnes, nor British
Columbia, nor tlie other two Western prov.could do so
inces. The only provinces tat
would be the two central provinces.
I want to say to the honourable senator
from Montarville (Hon. C. P. Beaubien) that
although le may think the people of bis
province represent a minority, they do not.
The people of bis province and those of
Ontario represent a majority; we of the
Western Provinces and of the Maritimes are
the minority. While politicians may talk
about minorities, and say the French-speaking people are a minority in Canada, it is
mostly in their imaginations that the minority exists. They are net a minority when
it comes to money. Therefore I say that we.
as part of the Parliament of Canada, should
investigate this problem. There would be
no political repercussions from the provinces
if we proposed that unemployment, for instance, should be dealt with by the Dominion.
I do net know where I should look to find a

body of men and women wlio would deal
more fairly with the question than the members of this Honse.
This question must be solved before we
can put an*y of our idealistie legislation into
effect. Not one of the provinces of Alberta,
Saskatchewan, BPriiisi Columbia or the Maritine Provinces could carry out any of the
schemes which have been proposed before
the various reconstruction connittees of Parliaient this session. We have in this Chamber representatives from every walk in life.
We have business mîen-suicessfuil business
men-we have womnic, professional men and
farmers, and I am persuaded that if we gave
consideration to this question we should make
a real contribution to the political thought
of this country.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE:

Is there

any anmiend-

Hon. Mi. HAIG: Not yet. As I come from
tlie province of Manitoba, it is liardly to be
expected tliat I would propose an amendment. I should hardly be foolish enough
to do that.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE:

May I interject that

we are more interested

<lo at this session.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
I would inform my
ionourable friend that tis
session is nearly

over. I expect tlat we shall finish at the
latest hy the 24tl of this maonth. I think the
political discussions in the other House have
been long enougli, and if the people of this
country are not tired of them, they ought
to be.
I come back once more te my proposal. I
ask honourable members to consider it between now and next session. If the men and
women in this H.ouse are of one mind, there
will be no political repercussions fron such
action. There cannot be. The members of
the committee will be chosen by divisions;
each division represented in this House will
be represented on the committee; therefore
there should be no unfairness to Ontario or
Quebec, and only fairness to the Western
Provinces and the Maritimes.
I am going to support the resolution before
the House.
I think the Government bas
acted wisely. I believe that in the other House
representatives from every province voted for
the legislation. The Western Provinces are
small so far as population is concerned, but
they have made a great contribution to the
war effort. I presume the same can be said
of the Maritime Provinces. In Manitoba we
have very little war industry. Net only did

JULY 6,1943
a great many of our people go into the armed
services, but a great many others moved to
Ontario and Quebec to become industrial
workers. Large numbers of these people may
come back. On the other hand, we may
have permanently lost that population. I do
not kno-w. If it is lost to us, we shall have
to suffer accordingly. In voting for this resolution, I am not doing so to hurt any minority.
So far as I am concerned, if in the future
we have before us any measure that appears
to me ta be unfair to Quebec or any other
part of Canada, I shall be the last one to
vote for it, because we shall never get a united
Canada if we pass unfair legislation. But I
think that this resolution is fair, and we
ought to support it.
Hon. ANTOINE J. LEGER: Honourable
senators, I may say at the outset that I wish
ta make only a very few remarks with regard
ta this resolution. Unlike the two last preceding speakers, I come from a province that
would not be affected by the proposed amendment, for New Brunswick now has the minimum representation to which it is entitled
under the British North America Act, and,
that would not be changed.
The resolution states that
. . . the effect of enlistment in the armed forces
of Canada and of employment in the production
of munitions of war has been to remove large
numbers of the population from their homes to
serve in and with such armed forces either 1n
other parts of Canada or overseas or to reside
temporarily in other parts of Canada.
Now, I cannot follow the reasoning of the
honourable senator who last preceded me
(Hon. Mr. Haig). I do not see how the
requested amendment could possibly protect
his province, because if hostilities should cease
to-morrow the redistribution, according to
this resolution, would still be made on the
basis of a war census, that is on the census

redistribution should be made on the basis of
a new census, taken when conditions have
become normal, and also that we should fix a
date when this proposed amendment would
cease to be operative. The Bill that we want
the Imperial Parliament to pass provides that
redistribution shall not be necessary "until
the first session of Parliament of Canada commencing after the cessation of hostilities."
Does that mean that if hostilities did not cease
for twenty years there would be no new redistribution in all that time, and that elections
would continue to be held on the basis of the
census of 1931?
Some Hon. SENATORS: 1941.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: No; the census of 1931.
I am not suggesting that will happen, but it
is permissible under this proposed amendment,
and it could happen. That is, if the Government did not have the courage to hold an
election under the census of 1941, it could
happen.
These are things which, it seems to me,
should have been taken care of in the resolution. In the first place, if we want to correct
a defect which arises because of the census of
1941, it seems to me that we should provide
there shall be a new census as the basis of
the next redistribution. My second point is
that we should fix a definite date when the
proposed amendment would cease to be operative, and not have such an indefinite time
limit as "the cessation of hostilities between
Canada and the Germnan Reich; the Kingdom
of Italy and the Empire of Japan," which hostilities might last-though I hope they wihl
not-for a number of years.

this, that the province of Quebec should
always have 65 scats in the House of Commons, and that the quotient obtained by
dividing its population by that number, 65,
would apply in every other province as the
average number of persons entitled to be
represented by one meumber of Pailiaient.
That was the agreement. All I want is to
have that agreement maintained.
But it
happens tîat the agreement is not maintained
now. Some provinces have a certain number
of members of Parliament which, according
to that quotient, they should not have. That
is the whole position.
The burden of mv argument was simply
that this amendment to the Constitution
should not constitute a precedent. That was
the whole gist of my point. It secms a very
Teasonable point to take.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
vote for it, anyway.

Oh, well, let us

Hon. S. A. HAYDEN: Honourable senators,
may I say just a word or two by way of
explanation as to why I intend to support this
resolution? It seems to me that in order to
preserve a sense of proportion it would bu
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

wise to consider just what the issue is.
Actually, if redistribution were carried out at
this time under the provisions of the British
North America Act, seven seats would be
involved. Saskatchewan would lose four seats,
and Manitoba would lose three. According to
the provisions and requirements of the British
North America Act, there would be no change
in the other provinces.
Now, se far as I am concerned, the position
is simply this, that having swallowed a number
of large things in the way of restrictions of
our legislative powers, I am certainly prepared
to swallow this very small one, whose only
effect is that we suspend for the duration the
provision in the British North America Act
requiring a redistribution at this time, based
on the 1941 census. The resolution will not
make a very great difference, but I think it
does indicate, if anything, a desire to preserve
the position of minorities, certainly in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, until a better and
more reasonable time for the discussion which
would inevitably result from a redistribution
measure just now. As I said earlier, having
swallowed so many great things, I will net
object te this small one. For instance, we
having, under the War Measures Act, more
or less abrogated our legislative functions;
having in effect suspended, for the duration,
provincial powers with respect to properties
and civil rights; and, in the interest of the
successful prosecution of the war and maintenance of unity, having even permitted
amendments to be made to our Criminal Code
by persons who are not members of Parliament, then I for one find no difficulty whatever in accepting a resolution which simply
suspends for the duration of the war. but
does net abrogate, the provisions of certain
sections of the British North America Act.
Hon. Sir THOMAS CHAPAIS (Translatien) : Honourablo
eators. I excceedingly
regret to infliet on the majority of the memhers of this Hous.e the French language, which
predominates in the province of Quebec. I
do not intend to deal at anv great length with
the serious matter that is now before us; I
should rather say the very serious matter.
Indeed, as my honourable friend from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) has said. it is one
of the most serious questions which we have
had to consider since the beginning of this
session.
I wish to go on record as being opposed to
the proposal which has been submitted to us
this evening by the honourable leader of the
Senate, on behalf of the Government which he
represents in this House.

JULY 6, 1943
The'question that is raised by the resolution
laid before us is that we should go to London
with a request for an Imperial enactment for
the settlement of a matter which to me seems
quite simple. Such action is fraught with
particular seriousness, and I should like, in the
few words I have to say, to impress that fact
upon all my honourable colleagues.
The matter involved is the representation
on the basis of population. Honourable members of the Senate, you know as well as I do
that this question was for a number of years
the stumbling-block of parliamentary government in Canada. I refer to the period which
preceded Confederation, that is to say, the
period of union between Upper and Lower
Canada. During that period, and for about
fifteen years at least, the two provinces had
been united by a more or less legitimate
marriage, to which the parties themselves had
scarcely given their consent, as we had to
put up with the Imperial legislation foisted on
us by that Constitution, and we went along
side by side until 1867. During that very
interesting period of our political life we
began to lay the foundations upon which
Canada was subsequently to be established.
Aside from questions concerning railroads,
canals, tariffs, etc., there was this terrible
question of representation on the basis of
population. Why terrible? Because, in 1840,
when the Imperial Parliament gave us the

the lower province, however, the question of
representation on the basis of population was
immediately raised. A man whose name remains graven in Canadian history, a man who
had his failings, but also his good pointe,
George Brown, took up this question of representation on the basis of population and made
it a foremost issue. He mounted that cheval
de bataille, and for years fought with unparalleled tenacity so that this doctrine of
representation on the basis of population might
triumph. My province, which had suffered
unfair treatment, and its political representatives of the time, opposed this movement
initiated by Upper Canada. For years there
was what might be termed a relentless battle,
and for years governments fell, one after another, overthrown precisely because they
hurled themselves against this stumbling-block
of representation on the basis of population.
There came a time when the Constitution 6f
1840 could no longer operate; when the inability of all parties to form a stable government gave rise to an insoluble problem. People
felt that the Gonstitution should be changed.
They said: "For heaven's sake let us try to
come to some understanding; instead of preserving this stormy union between Lower and
Upper Canada let us try to have a Confederation. Let us ask Nova Scotia, Prince Edward
Island and New Brunswick to join us and form
a great country." At the time it was even

Constitution which I mentioned a while ago, it

name of Kingdom of Canada; but in the end
we were satisfied with the more humble name
of Dominion of Canada.
Now, this is what I should like to recall to
the honourable members of the Senate.
What happened? The question of representation on the basis of population had first
to be settled. The constituents of 1864,
assembled in the ancient city of Quebec, agreed
on a compromise. A while ago it was asked
whether the Constitution which governs us is
the result of a contract. Good heavens, I
have no authority whatsoever to render a
decision on such a question, but I refer to the
opinion of those who drew up the Confederation, of those who have been called the
"Fathers of the Confederation of 1867." What
did they say? Look up the Debates on

was decreed that Lower Canada and Upper
Canada should have the same number of representatives in the Legislature.
Now, when the union had been brought

about, the Province of Quebec had 200,000
more inhabitants than the Province of
Ontario-Upper Canada at the time. Such
an arrangement was evidently unfair to the

province of Lower Canada. At that time representation was certainly not determined on

the basis of population. But what happened?
British immigrants gradually peopled the soli-

tude of the upper province, and its population

This population gained
increased rapidly.
ground very quickly, and there came a time
when the difference of 200,000 inhabitants

formerly in favour of Lower Canada was transferred to Upper Canada, and the population of
the upper province by far outnumbered that
of the lower province. Then the question of
representation on the basis of population was
brought up.
For years Lower Canada had suffered from
this lack of proportion; it fhad suffered and
could do nothing about it. When the population of the upper province exceeded that of

suggested to give this country the very glorious

Confederation, which you will

find

in the

Parliamentary Library: you will see that the
illustrious

statesman

Sir

John

Macdonald,

George Brown the Ontario leader, McGee, one
of Canada's greatest orators-all these men
state, one after the other, that the Constitu-

tion which had been drawn up was really a
contract. McGee said: "What we have there,

296

SENATE

on the Clerk's table, is a contract." And the
purpose of this contract was te establish the
Dominion of Canada. How should this system operate, however, with regard to parliamentary representation? Honourable senators,
you know it as well as I do. The agreement
was the following: "We will use the province
of Quebec as a basis, or better 'still, as a
pivot. It shall always have the same number
of representatives-65; we will then divide
the number of its actual population by 65,
and the quotient shall become the unit of representation for the entire Dominion of Canada. That shall be the basis of our parliamentary system. That is how our electoral regime
will operate. On the completion of each decennial census, the required calculations shall
be made, the population of the province of
Quebec shall be divided by 65, and the product,
the quotient, shall constitute the unit of representation for all the provinces of Canada."
Was this not a fair and reasonable solution?
What was the result? It was that after almost
every census a redistribution had to be
effected. You will recall that on the completion of each census there were changes in
the representation of the provinces, but
Quebec retained 65 members. There was one
decennial year, however, when the province
of Ontario lost three or four seats; I believe it
was after the 1921 census.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:

1921.

Hon. Sir THOMAS CHAPAIS: The province of Ontario, after the decennial census,
lost three or four representatives. Naturally,
it submitted, more or less unwillingly, but it
did submit. At other times other provinces lost
some of their representatives. That state of
things was normal. But why change it this
year? Because there bas been a large movement of population, because people from the
rural districts have thronged towards the
cities, because people have enlisted or secured
work in factories. But, honourable senators,
things will always be se. There was a period
when the Western Provinces were in their
infancy; then there was a flood of immigratien; these provinces developed by leaps and
bounds, they prospered and increased in population. That will happen again. You must
have been struck by what was said a while
ago. If this resolution should be adoptedand it will be-what will happen?
Is it
claimed that we shall be left as we are for
two, three, or four years? We all beseech
the Almighty that this war may be over as
soon as possible. We hope it will end in 1944,
but it might end in 1945, or later, and are we
to remain in this uncertain temporary condition
Hon. Sir THOMAS CHAPAIS.

all this time? In the face of movements of
population in the past, the Constitution was
net suspended.
After the great flow of
immigration we did net put a stop to redistribution. Is this measure a remedy?
If
the war is ended two years from now, and if
we should then decide it is time for redistribution, on what basis will it be donc? On
the 1941 census. We shall take the 1941
statistics and effect redistribution accordingly.
And then where shall we be? All these movements caused by enlistments, by the swollen
number of workers in war plants, etc., are
reflected in the 1941 census. This 1941 census
will remain the basis for any future readjustment. I therefore ask what is the use of
all this. Some provinces will lose a few seats.
I am sorry for that, but it has already
happened in Ontario without the Constitution
being amended on that account. These same
conditions will often recur and the wheel will
keep on revolving; the system inaugurated
in 1864 will keep on functioning normally and
the Canadian Constitution will net he needlessly amended.
Honourable senators, I only wished to call
the attention of the House to this aspect of
the matter. I consider this measure as being
useless and harmful, and I shall vote against
the resolution now before the House.
Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators,The Hon. the SPEAKER: I would draw
the attention of honourable members te the
fact that if the honourable leader now speaks
he will conclude the debate.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: I move adjournment of
the debate.
Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, I
hope my honourable friend will net insist on
his motion, for I think we should dispose of
the resolution to-night. Its subject-matter,
so far as we are concerned, is more or less
academic, since those directly interested, the
elected members of Parliament, have already
passed the resolution. Unless there is somne
very good reason, I would ask my honourable
friend net to press his motion.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Honourable
members, I do net agree with the honourable
leader opposite (Hon. Mr. King).
If any
honourable senator, whether on this or the
other side of the House, wishes to continue
the debate, there is no such great urgency
that he should net be allowed te do so. After
all this is a free Parliament, and a day or
two more devoted to a discussion of the
resolution will net make very much difference
one way or the other. I certainly would be

297

JULY 6, 1943
opposed to shutting off debate; on the contrary, I would allow every member to express
his opinions freely.
Hon. Mr. KING: I think my honourable
friend misapprehends what I said. I merely
suggested to the honourable member from
Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Sauvé) that lie withdraw
his motion unless he really desired to adjourn
the debate. In view of the urgency of the
resolution, I would ask the honourable gentleman not to press his motion, but if lie is in
earnest, of course I must give way.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: It is not so much a
question of time as of reaching a thorough
understanding of the point raised by the
resolution. I think it is very important that
the leader of the Government and other members of the Senate should read the speech
of our venerable friend from Grandville (Hon.
Sir Thomas Chapais) before continuing the
debate.

POSTPONEMENT OF REDISTRIBUTION
RESOLUTION ADOPTED
The Senate resumed from yesterday the de-

bate on the motion of Hon. Mr. King., seconded
by Hon. Mr. Hugessen:
That whereas provisions of the Britisi North
America Act require that, on the completion of
each decennial census, the representation of the

provinces in the House of Commons shall be
readjusted;
And whereas such readjustment involves in
fact the determination of the number of members to represent each province and the number
of electoral divisions within each province and
the delimitation of snclh electoral divisions;
And whereas Canada bas been at war since
September 10, 1939, and hostilities may continue
for an indefinite period;
And ivhereas the census of 1941 was taken
during the progress of hostilities;
And whereas the effect of enlistment in the
armed forces of Canada and of employment in
the production of munitions of war has been
to remove large nuitbers of the population from
their homes to serve in and with such armed
forces either in other parts of Canada or overseas or to reside temporarily in other parts of
Canada;
And whereas experience lias shown that such
readjustment may give rise to sharp differences
of opinion as to the appropriate delimitation of
electoral divisions, which differences it is most
desirable to avoid while Canada continues at
war;
And whereas in these circumstances it does
not now seem desirable that readjustment of
representation on the basis of the census of 1941
should have to be made during -the continuance
of the hostilities in which Canada is now
engaged,
lHon. Mr. ROBINSON.

A humble add-ress be presented to His Majesty
the King in the following words:
To the King's Most Excellent Majesty:

Most Gracions Sovereign:
We, Your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal
subjects, the Senate of Canada in Parliament
assembled, humbly approach Your Majesty,
praying that You may graciously be pleased to
cause a measure to be laid before the Parliament of the United Kingdom to be expressed
as foEllows:
An Act to provide for the readjustment of the
representation of the provinces in the House of

Commons of Canada consequenton the decennial

census taken in the year One thousand nine
hundred and forty-one.
Whereas the Sena-te and House of Commons
of Canada in Parliament assembled have submitted an address to His Majesty praying that
His Majesty may graciously be pleased to cause
a Bill to be laid before the Parliament of the
United Kingdom for the enactment of the provisions iereinafter set forth;
Be it therefore enacted by the King's Most
Excellent Majesty, by and witl, the advice and
consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal,
and Commons, in titis present Parliament
aisenbled, and by the authority of the same,
as follows:
1. Notwithstanding anything in the British
North America Acts, 1867 to 1940. it shall not
be necessary that the representation of tle
provinces in the House of Commons be readjusted, in conscquence of the completion of the
decennial census taken in the year One thousand
nîine hundred and forty-one, un.til the first
session of the Parliament of Canada conmencing
after the cessation of bostilities between Canada
and the German Reich, the Kingdom of Italy
and the Empire of Japan.
2. This Act may be cited as the British Noti

America Act, 1907, and this Art may be cited
togebter as the British Norti

Ainerica

Acts.

Hon. ARTHUR SAUVE: Honourable senators, I shall read the first two paragraphs of
the resolution.
That whereas provisions of the British North
Anerica Act require that, on the completion of
each decennial rensus, the reprosentation of the
provinces in the House of Commons shall be
readjtusted;
And whereas such readjustment involves in
fact the determination of the number of members te represent eacli province and the number
of electoral divisions within each province and
the delimitation of such electoral divisionsFor my part, there is no objection to these

paragraphs. Then, honourable senators, it is
a question of respecting the law of Confederation. It is the census-in the present case,
that of 1941-which determines the representation in the House of Commons, with Quebec
providing the quotient. Should an election
be held this year, or two years from now,
the census of 1941 and the Quebec quotient
must be the basis of the representation, unless

JULY 7, 1943
later on there is a further amendment te the
Act to change this manner of determining the
representation-and this is what I and many
of my compatriots fear. The door having
been opened, anything is possible. It is not
purely a question of determining whether the
British North America Act is a pact, a
convention, a treaty, a contrac-t or a compromise, but rather of respecting the provisions
thereof with reference to the federal representation, which provisions might affect the
rights and position of the minorities. In that
regard, I have been unable to accept the oldfashioned and strange argument of my honourable friend from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Haig), who is an able lawyer. It has always
been the opinion of the best minds in Canada
that our Constitution could not or should not
be amended without the consent of the
provinces.
I repeat that a change or modification in
the manner of determining the federal representation might injure the minorities. In
support of this assertion may I cite a few
extracts from the report made to the honourable the Speaker of the Senate of Canada in
the session of 1939, pursuant to resolution of
the Senate, by the then Parliamentary Counsel?
From page 130 of Annex No. 4 I read the
opinion of a former Minister of Justice, Hon.
Ernest Lapointe:
In order that adequate safeguard should be
provided it was proposed that in the event of
ordinary amendmedts being contemplated the
provincial legislatures should be consulted, and
a majority consent of the provinces obtained,
while in the event of vital and fundamental
amendments being sought iivolving such questions as provincial rights, the riglits of minorities, or rights generally affecting race, language,
and creed, the unanimous consent of the provinces should be obtained.
At page 132 there are some extracts from
Keith's Constitutional Law of the British
Dominions, edition of 1933.
Part 'of this
material is as follows:
In the extreme form it has been claimed
apparently by Mr. Ferguson, when Premier of
Ontario, that no change of importance can be
made without provincial consent; apparently
any great province, possibly any province, by
withholding assent could block change. This
view is based on the idea that the federal
bond is the result of a compact or treaty, a
terni which admittedly was often used in the
debates in the Canadian Legislature when that
body in 1865 approved the agreement achieved
with the Maritime Provinces in 1864. To this
view it is objected that in fact the Quebec agreement was never accepted by the legislatures of
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, and that in
fact in certain matters the Constitution prepared in 1864 was modified under Imperial
72542-201

299

auspices before enacted in 1867, while as regards the other provinces, especially those
created by the Dominion, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, any idea of a compact is
absurd. The most effective answer to this
contention is the fact that in 1907, when an
Imperial Act was passed to vary the then existing state of provincial subsidies from the federation, it was based on the assent of all the
provinces, for, wbile British Columbia demanded
better terms, its Premier did not refuse finally
to agree to the Act being passed. It is useless
to ignore the importance of this precedent,
whether it was wise to create it .or not.
Let me quote from a memorandum prepared by the then Premier of Ontario, Hon.
Howard Ferguson:
On the same subject, Sir E. P. Taché, Chairman of the Conference, said: "The majority of
the people believe if their rights and privileges
are left to the local legislatures they will be
safe in the liberties guaranteed to them and
ratified by solemn treaties, even if we do net
come to an understanding on the subject of
Confederation."
The first declaration of the conference was in
the following terms: "The best interests and
present and future prosperity of British North
America will be promoted by a federal union,
provided such union can be effected on principles
just to the provinces."
Additional emphasis was given to this declaration in the second resolution by the statement
that the proposed federation would provide a
system "best adapted, under existing circumstances, to protect the diversified interests of
the several provinces and secure efficiency,
harmony, and permanency in the working of the
union."
At page 138 I find the following:
The Minister of Justice denied the provinces
any voice in the matter on the ground that it
did not in any way concern them; although
it was urged upon hin by the Attorney-General
of Ontario, in a letter dated July 10, 1924,
that "in the opinion of the law officers of the
province of Ontario an amendment to the
British North America Act, in the words of
your resolution, might be interpreted as forming
a basis of encroachment upon matters of legislation unquestionably given to the province by
the British North America Act."
On this occasion the Attorney-General of
Ontario also ventured the following protest -on
the broader issue involved: "I do not need to
remind you that the British North America
Act was a produet of representatives from all
the provinces as such, and not as representatives
to a Dominion Parliament. The Governuient
of this province is of opinion that the Dominion
Parliament should not act in the matter of
obtaining constitutional changes without the
sanction of the provinces to its proposals to the
Imperial Government."
I direct attention to the following, which is
taken from a speech by Hon. Mr. Ferguson as
reported in the Toronto Globe of July 14,

1924:
Confederation was the result of certain compromises between the provinces entering into it.

300

SENATE

It amounts to an agreement, and my view is
that there should not bc any amendment without
the consent of the provinces, and no request
should be made of the British Parliament without first ascertaining whether or not the
provinces would consent.
At page 143 will be found this citation:
. . . it was of tactical importance to Macdonald

to be able to assert that the Quebec scheme was
the truc foundation of the Act of Confederation.
By "Quebec scheme" the author, of course,
was referring to the Quebec agreement.
It bas often been said that the Confederation
Act is an entente, a convention, a pact between the provinces of Canada. Confederation
was possible only by the will and authority of
the provinces. We should respect the spirit
and purpose of our Constitution, so often interpreted, explained and observed by the
Fathers of Confederation.
My honourable friend from Grandville (Hon.
Sir Thomas Chapais), in eloquent terms and
masterly manner, established the historical
viewpoint of Confederation and the futility as
well as the danger of this violation of the
Constitution. The honourable senator from
Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) showed the
particular danger of this violation to the chief
minority, represented by the province of
Quebec, and to those branches of the country
whose sentiments were expressed by the
honourable senator from L'Acadie (Hon. Mr.
Léger). We have Confederation with the support of this minority. He who knows intelligently the history of the period cannot deny
my assertion, and cannot afford to neglect or
despise the exceptional importance of this
minority, its legitimate fears, and the conditions of its constitutional guarantee. The
minority represented by Hon. Mr. Galt in the
1865 debates was also heard, and demanded
guarantees to the same extent as the French
Canadian minority.
The French Canadian
minority settled in Lower Canada had sacred
rights whicli were recognized by legislative
enactments and conquest treaties and which
were safeguarded anid defined more specifically
in the Constitution. Thiis minority also requested Confederation.
One of the main
guarantees of the preservation of its rights is
founded in the assurance that no amendment
to the Constitution shall be effective without
the consent of the provinces whicli signed flic
agreement, the Act of Confederation.
In the present case, not only is the Government without the support of the provinces, but
flic important province whose quota is used
as a standard for the representation of the
other provinces voiced its strong opposition
through the unanimous consent of its Legislature. I ask: Was the protest of its Prime
Hon. Mr. SAUVE.

Minister, Hon. Mr. Godbout, taken into consideration? The Quebec Premier is a great
friend of the Ottawa Government. He is a
Liberal chief who gave his full support to the
Ottawa Government, even if bis popularity
should suffer from it. He bas always shown
a sense of deep gratitude towards the Government. However, he deems the measure now
submitted to us to be such a serious menace
to his province that he is opposing it
withi a resounding protest, and bis protest
is supported by ail the political groups
in fhc Quebec Legislature.
How can bis
friends in this Chamber reject or neglect
bis protest?
If, as I must believe, the
Premier of Quebec is sincere, what would lie
think of their refusal to sjpport him? Why
did the Federal Government disregard bis
protest? Why has it ignored this opposition to
the proposed resolution when it does net
possess flic right to amend the Constitution
without first securing the support of the
Quebec Legislature and the other provincial
legislatures of the country? So far as the
Senate is concerned, that is the constitutional
objection which we must respect and support.
To amend the Constitution with the consent
of the provinces, as voiced through their
respective legislatures-that is right.
The
evolution of the country may necessitate certain amendments. My opposition does net
affect the rights of the provinces to their representation in the House of Commons, which
is based upon their population according to
the 1941 census as governed by the quota of
the province of Quebee.
As has been said in this Chamber, during
or after the war the 1941 census wiill determine flic represenitation of the provinces in
the Federal Parliament, unless the Government has campaign anticipations or intentions which it keeps secret. But the Government's election plans do net concern the
Senate. The first duty of the Senate is to
insist op observance of the main condition
authorizing amendments to the Constitution.
Therefore. since the Government lias not
secured the unanimous consent of the provinces, its measure cannot be accepted by the
Senate, which is the protector of the
Constitution.
May I add that the Government measure
was net supported by unanimous consent of
the federal representation of each province?
Consequently this measure is not in accordance with the spirit and best interpretation
of the British North America Act.
Hon. P. R. Du TREMBLAY: Honourable
senators, this resolution is very important. It
proposes an amendment of .the British North

JULY 7, 1943
America Act ta delay redistribution. Its effeet
is ta suspend the adjustment of the representation of the provinces in the House of Commons until the first session of the Parliament
of Canada commencing after the cessation of
hostilities between this country and the
German Reich, the Kingdom of Italy and the
Empire of Japan. The reasons given for
such postponement are contained in brief in
the resolution. It .is important that they
should be read. It states that the census of
1941 was taken during the progress of hostilities and that enlistments in the anmed forces
and employment in the production of munitions of war have removed a large nurmber
of the population from their homes ta serve
overseas or ta reside in other parts of Canada;
that the readjustment or redistribution of
electoral divisions under the ciroumstances
may give rise ta sharp differences of opinion,
which it is most desirable ta av.oid while
Canada continues ta be at war. f these
statements are accurate and true, and, I believe that ta a great extent they are, it is
fair and just ta adopt this measure. I do
not think that in the present circumstances
any Canadian or group of Canadians should
desire ta gain an advantage over any sister
province. Nobody should desire to deprive
any province of the share of representation
to whieh it is properly entitled under normal
conditions. Shauld any province be penalized
by being deprived of its proper number of
representatives because many thousands of its
citizens thought it right ta do their duty
toward their King and country? I would not
hesitate ta say that it would not be fair and
generous ta take such a stand towards a
member of Conf'ederation. It would nat be
a correct gesture.
There is 'to my mind another reason for
delaying redistribution ta a more appropriate
time, and it may be a more important reason
than any of those stated. It is that to-day
the provinces have nat a fair and adequate
representation under the present provisions of
the British North America Act. The whole
question of the representation of the provinces in this Parliament should be completely
studied and an amendment ta the Act should
be adopted which would provide for every
province being fairly and equally represented
on the basis of its population. I agree that
this time is nat the proper time ta study this
question from all its angles. To do so now
would spread disunity when what is needed
above all is unity. The proper time would be
after the war. Then this question could be
fully debated in a quieter and more favourable
atmosphere. Each province should be represented according ta its population. This ahould
be the golden rule.

301

The postponement of redistribution of
representation gives us the opportunity to
study this question and ta make the necessary
amendment ta put all provinces on a fair and
equal basis. Some honourable senators spoke
yesterday of the representation of the province
of Quebec. Some insist that we should nat
change the Constitution nor delay the redistribution. Personally, I am not satisfied with
the representation of the province of Quebec.
I think it should have more representatives.
If the representation of the province were
placed on. the basis of its population, that
province would have five or six more members.
The population of the province of Quebec,
according to 'the 1941 census, is 28.96 per cent
-nearly 29 per cent of the population of
Canada. If you take 29 per cent of the 245
members now sitting in the House of Commons, you will see that Quebec would be
entitled ta about 71 members; at 28-96 per
cent, ta be exact, it would have 70 members
instead of 65.
It is not fair that Manitoba, Saskatchewan,
or Quebec, should have a unit of representation of 51,213 when some other provinces
have a much lower unit. In Ontario, for instance, 17 of the members have a unit of
27,000. All these matters should be 'looked
into at the proper time, in such a committee
as was suggested by the honourable member
from Winnipeg, where representations could
be heard from the provinces. We must establish a rule of fair play, and personally I am
pleased with this postponement, as at the
proper Lime it may be the means of rendering
justice to all.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I ask the honourable
gentleman a question? Is he taking into'
consideration the amendment ta the Act
giving the Maritime Provinces a different
quota of representation from that of the other
provinces of Canada?
Hon. Mr. Du TREMBLAY: Oh, yes. We
should take all that into consideration.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: The honourable
leader of the Government last evening promised that he would give an answer as ta
whether he would table the correspondence
between the Ottawa and the Quebec
governments.
Hon. Mr. KING: I am sorry ta have ta
inform my honourable friend that I am not
in a position ta table the documents at the
present time. I made inquiries this morning
and hoped ta be able ta advise my honourable
friend definitely. If they are not available
now, I hope they will be available later and
will meet the purpose of my honourable

302

SENATE

friend. As I stated last night, both governments must be consenting parties to the
tabling of documents of that kind. They are
not yet in my hands to be tabled.
Honourable senators, I have just a few
words to say in closing the debate.
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators,
I presume that if the honourable leader of the
House speaks now, further debate will be
cut off.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I am not particularly
interested in the constitutional aspect of this
question, except in so far as what we are
doing may constitute a precedent. I do not
sec how this appeal to the Crown is going to
relieve the situation or change the representation of any province in Canada if the redistribution wien made is based upon the 1941
census. Redistribution will be postponed for
one, two or three years, possibly, but, after
all, unless the present Government or the
Government that succeeds it takes another
census immediately after the war, the situation will be exactly the same then as it is
now with respect to Manitoba and Saskatchewan. This being so, it is not plain to me
why we have to go to the Crown. I do not
want to say that this is a political expedientit may or may not be-but why do we have
to go to the Crown if we are not to have
another census before we have redistribution?
Perhaps the leader of the House can answer
that question. If he can, I shall be glad to
have the explanation.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Before the lonourable leader rises, may I say that his answer
to my request for the tabling of the correspondence between the Quebec and Ottawa
governments is neither clear nor satisfactory
to me. I understood the leader to say that
he did not have the correspondence under bis
hand at the moment, but might have it later.
When my honourable friend concludes his
remarks, the debate whîich is now in progress
will be closed, and no one elsé can speak to the
question. Will not the Minister now either
give us the definite answer that he will produce the correspondence, or else let us know
that he cannot do it?
Hon. Mr. KING: If I may proceed, and if
this is the closing of the debate, I will first
reply to my honourable friend. The correspondence, of course, is not in my hands.
I asked for it this morning and called attention to my honourable friend's request of last
night, and I had hoped to have the documents
and present them Ithis afternoon. But up to
the present time they have net come te me. I

personally see no reason why they should not
be tabled, and I think they will be, in good
time.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTNYE:

Hon. Mr. KING: They may be too late
for an argument, but I think we shall cover
that before I sit down.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE:
pondence?

Where is the corres-

Hon. Mr. KING: I suppose it would be
in the bands of the Ministers who corresponded
with the various departments of the provincial
Government.
Apparently my honourable
friend's idea is that there was correspondence
between only the Government of Quebec and
the Federal Government. Well, other provinces are probably as much interested in this
question as is Quebec, and there may be other
correspondence.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: It would be easy to find
the letter from the Prime Minister of Quebec.
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes.
as far as I am concerned.

You may have it,

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I find it especially difficult to understand why my honourable
friend is not in a position to table the correspondence now, since I notified him a week ago
that I intended to ask the question.
Hon. Mr. KING: My honourable friend
realizes that correspondence between governments cannot be laid on the Table except
with the concurrence of the governments concerned. The Government of Canada is, of
course, represented by the Prime Minister.
Mr. King is most meticulous about public
business, and if there are documents which in
his judgment can properly be tabled, they
will be tabled. Honourable senators may be
assured of that.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: This year?
Hon. Mr. KING: At present I have no
knowledge that thre are documents of that
character.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Pardon me, honourable
senators, but I do not like to see the honourable leader closing the debate until certain
questions are answered.

Hon. Mr. KING: No. If any honourable

JULY 7, 1943
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Am I to get an answer
te the question I put to the honourable leader?
Another question I should like to ask him is:
Have all the provinces of Canada been consulted with regard to this appeal to the Crown
for a change in the Constitution?
Hon. Mr. KING: No, I should not think so.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Then, in my opinion,
the procedure is entirely uneonstitutional. The
Government should consult every province
before attempting to have the slightest change
made in the Constitution of this country.
Until all the provinces give their consent to
this proposed amendment, we are not acting
within the spirit of the Constitution, the
British North America Act.
Hon. Mr. KING: That is my honourable
friend's opinion.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: That is my opinion,
and I think it is the opinion of most people
in Canada who have studied the constitutional
question. I do not know whether any other
members on this side want to continue the
debate. I now have an answer from the
honourable leader that the Government did
not consuit all the provinces with regard to
this resolution.
Hon. Mr. KING: I do not know, but I
should not think so.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Unless we are going
to have a new census after the war, I cannot
see why this amendment -is being made. If
I get a satisfactory explanation of that, I
shall not express any further objection, except
in casting my vote.
Hon. GUSTAVE LACASSE: Honourable
senators, I do not want to add very much to
what has already been said about this resolution, but, since I expect there will be a division, I deem it my duty to state why I am
going to vote the way I intend to. I shall
vote for the resolution, for reasons more or
less identical with those expressed last night
by my honourable friend from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden). That means that I shall vote
for it without any enthusiasm. And I shall
vote for the resolution without any enthusiasm
because I was greatly impressed by at least
two speeches delivered in this House last night
with reference to the sacred contract, or convention, or pact, or whatever astute and
learned lawyers may call it, of Confederation.
This is a constitutional issue, because it
deals with our Constitution, which was agreed
to by universal consent of the provinces of
Canada. We were treated last night to a
very informative and interesting speech by

30q

my honourable friend from Grandville (Hon.
Sir Thomas Chapais), describing the genesis
of our Constitution. Of all the speeches that
have been made in this debate, his impressed
me most deeply, and I am sure all my Englishspeaking friends here will be deeply impressed,
too, when they have the advantage of reading
his remarks in their own language: It is
unfortunate that the English translation is not
yet available to them.
The second reason why I shall vote for this
resolution without enthusiasm-I emphasize
that-is that it does not meet with the
general consensus of opinion in Canada, particularly in so far as the provincial governments are concerned. I should vote for it
with much more eagerness if the governments
of all the provinces had expressed themselves
in favour of it. Not only have they failed
to do this, but one province has expressed its
strong opposition to it; a province whose status
in Confederation is most important, if only
for the fact that its population is taken as
a basis for distributing the electoral constituencies in Canada.
My third reason for lack of enthusiasm is
my fear that if a few more amendments are
made to the British North America Act at
shorter and shorter intervals, our Constitution
is bound to become in a relatively short time
a pale copy of what it was originally. I think
that in future we should be very careful
before making other amendments. It was
stated yesterday by the honourable leader of
the House (Hon. Mr. King) that this is, if I
remember him correctly, the fourth amendment to the British North America Act in
the last quarter-century. That 'means there
has been an amendment every five or six
years, on the average. Rather than keep on
at that rate, honourable senators, I believe
it would be well to follow the advice of the
honourable senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Haig) and appoint a standing committee to
look after amendments to the Constitution in
future.
In spite of all this I intend, as I have
said, to vote for the resolution. Some honourable members might consider my vote to
be inconsistent with my remarks. To them
I will say that I do not see how the sinister
consequences feared by some people will
follow the adoption of this amendment to the
British North America Act. That aspect of
the case has been, to my mind, grossly
exaggerated. This is just a measure of a
temporary nature, brought about by the
extraordinary circumstances of the present
time. I am supporting the resolution on that
understanding, and I emphasize, as other

SENATE
honourable members have done before me,
the importance of seeing to it that the resolution shall not be regarded in the future as a
precedent. I feel very strongly on that point.
Another reason why I shall support the
resolution is that the Chamber principally
interested in it has already assented to it by
a large majority. Since the parties who are
most interested have seen their way clear to
adopt this resolution, however extraordinary
it may seem, I do not sec why we should not
follow suit and sanction the stand they have
taken.
There is one more reason-and this may
be the paramount one-for my support of the
resolution. I have enough confidence in the
Government, in those upon whom rests the
heavy responsibility of administering the
affairs of Canada to-day, to back them up
on this score.
All that I have said, honourable senators,
is conditional on the war not lasting ten
years or more. We know that in the past
one war lasted a hundred years. A day or
two ago I read that Italy is making preparations to keep fighting for thirty years, but so
far as I can sec, that is a pretty high ambition. I do not think the war will last as
long as that, but it might last long enough
to give some people an opportunity to use
this resolution in a wrong way.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: If it lasts as long as
that, we shall have another census.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: As to the census,
sorne day it might be decided to ask for another amendiment to the Constitution, to
provide that a census shall be taken every
five years, or every fifteen years. It all
depends on the circumstances, and whether
what we are doing to-day is taken as a precedent, much as we may try to prevent
that.
That is why I am so careful to
emphasize that this proposed amendment is
of a temporary nature only.
That is all I have to say, honourable senators, I hope I have made myself clear, because
I do not think anyone should vote lightly on
this issue. Every honourable member should
take his own responsibility, not only for today, but also for the days to come. For
whatever words we utter in this House to-day
and whatever move we make will constitute
another link in the history of Canada. Therefore, we should be very careful as to the
views we express and the action we take.
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators, I
do not propose te repeat the arguments I
advanced last night in support of the
resolution.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE.

The honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne) has asked for production of the
correspondence between the Government of
Quebec and the Federal Government. We
are, I suppose, all aware, through reports in
the Press and references made in another
place and here, that recently the Legislature
of Quebec passed a resolution protesting
against this proposed amendment of the Constitution. As to the correspondence on the
subject between the two governments, I can
assure the House that it will be tabled if the
governrments concerned agree and if, to use
a current expression, "it 1$ in the pubi
interest."
My honourable friend' from Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien), in the excellent speech
he made last night, presented the viewpoint
of himself and others from his province, and
aise of certain senators from some of the other
provinces. I need scarcely assure him that
no Government ever proposes an amendment
to the British North America Act until after
very careful deliberation.
As I intimated
yesterday, during* the last twenty-five years
there have been three amendments to the
Constitution. A brief review of those amendments will, I think, have some bearing on the
legal opinions which were cited yesterday in
regard to the necessity of consulting the
provinces in such cases.
The amendment of 1916 was for the purpose
of extending the life of the then Parliament.
The provinces were not consulted at that
time, for the reason that the subject-matter
was within the purview of the Parliament of
Canada, the British North America Act having divided the administrative field between
the provinces and the Dominion. Surely it
was intended that, although members of the
House of Commons came from the various
electoral districts in the provinces, once they
arrived in Ottawa and took the oatE, their
responsibilities were not merely provincial or
local; they became Dominion-wide.
Therefore the amendment sought in 1916 was
absolutely within the jurisdiction of the
Parliament of Canada, and consequently the
provinces were net consulted.
But in the case of the amendment of 1930
the provinces were consulted, and at a
Dominion-provincial conference it was agreed
that the vast unorganized areas in the Northwest should be turned over to the provinces
of Alberta and Saskatchewan.
The provinces were also consulted in regard
to the amendment relating to unemployment
insurance, for obviously this is one of the
subject-matters within the provincial field.

JULY 7, 1943
But surely it will not be seriously contended
that the Parliament -of Canada, set up to
manage the affairs of the nation, must ask
the provinces for permission to amend the
British North America Act in order to postpone redistribution.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I do not want' to
interrupt the honourable leader, but it seems
to me the two cases he has cited, the extension
of the life of a Parliament and the postponing
of redistribution, are not at all parallel.
Hon. Mr. KING: It is a matter of degree,
and the first is the greater.

Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: That is to say,
without consulting the provinces. He made
that very clear.
Hon. Mr. KING: That is right.

Hon. Mr. KING: Oh, no.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: If that is not

Hon. Mr. KING: No. I am coupling one
fact with another. It may be that within
five or ten years some condition will arise
requiring an amendment to our Constitution.
When that time comes, the Government of

Chamber, with a long and distinguished
political career, and we all respect his wisdom
and learning.
Yesterday he gave us an
authoritative review of the manner in which
Confederation was set up, and, although I have
not yet had an opportunity to read his speech,
I gather that he expressed the fear enterby my honourable friend from
tained
Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien), that what
is now proposed may create a dangerous precedent. I submit that such fears are groundless. I have not the slightest doubt that our
parliamentary institution will long continue
in full vigour, notwithstanding the adoption of
this resolution. As is well known, the step
now being taken is rendered necessary by
reason of the fact that several members of the
House of Commons are not in their seats, but
are serving in His Majesty's forces, and that
electors who would have been tabulated
within their constituencies when the 1941
census was taken were absent either on military duty or at work in war factories.
It has been suggested that the resolution
should be amended to provide for redistribution at a certain date, perhaps after another
This suggestion is impossible of
census.
adoption. Nobody in this Parliament or outside can tell when the war will cease. As I
see it, we shall have to utilize the census of
1931.
The redistribution of 1933, following
the 1931 census, was made by the Bennett
Government. It is acknowledged that it is an
advantage to the party in power to have an
opportunity to deal with the redistribution of
seats, because its members are always in a
majority on the redistribution committee.
Fortunately, of late years the pressure of
publie opinion has discouraged the gerrymandering of seats which in earlier times vas
resorted to. In the last redistribution, riding
boundaries had to be changed because of
increase or decrease in population, a block of
territory having to be taken off here and a
block put on there. This change of boundaries
was reflected in the next election.
If redistribution could be carried out at
present, and if this Government were looking
for an advantage, it would, like most governments, jump at such an opportunity; but I
think the Government realizes that it would
be unfair and unwise to put through a redistribution measure at this time, and consequently it bas asked that the matter be delayed for
the time being. As the members of the
elected body have almost unanimously endorsed the resolution-I think honourable
senators are thoroughly conversant with their
recorded vote-I hope this House will adopt
the measure unanimously, as it did with all
three of the previous resolutions coming to
this House.
Hon. Mr. KING.

Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Would the honourable gentleman permit me one question for
the purpose of clarifying the atmosphere, at all
events as far as I am concerned? Do I understand from him that, in his judgment, he cannot make a declaration to the effect that the
passing of this resolution at the present time
shall not constitute a precedent?
Hon. Mr. KING: A precedent for what?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: My honourable
friend is quite right in asking that. Nobody
can bind and direct the future, if I may put it
that way; but it is quite possible that, if my
honourable friend would make a declaration of
the kind I have mentioned, the vote on this
question would be unanimous. That declaration would have great weight in preventing
future members of Parliament from saying
that a resolution passed at a certain date, and
another at such and such a date, constituted
precedents. If I for my part wanted to see
the resolution passed, I do not see how I could
support it without the reservation.
Hon. Mr. KING: My honourable friend is
not q.uite fair. He knows that any statement
the Government or I might make would not be
worth anything. It would have to be a statement of the Parliament of Canada, and that
statement will not be made. I will not try to
smooth over anything by making a statement
that would be valueless to the people of
Canada. It would not be my right to try to
induce them to believe there would be no
further amendments to the British North
America Act. It would be very silly for me
to make such a statement.
The motion was agreed to on the following

For the present session 106 petitions for
Bis of Divorce were actually presented in

0f the petitions recommended, 29 were by

0f the petitions recommended, 92 were
from. residents of the province of Quebec, and
two fromn the province of Prince Edward
Island.
An analysis of the occupations followed by
the applicants is as follows: bank clerk,
barrister, clerks, designer of millinery, domestie servant, draughtsman,
electrician,
farmers, hairdresser, hotel proprietor, labourer,
lumber agent, manager, manufacturer, mechan-

secretaries, sergeant detectives, sheet metal
worker, shipper, stenographers, stockbroker,
superintendent, tailor, teacher, teletype operatar, trueker, waiter, workman.
The committee held' twenty-four meetings.
In twenty-seven cases the committee rccommended that part of the parliamentary fees
be remitted. There has been. some discussion
about that at different times. The parliamentary fee is $210, and the cost of getting a
divorce through Parliament is, I suppose,
double what it ordinarily is in the courts; so
when part of the fee is remitted it is nat a
very big concession, after ail.
Assuming that aIl the buis of divorce recammended by the committee and now in various

The Divorce Committee has worked very
hard in handling these cases, sitting here many
days when the Senate, was adjourned, and it
would be a great relief if some court could he
made available to the petitioners. Honourable
members who corne from the province af
Quehee seem ta think it would flot be right ta
open up the courts of that province ta these
people. I am sorry they take that view,
hecause, although we have a very gaod com.
mittec, I think the cases wauld he better
tried in the courts. We do the best we can,
but it seems that these cases are matters of
law and should be dealt with in the courts.

Hear, hear.

that honourahle members from the province of
Quebec would yield a little, s0 that we could
get them ta agree on this.

SENATE

ADJOURNMENT-BUSINESS
SENATE

OF THE

DISCUSSION

Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, I
move that when the Senate adjourns to-day it
stand adjourned until Tuesday, July 13, at
8 o'clock in the evening.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators, may
I ask the honourable leader whether there is
any possibility of changing that date to the
20th? Will there be any work for us to do
on the 13th?
Hon. Mr. KINC
as I know.

Yes, I think so; as far

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I consulted some members
of the House of Commons to-day, and they
think it will be the end of next week before
they are through with the War Appropriation
Bill. I do not like to keep talking about this
matter, but it is extremely hard for those of us
who corne from a long distance to stay around
here doing nothing for five days in order to
be on hand when there is to be a sitting for a
day or two. We have a grievance, a real
grievance. If the Government of the day does
not want to give us work to do in the early
stages of the session, we ought to take the
necessary adjournments until work is ready
for us.
I do net see any possibility of a long discussion bere on the War Appropriation Bill, and
since the session is not likely to close before

the 24th, at the earliest, I think the honourable
leader should consider adjourning until the
20th.
Hon. Mr. KING: My honourable friend
would not want to take the responsibility for
having us adjourn until the 20th, now that
the session is nearing its close. The most
important bill for this year is now being
dealt with in the other House and has to
corne before us. In addition, there are a
nuhmber of other bills in the ordinary run
of Government business. As we are expecting
Parliament to adjourn on the 24th, I would
not take the responsibility of suggesting that
the Senate adjourn now until the 20th. I
think that would be very unwise.
Would the
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
honourable leader indicate to this Chamber
what legislation is still to 'corne before us?
Hon. Mr. KING: The most important is,
of course, the War Appropriation Bill. The
debate on the resolution has been going on
for some weeks, and I think is almost concluded. I should look for the Bill to core
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON.

to us next week. Besides that Bill, to-day's
Order Paper for the other House contains
these items:
Second reading, Bill 71, an Act to amend the
Federal District Commission Act.
Second reading, Bill 74, an Act to amend the
Canada Evidente Act.
Second reading, Bill 77, an Act respecting the
appointment of auditors for National Railways.
Second reading, Bill 78, the British Columbia
Indian Reserves Mineral Resources Act.
In Conmittee of the Whole: A resolution for
the introduction of a measure to amend the
Unemployment Insurance Act, to facilitate its
operation and to extend its provisions to employees in receipt of remuneration up to $2,400
a year, instead of to those receiving only up
to $2,000 a year, as at present.

In Committee of the Whole: A resolution to
bring in a measure to authorize the Canadian
National Railway Company to issue securities
not execeding $6,046,300 in principal amount to
provide the moneys necessary to meet c-apital
expenditures made or capital

indebtedness in-

curred during the calendar year 1943, etc.
Second reading, Bill 107, an Act to amend the
Crimnnal Code.
In Committee of the Whole: A resolution to
bring in a measure to amend the Exchequer
Court Act.
Second reading, Bill 108, an Act to amend the
Department of National Revenue Act.
Second reading, Bill 119, an Act respecting a
certain tax convention and protocol between
Canada and the United States of Ainerica,
signed at Washington, in the United States of
America, on the 4th day of March, 1942.
And perhaps sorne measures of which we have
no knowledge to-day will be introdLceed before
the session ends.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators, with
permission of the House I should like to rise
again on tbis matter. The bills just referred
to by the honourable leader cannot get here
until the War Appropriation Bill is passed by
the other Chamber. The intention over there,
I understand, is that that piece of legislation
must corne first. And, as I have stated, the
best estimate I can get from honourable members of that House is that they will net be
finished with the War Appropriation Bill until
the end of next week.
Hon. Mr. KING: There is no reason why
my honourable friend should think he can make
a better guess as to that than J, or anybody
Beginning to-morrow, the other
else; can.
House is meeting in the morning and holding
three sittings a day.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Morning sittings may not
begin until Monday.
Hon. Mr. KING: They may not, but the
proposal is to have them begin to-morrow.
We know from experience that things can
move along very rapidly in the Commons.
I would not take the responsibility of adjourning the Senate until the 20th.

MONTREAL PUBLIC ABATTOIRS
MOTION-DEBATE ADJOURNED
Hon. ARTHUR SAUVE rose to move:
Whereas serious complaints have been addressed to the Government, Parliament and
Press concerning certain commercial operations
or proceedings of the Montreal public abattoirs;
Whereas, if these complaints were well
founded, they would constitute a great injustice
and an intolerable abuse;
In the opinion of this House it is expedient
that the Government consider the advisability
of setting up, if it has not been made, an
investigation into the said operations and proceedings, under the direction of a commission
competently representing the Government, the
producer and the dealer.
The said commission should prepare, in the
shortest possible time, a complete report of its
investigation and submit it to the Government
and Parliament.
He said: Honourable senators, the weather
is so warm that, although the official correspondence in regard to this matter is very
cool, I shall be quite brief. I move this
motion because the honourable leader of the
Government promised that if in conformity
with the rules I could find means to get the
information I was seeking, there would be no
disposition to withhold anything which might
properly be placed before this House. As a
matter of fact, relying upon my broad parliamentary experience, I formulated questions
to show the outstanding points upon which
the Government should seek information in
order to give a frank, precise and heartening
answer concerning the commercial operations
of that important market, the public abattoirs
of the metropolis of Canada.

MuN

Among other facts, the following criticisms
were publicly made. Farmers or producers
complain that at the Montreal publie stockyards dishonest speculators operate in such
a way as to avoid paying the seller the amount
which is rightfully due him. In a certain
case $18 was said to have been deducted for
eight hogs duly graded. When the farmer
received his money, a few days after his
return home, he protested to the Government
official, who made many calculations and examined the weight slips, but was unsuccessful in explaining the difference about which
the seller was complaining. Finally, the
official offered $5 in settlement, but the farmer
refused, saying: "I want what is owed to
me; if you do not owe me anything, I do not
want your money; if my amount, based upon
my coupons, is correct, pay me."
The sellers usua'l1y complain that they cannot obtain the protection they want. The
grader lives among speculators who stay at
the abattoirs, and he does not give the required protection and justice. The Liberal
member for Chambly-Rouville denounced this
unfairness and requested, as I previously did,
that a capable and honest representative of
the sellers should check the grading and the
weighing.
Did the Government take the means to
learn the exact conditions at the Montreal
abattoirs? Did it have the complainants called
before one or more representatives duly authorized to make full inquiry? Did it endeavour
to learn the truth concerning particularly the
claim of Farmer Albert Godin and others?
In Godin's case, Mr. Alfred Savoie, the
senior foods officer for the representative of
the Wartime Prices and Trade Board, called
the farmer, examined his slips, and finally
told him that he would give his opinion after
studying the affair; but nothing more was
heard from Mr. Savoie. The farmer wrote
him again, and received no answer. I myself
also wrote him, and did not receive any
answer. The correspondence produced proves
this. In a letter which is on file; Mr. Alfred
Savoie wrote his chief concerning this Godin
case and stated that an analysis of the weights
given shows clearly the possi'bility that an
error was made, not in the weight of the
animals when they were weighed dead, but
rather in the case of their live weight. After
explaining, Mr. Savoie says:
However, I must add that the weighing of
hogs done at the abattoirs when the animals
are alive is performed in such a manner that
the farmer can check this weighing himself.
When the weighing is done upon carcasses, it
is effected under the direction and control of
authorized officers froim the Department of
Agriculture, and consequently, in both cases,
the farmer is protected as much as possible.

310

SENATE

Mr. Savoie does not tell the whole truth.
Might net a peculiar meaning attach to the
phrase, "as much as possible"? Many producers have complained about the incompetence or neglect of the official in charge at
Montreal abattoirs. It was on these complaints that the Liberal member for ChamblyRouville based his request that the producers
should be represented at the weighing and
grading of their hogs. He said:
The Government should appoint bacon hog
producers as representatives of the farming
community, who would be stationed, at the
slaughter houses, where they would check the
weight of those bacon hogs, thereby protecting
the farmer's interests. I do not mean that the
abattoir owners rob the farmers, but I do say
that the latter must accept the arbitrary
decision of interested people. Were the Government to hold an inquiry in this matter,
perhaps they would find that even in the cattle
trade, and in the abattoirs, there may be trust
operators against whom the farmers should be
protected.
When a farmer, througb a trucker or a hog
dealer. sends one hundred or one hundred and
fifty hogs to the Montreal market. there is no
one in a position to decide how many of then
fill the conditions required by the Government
to warrant the payment of the bonus. The hogs
are not weigled in the presence of the farmers
or the truckers at the abattoir. They are told
to return a week later and learn what amount
they are entitled to, how many animals command
a premium, and how many are subject to a
cut. When the fariecr or his representative
returns the following week, lie finds that perhaps
sixty out of one hundred hogs did not entitle
him to the bonus, but ere subjected to such
a eut that no profit could be derived from
raising them. This condition should be remedied
at once.
What is the answer of the Governiment to
the representations of the member for
Chambly-Rouville?
Furthermore, on December 2, 1942, that is,
last year, I submitted similar representations
to Mr. W. A. Peterson, Superintendent of
Animal Production, and to Mr. L. C.
Robitaille, Chief of the Agricultural Production Services in Montreal. Here is my letter
to them:
Dear Sir,
I wisb to tell you that I have heard serious
2omplaints froi agricultural producers in my
district, one of which is as follows: A farmer
takes eight choice hogs to the Montreal
abattoir,
Weight-live: 1,750 lbs.
Price-live: $12.60-$220.50
Price-dead: 1,228 lbs. at $16.45,
and receives only $202.
What is the meaning of this difference? Why
a decrease of $3? I must tell you that, among
the eight hogs, two were graded "select," and
the six others "bacons."
The farmers claim that they have no means
of checking or verifying the weight. They must
take the word of people they do not know:
dealers, weighers, etc. They receive a statement from the weigher two or three days after
Hon Mr. SAUVE.

arriving home, and they must abide by it without argument. Is it truc?
If it is truc, I
claim with thei that the seller should have a
representative present when the cattle are
weighed or graded at the abattoir. This wouid
avoid fraud and misunderstanding.
Hoping that you will give your answer shortly,
I am, etc.
Arthur Sauvé.
St. Eustache, 2nd of December, 1942.
Where is Mr. Peterson's answer? Where is
the information he gave the Covernment? I
do not see anything in the file. I am not
talking about Mr. Baird, a technician, who
does net touch on the points raised.
Did the Government draw the attention of
its officers to the seriousness of the statements
and denunciation by the member for ChamblyRouville, who bas been twenty years in public
life? He is a lawyer who knows the value
of words and of evidence. Did the Government ask for an explanation froin its weigher
and grader? Did it ask him to explain his
conduct? Did it confront him with Fariner
Godin?
Is it true, yes or no, that an official would
offer to pay a farmer for his willingness to
withdraw his claim? Did the Government
carefully inquire into the truth of this assertion? Did the Government see that the farmer,
Godin, was questioned by one of its representatives other than the weigher or grader
w-bho was said to be involved? Did it investigate the charges? Did it appoint an investigator?
I understand that the correspondence produced upon an order of the Senate does not
go beyond the bournds of the motion, and that
it is narrowly restricted, in part, to technical
answers which are in strict conformity with the
regulations, laws, Orders in Council and memoranda; but it appears tiat there is no evidence
of any steps being taken by the Government
to examine earnestly the individual cases which
are the objects of serious complaints.
Complaints from producers are not very
numerous upon this file if one compares them
to those which are heard among the public.
Certain farmers who are voicing complaints
fear that their criticisms of the officials will
bring upon them new difficulties when they go
to the markets. Threats are directed against
them, and they fear that they will be put upon
the black list. I am told that the Farmers'
Catholie Union of the province of Quebec is
planning a serious investigation into the complaints which have been voiced, in order to
find out the exact conditions existing. Better
late than never! I hope that this organization
will fulfil one of the most noble duties for

JULY 13, 1943

which it was created, and that it will report as
soon as possible to the Government and to the
public.
If the leader of the Government were in a
position to state without any doubt that this
investigation would now receive all the necessary help, and full and impartial assistance
from the Government, I should be willing,
with the consent of the House, ta withdraw my
motion. I do not intend to play politics. I
understand, that some officials are more guilty
than the Government, which in this period of
turmoil is handicapped by difficulties in keeping control. But the Government is responsible
for the action of its employees, and if, when
informed of their incompetence and negligence,
it neglects or refuses to take action, it becomes
just as guilty as they are, or even more guilty.
I proceeded by correspondence, which gave
no satisfacory result; so I have used the
tribunal of the Senate to submit complaints on
matters of public interest-complaints and
charges of fraud committed at the markets of
These
the public abattoirs in Montreal.
charges, founded upon specific cases, are all the
more important because, according to assertions made to me by senators from Ontario
and the Western Provinces, they are becoming
general in every part of the country. There is
a devastating black market, which is the worst
saboteur of the Allied Nations. In certain cases
the Government investigated and dealt with
the offenders severely, but it is plain that in
this case the Government organization is very
far from being satisfactory, and that the application of many of its measures is, at best,
clumsy and insufficient, or practically nonexistent, or productive of ill results.
It is the duty of every good Canadian to
help the Government to put a stop ta abuses,
fraud and robbery. For my part, I wish before
all to put a stop to these complaints and to
intolerable wrongs. I claim ,that farmers, producers, dealers and consumers are entitled to

justice, and that those who participate in the
black market or rackets in Montreal or elsewhere are traitors of the worst kind and dangerous saboteurs of our most earnest war
effort. There should be no privileged persons.
Some particularly bold representatives of a
certain group, who should appreciate our efforts
to protect their brothers from persecution by

t
our enemies, ought to attempt ·o stamp out
the main causes of our complaints and of the
contempt in which we hold their peculiarity
of action. If we must be unrelenting towards
the enemy to the point of shedding our blood
and giving our wealth in order to nullify his
threats, let us be still more unrelenting towards those who, taking advantage of the diffi-

311

culties and distress brought about by our enemies overseas, attempt t0 plunder us at home,
rob us.of our property, and undermine our
morale. This is the enemy the Senate should
fight when it falls within our power to do so.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators,
in support of the honourable senator who has
just taken his seat, I should like to state something of my own practical experience. I might
point out that my somewhat radical proposal
that the Government should take over all
stock-yards in Canada was the result of my
personal knowledge of the manner in which
farmers and some dealers are being robbed on
the markets to-day.
The honourable senator from Rigaud (Hon.
Mr. Sauvé) has touched upon a very important point. I-t is true that some men who know
they have been deait with unjustly are afraid
to complain, for fear of what may happen when
they come back with their next carload of
stock, because the present operators of these
markets are absolutely a law unto themselves;
or it may be that some of the victims hope
that in the future they may possibly work their
way into the privileged class.
It is not a question of grade. We have
heard a great deal about 'the charge of a dollar
a head for every animal; a horse, for instance.
I would ask any member of the Government or
any honourable senator to visit the stockyards and see what occurs there, and what those
crowbars or hickory octagon canes do to live
stock. The honourable senator from Parkdale
(Hon. Mr. Murdock) secured for me an answer
to some of the charges I made to the Minister
of Agriculture. I believe the honourable senator is sincere, but I do not believe he ever
shipped a carload of cattle in his life, or took
time to watch what goes on at the stock-yards.
I still maintain that horses bought in Western
Canada for $75 apiece are sold to farmers in
Eastern Canada for from $150 to $200 apiece,
or thereabouts.
Commission men are operating in Montreal. They charge a commission of five dollars,
and'collect eighty cents a day for feed. They
are also the owners of horses. They have
buyers out who buy as cheap as they can.
Then prospective purchasers are told, "I will
sell you a horse from. this fellow, but you
will have to pay pretty well for him." Commission merchants should not purchase the
commodity which they are selling on commission; nevertheless, by means of subterfuge this kind of business is being carried
cattle
on in connection with horses in the
market. The commission men are not satisfiéd with their commissions, but by the use

·

of fictitious names they are buying for themselves and selling at a higher price.

312

SENATE

It was a new experience for me, when
the honourable senator from Rigaud brought
up this question before, to hear his Honour
the Speaker rule that no further discussion
could take place.
I was rather surprised,
because to my mind there is nothing of
greater importance in this country to-day than
this very question. I tried to bring this to
the attention of the Minister before our committee, and I said I should like to ascertain
the actual prices paid at the packing plants.
Truc, we have been given a figure, but I
happen to know what took place in the case
of a neighbour of mine. That is why I made
the remark that those who need the most get
the least.
This young fellow refused a
buyer's offer for a carload of sheep, a doubledecked car, and took them into the. market
at Winnipeg. It is probable that word went
ahead froin the buyer: "Here is a green
fellow coming down. Nip him." Later when
I saw this young chap I said, "How did you
get along?" He said, "I lest some $150; the
market was down." I said, "It went up the
next day, when there were no sheep offered,"
and he said, "Yes." That is what goes on.
On the day whben large numbers of cattle
are marketed prices are low; the next day
they are high. The packer may quote you a
price. but probably' he does net buy an
animal. Therefore I say it is important that
the Government investigate and sec that
proper control is exercised. So far as I have
seen, there is none at all. I have visited
three or four live-stock markets and have
watchcd the procedure for days, and I think
I know what I am talking about when I say
that skulduggery of the worst kind is practised. J would net have suggested that the
Government take over all those stock-yards
if I had net known of the practice and
given up hope that it would be rectified. I
would ask any honourable senator w-ho can
spare the time te visit the stock-yards and
watch wbat is going on, because soinething
should be done te protect the man who is
being robbed. I want te support the honourable senator frocs Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Sauvé),
who I think is absolutely right. I have no
doubt in the world that people who have
registered these complaints have just cause
for complaining.
We were asked to produce hogs a little
heavier. Well, if a hog dresses three pounds
over 180 pounds, yeu are eut $2. Who is
there to see the carcass weighed? Is there a
Government man to inspect that?
What
happens in so many cases is that we are
disappointed with results because our hogs
have graded a pound or two too much, and
Bon. Mr. HORNER.

that brings the animals down from the select
bacon price range to the heavier hog price
range.
Some suggestion was made that it was
rather surprising how the packers were able
to sell at the prices they do, in view of what
they pay for the live stock. Well, it is no
mystery to me, for although they claim to
pay up to 13 cents, the bulk of the live stock
is bought at 10 cents.
I feel it is a duty and privilege for me to
support the honourable senator from Rigaud
(Hon. Mr. Sauvé) in his complaint.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
a good many honourable members are more
qualified than I am to speak on this matter,
but it is one that bas given me some concern
for many years. I am firmly of the opinion
that some action must be taken to protect
producers of live stock in this country.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: I am somewbat familiar
with the situation of which my honourable
friend, from Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Sauvé) complains. By and large, I am entirely in faveur
of the present hog grading system, w'hich has
resulted in our producing Wiltshire sides and
bacon as good as are produced in Britain.
I am an occasional shipper to the market.
The hog is graded on the rail after it is killed.
It is, as I understand, impossible otherwise
to grade a hog properly, because the distinction between the different grades is so slight
that you can hardly notice it when the hogs
are on the hoof. Just to illustrate that, I
wiil refer to a personal experience. Two years
ago at the Vancouver Exhibition I exhibited
twelve head in the feeding class. The Universify of British Columbia, which feed:s its
bogs according to the most efficient standard,
had eight head in the same class, and they
were graded ahead of mine in the show ring.
I said to the University's representative: "I
ship my hogs to the same abattoir as yen
do. It will be instructive to see how they
grade out on the rail." Well, the Government
grader on the rail classified nine of my hogs,
I think, as select, and three as B-1. But only
two of the University hogs were placed in the
select class, the remainder being graded as B-1.
I am quite in faveur of the high standard
that we have obtained in this country.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Will the honourable senator let me ask him a question? Who does
the grading in the abattoir?
Hon. Mr. McRAE: A Government inspecter.
We producers are thoroughly familiar with
the quality of our own animals, and we are

JULY 13, 1943
not always satisfied with the grading we get
on the rail. It seems that the grading is
sometimes too severe. But the report does
not come back until four or five days, or
perhaps a week, after the grading; se there is
no chance for a re-hearing. I do not sec how
this can be changed. Of course, if the inspector is too severe in his grading, and you find
his decisions are not correct, lie can be
changed. But the hogs are handled so
rapidly-in twenty-four hours they are in cold
storage-that it is not clear to me just how
we can protect the individual shipper.
This question ,which has been brought up
by the honourable senator from Rigaud (Hon.
Mr. Sauvé) has to do with a much broader
subject than hogs alone. It applies to all live
stock produced in Canada. li my province
three large abattoirs handle nearly all the
live stock. Under our city by-laws the
individual killer has been pretty well eliminated; se nearly all the business finds its way
into the hands of the three big abattoirs. As
there is no common yard in which the live
stock is sold, the producer ships his animals
to whichever of the three abattoirs lie may
prefer. There is no competition in that part
of the business. The co-operation between our
Canadian abattoirs is undoubtedly very close.
lu fact, I think the abattoirs are one of the
bigs trusts that we have in this country.
In my opinion, if you take the business by and
large over the year, there is virtually no
competition. There may be a little on the
part of one abattoir to-day, and perhaps on the
part of another abattoir to-morrow, but even
that little does not exist out in the country.
Considerable stock is raised up in what we
call the Cariboo country. A producer up there
may be anywhere from 100 to 120 miles from
the rail head, and it takes him probably a
couple of weeks to bring his live stock down
that distance. Once lie does get his animals
at the rail head, lie cannot take them back
home; so lie must sell them. I am stating this
on the best authority, from what has been told
me by a man. who knows the situation. On
sale day there is a large collection of live
stock, and three buyers appear. One buyer
comes along and looks at a rancher's cattle.
Suppose the prevailing price is five cents a
pound, as it w'as a few years ago. The buyer
says, "I will give you four and three-quarter
cents." As the rancher is convinced that he
ought te get five cents a pound for his stock,
lie approaches a second buyer. This man, who
is fully aware of what offer has already been
made for the cattle, quotes perhaps $4.65 a
hundred pounds. That being unacceptable,
the third buyer is approached, and he makes
the same offer. So the rancher goes back to
the original buyer, who now says: "I have had

313

a further look at your cattle, and find that
some of them are not up to grade. I shall
have to go over them again." So lie goes over
them again and then says, "I will give you
$4.50 for the rejects and $4.75 for the others.
That is the best I can do."
Hon. Mr. HORNER: That is the game.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: There is not a bit of
competition in that business. In fact, it is
really as though there were but one buyer.
Without doubt, the farmer carries the bag.
So I am entirely in sympathy with the honourable senator from Rigaud (Hon. 'Mr. Sauvé)
in the complaints he has made.
I do not like Government ownership, but
something has to be done with our abattoirs.
In case seme honourable members may think
I am speaking too stroigly, let me refer te
what happened the first year after our federaI
pork board began te operate. We got along
very well for almost a year, but at the end of
that period we found ourselves with a surplus,
if my memory serves me rightly, of 33,000,000
pounds of pork, nearly all represented by importations from the Chicago market, where
hogs were selling at about $4.50 on the hoof,
when we were getting $9 for the finished
product here. It is estimated that one or other
of our three packers got away with a million
dollars. In order te meet the situation, the
Government had te reduce the price of pork
for about a year. The hog raisers took the
loss, of course, and this set back our pork programme also for about a year.
I think I am within the fact when I say
that one of the men on the pork board was a
representative of one of the packers who
brought in this pork from Chicago. That has
never been aired in this House before. The
importing of this bacon from Chicago and
selling of it te consumers in this country at the
considerably higher price prevailing here was
certainly not a patriotic move on the part
of a Canadian packer.
I mention these things to show that the
whole business is a pretty difficult one for the
farmers of this country. I see the honourable senator from High River (Hon. Mr.
Riley) opposite me. He is very much better
qualified to deal with this subject than I am,
and if he would indicate a desire to speak I
should sit down at once.
I only want te add, in conclusion, that the
very important subject opened up by the honourable senator from Rigaud must be dealt
with at some time, and the sooner the better.
Properly operated abattoirs are essential te the
successful raising of stock in Canada. Whether
we can regulate the abattoirs under anti-trust

law or not, I do not know, but we ought to
see to it that the live-stock producer can get
a fair return for the produce he sells.
On motion of Hon. Mr. King, the debate
was adjourned.
GRAIN STORAGE IN PRAIRIE
PROVINCES
REPLY TO INQUIRY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators,
on June 30 the honourable senator from West
Central Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
made an inquiry regarding the supply of
lumber for building elevators and granaries for
the storage of wheat., I have the following
answer:
Arrangements have been made whereby all
but a very small percentage of the production
of lumber in the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and in the northern and
southern interior of British Columbia is to be
made available for use in this area for war
purposes and essential civilian demands, of
which agriculture is considered of major importance. Arrangements have also been made
whereby substantial deliveries of lumber produced in the coastal area of British Columbia
have been and are made available to the Prairie
Provinces.
POSTPONEMENT OF REDISTRIBUTION
CORRESPONDENCE TABLED

Hon. Mr. KING: During the debate last
week on the resolution for an amendment to
the Constitution in order to postpone redistribution, the honourable leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) asked for production
of the correspondence between the Hon.
Premier of Quebec and the Right Hon. Prime
Minister of Canada. At that time I was not
able to comply with his request, as I had
learned that the correspondence was not complete. I now table it.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
very much.

Thank you

OOMMIRTTEE
ON ECONOMIC
RE-ESTABLISHMENT AND
SOCIAL SECURITY
REPORT ADOPTED

Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT presented
and moved concurrence in the third report of
the Special Committee on Economic ReEstablishment and Social Security.
He said: Honourable senators, in moving
concurrence in this report I should like to
point out that adoption of our second report
gave authorization to the committee to hold
sittings during periods when the Senate is
adjourned. It is expected that a sitting of the
committee will be called late in September or
early in October, to confer with a group of
members from the United States Senate and
House of Representatives, as arranged for in
recent negotiations with representatives of
those bodies. Definite dates will be announced
later.
The motion was agreed to.
NAVAL, ARMY AND AIR ADMINISTRATION BUILDINGS ON CARTIER
SQUARE
NOTICE OF INQUIRIES

Hon. C. E. TANNER rose to give notice:
That he will inquire of the Government in
respect to the naval administration building
consisting of three storeys of wood construction
above basement of concrete, situated on Elgin
street, at Laurier avenue, in the city of Ottawa,
what are provided as safeguards against fire,
particularly:
1. Outside fire escapes of wood or metal?
2. Inside fire escapes from each floor, and
what they consist of?
3. Stairways, their dimensions, and whether
of wood or metal?
4. Number of fire hose attachsments on each
floor?
5. Number of ciemnical fire extinguishers on
eaci floor of building?
6. Number of fire watchers on duty day and
night, respectfully?
7. What arrangement or agreement, if any,
exists with the City of Ottawa ;for city fire
service?
S. If there is a sprinkler system, is it installed so as to be effective on the outer wooden
walls of the building?
He said: I have a similar inquiry in respect
to the army administration building, which
is immediately at the rear of the naval
building; also one in respect to the air
service administration building, which is close
up to the army building, and faces on Lisgar
street.
I may explain that I am making these
separate inquiries because I should like to
get answers at an early date. Since three

branches of the fighting services are covered,
if I included the three buildings in one
inquiry, it would be shuffled around from
department to department and very likely
months would elapse before the information
would be forthcoming. I had an experience
of that kind last session, and I do not want
another. In June of last year I put similar
inquiries on the Order Paper. I got an
answer in February of this year, and by then
it was six or seven months behind the times.
I am asking about these buildings because,
while in Ottawa, I reside across the street
from some of them, and I am under the
impression that they have created in a
residential district of the city a tremendous

the safety of the people who work there to
be considered. I do not know how many
there are, but there must be some thousands
employed in those buildings. Finally, the
country has a tremendous investment in those
three buildings. My information is that they
have cost the country, exclusive of the
furnishings, between two and three million
dollars. This is another reason why they
should be thoroughly safeguarded from fire.
MONTREAL PUBLIC ABATTOIRS
MOTION-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
debate on the motion of Hon. Mr. Sauvé:
That whereas serious complaints have been
addressed to the Government, Parliament and
Press concerning certain commercial operations
or proceedings of the Montreal publie abattoirs;
Whereas, if these complaints were well
founded, they would constitute a great injustice
and an intolerable abuse;
In the opinion of this House it is expedient
that the Government ceonsider the advisability
of setting up, if it lias not been made, an
investigation into the said operations and proceedings, under the direction of a commission
competently representing the Government, the
producer and the dealer.
The said commission should prepare, in the
shortest possible time, a complete report of its
investigatton and subnit it te the Government
and Parliament.
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators,
when I moved the adjournment of the debate
last night, since the - scope of the proposed
inquiry had been enlarged by the remarks
of the honourable senator from Saskatchewan

315

North (Hon. Mr. Horner) and the honourable the senior senator from Vancouver
(Hon. Mr. McRae), I intended carrying the
debate over until next week before making
my reply. But my honourable friend from
South Bruce (Hon. Mr. Donnelly) bas intimated that he has a few remarks to make.
I should like, therefore, to clear the way for
him, at the same time reserving my right to
speak next week.
Hon. J. J. DONNELLY: Honourable members of the Senate, it was not my intention to
take part in this discussion, but this morning
it occurred to me that there was one matter
in connection with the production of beef in
Canada that I should like to bring to the
attention of the Senate, and through it before
the members of the Wartime Prices and Trade
Board. I mentioned this to the honourable
leader, and I thank him for waiving his right
and permitting me to speak at this time.
The honourable member from :Rigaud (Hon.
Mr. Sauvé) presented his case very well. He
gave strong evidence in support of it, and,
no doubt, when the Government have an
opportunity to do so they will examine into
it, and we shall kncw better about the merits
of it when we hear from them.
I am in full accord with what the honourable senator from Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr.
Horner) and the honourable senator from
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. MoRae) said in regard
to the packers. They are a close corporation.
We send cattle to Toronto, not exactly for
marketing, as there is no competition, but for
distribution among the packers. The packers,
however, serve a very useful purpose: if we
did not have them to organize the beef trade
and find a market for our cattle, we should
have great difficulty.
It occurs to me that possibly many honourable members from the cities will be somewhat confused when they hear talk about the
grading of hogs. The honourable member
from Vancouver last night showed us that he
had a very thorough knowledge of that practice. I may say a few words along the line
of our pork products. Some thirty-five or
forty years ago the farmers who bred hogs
aimed to get an animal with large hams and
shoulders and plenty of fat; but that practice
had to be modified to meet the tastes of the

ensuing generation.
grew up of producing a long, lean hog, with
a mixture of lean and fat. When we started
sending bacon to the English market we found
it necessary, in order to compete with the
people of Denmark, who excel in the production of bacon, to be very careful about the
type of animal we raised, and there was a
general improvement in the type of hog pro-

SENATE
duced. During the present war that improvement has been carried on to an even greater
extent, for the purpose of fulfilling the requirements of the British Government in regard
to bacon.
Usually a bacon hog, when finished, weighs
from one hundred and eighty to two hundred
and twenty pounds. It is then sent to the
market, as has been explained. After the hog
is killed in the packing plant the carcass is
placed on an overhead track, a rail along
which the carcasses are pulled very fast by
means of pulleys and hooks, and it is while
the carcass is going along the rail that the
inspectors make their inspection. That is why
we speak of rail grade. If the inspectors are
capable and honest, they niake, I think, a fair
:nspection; they may make mistakes, but if
they are honest they balance up. It is important to the producer of the grade to get a
hog of the size I have mentioned, which at
present prices of between sixteen and seventeen cents brings him around S25.
The
standard grades are bacon, but the better
grades are classed as selects.
The packer pays the producer a bonus of
$1 a head over the regular market price for
hogs that are classed as selects. That is the
only bonus the packer gives for the higher
grading-I am speaking principally of what is
donc in Ontario-but the provincial Government, in order to encourage the production of
bacon, has seen fit to give what is called a
hog bonus. Reports are made by the Government inspecto-r and sent in by the producer
within three months, and on the basis of these
the hog bonus branch of the Ontario Department of Agriculture pays the producer $1 a
head for every select hog raised, and 50 cents a
head for every bacon hog. Even if the
animals are of the right weight, the packer
may deduct anything from one to three dollars if they are too fat or, in any other way,
not of the proper type.

tion of bacon. But it is very difficult to increase production of beef. A man may buy a
cow and have her bred, and at the end of the
year have a calf two or three months old, but
it may b another two or three years before
that young animal goes to the market in the
form of beef. Most of our beef is produced
from steers. I make the statement that the
number of steers that will go on the market
to be slaughtered in Canada during the next
two years is now fixed and cannot be increased. The only way to increase production
of beef is to sec to it that every animal is
kept on the farn until fully grown and properly finished.
It might be pointed out that cows and
heifers are also a source of beef. But they are
in a different class. The dry cows that go on
the market are animals that are not paying
their way. When a cow becomes ten or eleven
years old she loses ber teeth, and is ne
longer an efficient machine for turning oats
and hay into milk and for raising calves; so,
net having much value then except as a source
of beef, she is sent to market. As to the
heifers, many of them will be required for
breeding purposes, but in any event it is net
possible to increase their weight properly te
the same dlegree as with steers. A heifer, ta
be handled profitably, must go to the market
at around 900 or 1,000 pounds. If the animal
fattens too quickly, you get what is called
patchy fat, and this commands a lower price
on the market. The fat on a heifer of 1,200
pounds is not palatable. In this respect there
is a big difference between a fat heifer and
a fat steer. I am stating this, not as my own
opinion, but on the authority of a buyer for
the dining-cars of one of the large railways.
He told me his company would not buy a
heifer which dresses more than 600 pounds.
He added that not only is the fat of a heifer
of over 1,200 pounds unpalatable, but it has
a tendency to gag anyone who eats it.

But, as I said a while ago, it was net so
much from a desire to take part in this diebate
that I asked for an opportunity to speak.
The farmers throughout the country are being
urged to make a special effort to increase their
production of foodstuffs of all kinds, including beef and bacon. Now, there is a great
difference between increasing production of
bacon and increasing production of beef. A
stock man can buy a brood sow and have her
bred twice a year, so that she will produce two
litters within twelve months. Sometimes there
are ten or twelve pigs in a litter, but the average is around seven or eight. At the end
of one year he can have seven or eight finished
bacon hogs from one sow. So it will be seen
that it is a simple matter to increase produc-

Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: The reason I am
dwelling on this is to emphasize the point I
have already made, that the only way to iný
crease beef production in this country is to
see to it that all the steers, particularly those
of beef type, are fully grown and properly
finished before being marketed.
I am not speaking for the purpose of criticizing anyone, but there is in connection with
the Food Corporation a situation which I an
going to explain. There is no doubt as to
the facts that I shall state. In 1942, about
this time of year, the corporation, which is
a branch of the Wartime Prices and Trade
Board, started in the business of buying cattle

Hon. Mr. DONNELLY.

Hon. Mr. McRAE:

That is correct.

on the Toronto market. The stock-growers
of this country were very dissatisfied: they
had been barred fromn sending their cattie te
the United States market. In the course of
this debate it bas been said that there is ne
Weii,
competitien arnnng the packers.
farmnerly, if producers did net get what they
considered a reasona;ble price for gond cattie,
they could load thema up and send themn te
Buffalo. For some reason our Gnvernment
saw fit te take away this privilege. I arn
making noexniticisma in cennection with, this;
1 arn simpiy stating the fact that producers
were then prevented from sending their beef
cattie te the United States. When the Fend
Corporation began buying cattie at Toronto,
they paid the drovers eleven, twclve, tweive
and a bal, or, in some cases, thirteen cents
a pound, and resoid the animais te the packers
for two. cents less. Again, I arn net tinding
fauit with what was done, although I think
it is worthy ni consideration. What the
corporation was doing did neot become generai
knowledge for a -week or ten days, and in
tilat tirne our cattie drovers, who are ver.y
shrewd people, saw an, epportunity to, iake
sone meney. They beught up cattle-I arn
speaking new of Western. Ontarie-at the nid
price, took tbem te, Toronto and sold themi
to tbe corporation at .an advanced price that
yieided a profit nf $20 te $25 a head.
When this get rumoured arnund, the livestock producers liecarne very sure about it.
They stili are soe about it to-day. They
have lest confidence in the corporation and,
te some extent, in the Prices Board.
Thers is another point. In the sariy part
«of July iast year I saw net only carloads,
but trainloads, of half-finished cattie being
shipped te the market, because the producers
couid make a gond profit on thsm at that
tinie, at the prices being paid by the corporatien, and wers afraid nf what would happen
later on. As a resuit, thousands of acres nf
grass were isit for the remainder nf the
season with virtualiy ne cattie grazing on thsm.
That had a very serieus sifect on, the production ni beef. To make clear what I mean, I
need oniy give a simple illustration. Suppose
a steer, net properly finishsd, weighs 1,100
pounds at the mniddle nf July. The average
increase in weight nf a healthy steer nf that
type when eut on the pasture is at lsast two
pounds a day. Soesvsry such animal that was
allowed to remain on grass frein the middie
ni Juiy te the middle nf October, a period
ni about ninety days, would -have gained two
hundred pounds in weight. It is easy to see
hew the total production ni beef would have
been very much increased had the animais
siot been sold in the siimmer.

~1

Not only was the beef production considerably iower than it should have beeri, but
there wvas a definite faliing off in the quaiity.
One reason. for that was the announcement
by the Prices Board that the ceiling price of
meat wouid gradually drop every rnonth unti]
the fali, and beef producers were trying to
take advantage of the high price while they
could. In the circumstances they were not
concerned so mucli about the quality as they
were about rnaking a profit.
Ail this bas had a very bad effect. One
resuit is that the cattie-raisers of this country
have net to-day the confidence in the Fond
Corporation and the Prices Board that they
shouid have. Our stock-growers mnust have
more confidence in these bodies befere we can
make a success of producing beef in this
country, and it is the duty of everybody
interested te try te sec that gond relations
are re-established.
While the situation is net se bad to-day as
it was a year age, only last week I, saw
many half-finished cattie being loaded for
the Toronto market, where there was an
advance in the price. What I said about the
cattie that were shipped tee eariy Iast year
is true aise of these-that if they were
permitted te stay on grass until October they
would then weigh twe hundred pounds more
and be of better quality.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: May I ask the, bonourable senater a question? Is it net a faet
that on the lst of August the price nf beef is
to be reduced?
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: The reduction wili
beceme effective on thýe l6th nf August. It
is because of the general belief among cattiedealers of this country that the Food Corporatien is geing te lower the price of beef on
the 16th of August, that se many haif-finished
cattie are being shipped te market now, as
was done last year. The fact is that the
ceiling price wiil net be reduced. It is the
floor price that will be reduced on the l6th
of August. But the nrdinary cattle-producers
throughout the country hear there is te be a
reduction, and they do net bother te inquire
into the particulars as te whether it is the
ceiling price or the floor price that is te be
lowered. Their attitude is that they should
ship their cattie new, before there is any
reduction, and be sure nf getting the present
price.
The floor price. wiil be reduced every month

arguedi in support of its action that it is
cheaper te produce beef from grass than
froma grain. This is net a sound argument.
The board apparentiy forgets that a steer

318

SENATE

has to be from twenty-four te thirty months
old before it is fit to go to market, and must
be fed in the stable for two winters on grain
te do well on grass in the summer months.
But even if the argument were sound, we are
more concerned about results. My contention
is that in order te stop this rushing of halffinished cattle on the market, the Prices
Board should make no reduction in the floor
price and should increase the ceiling price.
Then the beef producers would be glad te
hold their cattle until the fall, and the total
production of beef would be much greater.
The Food Corporation, the Department of
Agriculture, and the Prices Board cannot of
their own action make any material increase
in the production of beef in this country.
They can only secure results by getting the
goodwill and co-operation of the people who
raise our beef te see that the cattle are
properly finished before they go on the market.
I think I explained that there is no possibility of increasing the number that will be
slaughtered for the next two years.
The farmers, as I have said, are not very
well satisfied. They are perhaps wrong in
thinking the situation is as bad as they picture it. As I have tried te explain, it is not
the ceiling price that is being lowered, but the
floor price. But the farmers throughout the
country are under the impression that the
packers take advantage of that situation te
drop the price of cattle.
There is something else that our cattleraisers feel is a grievance. Yesterday's papers
showed that on the Toronto market the better
class of steers were quoted at from $13.50 te
$13.25 per hundred. That is a drop from the
week before. On the same day in Buffalo, for
a similar class of cattle, the quotation was
from $15.70 te $15.75--at least $3 a hundred
more. Our cattle men know they are shut
out of the American market, but they believe
that part of the meat produced from cattle
slaughtered in Buffalo will go te Europe te
feed the soldiers of the United Nations, and
part of the beef from the cattle slaughtered
in this country will also go te the same place.
Our farmers reason that the American farmers
will get $3 more, live weight, for their cattle
which end up in the same market and for the
same purpose as do our cattle.
As I said a short while ago, I should like
the Minister, if he thinks there is any merit
in the case, te use his influence te bring it te
the notice of the Prices Board and te suggest
that there be no reduction in the price of
beef from now on te the fall. If that course
were taken, our people would keep their cattle
on the grass, and, as there is an abundance of
grass, there would be a great increase in the
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY.

total production of beef in this country. That
is the only way te bring about an increase in
production, and also an improvement in the
quality of the beef.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Am I right in thinking
that the floor price is the price to the consumer, or at least the wholesale price?
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY:
price te the trade.

It is the wholesale

Hon. Mr. McRAE: The net result, as I
understand it, is that when the floor price is
reduced, that reduction passes all the way back
te the producer, and in the end is a reduction
on the price te him.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: That is the effect.
I may say that the statement I have made
about ceiling and floor prices I obtained from
the Food Corporation; se there is no question
about its correctness.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Sinclair, the"debate

ADJOURNMENT
DISCUSSION

Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, I
move that when the House adjourns to-day it
stand adjourned until Tuesday, July 20, at
8 p.m.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable members, I
had not intended te raise the objection which
I raised when we last adjourned, but I should
like te ask the Minister what business will be
ready for our consideration next Tuesday?
Hon. Mr. KING:

" Hope springs eternal."

Hon. Mr. HAIG: But the opposition in the
other House control the hope.
Hon. Mr. KING: I think they are hopeful.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Mine may be the only
protesting voice, but I am still objecting to
short adjournments.

Hon. Mr. KING:

Objection registered.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Apparently I am getting
no support, but I intend te continue te raise
objection. The honourable leader opposite
seems te think that because the Government
supporters and the official Opposition in the
other House hope that the session will be
concluded by a certain date, the matter is
settled. But I submit such is not the case.
It is the back-benchers who determine when
the session shall end. To-day we have in
the House of Commons what I may term a
split opposition. I had some experience of
what this means while I was in the Legislature

XJLY 14, 1943
of Manitoba from 1920 to 1935: debates were
twice as long as when there were two parties
only. I think that in fairness to members
who live a long way from the capital our
adjournments should not ho so short. To put
it mildly, it bas been rathor tiresome to have
had to stay in Ottawa since June 29 for the
purposo of doing morely two days' work in
this ýChambor. Now we are again to adjourn,
this time until the 2Oth. Noxt session we
ought to have a promise from the honourable
leader of the buse (Hon. Mr. King) that
consideration will ho givon to the viows I arn
oxpressing. I have been told by members
much senior to myseif in this Chamber that
objections similar to mine have been raised
before, but without rosuit. This may not
afford me encouragement to persiat, but I
shall continue to raiso my voice in proteat
until the improvoment 1 am contonding for
is hrought about. It may ho a mean thing to
do, but I may as woll state now that next
session I intend to cite figures to show just
what bas been donc this session between
adjournments. 1 do not think it is fair to
ask business men to stay bore week after week
with nothing to do, simply hecauso the
House of ýCommons will not givo the Sonate
any. work. At the presont timo tho Gavernmont miglit well have initiatod in this Houso
much of the logisiation now on the Commons
Order Paper, such bis, for oxamplo, as those
to amend the Criminal Code and the
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act. Those
bis could ho deait with in this flouse, and,
if not acceptable when they reacli tho other
Houso, could be amended there. I repeat, it
is unfair to ask members of this Chambor to
remaîn here from week to week with nothing
to do, and again I proteat againat short
adj ournments.
I should like to ask the Ministor whether he
lias any idea as to when the session will be
concluded.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Not this week.
Hon. Mr. KING: My honourable friend has
had sufficient experienco in this Chamber to
know that he is flot voicing any now griovanco.
Soon after Confederation the Sonate had to
complain of the lack of logisiative business.
As I said the other day, and as lias beon
said by otho-r membors, this is flot an ordinary
session of Parliament. Tho country boing at
war, the wholo logisiativo programme this
sossion lias had to. do with war measures, and
naturally such measures must first corne beforo
the olocted mombers of Parliament. As for the
timç, the othor flouse lias takon to conduct its
business, it is noithor within my province

nor that of my honourablo friond to criticize.
We are, I boliovo, nearing the ond of the
session.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. KING: Members of tho Cammons have had the War Appropriation Bill
under discussion for many weeks, and as
they are holding three sittings a day and
intend, I boliovo, to ait noxt Saturday, we
havo gond reason to helieve that the War
Appropriation Bill and other bis will ho
ready for aur consideration whon wo moot next
Tuesday.
We shall adjourn, with the reservation, of
course, that if His Honour the Spoaker
should deem it necossary to summon us back
at an carlier date ho may do so.
Hon. Mr. EUILER: Honourablo senators, 1
miglit make a suggestion, thougli perhaps I
amn out of order. In viow of what the
honourable sonator from Winnipog (Hon.
Mr. Haig) lias said, with whicb I agree to a
certain oxtont, would it flot ho possible,
when there is uncertainty as .to whother or
not there will ho any business beforo us next
week, to authorize the Speaker to notify us
as soon as the leader of the House advîsos
him that there is actually logisiation for us
to deal with? Wo did that hast year. The
summoning of members could ho done at very
amail exponse.
Hon. Mr. KING: The Speaker lias that

Hon. Mr. EULER: Thon I do nat see why
we could not f ollow that course. It would

Hon. Mr. EULER: But because sucli a plan

loase way of running tho business of the
Senato.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: What legisiation is
likely ta corne before us in addition to the
two measures mentionod by the honourable
sonatar from Winnipeg? Is there any
important legislation that we shall have to

it is the intention to proceed with them on
Saturday. The other day I mentioned four
or five such measures.

SENATE

You cannot conduct the Senate on the
assumption of the leader saying, "We will
adjourn until the Speaker calls us." The
Senate in some quarters is not in particularly
good odour now, and that would be a ridiculous position.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No more ridiculous than
at present.
Hon. Mr. KING: I do not think the country
has suffered from the occasional scarcity of
work we have had in the Senate. There have
been two occasions only when we have not
had much business before us. It is all very
well for m.'en with important business cônnections to desire that this Chamber should
adjourn to suit their convenience, but that
is not the primary consideration. Appointment to this Chamber involves certain duties.
In consultation with my honourable friend
opposite (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne), I have tried
as far as possible to meet the convenience of
senators generally. Of course, it is troublesome for my honourable friend from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. Haig) to have to stay here for a
few days, but many of us have had to remain
here throughout the session in order to be
on hand when business reached us from the
other House; and I believe that business bas
been dealt with in a fairly satisfactory manner.
I cannot see any advantage, at all events at
this stage of the session, in raising the objection raised by my honourable friend. We are
nearing the end of the session and there will
be business to transact, and I should not like
to take the responsibility as Government
leader in this Chamber of saying that we
should, adjouri to-day to re-assemble at the
I do not think my
call of the Speaker.
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Euler) would
seriously press that suggestion if he thought
it over.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I do net want to speak
again; I know we are all out of order-Hon. Mr. KING: Then why continue?
Hon. Mr. EULER: I am net the only
offender, if I may say so to my honourable
leader. But what he as said has net moved
me in the slightest. I still believe that what
I suggest would be eminently practicableand it has been done on other occasions.
Hon. Mr. KING: No.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I beg pardon.
Hon. Mr. KING: A date bas always been
fixed, subject to recall by His Honour the
Speaker.
Hon. Mr. EULER: That is what I am
suggesting. I understand that the honourable
Hon. Mr. KING.

leader has fixed a date in his motion, but
that it is to be subject to the call of the
Speaker.
. Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: We have set a fixed
date.
Hon. Mr. EULER: All right.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Perhaps I may
clarify this point. When power was given to
the Speaker te recall the House before the
date fixed for resuming, a specific date was set,
and the members were recalled only if necessity
arose.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Surely that is a distinction without a difference. I apologize to the
House for speaking again, but I feel rather
strongly on the matter. If the House adjourns
to a fixed date, but His Honour the Speaker
has power to call it earlier, what does that
mean? Adjourn to a fixed date if you like, but
fix it sufficiently far away to mean something;
thon, if there is business to b done in the
meantime, the Speaker can call the House.
Hon. Mr. COPP: That leaves it in the
hands of the Speaker te call the House at his
wish and pleasure.
Hon. Mr. EULER: It is net at his will and
pleasure. I bave not changed my opinion that
my suggestion would be worthy of consideratien at another session.
Hou. Mr. CALDER: My understanding of
the situation is briefly this: that any time
during the session when the louse is ad.journed
His Honour the Speaker bas the right to recall
the members if there is any reason for so
doing. Early in the session the House passed
a motion te that effect, and it applies to every
adjournment of the House.
Hon. Mr. EULER: But that is of no value
if you set a date within a few diays.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: It does net make any
difference what the date is. As I understand
it, the object of the motion passed was to
provide a means whereby the Speaker could at
any time during an adjournment call the
House together, if necessary, and without any
separate motion to that effectHon. Mr. KING: That is right.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: -or
for it every time.

without providing

Hon. Mr. EULER: If the motion before us
passes-and I am confident it will-we shall
meet on Tuesday next, and the power given
the Speaker to recall the House is of use only
if we adjourn to a fixed date at some distance
in the future.

SOLDIER VOTE IN ONTARIO ELECTION
INQUIRY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. G. V. WHITE: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are proceeded
with, I wish to direct the attention of the

JULY 20, 1943
honourable leader of the Senate ta, an article
which appeared in this morning's Press under
the caption, "Reserves in camp not able ta
vote." It readis:
Toronto, July 19.-(CP)-Major Mlex Lewis,
Clerk of the Legislative Assembly, said to-night
that memibers of Reserve Arrny units in M.D.
No. 3 with headquarters in Kingston, who leave
for camp at Connaught Ranges, near Ottawa,
July 25, will not have the opportunity ta. vote
in the August 4 Ontario general election.
Major Lewis said the situation was caused
by the fact that official nomination day is fixed
for July 28-three days after the reserve units
have gone ta camp. Ballots cannot be printed
until after ýthe officiai nominations and therefore
it is impossible for the men ta vote in advance
poils.
Reserve units in M.D. No. 1, London, and
M.D. No. 2, Toronto, may vote in advance polis
July 31, day before they leave for their twoweek camp.
Although he could give no detailed estimate
of the numbers involved in the Kingston military district, Major Lewis said they comprised
several units.
In view of that announcement, will the necessary steps be taken by the Government to
make sure that these men of the Reserve
Army are not deprived of their franchise on
August 4? Recently I had the privilege of
witnessing several units of the Reserve Armiy
at o-ne 9f the training centres, and I was
much impressed by the manner ini which the
men responded ta the intensive training which
tbey are compelled ta undergo. These men
corne from mnany walks of life. A large number
of them served in the Iast war, and sanie are
professional. men and business men. They have
made considerable sacrifice in becoming part
of the Reserve Army and do.ing their share of
this train.ing, and I think it would be an
injustice if they were not permitted ta exercise
their franchise.
Hon. Mr. KING: It would be difficult for
me ta give a definite answer ta. my honourable
friend. The provincial Legislature has made
provision for men overseas ta vote by proxy,
but I do, not believe that provision would
apply ta men in Canada. It would seem ta
me, speaking off-hand, that if the Government
undertook ta bring back ta the province by
the 4th of August ail Ontario men who have
joined the variaus branches of the armed
services, it would be a tremendous undertaking, because undoubtedly these men are scattered from. Newfoundland ta Alaska.
1 shall be glad ta bring my honourable
friend's remarks ta the attention of the
Minister of Defence. 1 know he will be most
sympathetic if a plan cau be worked aut
whereby these men are able ta exercise their
franchise. But we must remember that we are
72542-21J

323

at war, and these men are in the armed services. If their return ta Ontario by the 4th
of August. would interfere with the work of
the services, I arn very doubtful if the
Department of Defence would be inclined
ta consider the matter favourably. However,
that is but my personal. opinion. As I have
already said, I shaIl bring my honourable
friend's questions ta the attention of the
Minister of Defence and also of the Government.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: I should like ta draw
my honourable friend's attention ta the fact
that I was referring ta the Reserve Army.
These men are ail in camps within the
province.
Hon. Mr. RING: In the Reserve Army
only?
Hon. Mr. WHITE: Yes.
Hon. Mr. KING: What about men in the
other divisions who would like to exercise
their franchise?
Hon. Mr. WHITE : Men who are in the
active forces?
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: Surely some provision
is being made ta enable them to vote by
proxy.
Hon. Mr. RING: Not in Canada, I think.
Hon. Mr. WHIITE: The first battalion of
the regîment with which. 1 have been associated for many years was doing coastal duty
down in the eastern part of Canada until
recently, and now it has been moved ta
Western Canada. Surely the men in that
battalion will not be deprived of their
franchise.
Hon. Mr. KING: I amý not sure what provisions were made by the Ontario Legisiature.
I understand that there is provision for men
overseas ta vote by proxy, but 1 amrn ot sure
about this. My honourable frîind would know
better than I.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: My understanding
is that provision'has been made for voting by
proxy by ail Ontario residents who are on
active service outside the province. What my
honourable frîend from Pembroke (nlon. Mr.
White) is referring to is the Reserve Army,
wbich is undergoing training at variaus camps
in Ontario. The point he makes, as I understand, às that, these men being in uniform, the
Government bas some responsibility for seeing
that they get a reasonable opportunity ta vote.
0f course, the voting is really a provincial
matter.

seems to me, require furthor oxplanation.

The honourable senator from Rigaud mentioncd two peints whicb I thought shouid be

I askel lthe the Departmcnt cf Agriculture te

duties in the departmnent. The

addressed ocrer rcached him, but was answered
by Mr. Baird, the man who succeeded hima on

Hon. Mr. SAUVE: I wrcte to Mr. Peterson

Hon. Mr. SAUVE: Yes.

JULY 20, 1943

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I cite that in order
to show that there was no oversight by Mr.
Peterson or the department in -attending to
the honourable senator's letter. It was given
proper attention by Mr. Baird, Assistant
Director of Live Stock and Poultry Products
with the Wartime Prices and Trade Board,
the letter having been addressed to Mr.
Peterson, Administrator of Live Stock and
Live Stock Products with the Wartime Prices
and Trade Board.
The honourable senator from Rigaud made
a serious reflection on an official in the Montreal abattoirs, to whom he .referred both on
April 15 and July 13 when he brought this
matter before the Senate. He stated that an
official had offered $5 to a farmer in settlement of a dispute in regard to the price
received for hogs sent to the abattoirs, the
farmer being dissatisfied with the grading. I
asked the department for any particulars it
might have in regard to this complaint, and
I have in my .hand a translation of a letter
addressed by the grader, Paul Laliberté, to
the supervising grader, Mr. R. K. Bennett.
I may explain that the method of the
department in handling the grading of hogs
at abattoirs is the same all over Canada. The
supervising grader checks the grader's work as
often as possible, the main purpose being to
secure uniformity and to prevent any failure
on the grader's part to conforin with the
regular practice. This is the letter:
Montreal, Dec. 29, 1942.
Mr. R. K. Bennett,
Supervising Grader,
316 Bridge Street,
Montreal.
Re Sale of 8 Hogs by Mr. A. Godin at the
Eastern Market, on Nov. 17, 1942.
Dear Sir:
In reply to your request I wish to submit the
facts of this case.
On November 17, 1942, Mr. A. Godin, of St.
Eustache, came to the East End Market to sell
8 hogs (A. Sarrazin, trucker). After having
made inquiries regarding the price Mr. Godin
agreed to sell his hogs to Modern Packers for
$16.45 per 100 lbs. dressed.
These hogs were killed in a lot of 42, conprising 39 straight hogs and 3 sows. The carcasses were graded as follows: 2 A's, 4 Bl's and
2 Ridgelings, with a total hot weight of 1,228
l'bs., and were settled for by the buyer as
ind.icated on the attached settlement sheet and
grading certificate.
When he came to the market some time later
Mr. Godin pretended that there was approximately $20 coming to him. This represented
the difference between the value of the hogs
on a basis of live weight without taking the
grade into consideration, as compared, with the
net amount on the settlement.
The tickets were checked in the presence of
Mr. Godin and Mr. Sarrazin and I added up

the individual weights on the tickets. Everything was found to be in order as shown on
the grading certificate and the settlement.
Mr. Godin then met Mr. Morris Pinsky, chief
buyer for Modern Packers. The latter, after
having listened to Mr. Godin's story and having
checked everything, stated that everything was
in order and that he owed this farmer absolutely
nothing. He added, however, that, considering
the fact that Mr. Sarrazin was a regular shipper
and that he wislied to keep his goodwill, he
was willing to offer him $5 out of his own
pocket. Mr. Godin refused this offer, demanding
that he -be paid the difference as represented by
the live weight, 1,750 lbs., at $12.60.
As Mr. Godin chose to sell his hogs on a
basis of dreised weight, it would seem that the
only point in question is whether the dressed
weight of 1,228 lbs. is correct. It is evident
that this is the case as proved by the following
facts.
(1) The automatic scale was checked in the
regular manner before the kill on Thursday,
the 19th November, 1942, and I found it to be
exact.
(2) It is true that it was impossible for
me to clearly read the tattoo mark Y 773 on
one of Mr. Godin's hogs because this had been
accidentally shaved up on the killing floor.
However, as all the hogs in the lot of 42 were
clearly tattooed each lot checked out; this left
only the lot of 8 for me to complete, and, I
am absolutely certain that the hog bearing no
number belonged to Mr. Godin.
(3) The yield of the lots of hogs killed at
the same time and in the same lot of 42 is about
the average; for example, the 18 hogs from Mr.
A. Emond, of Glengarry, yielded 76.2 per cent.
There is always the possibility that an error
was made at the time the hogs were weighed
alive.
For your information I wish to point out that
the tickets are not on file because the buyer
for Modern Packers who asked for these tickets
in order to make a check gave them to Mr.
Sarrazin, who has not brought them back.
Yours very truly,
(Sgd.) Paul Laliberté,
Grader.
I think that explains the situation. The
farmer could not very well come back and
claim a settlement on a live weight basis after
having agreed with the trucker to sell his hogs
on the dressed weight basis.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE:
Godin's statement.

That

was

Mr.

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: According to this
statement the $5 was offered, not by an official
of the Government, but by Mr. Sarrazin, a
trucker who sells hogs in this way.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE:

Oh, no.

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: That is the explanation I have been given. If further information
is required, the proper way to get it would be,
I think, as I have already suggested, at the
beginning of next session.

326

SENATE

I may explain-though perhaps I have explained sufficiently-that the graders keep a
very close check on the scales at the abattoirs.
They are responsible for checking the scales at
the beginning of every kill. If the kill is a large
one, they check at intervals during the course
of the kill. The scales used at all the abattoirs
are automatic and punch a ticket which is
given to the grader, and it is available to the
owner of the stock, or the man who bas purchased them; so there is not much chance for
differences to occur in that regard.
It has been suggested that the producer
should be represented at the taking of the
weights. That is a reasonable suggestion; but
in all the stock-yards and abattoirs in eastern
and central Canada the producers' organizatians are quite active. I am not so well
posted about those of the West, and cannot speak about them. I know that in our
province we have a live stock board, which
is a farmers' organization. It sells hogs for
the members to the Moncton abattoir or in
Montreal, according to the market. There is
a similar board in New Brunswick, and in the
province of Quebec there is a large farmers'
organization known as the Co-operative
Fédérée, which, I think, in 1942, sold about
forty per cent of the hogs sold at the
Montreal abattoir, either through the stockyards or direct. These producers' organizations have
representatives watching the
business going through the stock-yards and
abattoirs where they deem it necessary. Also,
in Ontario there is the organization of the
United Farmers of Ontario, which is co-operative. With all these organizations representing the producers, I do not see that much
is to be gained by having representatives
appointed in other ways ta watch the weights
in stock-yards or abattoirs.
A point that is worthy of consideration is
this. The inspection of the weights is of
benefit to both parties to the bargain. If the
scales are weighing over, it is to the benefit
of the packing house to have them tested;
if they are weighing under, the testing is to
the benefit of the other party. In other
words, it is in the interest of both sides that
the scales be right. I do not think there
is anything that would induce either party to
tamper with the scales, and I feel quite sure
that reasonable precautions are taken by the
Department of Agriculture, through its representatives, to see that this business is carried
out in a manner which is fair to both parties.
Something has been said about the competition that takes place at the stock-yards.
There may be some grounds for suspicion or
dissatisfaction in that regard. But the fact is
that the stock-yards are largely owned by
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR.

private companies. The stock-yards at Montreal are owned largely, I think, by the railways; those in Toronto are operated by a
joint stock oampany. The packing houses or
abattoirs really have no interest in the stockyards in the East, and I think the same is
true in Winnipeg. As to those farther west, I
cannot say.
Hon. Mr. HORNER:
May I ask
honourable gentleman a question?
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR:

the

Yes.

Hon. Mr. HORNER: Does the honourable
gentleman state positively that the packers are
not interested in or part owners of the stockyards?
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: The information I
have is that the stock-yards at Montreal are
owned by the railways, and at Toronto by a
joint stock company. At one time it was an
American company.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: They are owned by
the railways, and various packing companies
have a certain interest in their operation.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR:
The railways are
responsible for the operation of the yards
that they own, and the commission men and
speculators who operate there are licensed and
bonded by the Department of Agriculture. If
any irregularities occur they are immediately
brought to the notice of the yard by the
department, and if the Exchange-which is an
organization of those interested in dealing in
the yard-does not discipline the offenders, the
department does.
Hon. Mr. HORNER:

Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR:
The honourable
member may laugh, but these are the explanations I have received from the official who is
in charge of the control and inspection of
stock-yards.
I think it is a good thing for a discussion
of this kind to occur in this House or in the
other branch of Parliament, because it brings
out the facts. Earlier in the session, as I
have said, we could have had representatives
of both sides appear before a committee and
give us information.
At our last sitting the honourable senator
from South Bruce (Bon. Mr. Donnelly) spoke
about the setting of the price on beef and
cattle products, the effect it might have, and
did have, in encouraging producers to market
cattle before they were properly finished, the
waste of pasture, and the fact that the producers could have got more weight and more
money at an even price. The information
I have in that regard is as follows:

cattle to the States. As I say, I simply stated
what I considered to be the facts, and what I
still believe were the facts. I feel that it was
the duty of the Food Corporation to give more
information in regard to what they proposed
to do. Had such information been given, the
drovers could not have made a profit of $20
and $25 a head on cattle, as they actually did.
That is a matter of common knowledge to
people who traded at the Toronto stockyards at that time. I mentioned it to a
member of the Food Corporation, and he did
not contradict it. I believed when I was
speaking, and I still believe, that if the course
I suggested had been taken, the quantity of
beef produced in this country would have been
greatly increased and the quality much improved. After all that has been said by the
honourable senator from Queen's (Hon. Mr.
Sinclair), I am still of that opinion. I do not
think he has answered what I said in that
regard.
I stated that I had seen half-finished cattle
being sent in large quantities to the Toronto
market. The honourable senator mentions the
increase in weight of animals sold this year, as
compared with those sold last year. That is
quite natural. It is very difficult to get stock
nowadays, and farmers prefer to grow their
cattle to a larger size than formerly. There
is not the same proportion of baby beef going
to market that there used to be. I presume
that all honourable senators know what is
meant by this term. If an animal is given
all the food it can take for about twelve
months, and is sent to the market when it
weighs about 700 or 800 pounds, it will make
good beef and, prior to the war, it would have
commanded a price of three or four cents a
pound higher than other beef. But that is not
so to-day. There is no premium for this class
now, with the result that a great many cattlemen continue to feed their animals until they
weigh 1,200 or 1,400 pounds.
I repeat that I did not criticize anyone. I
pointed out what I believed to be the facts,
and what I still believe to be the facts. Even
though the theory about feeding on grass
should be sound, what we want are practical
results. And we shall get more practical results, to the benefit of all concerned, if the
price is maintained until the fall and our
cattle-growers are thereby induced to keep
their animals on grass until that time, when
they will have become considerably heavier
and will be in prime condition.
Honourable
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN:
senators, I have followed this debate from its
beginning with much interest. I think that
with the exception of the mover of the motion
(Hon. Mr. Sauvé), I am the only one to take
72542-22

part in the debate who is not in the live-stock
business in some form or other. I come from a
part of the country where a great deal of live
stock is raised, and I frequently hear criticisms
of methods that are followed in the marketing
of live stock, but I am not in a position to say
whether these criticisms are justified or not.
My purpose in rising is to support, as.
strongly as I can, the suggestion that has been
made by my desk-mate (Hon. Mr. Sinclair),
that next session the Senate might carry on an
inquiry into live-stock marketing, and particularly with respect to some of the charges
that have been made in the course of this discussion. Serious charges were made by the
honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr.
McRae) with regard to grading and the
methods of buying followed by the packing
houses. He also made the very serious charge
that through a deal in the purchase of pork
from Chicago, some packers split a million,
dollars. I feel these allegations are so serious
that they should be inquired into, for the purpose of removing any impressions that might
cause unrest among the producers of the
country.
The honourable senator from Saskatchewan
North (Hon. Mr. Horner) made some charges
that, in my judgment, are fully as serious, and
I think they also should be inquired into. I
have said before, and I want to repeat, that in
my opinion this Senate could very well devote
itself to inquiries of this character, rather than
refer them to judicial commissions. We have
a Committee on Agriculture under the very
competent chairmanship of the honourable
member from South Bruce (Hon. Mr. Donnelly), who has just spoken. He is well informed on all aspects of the live-stock business,
and the other members of the committee are
all practical agriculturists. If it is necessary to
have an investigation of this kind, we could
add to that committee. Before it could be
summoned officials of'the Department of Agriculture and of the Wartime Prices and Trade
Board, as well as officers of farmers' organizations and representatives of the packing interests and any others against whom charges are
made. I am confident the inquiry would be
thorough and would place before the public the
actual conditions in our stock-yards and
abattoirs. In that way we could contribute
something towards satisfying those who are
complaining, and if the paêkers have a good
case they would be able to present it and
clear the air.
Hon. DUNCAN McL. MARSHALL: Honourable senators, I was not able to be here
on the two occasions when this matter was

brought up by my honourable friend from
Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Sauvé), but I read the
debates and was greatly interested in the fact
that the discussion had broadened out and
taken in almost the whole live-stock business, including marketing. My only excuse
for saying anything at this time is that for
more than fifty years I have been a constant
marketer of cattle, having bought them in
stock-yards from Toronto to Calgary, and sold
them from Calgary to Merklands wharf at
Glasgow. I never allow three weeks to pass
by without spending a forenoon in the Toronto
market. When I was in business with an
advertising agency its partners wondered why
I wanted to tramp around the stock-yards.
I said that it made me feel as though I were
back home on the farm; that I understood
beasts and as a matter of fact preferred their
company.
Last Monday I spent the forenoon in the
Toronto stock-yards. I had a commission from
a personal friend to buy half a dozen steers,
and I would have bought them for the mere
pleasure of doing it, but I could not sec the
kind of beasts to turn out on grass. To-day
there is such an abundance of feed in the
country that anybody who has decent cattle
is grazing them himself.
I think one of the difficulties concerning
packers and buyers and drovers of cattle is
that before a yard becomes big enough to be
run like the Toronto stock-yards a good many
things happen that would not bear the light of
day. Truckers and traders and scalpers get
into small yards and, in their eagerness to make
a dollar, lay for everybody who comes in with
a beast to sell. At large stock-yards such
as those in Toronto the cattle are weighed on
electrically-operated scales.
When I sold
beasts there I never went down to sec them
weighed, because the weight is stamped on
tickets in triplicate, and there can be no
humbug about it. Every once in a while, as
the scales get dirty, they are swept clean, and
balanced for accuracy.
One of the difficulties which caused the
trouble that my honourable friend bas brought
to our attention has been the changing over
fron grading hogs alive to grading on the rail.
Some farmers strogly re-ented that change.
I know of no place where they resented it
more than in the province of Alberta, where
I lived for nearly twenty years. They did
not want any rail grade. They wanted their
hogs graded by a Government grader of
course, but graded alive. But in order to
compete in the British market with the farmers
of Denmark-as we had to do before the war
-we
must produce the highest class of
Wiltshire sides, and anybody familiar with
Hon.

Mr. MARSHALL.

the pork busineqs knows that that can only
be donc provided you have rail grade; that
is, you must see the inside of the pig, particularly its back fat. Do yen know, they go se
far in Denmark as to measure the back fat?
It must not be less than 1- inches nor more
than 12 inches in depth, or the grade goes
down. The farmers in Denmark have the
most exact system of grading, as well as the
finest system of breedling pigs for Wiltshire
sides, in the world.
When I went into the smoke-house in
Smithfield market in the city of London and
watched Canadian sides of bacon handled
there. I used to sec a lot of short sides, and
invariably on inquiring I found they came
from Alberta. This was because there were
many farmers in that province who had come
from the United States, where they had been
used to breeding thick, fat hogs, and if a hog
got beyond a certain length they thought his
back would go down and be would not be any
good. So they liked their hogs short, as we
like our beef cattle, for the shorter they are
the better they are: yeu can get more good
cuts out of them. But the longer the back
of the hog between the hams and the
shoulders the better, as that is where you get
vour expensive cuts of bacon. Your pig in the
pen must have a good, arched back, for if he
bas that kind of back he will have a level
covering of fat-not flesh. There is a difference between flesh and fat. Flesh is the lean
meat. Flesh is protein; fat is just fat. That
is why' the Englishman is particular about
the kind of bacon he has on his breakfast
table, and if you do not give him a proper
percentage of protein in his bacon he will buy,
not from you, but from the Dane. He cannot
buy much from the poor Dane now, but
before the war England was getting its largest
importations of bacon from Denmark.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Are you going to tell
us how the farmers of Denmark secured that
market-by the producers owning the abattoirs and by co-operation?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: There is no doubt
the Dane did this job better than anybody
else could. I might answer my honourable
friend now by saying this:
I have always
held that rail grading should net be done until
the Department of Agriculture at least controlled the abattoirs.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: The department
should have the kind of control over the
abattoirs that would be almost equivalent
te owning them. I do net know how successful this would be. Goodness knows we have

get all the time it is on. We ought to pay
the sane price from start to finish, and sec
the thing through on that basis." The board
have fixed the selling price of cattle now at
$19.50, with 50 cents added when they are
defatted.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: How about the sane
price all over the country?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: Prices are regulated
as a matter of geography in freights in the
large stock-yards in Calgary, Edmonton and
other places.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: A great part of the
beef is consumed out there in the army
camps and training fields.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: We cannot help
that. They will not starve themselves to
death, and we would not ask them to.
This would not be the first investigation
of our packers. My honourable friend will
remember that a colleague of his, Hon. H. H.
Stevens, at one time undertook to investigate the packers, and he got fired out of a
Cabinet for his pains. It is dangerous to
attack the packers.

some Government institutions that do not
make very much money, and maybe there
would be a bad time if the department went
into the pork-packing business. In Denmark
all but two little factories are owned by the
farmers themselves, and all the money those
factories make out of bacon goes back to
the farmers. But then the Danes seem to be
able to do what we should find very difficult:
they make every farmer live up to his bargain,
and if he brings in a hog that is too heavy
he just has to take it back home and eat it
himself.
I have had some experience of buying and
selling cattle and also of stock-yards. I know
something of the Danish system, although I
was never in Denmark. It may surprise some
of my honourable friends to know that I have
a boy who spent three months in Denmark,
riding about the country on his bicycle visiting
pork factories. He was attending Oxford University at the time and was preparing, in connection with his course in economics, a thesis
on the marketing of pigs. So you see pigs still
run in the Marshall family. It used to be
cattle. If you read some of Crockett's tales you
would find that my forbears were the finest
lifters of cattle that ever crossed the borders of
the hated Sassenach. Now we have to get
along with pigs and pork. I had the surprise of
my life from my boy when he told me: "At
Oxford I shall specialize in agricultural
economics. I shall go to Denmark and make
a report on the Danish bacon factories." I
may say that it was a good report; at least
Oxford University thought his thesis merited
the degree of Bachelor of Literature.

And let me prophesy that baby beef is going
to be cheaper. There will be a smaller difference between the price of baby beef and the
price of heavy cattle; and I think that is
proper in times like these, when we want
most of our cattle grown up and the greatest
production of beef we can get. When I was
on the market a week ago Monday I saw
some very nice babies sold for $13.25; then I
saw two sliisy white-faced cattle that were
just somewhat slippery, not more than half fat,
selling for the same price. The idea was to
get all the red meat out of these fellows;
they had not laid on much tallow, but they
were smooth and nice, and were selling at the
same price as babies. That would not have
happened before the war began, or before
these prices were set.
A ceiling having been put on, there is now a
floor. I am not worried much about the
floor. I talked to two or three buyers, and
all agreed that they would not do any rollerskating on the floor. You cannot bring cattle
into the Toronto market now and hold them
very long: someone will grab them quickly,
and at a good price. While there is a floor
to which the packer can come down in case
a flood of cattle cornes on the market at one
time, I have not much fear that it will affect
matters in any way. This price will prevail
until next spring; what will happen after
tha,t I cannot prophesy.
Cattle are now about three cents a pound
higher in Buffalo than in Toronto; but we
have to remember that even in the best of
times a cent and a half would have to be
paid for duty.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Tbere is ten per cent
on the money as well; $10 on every $100.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: Yes, but most of
the cattle sold on the Buffalo market are
taken there by Buffalo men who come over
to Toronto and get them.
As the honourable senator from South Bruce
pointed out, the bonus, handled as it was, was
a mistake. The price boards found they were
not getting the beef; so after they had prohibited the export they decided they must do
something, and they appointed two men to
judge the cattle. I must say they appointed
men who knew cattle, and although I dropped
into the yards a good many times I never
heard a complaint while they were placing the
cattle. They said, "These are fit for export,
and these others are net," and on those that
were fit they paid a bonus of the difference
between the Buffalo market and the Toronto
market, less the duty. But, as my honourable
friend said, before the farmer found this out
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL.

-for the farmer is a busy fellow-he very
often sold to drove-rs. They, I suppose, are
just like any other class of people-members
of the Senate or of the House of Commonsand there are among them some smart fellows
who take advantage of their friends if they
can.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: So they started out
te buy these .cattle. When they went te the
farmer, he said, "Have prices been raised?"
They said, "Oh, no, no," and looked very
gloomy; "the ceiling is still on, and it doesn't
look as if it were going to be raised." They
did not mention the bonus, but bought the
cattle and took them te Toronto and made
from $20 te $25 a head on them. But they
very nearly got hanged for their pains, after it
was all over, and because they got caught at
the job they are not as popular as they were.
They took some money from the farmer,
and he learned of it.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: The majority of buyers I know were sent out and financed by the
various packers, and they knew full well what
they were doing to the farmers.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: I could name half
a dozen buyers in Ontario who are net, and
do net have to be, financed by the packers.
They can get all the money they want from
the banks.
They are farmers as well as
drovers.
If the honourable senator from
London (Hon. Mr. Little) were here, he could
name half a dozen such men in his district.
There are very few packers' buyers. The trend
is away from packers' buyers.
The rail grading in the abattoirs makes for
the marketing of pigs direct to the abattoir.
That is why we need more regulation than we
have, to cover the marketing of pigs. The
practice of taking pigs te a stock-yard and
housing them there and selling them is net
general at the present time. We did get a
somewhat sorry deal with regard te pigs at
the beginning of the war. Incidentally, while
speaking on this subject, I have a compliment to pay to the honourable senator from
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae), on the address
he delivered in this Chamber the other day.
I am sorry he is net in his place. Since the
war began there has been nothing more
important to Canadian swine breeding than the
importation of stock from England. There is
only one place in the world where we can
get stock to mate up with ours to improve
our Wiltshire sides: I refer to England and te

know about them before. After all, no man can
keep track of everything that is going on, and
whenever I have stumbled on something like
that I have always considered it my business
to pass on the information ta the proper persons, whatever Government may be in power.
Two men introduced the grading of pigs
into Canada. The late Dr. Tolmie was the
Minister of Agriculture who had the legislation put through, and Hon. Mr. Motherwell
was the Minister who put it into force.
I had the pleasure, over twenty-five or thirty
years, of intimate acquaintance and friendship
with both these men. Canada has never had
better public servants than Dr. Tolmie, both
while he was in the Health of Animals Branch
and afterwards when he was Minister of Agriculture, and Mr. Motherwell, as Minister in
his own province and, later, in the Dominion
of Canada. These were men to whom I could
go and talk. They deserve great credit for
first establishing the grading of pigs. Upon
grading depended our ability to remain in the
British market. We either had to get better
pigs and better Wiltshire sides, or we could
not live in that market, for the British could
import from Denmark tremendous supplies of
better quality than we were producing. For
several years the pigs were graded alive. This
method was reasonably satisfactory. Of course,
some people were not pleased about it. Everybody thinks that he has the finest pig in the
fair, and that the other fellow's pig beat his
only because that other fellow had sent this
judge a ham ahead of time. Human nature is
the same, no matter how, when and where you
have to deal with it; so there are always
people who will complain.
As I have said, Dr. Tolmie introduced the
bill for grading, and Mr. Motherwell afterwards
enforced it very effectively. Then we came
down to the point where rail grading had to
be introduced. I held the opinion, and I
expressed it without any hesitation, as I
express it here to-day, that we should have
had better control over the abattoirs before
rail grading was fully established. But it is
fully established. All the abattoirs have to
rail-grade now, and the Government is making
efforts to protect the people as much as
possible. The hog-growers mentioned by my
honourable friend from Rigaud (Hon. Mr.
Sauvé), in his motion and his address, are
unknown to me, and I do not know anything
more about the facts than he has stated. I
have no right to question his statements, and
I do not. I think the most damaging admission in that connection was that somebody did
cough up five dollars. That is not very much
money, but somebody felt he had to keep
somebody else quiet, and I think a case in
which that happens should be investigated.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL.

I will tell you of an idea that I have held
for a considerable period. This is no time
to ask that it be put into effect, since it would
be a physical impossibility to get the men
just now, but I should like to sec a troubleshooter, if I may call him that, in every large
abattoir; a man with full authority to settle
disputes, one selected in some manner satisfactory both to the buyer and the seller. He
may not be a producer, but it does not matter
what he is, so long as he is the right man.
I have one such man in mind. He has never
fed a pig in his life, but I should like to see
him placed in one of the big abattoirs, to
put these fellows right and keep them straight.
And he would do it. There were, as was said
by my honourable friend from Queen's (Hon.
Mr. Sinclair), a number of farmers on the
Bacon Board. But these men, sitting in with
a group of packers skilled in the business, could
not know much about it; they could only
understand it in a general kind of way.
I had something to do with packing plants,
if you please. I had a packing plant left at
my door-step once. When I became Minister
of Agriculture for Ontario I found that the
Barrie Co-operative Packers had shut down.
They were not buying any more pigs-and you
cannot make bacon without pigs. I got a
wire from them saying their board of directors
would like to see me. I said, "All right, you
may see me." They named a day, and in the
meantime I inquired what kind of fix they
were in, as I had no knowledge of it. I found
that several years previously the provincial
Government had given them a loan of $25,000,
on which they had made no payments of principal -or interest, and it had guaranteed them
for $25,000 more at a bank in Barrie. They
had run out of funds and, being at the end
of their tether, could net buy any more pigs.
The board of directors came to my office and
made a proposition to me. It was that I
guarantee them to the extent of $25,000 or
$50,000, and give them a chance to make good.
I said, "I will do it only on one condition, that
you find a new manager, a fellow who can run
your business successfully." They told me they
had a good manager and that he was right there
with them. I replied: "I never saw him before,
and I do not care who he is or what he thinks
of me, but I know from the way he is running
the Barrie Packers that the packing business
is not his business. His business is in some
other line, and he had better find out what it
is. So far as I am concerned, I will net
recommend the advancement of public money
while he is manager of the company. You
find a man who is satisfactory to me, and I
will try to get the money for you." In two
or three weeks' time they came back and re-

JULY 20, 1943
ported they could not got a man. 1 had
expected they would have this difficulty and
had mysoîf dono a little looking around. I
asked them if they would let me name the
manager. Thoy stated they would. I said:
"Will you keep your bande off him when lie
goes in there? Ho will not go in otherwise."
They agreed to that.
I chose a Mr. Morrison, who worked for
Canada Packers for a number of years and
was a particiilarly good saiesman. One trouble
with the Barrie Packers had been that, thougli
they made good bacon, they could not soul it.
I quizzed this man Morrison as to what large
sales of bacon lie had made in recent years.
Ho said: "Woll, the Barrie Packers, for
example, go up against the wall every once in
a whule, and they have a fire sale of their
bacon. I go up, buy it and market it." I
was satisfied as to lis ability, and engaged
him. Ho went in, ran the packing plant, paid
off a good share of the $25,000, and the firm
was guaranteed for another $100,000 at the
bank, with the interest reduced by two per
cent. I remember that when 1 told the bank
manager the interest had to be reduced by
two per cent, lie said lie could nover agree
to that. 1 replied: "Well, there are other
banks in Canada. I shall have to try one of
them." Thon ho asked me to see him the noxt

plant in Barrie is a first-olass success to-day.
These things are aIl matters of the human
equation, of getting the proper man to do the
job well. Had we got for the Barrie plant
somebody who was not much good, lie probably would have lost more money. I do not
know how dangerous the packing business is
for farmers to got into. The farmers in Barrie
have learned a lot about it, because tliey put
up thoir own liard-earned money to build the
plant. It was not built on fresh air and
exorcise.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I should like to
ask the honourable sonator what this lias to
do with the motion beforo the House.
It lias everyHon. Mr. MARSHALLthing to do witli it, for I amn showing the
difficulties you corne against when you undertake to figlit the packers. The first thing
that liappened after this man took charge of
tlie Barrie plant was that the packers in Toronto sent buyers up to Barrie to buy pigs
at ton cents a liundred pounds more than the
market price. I will tell you of somneone else
who went up. The Farmers' Co-operative

335

Company had a buyer at the stock-yards in
Toronto, and.he went up, as the representative of one farmer's co-operative, to try to
trim the bide off another farmers' co-operative.
Ho also paid ton cents a hundred pounds more
for the pigs. Now, there was elearly something wrong. Either these fellows wore paying
too mucli at Barrie, or they were robbing the
farmors fromn whom they bought at Toronto.
We had a meeting or two about it, and finally
tho packers got tired of this kind of competition when they found out that our man
was making a success of the plant.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Even now your cooperative plant is perhaps fortunate in business simply because of the war.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: No. It was right
on its feet before Hitler oven thoýught of striking a blow.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I know of littie flour
mills that were put out of business by the
same methods.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: Maybe they did
not have the rigbt kind of manager.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: No man, can, make a
success of selling flour at a dollar below the
cost of production.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: That is the sort
of thing you will have to fight, and it is just
the sort of thing that causes the trouble
mentioned in this motion. If you start in to
fight those fellows, unless you can really do
something to themn your second state is würse
than your first.
1 stili commenci my suggestion to the powers
that be, that a man should be appointed to
rnvestigate complaints against packing plants
and try to find out the truth about them
riglit then. It is no good to make inquiries
a year after the trouble bas happoned. If a
man feele lie lias been trimmed, by the
packers, give him an opportunity to go to an
investigator with bis complaint, which should
be dealt with prom.ptly. Then you will get
somewhere.
I am afraid my hon ourablo friendis are
getting tireci of my little dissertation on pigs
and cattle. In these mattors, however, in my
time, I have done a few things to the packers.
Before the war the Barrie Co-operative and
myself did rather well against the packers;
so well that they were willing to quit. But
it is not an easy job to undertake, and if you
undortake. it the paekers will have no kindly
feeling towarde you. Hon. H. H. Stevens

SENATE
was -one of the best men who ever fought
those interests in the House of. Commons. I
am prepared to grant that much to him.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Heuar, hear.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: He carried on the
fight so well that finally someone could not
stand it any longer, and lie had to drop out
of the Government. To those reconstruction
and re-establishment committees, who organized corporations with a capitalization of
$200,000,000, $300,000,000, or $500,000,000, why,
the building of a mere packing plant is
not very much of a job. I might say to my
honourable friend from Rigaud that I have
the heartiest sympathy with his motion. I
have been fighting battles of this kind not
only in the pork and beef business, but also
in the grain business. When no farmer could
get a car to ship his wheat out of Western
Canada, I took the railroads into the police
court three times a week, and they had fines
imposed on them to make them play fair. The
little I have tried to do in polities lias been
in the interest of the fellow who raises a few
beasts and grows a bit of grain, and I stand
read;y in tIis Chamber to do anything that
may corne my way te assist in any investigation of abuses. But I believe that an investigation would accoemplish a good deal more
if we appointed a comtmittee outside of this
House altogether, conposed of, say, two or
three good fellows-and they can be found
here and there-who would get to the bottom
of these complaints.
Honourable senators
have only an ephemeral knowledge of the
packing business, just as I have fron my
contacts with it. I would not have made
such suggestions as I have offered, if I had
not had the misfortune to be for fifteen years
Minister of Agriculture in two provinces.
I have seen what some people will do to the
farmer when they get a chance, and I can
assure my honourable friend that I shall be
glad to back him up in any efforts te may
make to have things straightened out.
On the motion of Hon. Mr. Howard, the
debate was adjourned.

adopted by the Senate on Thursday, January
28, 1943. I stated last night that this resolution would continue in effect during the forthcoming adjournment of the session, but it was
thought nevertheless that it should be placed
on record again. It reads:
That for the duration of the present session
of Parliament, should an emergency arise during
any adjournment of the Senate, which would in
the opinion of the Honourable the Speaker
warrant that the Senate meet prior to the time
set forth in the motion for such adjournment,
the Honourable the Speaker be authorized to
notify honourable senators at their addresses as

at a time earlier than that set out in the motion
for such adjournment, and non-receipt by any
one or more honourable senators of such call
shall not have any effect upon the sufficiency and
validity thereof.
The motion was agreed to.
MINUTES OF PROCEEDINGS
DESIGNATIONS OF SENATORS

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are called, I
have a suggestion to make. On the front
page .of the Minutes of the Proceedings of
the Senate there always appears the name of
each senator who was present on the date
shown, but in each instance the senator's name
only is given; for instance, "Haig." I wonder
if it would not be possible to insert after each
name the member's designation. This would
be a considerable help when any one of us is
speaking and wishes to refer to another member. As it is now, this matter gives us some
considerable difficulty.
I happen to know
that the honourable senator right opposite me
(Hon. Mr. Murdock) is from Parkdale, because I have heard him speak a number of
times; and that the senator on my left (Hon.
B. F. Smith) is from Victoria-Carleton,
because his designation is always shown in
the Minutes; and for this same reason I know
that the designation of one of the honourable
senators from Montreal is Montarville (Hon.
C. P. Beaubien). But I do not know the
designation of the senator who comes from
Lethbridge, for instance (Hon. Mr. Buchanan).
I think it is Lethbridge, but I am not sure.
So I would suggest that in future the designation be shown after every name.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: There is a card in
your desk.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The honourable gentleman
says there is a card in my desk. But have I to

337

look up that card every time I want to know
a member's designation? And even if I did so,
the senator to whom I wished to refer might
not be in his own seat. I might refer to the
honourable gentleman from Waterloo, for instance, when the member I meant might be
from Perth.
It would be a great convenience if the
designations were printed. Then my name, for
instance, would appear as "Haig (Winnipeg)."
Perhaps, if my suggestion is carried out, some
honourable members would change their designation. The designation "West Central Saskatchewan" does not indicate anything ,to me,
but if someone refers to the honourable senator
from Rosetown we all know right away who is
meant (Hon. Mr. Aseltine). At present three
senators are designated as from Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. Harmer, Hon. Mr. Griesbach and
Hon. Mr. Blais). There are two menmbers from
Vancouver, but only one is so designated (Hon.
Mr. McRae), the other (Hon. Mr. Farris)
having the designation of "Vancouver South."
I remember that when I first came here I was
called the junior senator from Winnipeg, to
distinguish me friom the late Senator MeMeans,
who was always referred to as the senator from
Winnipeg. There was a lot of trouble caused
sometimes when the word "junior" was left out
of my designation. I would suggest that whatever committee has to do with the matter
should take it into consideration next session.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: The practice which
the honourable gentleman suggests is followed
in the proceèd,ings of the House of Commons:
after each member's name appears the designation of his constituency.
Hon. Mr. COPP: That is in the Commons
Hansard?
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. COPP: What the honourable
senator from Winnipeg is referring to is the
list of members on the front page of our
Minutes of the Proceedings.
Hon. Mr. KING: I think the honourable
gentleman's suggestion is worthy of consideration. I myself have considerable difficulty in
recalling the designations of honourable
senators. In fact, to refresh my memory, I
keep this somewhat cumbersome chart in my
desk, but it is not always convenient to refer
to it. I shall be glad ta consult the officers
of the Senate and ascertain whether the suggestion can be adopted next session.

Sistem of Winnipeg.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, I move, seconded by the honourable
member from Victoria-Carleton (Hon. Mr.
Smith), that the amendments made to Bill T2
in the House of Commons be concurred in.
There are three amendments. The first is
an additional section declaring that the property of the corporation shall be subject to the
laws of the province. I think this is the case
anyway. The second amendment strikes out
sections 10 and 11. The third amendment
merely renumbers section 12 as section 11.
This morning I wired the promoters of the
Bill and they have replied consenting te the
amendments. I have filed the telegram with
the Clerk.
The motion was agreed te.
COMMONS AMENDMENTS CONCURRED IN

The Senate proceeded to consider the amendments made by the House of Commons te
Bill X2, an Act to Incorporate Bethel Full
Gospel Assembly.
Hon. S. A. HAYDEN: Honourable members, I move, in the absence of the sponsor
of Bill X2 (Hon. Mr. Farris), that the Senate
concur in the amendments made te this
Bill by the House of Commons.
The amendments have been submitted to
the promoters and approved by them. They
involve no substantial change in the terms of
the Bill. For the purposes of greater clarity
there is amplification of one provision in new
section 5, which originally defined the dogma
of the corporation. Though the language is
different, the result is the same. Section 5
of the Bill, relating to management, bas been
struck out. A similar section has been inserted in another place in different language,
but, in my opinion, while it is a little more
verbose, it accomplishes the same result. In
section 4, which deals with the publishing
if Christian literature in English and foreign
languages, the word "French" has been
nserted.
The motion was agreed to.

FEDERAL DISTRICT COMMISSION BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. KING moved the second reading
of Bill 71, an Act to amend the Federal District Commission Act, 1927.
le said: Honourable members, the honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert)
bas kindly consented to make the explanation
of this Bill.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, as sponsor of this Bill I should
like to point out that the Federal District
Commission Act of 1927 provided originally
for an annual payment of $250,000 to the
Federal District Commission for a period net
exceeding sixteen years dating from the 1st of
April, 1927. In consideration, however, of the
sum of $3,000,000 having been made available
for large-scale improvements in the central part
of Ottawa, which in themselves compose the
central theme or motif of the scheme of
beautification, the grant was reduced to $200,000 a year for a period not exceeding fifteen
years from the Ist of Àpril, 1928. The reference is chapter 26 of the Statutes of 1927.
This authority expired on March 31 of this
year, and it is necessary now to make provision for the grant in future years, beginning
April 1, 1943.
The proposed Act will continue the present
grant of $200,000 for a period of ten years,
which is five years less than the period originally provided for in 1927.
Most of the members of the Senate are
familiar with the work of the Federal District
Commission. It is hardly necessary for me to
enumerate the different features of its administration which represent the appropriation of
$200,000 a year. In general termas, -the commission bas to maintain a large system of
roadways and parkways, some thirty-two
miles in length, in and around the city, two
large bridges and at least two smaller ones.
There is also a large parkway property on
the other side of the Ottawa river, extending
all the way from the mouth of the Gatineau
to the hospital and the main street of Hull.
and there is the maintenance of streets both
in winter and in summer. Altogether this
represents the expenditure of the amount
specified.
In normal times, due regard being had to
the present stage of development of the parkway system, including the new Gatineau Park,
$250,000 would be the minimum amount required for first-class maintenance alone. However, under the presently existing wartime
conditions the commission bas drastically cur-

location, laying out and beautification of parks

and transportation within the area in question.
That, as I say, laid down the principle or
the policy which has been followed ever since.

federation Park is, of course, an important
item.
In addition to the $10,967,000, the
Government expenditures that were made
through the Department of Public Works, on
account of Confederation Park, amounted to
$1,747,967.81, making a total contribution by
the country, through the Government, the
Department of Public Works and the Federal
District Commission, of $12,714,967.81.
I an not giving these figures in any spirit
of criticism. I think every dollar of that
money was well spent and the country bas
splendid value for every dollar of it. But it
does no barm to know how much is being
paid in order to carry out this fundamental
policy.
It may be as well to state that in addition to
that, one of the finest residential districts of
the city of Ottawa, Clemow avenue, was constructed at Government expense, through the
Federal District Commission, or the former
body, the Ottawa Improvenent Commission.
The Clemow Estate donated the property, and
the Government, probably through the Ottawa
Improvement Commission, built the street, and
is under contract with the city to maintain it
for all time.
Just now the Governmrent is engaged in
rebuilding, under its contract with the city, the
Laurier avenue bridge, at a cost of about
$50.000. The Gov ernment is also under coutractxwith the city to maintain the sidewalks
on Elgin street and Laurier avenue in front of
Cartier square, also ail the sidewalks on Wellingon street froin Connaught Place west, in
front of Government buildings, and also the
roadway of Wellington street west of Bank
street. I am not inaking criticism about these
things; I am only giving them out as facts for
the information of honourable members.
I have here a statement, revised for me by
the Secretary of the Federal District Commission, summarizing the work done by that
commission and the Ottawa Improvement
Commission. I will read the statement, or
hand it in to Hansard, whichever honourable
members prefer.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hand it in.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: All right.

buildings in the city, including Parliament Hill,

1 may peint eut that Hull is mentioned in

commission.

More recently the commission

acquired, with money supplied by the Government, 15,000 acres of land up in the Gatineau

district, about 15 miles from Ottawa. This

These beautiful boulevards and parks and

and this beautification is something of which
every citizen may well be proud.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: We do not begrudge
one dollar of the expenditure.
My only
criticism is that the city does not carry out its
responsibilities in relation to traffic on the
boulevard. True, there are numerous parking signs warning positively that cars must not

ho parked here or there; but the resuit is
lauchable.A few people park their cars
right by these signs. It seems to me too bad
that the Government and the city should have
invested $5.000.000 to provide a lovely parking
ground for a few dozen motorists. If I had
anything to do with the enforcement of the
parking bvlaws I would not allow a car to
be parked anywhere on Elgin street from
Wellington down to Laurier avenue; not one.
This beautification project is not made more
beautiful by the parking of old cars; far
from it.
ome Hon. SENATORS: Hear. hear.

JULY 21, 1943
Hon. Mr. TANNER: The city authorities
do nothing to enforce their parking regulations.
They may give the excuse that we are at war.
Well, I do not believe we should lose the war
if motoriste were to stop parking their cars
in this area. On the contrary, if parking were
strictly prohibited the absence of cars would
add further to the beauty of these boulevards.
I hope that before long the city authorities
will make up their minds to enforce an ironclad law to put a stop to motorists trespassing on this $5,000,000 boulevard.
Hon. W. RUPERT DAVIES: Honourable
members, I have listened with great interest to
the remarks of the honourable senator from
After being
Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner).
advised of the large sums of money spent by
the Federal District Commission on the
beautification of the capital, it would seem
to me that Ottawa is indeed a child of fortune. I am one of several million Canadians
who know nôthing about the Federal District
Commission nor how its funds are raised and
expended. However, before seeking enlightenment from the honourable senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert), I am afraid I must disagree with the views of the honourable senator
from Pictou in reference to parking. As one
who lives a hundred miles from this city
and has to drive here frequently, I find it quite
difficult since the erection of the memorial
monument and the widening of Elgin street
to find a parking place for my car. We are
living in a motor age, and it seems to me that
both the city of Ottawa and the Federal
District Commission have not only overlooked the need for parking space, but have
actually made it more difficult for motorists
to park their cars anywhere near either of the
leading hotels.
Now, for my own enlightenment, as well as
that of many other citizens of Canada, may I
ask: Who appoints the Federal District Commission? Who are its members? What control
is exercised over its expenditures? This Bill
asks for $2,000,000.
Hon. Mr. COPP: No; $200,000.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Yes, $200,000 for ten
years-a total of $2,000,000. Is this money to
be expended by a commission appointed by
the Government? And are the expenditures
audited by the Auditor-General? Perhaps the
honourable senator from Ottawa can give me
this information.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, I am grateful for the opportunity
of being able to speak further on this subject.
If my honourable friend from Kingston (Hon.

343

Mr. Davies) will permit me, I should, like first
of all to express my appreciation to the
honourable senator from Pictou (Hon. Mr.
Tanner) for having gone at some length into
the background of the Federal District Commission and emphasized the importance from
a national standpoint of beautifying this
capital city.
I might say in passing that the book he
quoted, which was written by Mr. Ketchum,
was undertaken at the instance of Mr. Frank
Ahearn, in commemoration of his father, the
late Thomas Ahearn, who himself was one of
the pioneers and supporters of plans for the
beautification of Ottawa. In his references to
that book, I think, the honourable senator
paid a very fitting tribute to one who was
early associated with the project of the
beautification and development of the capital.
My honourable friend from Kingston has
told us that he thinks the city of Ottawa has
been "a child of fortune." His point was
raised in this Chamber, I think, a year or two
ago, when the late senior senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Coté) dealt with the subject of the
account, amounting, I think, to $100,000, for
services rendered by the city to the Federal
Government. It was then pointed out that the
account probably had never been adjusted.
Those services related to fire and police protection, and so on. At that time it was suggested that a committee should be appointed
to take up the question with representatives of
the city and try to reach a fair and equitable
basis. It was also suggested that the Government of Canada should establish a district
around the capital analagous to the District
of Columbia in relation ta Washington. I
mention this by way of comment on the
remark of the honourable senator from Kingston, because I believe that in direct proportion
to the investment of maney and sentiment in
this capital there will develop a national
interest in the Dominion as a whole.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I believe that our
interest in Canada generally will to a certain
extent be measured by the expenditures which
we are willing to make to develop the attractive natural setting of the national capital.
Regarding the details of expenditure, I shall
be only too pleased to place on Hansard a
breakdown of the $200,000 representing
administration staff salaries, maintenance of
parkway system, and so on. There is also an
item for mosquito control work, which is part
of the co-operative effort of the Federal

department insisted that the commission make provision for accommodating
elsewhere the water craft affected. This resulted in the Dow's Lake boathouse being erected. At the present time accommodation lias been leased
for 94 canoes and 22 motor boats. It costs the commission approximately
$1,500 per year to operate the boat-house; the total yearly rentals anount

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT.

JULY 21, 1943
I would conclude my remarks by expcessing
commendation of the work of those who
compose the Federal District Board.
Hon. Mr. HIAIG: The honourable senator
bas not yet answered the question of the
honourable gentleman froým Kingston. I think
I know the answer. but it would be better
if it came fromn the honoucable senator hlmself. Who appoints the commission, and what
is its autbority?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: The Federal Distriot
Commission is appointed by the Government
of Canada to take care of the areas which are
ceprcsented in the driveway scheme and al]
thfe other undertakings for the beautification
of this distict. The members of the commission are: Mr. Frederie Bronson, chairman;
Dr. R. Chevrier; Mr. C. J. Booth; Mr. A. E.
Provost; Mr. J. B. Spencer; Mr. Alexander
Johnston, C.M.G.; Mc. Duncan MacTavish,
K.C.: Mr. J. A. Ewart; Mr. Jos. W. Ste. Marie
(Hull); the Mayor of Ottawa. I am personally acquainted with several of those gentlemen and I can testify to their close personal
devotion to the* work of the commission. 1
may say that they very carefully serutinize
aIl expenditures during these rather trying
times.
I can assure my honourable friend that
personally I shahl be very pleased to see that
he is made familiar with the wock of the
commission. Nothing would give me greater
pheasure than to have him accompanry Mc.
Bronson and mysehf on a trip -through -the
city to see some of the more beautiful
features, which are flot always seen by
motocists driving here fcom Kingston and
hooking for a parking place.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honoucable senators, in 1938 or 1939 a celebcated Paris
architeet came bore and pcepared plans for
the beautification of the capital. An elabocate
maquette was prepared and phaced in these
buildings, opposite the do-or of the buse of
Commons, for public inspection, to show what
progress had aîready been made in beautifying
the city and what developments were planned
for the future. I should hiko to know from
the -honoucable senator whether these plans
have been adopted and are being cacried out
according to the model.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: In reply to the
honourable senator from Montarville (Hon.
C. P. Beaubien) I would say, first of all, that
this Bill is simphy for maintenance, altogether
apart from the great capital undertaking represented by the plan and by the model which

was in the House of Commons lobby a couple
of years ago. The very eminenýt architeet
from Paris, who acted in close co-operation
with the Prime Minister on the scheme, bias
given the Government a plan which has been
partly carried out, but which is stili incomplete. The details of the seheme are stîli in
blue-print form, but really have. been adopted
as part of the big scheme of beautification
embracing the area of the present station and
the district running down towards, Laurier
avenue.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The plans are being
followed out, are they?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: The plans have been
adopted, and have been partly put into, effeet.
The complete plan, which covers a period of
fifty or sixty years, bas been adopted by the
committee of the Gove.rnment.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

Evidence Act.
H1e said: Honourable senators, the honourable memrber fromn Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen.) lias been kind enough to consent
to explain this BilI.
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN: Honourable senators, this Bill to amend the Canada Evidence
Act is a small and, I think, quite innocuous
measure. In brief, it provides for the taking
of oaths. affirmations or statutory declarations
under the Canada Evidence Act outside of
Canada before certain governmental officiaIs,
including officers of the British diplomatie or
consular services, Canadian diplomatie or consular officers. Canadian High Commissioners
and Canadian Trade Commissioners and Assistant Trade Commrrissioners. I am given to
understand that the object of the Bill is to
bcbng tire Canada Evidence Act in this regard
into line with similar legislation which exista
and is in for-ce in sevecal of the provinces of

346

SENATE

Canada, with respect to the proof of matters
that are subject to provincial jurisdiction. I
arn jnformed that as matters stand at the present time it sometimes happons that in a single
case the Canada Evidence Act -may be applicable to one portion of the litigation whule
provincial legislation is applicable to another
portion. This simply brings the Canada Evidenco Act into line witb the provincial statutos
with respect to officers outside of Canada
before whom affidavits and declarations may
be made.
If the second reading is agreed to, I shall
niov~e that the Bill be reforred for consideration to the Standing Committoe on Banking
and Commerce.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: 1 had intended
suggc.sting the third reading, but the hionourable senator from Ponteix MHon. Mr. Marcotte), who bappens to be ont of the Chamber, has said ho wishes to consider the matter
further, and may have some observations f0
miake in committee to-morrow. It is at bis
suggestion that I ask that the Bill be referred
to the committee.
Hon. ANTOINE J. LEGER: Hononrable
senators, this may not be the proper time to do
it, but, as I am not a member of the Banking
and Commerce Committee, I should like to
miake a suggestion. In the third uine from the
bottom of section 49 these wordýs appear:
-being adrninis;tered. takeii or reccived bY inii.
shall ho admitteil in evidence. withaut proof of
the seal or stamp or of bis signatture or of1 it
officiai eharacter.
The language there seemns to be absolute,
and I amn .ust wondering whether on that anybody wonld have the righit to make proof.
In mY opinion the language s-hould be something like this: "shahl ho prima facie admissible in evidence."
In that case a defence
would be possible; but under the wording of
the Bill any such document produced is admissible, and the judge bas no discretion in the
matter at ail. I think it is the intention that
the document shonld be prima facie admissible
in evidence, without further proof, and I think
tihe members of the committee miglbt consider
thiat point when the Bill is before tbcm.
The motion was agrecd to, and the Bill was

13RITISH COIM\BIA IN"ýDIAN RESERVES
MINERAI, RESOURCES BILL
SECOND

IiEADINýG

Hon. J. H. KING mov ed the second reading of Bill 78, the British Columbia Indian
Reserves Minerai Resources Act.
Ho said: Hononrable senators, the explanation of this Bill is brief.
Those who are
familiar with the question of Indian reserves
In the province of British Columbia know
that since the tirne of Confederation there
have been certain outstanding differences in
regard to these reserves as between the province and the Dominion Governiment. It was

347

JTULY 21, 1943
only in 1912 that a commission knawn as
the McKenna-MeBride Commission made an
inquiry into the question, as a result of which
an agreement was entered into. Priar ta that
time the province was entitled ta a reversianary intcrest in ail Ind-ian lands which were not
required by the Indians for their use. This
resulted in a joint ownership, making it practically impossible for the Dominion ta admînister the lands for the benefit of the Indýians.
To settle these d-ifferences the agreement
already referred ta was entered ino, and the
repart ai a committce appointed thereunder
was adapted and approved by Parliament in
1920. That agreement provided that when
the reserves werc finally fixed by the commission they were ta be conveyed by the
province ta the Dominion, which was ta have
fui! power ta deal with them as might be
deemed best, and ta sel! them and use the
proceeds for the benefit ai the Indians. The
reversionary interest of the province was thus
disposed af, except where the Indian bands
became extinct, in which cases the lands
reverted ta the province.
The agreement, aithaugli approved by Parliament in 1920, did not receive the approval
of the provincial Government until 1927, and
it is only within the last year or twa that the
province and the Dominion have been able
ta agree upon the rights ta, minerais that may
be found upon the reserves.
In the eighties. in a case hefare the Privy
Council, in which the Attorney-General for
the province and the Attorney-General for
the Dominion were represented, the province
contended, and was successful in the contention, that preciaus metals in and upon and
under Crawn lands "are nat incidents ai the
land, but belong ta the Crown, and, under
section 109 ai the British 'North America Act,
1867, beneficially ta the province." The
Dominion continued ta cantend that the base
metals were within the right ai the Dominion
and should be utilized and disposed ai for the
benefit ai the Indians, and, as I have said,
st two or three
it is only within the
years that the two governments were able
ta reach an agreement, which is set out in
the schedule ai the Bill.
This agreement provides that if consent is
given by the Indian Affaira Branch -that
means, with the approvai ai the Indians in
Councii-prospecting may he done an the
reserves, and the minerai rights explaited. Al
work will be carried, on under the iaws and
reguiations ai the province ai British Columbia.
It is aiso pravided in the agreement that ai!
revenues derived from such development wil

be on the basis of present charges made by the
provincial Government, and will fot be reduced without the consent of the Government
of Canada.
Under this arrangement, an individual or
group af individuals may make application to
the Indian agent in any district for permission
ta prospect for minerais upon a reserve. The
agreement, 1 believe, is important. There are
some 1,600 reserves scattered throughout the
province of British Columbia, many of them
in mineral-bearing areas, and I have no doubt
that when the agreement cornes into force considerable prospecting will be donc upon some
of these reserves and wili resuit in a good deal
of deveiopment, which will produce revenue
not only for the province, but -also for the
Federai Treasury. This revenue received by
thie Goveriement of Cana&a wlll, -of course, be
held in trust and used for the advantage of
the Indians upon the reserves.
I think that is ail I need to say.
Han. C. P. BEAIJBIEN: Would the honourable gentleman be kind eiiough ta repeat the
number of reserves there are in the province?
Hon. Mr. KING: There are 1,600 reserves.
It is an amazing number.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: If permission is
given for prospecting, what happens afterwards? Will development be done by the
province or the Federal ýGovernment?
Hon. Mr. KING: No. Develapment will be
done in the ordinary way by an individus! or
group or company, under the iaws of the
province.
The motion was agrecd ta, and the Bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. KING moved the third reading of
the Bill.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill was
read the thîrd' time, and passed.
CRIMINAL CODE BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. KING moved the second reading
ai Bill 107, an Act ta amend the Criminal
Code.
H1e said: Honourable senatars. my honourable friend from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden)
has been kind enough ta undertake an explanation af this Bill.
Hon. S. A. HAYDEN: Honourable senatars,
I have given consîderation ta the amîendments
ta the Criminal Code that are incorporated in

348

SENATE

this Bill, for the purpose of trying to reduce
them into a concise statement. Some of the
amendrnents are new, some have tHe objeet, of
making provisions of the Code more enforceable, and sonto are clearly procedural. Since
they range ox er varjous parts of thie Code, 1
hav e toade my own grouping of tHe amendment-s according to the subjeet-mnatters to
which they relate.
May I first direct attention, of honýourable
senators to sections 15, 16, 22, 23, 26 and 27
of the Bill? Those relate to procedure in cases
where Hic offonce with which a person is
chargod is of a type for which greater punishment tnay ho inflicted upon the accused if it is
proved that he was previously convicted. The
proceduro outlined in' these sections differs
from, and, in my opinion, is fairer than, that
now folloxved. For instance, at the present
timo where a person is being proceeded against
summarily, under the summary convi-.tions
part of the Criniinal Code, and the Crown
alleges the offenco to ho a second offence,
some roference to this may bo made in the
information. That certainly is embarrassing
to the acousod person and makes it more
difficuit for him to defend himself. At least,
tHe atmosphere, in court is more unfavourable
to him. The amcncltîents titat I have referred
to deal wvith sumnnary convictions, summary
trials of indictahle offenees and spcedy trials
of indictable offences, and they ail provide
that, the information shahl not make any
roference to, a provious conviction. Only after
the accused porson has been convicted of the
offenco for which lie is thon boing tried may tlîe
judgc, at the requcst of the Crown prosecutor,
inquire of the accused w hether it is his first
off ence.
If he sas àt is, tlhe Crown nîay
thon put in eviden ce te prove that hoe is lot
telling the truth.
The next amendment I should like to refer
to is section 28 of the Bill. That amendment
hais become nocossary hy roason of a decision
by the Supreme Court of Canada, which held
that undor the provisions of the Code dealing
witlî tho speedy trial of indictable offences
t.he trial .iudgc could proceed with only one
charge at a timo agaînst an, accused person.
Opposed to that, where a man is charged unýder
indictment. if there are a number of counts in
the indictment the judge may at his discretion
procoed with several of the counts at the
samo time.
The Supreme Court's decision
meant that the so-called "speody trials" part
of the Code was a misnomer. Section 28 is
designed te make it clear that under this part
of the Code a person may ho tried on several
charges togeohir tf in the jndge's opinion
the accused would not be prejudiced thereby.
Ilûn. NIr. HAYDEN.

Tlîe advantage of this amendment is quite
apparent. from the point cf view both of
the accused and the Crewn.
Another group of amendments is contained
in sections 29, 30 and 31, and is based on a
resnlution cf the Manitoba Legislature. These
amendmcnts provide for twelve .iurors in
crîntinal cases in that province. As the Code
notv stands, only six jurors cao ho used in a
criminal case in Manitoba and Saskatchewan,
but if the proposed amendments are adopted
tilis limitation will no longer apply te Manitoba. The change is made hy eliminating any
reference te Manitoba in the relevant subsections.
Sections il and 32 are merely formaI. We
usod te have a Trade Mark and Design Act,
and the Code contains certain references te
thîis. But the Act was repealed by the Unfair
Competition Act of 1932, and the amendnient provided hy section Il simply incerporatos the title cf the new Act in the Code.
Section 32 corrects a clerical errer, by includtng referonco te the Timher Marking Act in
seoction 990 cf the Code, such reference hnving
been inadvortently omitted wlien the section
xvas amended in 1938.

of thoe Bill. .Section 5 siniplv combines the
provision of section 622 of the Code with

SENATE

the appeal must, be disposed of at that session or the next, unless the court makes some
other direction. The object, of this amendment is to extend the saine priviiege to the
Attorney-Generai as is now enjoyed by the
convicted person.
I may say at this point that before I
take up two sections whicb I regard as really
contentins I propose to give a brief explaniation of three or four other sections.
With reference to section 9, it, was felt that
something dangerous was developing in the use
of war savings starnps and other securities
in chain letter.s-paragraph
(c) something
whicb the Code dici not cover. It was therefore decided to amcnd paragrapb (c) of soUsection 1 of section 236 se as to include war
savings stamps and other securities as weil as
money wben used in the promotion of speculative enterprises.
Section 12 enlarges the scope of section 406
of the Code, deaiing with false pretences. At
the present time it is an offence to publish,
by way of advertisement or otherwise, any
statement, purporting to be one of faet which
is untrue, deceptive or miseading. This did
not catch every offender, for an advertisement mnight be presented in sucb a form that,
thoughi literally and technically accurate, it
could be said to be intended to deceive and
mislead. Therefore the section is amended
by addieg these words:
or which advertiscinet isniten tirî,îlly so
sxocile( oS' arraiigol als tu e
ilOSS
oi n islai îg.

It is another attempt, I suppose, to close
the door on the various types of false pretences
and false advertising that develop from time to
time.
Section 25 bas to do with tise restitution of
property. Its purpose is to bring the power
to order restitution of property on summary
conviction into line with the power so to
order on conviction for indictable offences. In
cases whiere property bas bcen unlawfuliy received the magistrate is given power to direct
that tbe stoien property be restored to the
rightful owner. Tbe present wording of "obtatined. by false pretiees" is tmýended to read,
"'unlawfully received."
Section 6 deals witb the very tecbnical problem of bail. Apparentiy thece was a loophole
in the Code, and the object of tbe amendment
is to broaden paragraph (c) of section 189 se,
that it wiil apply to a person on bail subsequent to as weil as before bis conviction.
Now 1 corne to the two sections whicb I
tbink may provoke some discussion. 1 will
refer to them very briefly.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. 1IAYDES.

Hon. Mr. IIAYDEN: They are sections 7
and 8. The amendments are sbort, but often
the littie bit you add may make a great deai
of difference.
Section 7 relates to betting. Tbis amendment originated becaiîse of the fact that
when a house on the outskirts of Toronto was

The telephones were tbere, but
apparently tbe police did not enter at a time
whien they were in operation. This amendment is devised for the purpose of covering
sucs a situation, the paragraph as amended

lon. Mr. HAIG: Has aniy other AttorneyCencral
rcquîcsted
tise passing of
the
legislation?
Hon. Mr. HAYIDEN: 0f section 7, yes--tbe
Attorney-Generai of Britisb Columbia.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Anybody else?

JULY 21, 1943

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Nobody else. The
amendment was suggested by the then Attorney-General of Ontario, and was concurred
in by the AttorneyGeneral of British Columbia. Since that time there has been a change
of Attorney-General in Ontario.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: There is no possibility of
a change occurring again, is there?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I do not know whether
or not t da a case of the wish being father to
the thought, but for the purpose of the
discussion of this matter I do not think a
consideration of that question is necessary.
Section 8 is another of the sections where
the word "likely" bas been introduced. The
wording of the present Act is:
advertises, prints, publishes, exhibits, posts up,
sells or supplies, or offers to sell or supply,
any information intendedand then the words "or likely" are added
-to assist in, or intended for useand again the words appear, "or likely to be
of use"-in connection with book-making, pool-selling,
betting or wagering upon any horse-race or
other race, fight, game or sport, whether at the
time of advertising, printing, publishing, exhibiting, posting up, or supplying such news or
information, such horse-race or other race, fight,
game or sport has or has not taken place.
The words following that constitute the
amending provision which the Minister of
Justice introduced in the other place when
this section was being considered. They are
as follows:
Provided however that the provisions of this
paragraph shall not apply to the publication of
news or records in relation to any race, fight,
game or sport, or to contestants therein in the
ordinary course of publishing a bona fide
newspaper.
The idea was that if this provision had not
been added, from the time this section became
law no newspaper would be able, or willing,
possibly, to publish even the entries for races
or the results, because if an excerpt of a newspaper containing entries and results were found
in the possession of some person it would be
difficult to resist the charge that these entries
were "likely to be used." For this reason the
Minister inserted the proviso regarding what
he calls a "bona fide newspaper."
I may tell you that this amendment was suggested by the Deputy Attorney-General of
Alberta and was concurred in by the AttorneyGeneral of British Columbia and the then
Attorney-General of Ontario. Since that time
the successor in office in Ontario has taken an
entirely different position, on the ground that

the word "likely" involves a complete change
in our criminal jurisprudence, inasmuch as
intention is no longer a factor.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Those words would
do away with the defence of mens rea.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Oh, yes, entirely. In
saying that, I am expressing my own opinion.
It is obvious, I think, that with the words
"likely to be of use" the offence is something
quite apart from any determination in one's
mind. For instance, if a man who was making
a bet somewhere with a bookie had an excerpt
from a newspaper in his possession, you would
have the combination of circumstances necessary to convict the newspaper if it were not
for this saving clause. It would be difficult to
say that it was not "likely to be of use," and
the question of intent would not matter. Heretofore, where a person has gone into the
witness box and said, " I did not intend this
information to be of use; I published it for the
purpose of satisfying the public interest in the
field of horse-racing," that was a perfectly
good defence.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: What is the meaning of
a "bona fide newspaper"?
Hon. Mr..HAYDEN: I do not know. We
have to take the meaniing which the words
appear to have. I should think a bona fide
newspaper would be one that is regularly
published and bas a reasonable circulation.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Why not say, "regularly
publ.ished newspaper"?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I cannot answer that
question. That is why I was suggesting that
the Bill should go to committee, where we
can get the opinion of officials of the Department of Justice and decide whether or not
this is wide enough in scope. For instance,
question might arise as to whether 'the official
racing publication of the Racing Association
is a newspaper within the meaning of the
amendment.
With this explanation, I would move that
the Bill be referred to the Commibtee on
Banking and Commerce for consideration.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I appreciate the
very lucid manner in whi.ch the honourable
sènator has explained this Bill, but before the
motion is put I should like to ask a question
w.ith regard to section 29. . The province of
Saskatchewan is the only province in which
a jury in future will consist of only six
members.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Yes.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: It seems to me that
in Saskatchewan there should be twelve jurors,
the same as in other provinces. I should like
to know why Saskatchewan is left with only
six jurors under the amended section. We
all know, of course, that during the bad years
in Western Canada from 1930 on, with resultant poor crops, a request was made by
the Attorney-General of Saskatchewan to have
the number of jurors in criminal trials reduced
from twelve to six; but I think conditions
have improved to such an extent that we
now should have twelve jurymen. I think
that if I were defending in a criminal action
I would sooner rely on twelve men than on
six; if I were prosecuting, I would sooner
have six than twelve. In my opinion, having
only six jurors works to the detriment of the
accused, and the accused should be given
every possible chance, because, as we all know,
it is much better that a number of guilty
persons should go free than that one innocent
person should be convicted.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: That, of course,
should be considered by the committee; but,
the change to six jurors having been made at
the request of the province, I personally would
be very diffident about changing back to
twelve without consulting the province.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I presume a request
was made by Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Yes. There was an
enactment of the Manitoba Legislature as a
result of which the change back to twelve
was made. It may be that the honourable
gentleman is underestimating the quality of
Saskatchewan jurors with regard to their
mental capabilities.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I do not intend to discuss the Bill, for it has been covered very
fully, but as Manitoba has been mentioned
I should like to say a word. The original
request made by Manitoba to reduce the
number of jurors was not unanimous.
I
happened to have the pleasure of being a
member of the Legislature at that time, and
I remember very well what the situation
was. Recently there lias been a great agitation to have the twelve-man jury restored.
Last winter the Legislature unanimously
passed a resolution agreeing upon that. For
several years it has been the general opinion
that the twelve-man jury is very much fairer
to all concerned than the six-man jury. That
is why the change is being made.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN.

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN:
I move that this
Bill be referred to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.

DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL
REVENUE BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading of Bill 108, an Act to amend the Department of National Revenue Act.
He said:
Honourable senators, this Bill
pertains to the internal organization of the
Department
of National
Revenue.
The
appointment of Mr. Hugh D. Scully as Consul General for Canada in New York has
created a vacancy in the office of Commissioner of Customs. This Bill provides for
the combining of the offices of Commissioner
of Customs and Commissioner of Excise, and
for raising the status of the commissioner to
that of a deputy minister. It also provides
that the Commissioner of Income Tax and
Succession Duties be made a deputy minister.
Section 2 of the Bill is to authorize the
Minister of National Revenue to administer
Part II and Parts IV to XVII of the Special
War Revenue Act, lately enacted.
This
authority is at present vested in the Minister
of National Revenue by Orders in Council
made under the provisions of the Department
of National Revenue Act.
I think this explains the provisions of the

Bill.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Would that increase the remuneration of these officers?
Hon. Mr. KING: That matter has not
been considered, but, judging from discussion I have heard, I should say it probably
would. Deputy ministers are entitled to a
higher salary than commissioners.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER:
When shall
said Bill be read a third time? '
Hon. Mr. KING:
of the House.

Now, with the consent

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

of Bill 119, an Act respecting a certain Tax
Convention and Pratocol between Canada and
the United States of America, signed at
Washington, in the United States of America,
on the 4th day of March, 1942.
Hie said: Honourable senators, the honourable gentleman from Westmorland (Hon. Mr.
Copp) bas kindly consented to explain this
Bill.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Honourable senators, as
its titie indicates, this Bill has to do with a tax
c onvention and protocol between Canada and
the United States of America, signed at
Washington on the 4th day of Mardi, 1942.
The convention and protocol have been in
force during the past fifteen months, and the
department administering the matter lias been
advised by the Department of Justice that the
agreement should be put into statutory form.
That is the only reason for the Bill.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: What is the purpose of the convention and protocol?
Hon. Mr. COPP: It is to deal with taxes
on dividends and other income passing between
the two coun tries.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN:- The object being
equalization?
Hon. Mr. COPP: Yes, as far as possible.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

Copp) has agreed to explain this Bill also.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Honourable senators, hast
year, or a short time before, the provinces of
Ontario and Quebec entered into an agreement
for the purpose of developing electrical power
72542-23

at various sections of the Ottawa river. Inasmueh as the Dominion bas certain proprietary
rights in some of the lands required for the
purposes of the agreement, an Order in Council

Hon. Mr. KING moved the second reading
of Bill 134, an Act to amend the Exehequer
Court Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this Bill also
will be exphained by the honourable senator
from. Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Copp).
Hon. Mr. COPP: Honourable senators, this
is a very short Bill, the object of which is to
amend the Exchequer Court Act. It has been
held that a member of the armed forces of
Canada is not a servant of the Crown, within
the meaning of that part of. the Act which
imposes liability upon the Crown for the
negligent acts of its servants. A nuniber of
accidents have allegedly resulted from negligence of members of the armed forces, and
some objection has been taken to the Crown's
freedom from. liability in such cases. This
Bill bas been brought in to make it clear that
liability does rest upon the Crown.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill waa
read the second time.

CANADIAN NATIONAL RAIL WAYS
FINANCING AND IGUARANTEE BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. KING moved the second reading
of Bill 135, an Act to authorize the provision
of moneys to meet certain capital expenditures
made and capital indebteiness inourred by the

REVISED EDITION

354

SENATE

Canadian National Railways System during
the calendar year 1943, and to authorize the
guarantee by His Majesty of certain securities
to be issued by the Canadian National Railway Company.
He said: The honourable gentleman from
De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Gouin) has kindly
consented to give an explanation of this Bill.
Hon. L. M. GOUIN: Honourable senators,
this Bill reproduces in substance a similar Act
which was adopted last year and is now
chapter 22 of our Statutes of 1942-43. In fact,
every year since 1932 a similar Bill has been
passed to provide moneys for capital expenditurcs and refunding purposes of the Canadian
National Railways System. The object of the
present Bill is simply to authorize capital expenditure of the Canadian National Railway
Company, and the retirement of miscellaneous
maturing obligations, either by way of loan
from the Dominion or by the issue of the
company's
securities guaranteed
by
the
Dominion.
As shown at the end of section 2, on page 2
of the Bill, the total amount to be now provided for the purposes I have just indicated
is $6,046,300. This sum is made up as follows:
Additions and betterments
(less retirements) ..... $12,200,000
Acquisition of securities. 1,294.300
Retirement of maturing
capital obligations, including sinking fund
and equipment principal
payments ............
9,552,000
$23,046,300
Less: Available from reserves for
depreciation and debt discount
amortization ...................
$17,000,000
$ 6,046,300
Section 2 of the Bill is the same as it was
last year, though of course the amounts are
never exactly the same in any two years. But
the 1942 measure had a third section, which
provided that the Canadian National Railway
Company, subject to the approval of the
Governor General in Council, could retire any
amount of the debts of the companies forming
part of the Canadian National Railways
System, and authorized the issue of new
securities in exehange for such retired obligations. That power conferred in 1942 ýis a
continuing one, and need not be re-enacted
this year. So section 3 of the 1942 Bill is
omitted from the present Bill. That is why
section 3 and the following sections of this
Bill correspond respectively with section 4 and
the following sections of last year's Act.
Hon. Mr. KING.

Section 3 simply gives the Minister of
Finance the usual authority to make to the
Canadian National Railway Company the
advances necessary to meet the expenditures
authorized in section 2, provided, of course,
that the total of such expenditures shall not
exceed
the
amount
already
mentioned,
$6.046,300.
Section 4 is the same as section 5 of last
year's Act. It provides for the issue and
guarantce of definitive securities for the repayment of temporary loans.
Section 5 is also similar to the corresponding
section 6 of the Act of 1942. It gives power
to the Canadian National Railways to aid
the various companies referred, to in the Act.
Section 6, too, is similar to section 7 of
last year's Act. It provides for the guarantee
to be authorized by the Governor General in
Council.
Section 7 is the same as section 8 adopted
last year. It deals with the ferm of the
guarantee to be signed by or on behalf of
the Minister of Finance.
Number 8, the last section, is similar to
section 9 of last year's Act. Paragraph 1
provides for the deposit of the proceeds of
guaranreed bond issues of the Canadian
National Railways. Paragraph 2 deals with
the release of any part of such proceeds.
To sum up, all the sections which I have
dealt with simply reproduce the provisions in
the 1942 Act, the only difference being in the
amount of the advances authorized.
In order to explain this difference I would
ask permission to place on Hansard a breakdown of the three items forming the sum of
$23.046,300, mentioned in section 2.
First I present the following statement:

Hon. Mr. Du'TREMBLAY: Will the debt
of the Canadian National Railways be increased by $23,000,000 or $6,000,000? Apparently depreciation will no longer 'be covered.
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: In answer to my honourable friend from Repentigny (Hon. Mr. Du
Tremblay) I may say that the loans from
the years 1932 to 1937 and $9,019,207.17 of the
advances made in 1938 have been repaid out
of the proceeds of Dominion guaranteed railway issues. The remainder of the advances
under the 1938 Act, namely $1,718,008.90, and
the advances in 1939, 1940 and 1941, have been
repaid'from the cash surpluses of the Canadian
National Railways for the calendar years 1941,
1942 and 1943 on account.
I wish to add that no railway issues have
been sold since the outbreak of war. The last

356

SENATE

guaranteed issue was that of January 15, 1939,
for $50,000,000. Until 1942 it had been necessary to make provision for temporary loans to
the railway company to cover operating deficits in the earlier part of the different years,
but last year we had the satisfaction of knowing that the system had an operating surplus.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

Senate, I would move that we proceed with
the second reading of this Bill now.
The honourable senator from Lethbridge
(Hon. Mr. Buchanan) has been kind enough to
undertake the explanation of this Bill to members of the Senate. He comes from Western
Canada and is f.amiliar with its operation.
Honourable
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN:
senators, I think I should say at the outset that
this legislation has been brought about by a
judgment of the Privy Council, which found
that the Debt Adjustment Act of Alberta infringed upon powers in respect to 'insolvency
and bankruptcy reserved only to the federal
authority. As that decision of the highest court
also affected similar legislation in Saskatchewan
and Manitoba, the provincial governments
appealed to Ottawa for what I think I might
properly term remedial legislation under the
bankruptcy and insolvency jurisdiction of the
Dominion. The first thing the Government
here did to meet the situation created by the
Privy Council decision was to pass an Order
in Council, to be effective, as I understand it,
throughout the period of the war, providing
that foreclosure proceedings should be stopped,
so as to keep on the land efficient and
industrious farmers, and protect as well all
those having any interest in the land of the
debtor.
I might next explain that the legislation I
am now presenting is not only intended to
meet the situation created by the Privy Council judgment, but it supplants an Act that
this Chamber has heard a good deal about
in previous discussions, the Farmers' Creditors
Arrangement Act. That Act was passed in
1934, when the farm economy throughout the
whole country was at a very low ebb. The
Act, which was applicable in every province,
was intended to enable farmers to compose
their debts, both as to interest and principal,
to meet the extremely adverse circumstances
of the times.
I think that at this point it would be well
to read the preamble of the Bill now before
us to make clear the class of farmer it is not
intended to benefit:
Whereas in view of the depressed state of
agriculture in the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta during the period immediately following 1929 the present indebtedness
of certain farmers in that area is beyond their
capacity to pay: and whereas it is in the
national interest to retain such farmers on the

357

land as efficieht producers and for such purpose
it is necessary to provide means whereby compromise or rearrangements may be effected of
debts of such farmers, and also to simplify the
operation of the Bankruptcy Act with respect
to farmers generally.
Later, all the eastern provinces and British
Columbia were removed from the provisions of
the Act. Still later, Manitoba was excluded,
and, consequently, in recent years the 1934
measure has been operating only in Alberta
and Saskatchewan.
The measure now before us is confined to
these provinces and Manitoba. The last-mentioned province, because of its fears as to the
status of its Debt Adjustment Act after the
decision on the Alberta Act, asked to be included in the provisions of this new federal
legislation.
That is, briefly, a background of the conditions that brought about the measure I am
now reviewing.
Naturally, honourable senators will want to
know the main features of this legislation. It
makes some extremely important changes in
debt adjustment as carried out under the
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act. The
Boards of Review, each composed of a High
Court judge and representatives of the debtors
and the creditors, disappear. Hereafter District
Court judges will deal with debt adjustment
applications, and the Clerk of the Court in
each judicial district will be the Official Receiver. At this point I might say that, in my
opinion, this change should be helpful. The
District Court judge is close enough to the
cases that come before him to know of the
existing agricultural conditions, and, in most
cases, to .know the farmer and his farming
abilities much better than a travelling Board
of Review could, for the members of that
board would be intimately acquainted only
with the areas in which they lived. In the
other branch of Parliament there has been
criticism of this innovation, but my own view
is that the debtors' interests will not be ýprejudiced or harmed. Our District Court judges,
as I know them, will not allow a farmer to be
forced off the land, if he is an efficient farmer
and trying to do his best, when adverse conditions face him. I make that statement because the criticisrn that has been directed towards the changes has been that they will
make it more difficult than it was under the
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act for the
farmer to get in court the consideration to
which he is entitled. I disagree with that
vîew.
The other significant feature of this Bill is
that a right of appeal is granted from the
decision of the District Court judge. This
appeal goes to a judge of the higher cnurtq

358

SENATE

who, at fixed periods, will go into the judicial
district and hear appeals. I do not think the
Bill carries this provision, but that is the intention, as I understand from the statement made
by the Minister of Finance in another place.
One criticism directed against this measure at
the outset was that it would be costly for a
farmer to appeal any decision, if he had to
travel a long distance to get to the Appellate
Court-for instance, if he had to go from a
distant part of Alberta to either Calgary or
Edmonton. But the procedure which I understand isto be adopted will reduce a farmer's
cost of appeal, as he will not have to travel
very far to have his- case heard. Clause 37
also protects the farmer as to expense in an
appeal, for it provides that only in cases where
the Appeal Court considers there were no
reasonable grounds for appeal will the appellant be required to pay the costs.
There is in this legislation one other provision of much importance. It permits the
re-opening of cases that were adjusted in the
period between 1925 and the end of 1938, with
the stipulation that this right is confined to
the farmer only. I mention this point to
refute the charge that has been made in
another place, that this Act is loaded against
the farmer and favourable only to the creditor.
I think the main attack made on the legislation has been that it is more favourable to
the creditor than to the debtor.
Coming as I do from the part of Canada
to which this legislation is made applicable, I
feel that I should say that most farmers want
to pay their debts. In the last few years
more farm debts have been wiped out or
largely reduced than in any previous period
since the Prairie farmers faced adversity
through crop failure and low prices. I am in
a position to state on fairly good authority
that in the first six months of this year the
payments made by farmers on debts are greater
than in any similar period in the last fourteen
years. That backs up my view that the good
farmer, the farmer who is anxious to stay on
the land and make good, wants to pay his
debts if he is given an opportunity. I think
also that the good, honest farmers-and they
are in the majority-want net only to pay
their debts, but to preserve their credit. They
know that if the confidence of the investors is
completely undermined credit will not be
available, and that, of course, would be disastrous to the future of agriculture in Western
Canada.
I have not attempted, honourable senators,
to state the extent of the farm debt of
Western Canada, or the reductions that have
beeni made in it through the operation of the
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN.

Fairmers' Creditors Arrangement Act. But I may
say that in another place figures were given
yesterday covering the amount of reductions
in secured and unsecured credits over the
period in which the Act had been operating.
I did not total them, but a rough estimate

shows they run over $100,000,000.

I can say

that thousands of farmers are meeting their
obligations each year and will undoubtedly
keep on doing so, unless calamity faces them
in crop failures or low prices. It is to protect
the interests of that type of farmer that this
legislation is introduced.
I feel that in closing I should express a few
words of commendation to those who loaned
their money in Western Canada.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN:
While I give
credit to the honest and hard-working farmer,
who is desirous of meeting his obligations and
wants protection only in periods when, either
through crop failure or low prices, he bas insufficient revenue, I think something should be
said also in commendation of the investing interests. I know that the banks, the insurance
companies, the mortgage companies and individuals who invest their savings in mortgages
are frequently charged with being Shylocks
wanting to take the last drop of blood from
the debtor. In some few instances there may
have been rather cold-blooded treatment of
borrowers, but that is far from being the
attitude of most investors. i know of many
cases where farmers were kept on the land
by compromises made voluntarily by mortgagees. I have not the figures, but I would
estimate the voluntary concessions made and
the losses taken by investing companies run
into many millions of dollars. In Saskatchewan and Manitoba, under voluntary adjustments made in 1936, investors took a loss of
$22,000,000. This sum was wholly apart from
reduction made under provincial and federal
debt legislation.
I do not know that I need say anything
further in presenting this Bill. I have singled
out what I consider to be the vital changes
that the Bill proposes. The clauses I have not
mentioned relate to the operation of the Act.
I think honourable members will find upon
studying the measure that the principle of
the old Act is being inaintained. That principle is that, by reason of the over-expansion
of credit in the West priar to 1929, and the
depression following 1929, it is necessary to
provide a special bankruptcy and insolvency
procedure with regard to farmers. This procedure is designed to bring the indebtedness
of farmers into line with their ability to pay,

SENATE

If the honourable senator from Lethbridge
thinks his right to speak again is now
exhausted, he will perhaps on the third reading
give us some indication of the actual situation
in the province of Manitoba, that is, information showing how many farmers are really in
financial difficulties now. The information
would be enlightening not only te myself, but
te all other members of this Chamber as well.
No doubt this legislation will be enacted.
It has, however, a serious aspect. We know
that the original Act did affect the credit
not only of the Prairie, but also of the Eastern
Provinces, and I should like to hear from
other Western senators if they think that
by and large this proposed legislation will
be a good thing for Manitoba. I first visited
that province more than forty years ago.
In my later visits I was struck by the great
progress that had been made. Winnipeg is a
beautiful city, with its university, schools,
and business buildings, and Manitoba may
well be immensely proud of her capital.
On my first visit to Morden, Deloraine, Portage la Prairie, Brandon and other centres,
what I saw convinced me that great credit
was due to the courageous and able pioneers
of that country. I recall that some years
ago the late Senator Burns, who was born
in Lindsay, Ontario, and whose father was
in the cattle business, told me that as a
young man he took out a herd of dairy cattle
and drove them through the province of
Manitoba. One farmer would buy a cow,
another farmer two cows, and so on. I
asked him, "Did you ever (ose any money?"
He said, "No; I got paid every dollar."
I asked him, "Did you give the farmers
credit?" He said, "I certainly did." What
to-day possibly is lacking in Manitoba, and
indeed throughout the Dominion, is the
pioncer spirit. There is too great a tendency
to lean on the State for aid. Many of the
pioneers of Manitoba went there before the
Canadian Pacific Railway was built. They
drove in with a team of oxen, got their free
section of land, and steadily improved their
holdings through bad seasons as well as good.
Those sturdy pioneers laid the foundations
of that great prosperous province that we
are so proud of to-day.
I wonder whether there is any real
necessity for this legislation to-day. There
are senators on both sides of this House
who come from Manitoba, Saskatchewan and
Alberta. I hope they will not let this debate
terminate without giving us their views. I
have an open mind in regard to this Bill.
Much as I admire the ability of the honourable gentleman from Letbhridge (Hon. Mr.
Buchanan), I would point out that he merely
Mon. Mr. BALLANTYNE

recited the provisions of the Bill and indicated
how it would be administered. I do not think
he made out a strong case in justification of
the bringing down of such legislation at this
time. If the farmers in Manitoba are in such
dire straits that they cannot meet their
principal and interest payments, and in order
te keep them on the land it is necessary
to enact this legislation, then we are
justified in approving it. There are, as honourable senators know, good farmers and
poor farmers. A similar distinction prevails
in business and in the professions-in all
walks of life. Everybody does not succeed.
But I am fairly well convinced that the
efficient and industrious farmers of Manitoba
do not need this Bill, and it is quite likely
that they did not take advantage of the
original Act. My friend opposite (Hon. Mr.
Buchanan) says that those who would apply
for a composition of their debts under this
Bill are efficient farmers. I am glad te hear
it, but I am under the impression that they
may not be; and if a man is not a good
farmer, no matter what financial assistance
you may give to him, he will not eventually
elear off bis indebtedness.
I recall that the late Senator Hughes and the
senator from Prince (Hon. Mr. MacArthur)
told us how unsatisfactorily composition arrangements were reached in Prince Edward
Island and Nova Scotia. That criticism applied
also te Ontario, Quebec and, the Western
Provinces.
I am glad' that one safeguard has been inserted in this Bill that was net in the original
Act. Formerly there was no right of appeal:
under this Bill an appeal may be taken te a
District Court judge.
There is one feature of the Bill that I do net
like. It is provided that if two-thirds of a
farmer's indebtedness dates from 1935 he may
come under this Bill. Why did ho net take
advantage of the original Act when it was in
force? Is it fair and reasonable that now,
wlen we are overburdened with taxation, which
everybody is cheerfully bearing, we should
invite farmers to seek composition of their
debts incurred as far back as 1935? When this
Bill goes before the Committee on Banking
and Commerce, that clause, I think, ought te
be eliminated.
Now, honourable senators, I have little more
te say. I would be the last man in this House
te object te any legislation that would really
further the progress and development of the
province of Manitoba or of the country
generally.
When we are considering this
measure we cannot confine our thoughts and
our judgment exclusively te the province of

361

JULY 22, 1943
Manitoba, but must consider whether the
legislation is good for the three Prairie provinces and whether it is good for the Dominion
of Canada. So I once more express the hope
that before this debate is over we may hear
very cogent reasons why the Government has
brought this legislation down, and why it is

necessary under present conditions in Canada.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: Before anyone else
takes part in the debate, I should like to point

out to the honourable senator that in presenting this Bill I said debt adjustment legislation had been voided by the Privy Council,
and it was assumed that it was voided not only
in Saskatchewan and Alberta, but also in
Manitoba. By reason of conditions prevailing

in some parts of Manitoba the Government of
that province asked the Government of Canada
to include Manitoba in this legislation. That is
the explanation in respect of Manitoba, so
far as I am informed.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I first wish te congratulate the honourable senator from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr.
Buchanan) on bis explanation of the Bill,
even though he omitted to mention one provision, which I shall refer to later on. I
also wish to thank the honourable. leader on
this side of the House for his remarks about
our province. He made conditions look even
brighter than I thought they were.
Now I want to say one or two things
which will have a political ring to them,

but which, I think, ought to be said. This
Bill in our part of the country is not a
piece of financial legislation, but a political
issue. I think the Government of the day
is'taking the right course in presenting the
Bill to Parliament, yet I want it to be understood right at the start that this question
is a political issue in Western Canada. The
measure was brought about by the Government of the province of Alberta, which said
quite defiantly, "We are not going to pay
our debts, and we are going to prevent any
creditor from collecting from anyone in the
province, the Privy Council and the Government of Canada notwithstanding." Then
there is in Saskatchewan an opposition party
which says that a farmer who borrows money
should net pay it back unless bis homestead
rights in the land are protected; that whatever he has paid is to be taken as an equity
against the mortgage, and that if the property
has gone down in value the mortgage must be
reduced, but that any profit on the sale of
the property should go to the farmer. In
other words, it is a case of "Heads I win,
72542-24

tails you lose." That is the political philosophy which is being preached in two provinces of this country.

The province of Manitoba does not need
this legislation at all. In proportion to its
population

and

accumulated

wealth,

that

province subscribed in April last as large an
amount as any other part of Canada. Seven
hundred thousand people subscribed $86,000,000-a truly magnificent subscription.
Again, in proportion to population, the province of Manitoba stands first or second in
the whole Dominion in the matter of enlistments. Last year our farmers produced the
best crop Manitoba has ever had, and in
relation to the acreage under cultivation

Western Canada produced the largest crop
ever produced, not excepting the year 1915.
There is therefore no fundamental justification
for this legislation at all. But if we reject

this measure we go back to the old legislation
and the Boards of Review; which would
mean that in Saskatchewan and Alberta the
creditor could not get a fair deal. Why,

honourable senators, there are cases in which
men who got adjustments sold their farms
within six months at a huge profit, pocketed
the profit, and walked off with it.
This brings me to the provision which the

honourable senator from Lethbridge omitted
to mention. This provision says that if an
adjustrnent is made, and the land is sold at
any time within the next five years, the
creditor, up to the amount of his claim, shall

have a right to that profit.
An Hon. SENATOR: Three years.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Three years? I thought
it was five years.

I think it was stated in

the House of Commons to be five years.
As I say, this is a political issue, and this
is the first attempt by any Government to
declare to the people of Western Canada, "We
are going to put this matter before a judicial

body that is used to weighing facts." It is true
that under the old law the chairman of the.

commission was a judge.

I must say that

the two judges in our province were very fair.
One of them was a city man. Probably ten

per cent of the farmers came under the Act,
certainly not more than fifteen per cent, in the
three provinces. In 1939 the Manitoba Government wrote to every farmer who had asked

for debt adjustment, telling him to apply
under the Act; but even then not more than
fifteen per cent applied. And who were those
who did apply? The first class of applicant
was the person who had a poor piece of land

-and

even in districts where the land is of

the very best you will find a little poor land;

and the second was the man who through unfortunate circumstances, perhaps because of
sickness, was unable to carry on, or who had
suffered from drought and rust or the grasshopper plague.
An Hon. SENATOR: Or who was a poor
manager.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I shall come to that point
later. These people applied, and quite properly so. Then there was another class, the
men who were poor farmers and who would
always be poor farmers. Well, some people
think there are no poor lawyers, but that is
not true. I should estimate that twenty-five
per cent of the young men who graduate in
law never go any further. Much the same
thing could be said of those engaged in merchandising or any other occupation.
Even
housewives do not all make a success of their
job. After you have disposed of the cases
which, owing to conditions, have genuine
merit, you come to the professional crooks, the
men who applied simply in order to get out
of paying their debts. There were plenty of
these. I could name case after case in one
province where people deliberately applied to
have their debts adjusted, and got the benefit
of the legislation because the judges, by reason
of all the stories they had heard, had developed a certain psychology. In the province of
Saskatchewan-I say this with all due respect
to honourable gentlemen from that province
-one
of the judges, in my opinion, went
"haywire."
He thought he was sent frim
Heaven or from some other place to save
humanity by a stroke of the pen, and he proceeded accordingly, and could not be corrected.
About five per cent of the cases tried in our
courts of law are appealed, and when the
Court of Appeal hands down a decision it
governs the decisions of the lower courts;
but in this matter of debt adjustment there
was no appeal, and, if you got a bad judgment you were left with it. This Bill provides for an appeal, and puts the matter in
the hands of a judge who, as the honourable
senator from Lethbridge has said, knows the
district in question. In Manitoba it will be
a judge in Dauphin, Minnedosa, Brandon,
Winnipeg and so on. In Saskatchewan there
will bo twenty of these judges, who know local
conditions and know the people, and who are
used to weighing evidence. If there are mistakes of law or misjudgments of the facts,
there will be an appeal to the Court of Appeal.
Personallv I should have liked to see the
whole Court of Appeal sitting in judgment;
but, as the honourable Minister pointed -out in
another place, it would then be necessary for
ine people of Manitoba to travel to WinniHUn. Mr. HAIG.

peg, those of Saskatchewan to go to Regina,
and those of Alberta to go to Calgary or Lethbridge. The judge of the appeal will go not
only to the judicial district-in Saskatchewan
there are twenty of them-but to all the
principal places in the province. In this way
the farmer will have every chance to present
his case with as little expense as possible.
Probably I should say, honourable senators,
that conditions in Manitoba, Saskatchewan
and Alberta were caused largely by conditions
existing after the Great War. You will remember that in the closing days of that war
wheat went up in price. I think it went as
high as $2.17 or 82.25 a bushel. The farmer,
who probably could produce wheat for 85 cents
a bushel, would buy land adjoining his farm.
He might pay as much as $50, $75 or $100 an
acre. To-day that land is worth perhaps $35
an acre. After he bought it there came a
drop in the price of wheat, and he was caught.
A great many applications came from persons
of that type. Such a man should not have
had an adjustment. It was greed on his part
that caused him to pay an exorbitant price
for adjoining land.
There is a philosophy in our country, and
there is some basis for it. When I was a boy,
if we wanted to say a man was a good business
man or farmer, we said he was "as good
as wheat." You could not pay a person
a higher compliment than that. We could
always sell wheat; the idea of not being able
to sell wheat never entered our minds. Wheat
became the gold standard of our Western
country, with the result that when wheat was
selling at $2 a bushel other things were priced
up, inflated, in proportion. When the price
of wheat dropped there was a deflation. That
is the way we -look at things out there. I
myself understand it, for I think of everything
in terms of wheat. When I talk of land value
I talk about it in terms of wheat. A farmer bas
that same mentality, and if when wheat was $2
a bushel he paid $75 an acre for land, he thinks
that when wheat falls to $1 the value of the
land should be S37.50. It is hard to get him
away from that point of view and to convince
him that the ceonpany which lent him money
should not take the same loss that he bas
taken. And a good case can be made out
for his way of looking at it.
The trouble really started, net with the
mortgage companies and the life insurance
companies-I am not here to speak for thembut with farmers who had sold their farms to
other farmers and retired to local villages.
They insisted that if they did net get their
payments they would foreclose.
And they
could foreclose, because if necessarv they could
go back to the land themselves. No mortgage
company can foreclose, generally speaking.

JULY 22, 1943

Of course, they do foreclose sometimes, but
only in a limited number of cases. Suppose
that in the three provinces you have five
hundred mortgagors behind in their payments.
Where will you get fiye hundred other
farmers to take over the lands? If things
are so bad that a farmer cannot make his farn
pay, who else can make it pay?
I should protest against this legislation being
imposed on Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: On that point, will
the honourable gentleman explain why Manitoba is included under the Bill? That has not
been cleared up."
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I am afraid I should have
to indulge in politics if I told you why
Manitoba is in the Bill. The Privy Council
decided that all debt legislation was legislation
of the nature of bankruptey, and that therefore under the British North America Act it
came within the jurisdiction of the Parliament
of Canada. The case was taken to the Privy
Council by Alberta, but as a result of the
Privy Council decision our debt legislation in
Manitoba has been practically repealed. However, i believe that but for the fact that the
political position in the other two provinces
would have spilled over into Manitoba, our
province would not have been in the Bill at all.
You must remember that no province has
increased the par value of its bonds in the last
five years to the saine extent as Manitoba has.
If you will compare the market prices of
Manitoba securities five years ago with the
prices ito-day, you will see that this is so. Our
4j per cent bonds are selling as high as $107
and $108, and the last issue, which I think was
at 3* per cent, is at par. These high prices
result from the preaching by our Government
that a contract is a contract and that when you
make a promise to pay a debt- you must pay
it. The Government of Manitoba, under the
former Premier, said that we must live within
our income; and the new Premier is proceeding
along the sarne lines. We understand that we
must pay our debts, and that is why we ask,
" If there is to be reconstruction after the war,
where is the money to come from?"
The only reason I can see why Manitoba
asked to be included in this legislation is that
after the Alberta Act had been declared ultra
vires Manitoba felt it should ask to be treated
the same as Alberta and Saskatchewan. We
are all Western provinces, and all have the
same basic commodity business, and as a
Manitoban I should agree to this.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN:
senators, the honourable gentleman seems to

think that Manitoba is the only province that
pays its debts. Well, the province I come from
pays its debts. The only defaulting province
that I know of in the Dominion is Alberta.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I am not boasting about
what Manitoba is doing.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: It is not the only
province that pays its debts.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I did not intend to suggest that. The point is, though, that we are
not asking to have this legislation made
effective in our province, but you are asking
that it be made effective there. Ordinarily,
in view of the province's strong financial
position, I should object to this legislation.
The reason I do not object to it is that if I
were the Government to-day I would paâs
this legislation. My duty as a senatorHon. Mr. HORNER: Is to oppose it.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: May I ask the
honourable gentleman from Winnipeg whether
there is a real need on the part of the
farmers of Manitoba for this legislation?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No. Manitoba does not
need it at all. There is no doubt about that.
There may be some need for it in the cities
and villages, but there is none in the rural parts
of the province, among the farmers. Nbbody
will deny that. You must look at this thing
realistically. Two-thirds of the business that
Manitoba does outside the province come from
Saskatchewan and Alberta, and we have to
bear in mind that it is to our advantage that
these provinces too should be prosperous. If
this Bill will improve the general business of
those two provinces, I, as a Manitoban, have
to consider that when deciding whether or not
to support the Bill.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: May I ask if the
loss of the Debt Adjustment Act seriously
affects any interest in Manitoba?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Only loans in the cities,
not in the country. I cannot imagine any
part of Manitoba needing any debt legislation at all.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: That Act has been
in force in Manitoba for some time.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, but practically no use
has been made of it outside the cities. I
should like the honourable leader on this side
(Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) and other honourable
members over here to realize that the great
bulk of the business of Manitoba is done in
the city of Winnipeg. About ninety-five per

364

SENATE

cent of the taxes collected by the Dominion
Government in Manitoba comes from Winnipeg. When the war loan was on, the people of
Winnipeg bought seventy-five per cent of the
$86,000,000 total subscribed by the province.
As I say, the people of Manitoba do business with Alberta and Saskatchewan. If this
legislation is needed in those two provinces,
if it is considered to be in their interests, I,
as a Manitoba senator, have to weigh that
against the unfairness that the measure would
work to Manitoba. I think the legislation will
be hardly used at all in Manitoba. It applies
only to debts incurred prior to the lst of May,
1935. Truc, if one-third of a mans debts has
been incurred since that time, they would come
under the Act. But the Act would apply to
only a very limited extent. At the present
moment I cannot imagine that one per cent
of the farmers of Manitoba will ever come
under this legislation.
Certainly not more
than one per cent of them will ever have any
need for it. Therefore, so far as our province
is concerned, it is not a very serious matter.
But in Saskatchewan and Alberta the present
law is, to employ a mild terrn, a humbug. It
is being used as a racket in those provinces.
This legislation for the first time provides a
ineans whereby a creditor may appeal to have
his case heard by a Supreme Court judge on
the merits, without prejudice.
That is a
tremendous gain.
At the present moment no company in
Canada, so far as I know, is making farm
loans in Western Canada. The only source of
such loans in the three Prairie provinces is
the Canadian Farm Loan Board. I venture
to say that my honourable friend from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan) cannot name a
single company that is making loans in any
one of the three provinces.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN:
The companies
have not been making loans in Alberta since
1935.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The danger is that we are
by this legislation continuing the threat to
contracts and helping to strengthen the impression that a man who signs an agreement
does not have to live up to it. That sort of
thing hurts credit seriously. In the province of
Alberta to-day, for instance, no man will make
any investment by way of loan, nor sell a farm
except for cash. The other day there came to
my notice a case where an application was
made for a loan of $8,000 on a property in the
city of Calgary worth $30,000. The company to
which the application was made said it would
not lend $8, let alone $8,000, because there
was no telling what kind of legislation might
be passed in the province.
Len. Mr. HAIG.

I am not blaming Mr. Bennett and his Government for passing the Farmers' Creditors
Arrangement Act in 1934. They thought they
were doing the right thing, and I admit that
I thought so, too, at the time. For the first
couple of years the Act went very well, but
then the racket started, and as a result the
credit of our country bas been hurt. This
measure also will hurt credit to a certain
extent. I do not think it will do very much
d.amage in Manitoba, however; I am convinced that the benefits of the measure will
outweigh its disadvantages there.
I hope honourable senator's will pardon me
for speaking so long, but I feel very keenly
about this legislation. It is the first time that
I have seen any daylight in all the amendments that have been made during the years
to this legislation. It is the first time to my
knowledge that the Parliament of Canada bas
simply said in effect that the idea that a contract need not be lived up to must be gradually brought to an end.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: It would be a good thing
for Western Canada if somebody would go on
the platforn in that part of the country and
tell the people that they are only hurting
themselves. Why should fifteen per cent of
any country control the credit of the other
eighty-five per cent? That is what is happening. The sooner we restore credit in the interests of the good farmers, the people who
want to get on in the world, the better it
will be for them and for our country.
Hon. W. M. ASELTINE: Honourable senators, from representatives of the provinces of
Alberta and Manitoba and from the honourable leader on this side (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne),
we have heard a good deal about the Farmers'
Creditors Arrangement Act of 1934 and the
Bill now before the House. I am both for
and against this Bill, but I think I am more
for it than aga-inst it. I should not be for it at
all but for the fact that in my opinion the
law is being substantially changed for the better. I come from a province where the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act bas been in
force ever since 1934. Being an active practising lawyer in that province, I have run up
against tbe provisions of the Act as much,
perhaps, as any other person in the province
has. I reside in a rural area where a certain
number of applications have been made, and I
have appeared before the Official Receiver and
the Board of Review on behalf not only of
debtors, but also of creditors.
It is true that in many cases the Act bas
been taken advantage of by unscrupulous

JTJLY 22, 1943

farmers, as was said by the honourable senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig). It is
also truc that many farmers who were entitled to consideration have received very
little. Many who had proposals made hav.e
never kept up their payments, but others
have lived up to the proposals and paid their
debts. There are other cases which have not
yet been adjusted, but which probably will
be if this Bill passes.
As the honourable member from Lethbridge
has explained, after 1934 province after province withdrew from the operation of the Act
until eventually it applied only to Saskaýtchewan and Alberta. Some years later, at
the request of the Government of Manitoba,
a bill was introduced to make the Act again
applicable to that province. I was pne of
those who spoke against the Bill in this
House. I opposed it on three grounds. The
first was that the procedure was too expensive.
As. will be recalled, there were Boards of
Review travelling about Saskatchewan accompanied by stenographers and clerks, and the
costs of administering the Act were high.
Secondly, I felt there should be a time limit
placed on the operation of the legislation.
As honourable members are aware, the Act
of 1934 was amended from time to time, one
of the amendments providing that no debt
incurred prior to May 1, 1935, should be
adjusted.' But no date was set for the expiry
of the Act. I thought from five to eight
years should be sufficient to enable the
farmers of any province to decide whether
they would take advantage of the legislation.
Thirdly, I objected that there was no right
of appeal, and on the motion for third reading I moved an amendment to make good
this omission. The Senate passed the Bill
as amended, but the other House refused to
accept it. The Senate insisted on the am.endment, and eventually the Bill died. We heard
nothing more about any farmers' creditors
arrangement legislation until the introduction
of this Bill.
I am pleased to note that it contains two
or three improvements on the original Act.
For one thing, the procedure has been much

district judges will do the work. This will
mean a saving in costs of administration, because the judges will not receive additional

remuneration.
Court will act as official receivers, and, though
they may be paid certain fees, these will not
involve much extra expenditure. The simplified procedure should not only effect a
considerable saving of costs, but also produce
better results.

3b

I am pleased that the Bill makes provision
for appeals. I have had many cases under
the original Act where I felt my clients
should have had the right of appeal, because
they had not received British justice. Though
under the Act a man might have his property
taken away from him, he had no recoursé
by way of appeal to a judge.
I have some suggestions to make to the
Government in relation to the Bill. First, I
would suggest that a clause be inserted to
the effect that three years from the enactment
of this measure no further applications for
composition of debts shall be entertained.
This should allow ample time for those who
have not had their debts adjusted to decide
whether they would take advantage of this
legislation. Of course applications then pending would still be- heard.
I have another suggestion which I think
is quite important. When a farmer, badly
involved financially, makes a composition
with his creditors under the Act, he is
expected, after a good crop, to pay off his
debts in accordance with the terms of the
arrangement. But in many cases he cannot do
so, and I will tell you why. Takç a farmer
with a couple of sections of land. When he
gets a good crop he has to pay so much
income tax that he cannot possibly pay off
his debts. I know some farmers who have
had to pay $5,000 and upwards of income
tax on a good crop. I suggest that such a
farmer should pot be liable for income tax
so long as his composition arrangement is in
force and unpaid. The purpose of this Bill
is to put a farmer into a position to pay his
debts, and, obviously, he cannot do so if
he lias to set aside 40 per cent of his crop
returns to meet income tax.
Might I suggest to
Hon. Mr. DAVIES:
the honourable gentleman that there are today many business men in exactly that position; they cannot pay their debts because

leges be given to farmers in this connection?
lon. Mr. ASELTINE: This is a measure
to put farmers on their feet and so keep
them on the land. If they are to be kept on
the land, they should be placed in a position
to pay off their indebtedness.
I listened to the debate on this Bill in the
other House. Some members from Western
Canada seemed to think that the farmer was
not sufficiently protected in so far as foreclosure under mortgages and cancellation of
agreements for sale were concerned. To meet
a decision rendered by the Privy Council in
a certain case, Saskatchewan has passed legislation which I think fully protects the farmer

366

SENATE

in this respect. The statute requires that
before instituting proceedings for foreclosure
of a mortgage or cancellation of an agreement
for sale application must be made to the
district court for an appointment. Notice of
that appointment is served on the mortgagor
and on any other person who by the title
appears to have an interest in the land. All
parties appear before the judge. who makes
the appointment far enough ahead to enable
the sheriff of the district and a board
appointed by the province to make a full
investigation of the farmer's affairs. Their
report is submitted to the judge. It is only
after those preliminaries that the mortgagee
can obtain consent to commence an action.
Usually, unless it is a very bad, case, the
application for foreclosure or cancellation is
refused. Therefore by that statute the farmer
is protected to the fullest extent. We have
in Saskatchewan another statute under the
title of Limitation and Civil Rights Act. If
a rmachinery company desires to seize farm
machinery because payment is in arrear, notice
is served on the farmer, and he has twenty
days in which to apply to the district court
judge for a hearing. Then all parties appear
and the case is fully investigated ahead of
tinte, and if the farmer has any rights at all
they are protected. He may want time in
which to sell his crop to enable him to make
payment, and the judge gives him the time;
anti so on.
It will be seen that the farmers of Saskatrhewan are well protected, and I feel that if
tIhis Bill is enacted no farmer should have
any complaint at all to make that his affairs
could not be satisfactorily adjusted so that
ho would be in a position to pay his debts.
I would, however, ask the Covernment to
give favourable consideration to my two
suggestions, nately, that the operation of the
Acu be for a definite period, and that any
fariner complying with the terms of the
composition arrangement should be given
some relief frem the payment of income tax.
Hon. J. P. MOLLOY: Honourable members,
as you are well aware, I cannot follow the proceedings as rapidly as J could at one time,
for reasons perhaps best known to myself.
However, as I do not want to delay the Bill,
since there is a chance that adjournment of
Parliament may take place to-morrow, I desire
to discuss the Bill now.
I am convinced that a lot of trouble over
this Act might have been avoided. Strange
as it may seem to honourable members, it has
often occurred to me that the trouble bas
arisen mainly from the title of the original
Act. It was intituled the Farmers' Creditors
ton. Mr. ASELTINE.

Arrangement Act. Had the world known, particularly the Canadian farmer, that the proper
title should have been the farmers' arrangement to skiver his creditors, we should have
got out of a lot of trouble.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: This legislation was
bad from the very beginning. It is true, as bas
been said by the honourable senator from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig), that the original
Act was brought forward during the very
depth of the depression in 1934. But who in
the world sat up night after night burning the
midnight oil looking for a title to this Act is
beyond me. As a consequence, when I rise
to-day to support this Bill, I do it with a
certain degree of hesitancy, believing and
knowing that the legislation was wrong from
the very beginning.
There is no doubit that the original Act was
introduced with the very best intention by those
who sponsored it, but the maladministration of
the legislation, which bordered on a scandal,
became such that the people would not tolerate it. Just the other day I was invited by a
friend of mine to spend a week-end with him
in the country. He lives on a hundred-acre
farm. He said, "I have another hundred acres
about three miles and a half from here, and I
should like to take you over to see it." We
went over. It was a very good farm. That
happened to be on Sunday. On Monday, while
coming in to town, he said to me, "What do
you think of that farm that I showed you
yesterday?" I said, "It is a very good farm,
but it would be very much better if it were
alongside your own." "Well," ho said, "that
farm came into my possession under these
conditions. A brother and sister had a mortgage on the farm, but the owner was determined he would not pay what he owed. It was
about the time the 1934 legislation was introduced, but fortunately for them they succeeded
in getting him off the farm before the bill
became law; otherwise that man would be
still there.
He was not paying his local
taxes or his interest. In fact ho did not intend
to pay anything."
The honourable member from Winnipeg
says that in a way this does not apply to
Manitoba, and I am not going to challenge
that statement. I was speaking to an official
of the provincial Government about two
years ago, and somehow or other ho mentioned this Act and the way it operated. Let
m say that the soil in that portion of the
country, on a Government analysis, is rated
the, best in Canada. In this particular jurisdiction the official-who does not occupy the

JULY 22, 194
position of a judge, or anything of that kind,

but is connected with the administration of
the Act-said that forty-two persans came
under the Act. Hie said, "I know tbem al
and you know thern ail." I did know them,
for I have lived in the district since 1879.
"Now," he said, "there are forty-one wha
had no right whatever ta corne under the
Act. There was sorne ground for tbe fortysecond man doing sa, as he rau into what
you might eall unavoidable had luck." The
point was that the debtor was taking an
undue advantage of the creditor.
Perhaps what prejudices me against this
Act more than anything else is a case that
was related by a judge in the province of
Ontario. Who the judge was you will neyer
know. The case was a very simple one.
There was a man of seventy years of age.
is wife died. They had no farnily. Hie
decided that rather than carry on the work
of the farm, on which he did not owe a
dollar, and on which he and bis wife bad
lived for fifty years, he would sell the farm,
stock and rnachinery. Tbe sale hrought him
$9,400. The oId gentleman said ta himself:
"I will set aside $400 and move-ta the village.
I will lend the $9,000 at a fair rate of interest,
say 5 per cent." When it became known that
this rnoney was available, the vultures-I
think I may caîl tbem so-flocked about
him. The biggest bird said he wouid take
the whole $9,000. The answer ta this proposai

was No.

The next two birds of prey said,

"Te help you out we will each take $4,500?"
But tbey were refused. Then came forward

They said, "We will take $3,000 apiece," and

went well until this Act came into force.
Then these young men were "put wise'ý-as

This Act bas neyer appeaied to me, and it
does nlot appeal to me any more to-day than
it did in 1934. In 1934 it might have had some
appeal, because, as bas been said by the
honourable senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Haig), things were dark not only for the
farmer, but for everybody else as well. I find
noa fault witb the introduction of the Act, but
what crosses me is its administration.
I arn voting for this Bill on one condition,
and one condition anly. If there is going to be
anything resembling the administration of the
old Act, I shall be one of the first to denounce
this measure frorn the place where I now stand,
if I arn spared ta do soý. My only hope is
that past experience and the provision for the
Court of Appeal wiil resuit in everyhody being
fairly treated.
One thing we must remember. A great
rnany people when they borrow money say,
"Oh, well, it is ta a mortgage company"ýor a life insurance company or a fire insurance company-"'that we owe tÉe money."
That is not always true. When yon borrow
money an a rnortgage yo-u very often barrow
the money of widows and orphans and the
aged, who have no other means of support, and
in the province of Alberta or anywhere aise
it is absolutely wrong ta deny these people
their rights. Therefore, by no vote of mine
will I do anything ta affect the weil-being of
the widows, the orpbans or the aged. This is
the money of many people who entrust it to
companies ta lend it for their benefit at a fair
rate of interest.
Now, it bas been said that Manitaba does
not need this legisiation. I will not go quite sO
far as that. There are, no doubt, cases in
Manitoba where it will apply; and I hope it
does appiy, and fairly. That it will apply in
Saskatchewan and Alberta on the samne basis
there is noa doubt. I remember speaking ta
some of the ministers of the province of Saskatchewan about a year ago. They said, "We
really need this Act, but we cannot get it, because the Senate will nlot pass it." I said,
"You make a fair proposition to the Senate
and they will pass it."
I arn not goýing to vote for this measure
with any overheated enthusiasm. I will not
say that I vote for it with reluctance, but, as
I have said, I arn going ta vote for it on
the condition that it shall be fairiy and squarely
administered as between the debtor and the
creditor; and if it is not, it will receive no
further support froin me.
I do not know that I can add anytbing ta
what bas already been said. The whoie thîng,
I repeat, is a matter of compromise. There
are rnany frorn Western Canada ini another

SENATE
place who say the Act has not gone far
enough. I say it bas. In the opinion of some,
it has gone too far. So far as I am concerned, it is a compromise. Let us hope it
will work out fairly and squarely for all concerned. My only desire is that each and every
,me shall be treated fairly. As to the old
Act, under which people refused to pay their
just debt when in many cases they could have
paid it, I say that that kind of legislation I
will not support, and I hope I am not supporting it in voting for this Bill.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators,
there are just a few points in connection with
this measure that have not been dealt with
by any of the previous speakers. The honourable the leader on this side of the House (Hon.
Mr. Ballantyne) did mention the expectation
that this would be merely emergent and shortterm legislation.
Honourable senators will
remember that a great portion of Western
Canada, including south-western Saskatchiewan,
had no crop for tbree or four years as a
result of drought, and that when there was
rain the grasshoppers took the crop. I may
say that I received the greatest surprise of
my life when I learned that the board was
travelling about in northern Saskatchewan,
where we had no need of it.
This measure is entirely unfair, and if there
is one duty this body could and should
perform, a duty which is particularly and
peculiarlv suited to the Senate, it is to vote
against this measure. The province of Saskatchewan bas suffered by having a worse measure
than this one, possibly, but we at least should
prevent this legislation being imposed on
Manitoba. I agrec with everything that bas
been said about the lowering of the morale of
the people who take advantage of this
legislation.
I was very much interested in the splendid
explanation of the Bill by the honourable
senator from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan),
and his statement that adjustments were
being made long before this legislation was
introduced: At that time, wben a good man
was fouud to be paying for land more than
it was worth, there was an adjustment between
man and man; but under this legislation and
the reduction of the debt by the board-sometimes to one-third-not a dollar bas been paid.
I have resented the fact that Manitoba and
other provinces were dropping out and that I
could get no support for having Saskatchewan
dropped; but so far as the credit of the
province is concerned, I am not alarmed about
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY.

the injury that bas been done to the credit
of the farmers of that province. The greatest
teacher of all is experience, experience of hard
knocks, and unless I am greatly mistaken the
farmers of Western Canada are no longer
going to borrow money, certainly net at eight
per cent. They are goicg to pay their way.
Yeu must remember that Saskatchewan was
a new province. We had net had the lesson
of crop failure and dronght; but now the
whole picture is changed. We shall not need
the loans we needed in the past, and in
Saskatchewan we will net take them.
I want to reply now to the splendid speech
of the honourable senator from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. Haig), part of which I resent. He
spoke of the greed of the farmer who bought
additional land.
Can the farmer net have
an honest ambition to make money? Is not
he entitled te that as well as anyone else? I
can imagine that some who have had the
experience of paying legal fees have shed
tears. I am reminded of the advice, "Buy
more land, and raise more wheat to buy more
land." I would attribute the plight of the
farmers te poor judgment rather than greed.
What about the man who buys stocks on
margin and who loses his money wen they go
down? You may call the motive greed or poor
judgnent or ambition. We used to think that
the farmer who was willing to stay on his
bomestead and net enlarge it was net the best
type of citizen. The ambitious man employed
labour and created more stir in the community,
to the benefit of all concerned.
This Act las net worked out at all as I
expected it would. I supported it at the
time it was introduced, because I thought
it would belp in the area that had met
disaster. At the time of the Tokyo earthquake money was sent from all over Canada to relieve distress. It was the condition
tiat existed in the West that led me to
believe the legislation necessary.
Possibly
the farmer is entitled te bankruptcy legislatien if he is hopelessly involved, se that he
can go into bankruptcy.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: He can do that.
Hon. Mr. IIORNER:

He can?

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: He could net be
forced into bankruptcy, but he could make a
voluntary assignment.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I do think that, as
was said .by the honourable senator from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig), the object of this
legislation is a political one.

369

JULY 22, 1943
Let me repeat that if this body has a
particular duty, it is a duty to defeat legislatien of this kind.
Honourable
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK:
senators, as everyone within my hearing
realizes, there is a great deal that I do not
know about this general question. I rise
te speak on it only because one of my lifelong convictions has been that . this world's
troubles are largely the result of attempts by
individuals te evade their proper responsibilities and liabilities. Such attempts, I think..
have caused a great many of the difficulties
that Canada finds itself in to-day.
In anticipation of this discussion, I have
had in my pocket for about a month an article
reprinted from the Globe and Mail, Toronto,
captioned "Finance at Large," by Wellington Jeffers, Financial Editor. I am not going
te impose upon the House a reading of the
whole article, but I would ask that it be
incorporated in the record, as I think it deals
pretty fully with the general subject-matter
we have been talking about this afternoon.
In the centre of the article there is a table
showing the amount of mortgages in the

that it be placed on record when this discussion took place, because, as I said when I

FINANCE

AT LARGE

By Wellington Jeffers, Financial Editor
In Report to Nation the Census Bureau Shows
Total of $653 Millions Mortgage Farm Debt,
Much Reduced Since 1931 Census Was Taken
The census of 1941 shows that farmers and
farming in Canada are in nothing like the
parlous state which might have been expected
from recent propaganda at Ottawa from those
who want farm credit arrangement Acts stiffened
in the Prairie Provinces, and measures taken to
forgive a great deal of the debt that already
exists. In fact, a table just prepared shows that
at the time of the census in 1941 the total farm
debt of Canada was $652-5 millions, consisting
of $463-3 millions for farm mortgages. $165-9
millions in agreements for sale and $23.3 millions covering liens.
The debt per farm is less than it was when
the prev.ious census of 1931 was taken. That is
shown by the fact that the total amount of
mortgages and agreements for sale in 1941 is
down 6-3 per cent from 1931, while in the same
period the number of farmers owing the debt
increased 9.2 per cent.
Farm Mortgage Debts Decrease.
The debt covered by mortgages and agreements for sale is only on land and buildings
operated by the owner and does not include
the amount of mortgage debt and agreements
for sale on land operated by tenants, because
this has no bearing on the debt problems of
Western farmers. Mortgages and agreements
for sale include all debts represented by agreements, by deeds or contracts for title, deeds of
trust, judgments and by any other legal instruFALLIS: Are these farm

Prairie Province Farmers Paying Off Debts
The actual comparative mortgage debt figures
(on owned land and buildings) for the three
Prairie Provinces, taken from the 1931, 1936
and 1941 census reports, are as follows:

millions of dollars, including accrued
interest.
The Manitoba figures show that there is no
real farm debt problem in that province.
Manitoba fariers are reducing their debt
steadily. In light of these figures it is difficult
to sec why Manitoba needs the Farmers'
Creditors Arrangement Act restored.
Mortgage debt in Saskatchewan and Alberta
increased froni 1931 to 1936, but since 1936 it
lias been reduced below the 1931 figure. If the
decrease from 1936 was taken instead of 1931,
the percentage in debt reduction would bu
higher than 6-3 per cent and 5.3 per cent
estimuates given above for reductions in the
decade.
Non Is Bad Time to Destroy Farm Credit
In speaking of $625-3 millions as by no means
a large farm mortgage debt, I was considering
both the relationship of this total to the current
estimaces of the value of farin assets in Canada
and to the earnings in recent years. The 1936
census figures showed farmers in Saskatchsewan,
whose position nwas generally regarded as the
worst during the drought years in the 30's, to
have assets in lands, buildings, live stock and
machinery of $1,023 millions, or $30 per inproved acre. The land and buildings alone were
valued at $798 millions and the mortgage debt
is non believed to bu down at $255 millions.
because some bas been paid back since the 1941
census study was made.
Of course, a lot of

and the legislation now asked at Ottawa,
according to F. G. Butterfield, president of the
Land Mortgage Companies Association of Saskatchewan, "would completely destroy farn

on record, bit new peaks in live stock and their
products, and had a cash income of $189-6
millions, double the 1938 total. and that without including bonuses and subsidies of $31-5
millions.

Some say that Saskatchewan's farm debt
really amounts to $600 millions if everything is
included. But reliable judges think it is below
$400 millions, including relief and farni aid
advances. tax arrears, and debts to fari implenient, cil, bank and retail companios. Lu the
last four years farmers have reduced these debts.
Implemîent debt is less than half what is was at
the end of 1937. There are many fully owned
farms in the province.
If this is the situation in Saskatchewan.
where the debts were supposed to bu heaviest
and hardest to bear in an econony levoted in
a grcat degree to one crop. the position in other
provinces does net call for credit lestroying
legislation. Saskatchewan really bas followed
a good course in preserving its public credit
during the hard years in the face of its difficulties, and it is diversifying its farming at
a rapid rate. It woulid bu poor post-war preparation to pass laws whicb would spoil the public
record and stop the financing of farm purchases
and sales.
Even though I hate to take this stand, I
cannot support the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, I
should like to have the Bill read a third time

referred to the Banking and Commerce Committee, and when it is taken up there tomorrow morning we can have the Law Clerk
present.
The motion was agreed to.

JULY 22, 1943

NATIONAL FITNESS BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 138, an Act to establish a
council for the purpose of promoting national
fitness.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Honourable
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
senators, when shall this Bill be read a second
time?
Hon. Mr. KING: With leave, I would move
the second reading now and make a brief
explanation. I think it is well known to many
honourable senators that prior to the war some
European states had undertaken youth training programmes, with the idea of building up
physical fitness. That was donc more particularly in Czechoslovakia and the Scandinavian
countries. Their programmes attracted attention in other countries, especially Great Britain
and the United States, and the League of
Nations became interested in it. The League
passed recommendations which were sent out
to all members of that body, suggesting that a
study be made and some plan or programme
adopted for improving the physical fitness .of
people in the respective countries. Canada received such a recommendation, but no action
was taken upon it by the Federal Government.
Some three or four years ago, however, tbe
provinces of British Columbia and Alberta
undertook provincial youth training programmes. In British Columbia we watched the
development of the programme with great
interest, and I have no hesitation in saying
that not only was it of benefit to our younger
people, but it received the endorsation of older
citizens in the various communities.
Before the war the Dominion of Australia
adopted a national fitness programme, which
is in existence to-day. Great Britain also, after
some considerable study, undertook developments along this liñe, as did the United States.
I think we were all greatly startled, shortly
after the war broke out, to find so large a
proportion of our young men rejected as
physically unfit when they went to enlist in
the armed forces. Many of us found it difficult
to believe that such a condition could exist in
a country like Canada, which has very little
overcrowding and certainly no scarcity of food.
The record in countries that had adopted youth
training programmes was encouraging, and I
think al who tried to familiarize themselves
with it found it intensely interesting.

This Bill is a start towards the establishment of a national fitness programme. It
comes to us with the unanimous approval of
the other House, where it was considered and
passed in all three stages yesterday. It provides for an appropriation of $225,000, to be
expended in co-operation with the provinces
on a fifty-fifty basis, for setting up a programme such as I have indicated. In addition,
$25,000 is provided for national administration.
It is proposed in the Bill that each province
coming into.the scheme would be represented
by one member on the council to be set up.
The only paid official would be the National
Director. Other officers who might become
associated with the council would be representatives of the provinces, and be paid only
their expenses resulting from attendance at
meetings.
At the present time the Department of
Labour has a number of training centres for
young men, where recreation programmes are
carried on. Under this Bill there would be
co-operation between various departments of
the Federal Government, and also with the
provinces, if they so desired. It would be for
the provinces themselves to say whether they
wished to take part in the scheme; there is
nothing coercive about the Bill in this respect.
As I have already said, the provinces of
British Columbia and Alberta had established
programmes before the war, and I understand Ontario has indicated its desire to partieipate in a programme.
I believe that if the scheme is properly
organized it will not only improve the physical
condition of the youth of this country, but
will also do much to improve their moral fitness and give them a better realization of the
necessity for discipline in our relations with
one another. I personally have given some
attention and study to the programmes that
were undertaken in Czechoslovakia and the
Scandinavian countries. The reports on those
programmes are most interesting and of great
value. I do not believe that we in Canada
could well afford no.t to undertake some such
plan as this for giving our youth an opportunity to develop their physical fitness.
We know that under present-day conditions boys in general have not the same
need to make themselves useful that boys
had when most of us were young. For the
boy in thê ordinary country town there is
no wood-box to fill, no cow stable to clean.
Those chores have disappeared, and to-day after
school the youth in the country are turned
loose to wander at will. I believe that under
this programme there will be an incentive to

72

SENATE

many young people nlot only to build up their
physical condition, but also to improve themselves morally and mentally. I have no hesitation in recommending this Bill to the faveurable consideration of the Senate.
Hon, C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I have had only a few moments to
glance over the Bill. I arn certainly in faveur
of its prineiple, for it. is absolutely essential
that the youth of this country should have
physical training. I agree with the henourable leader opposite that it was deplorable
te note the largo number of youag men who
were not phy sically fit to be taken into the
armed forces.
SAfker the eursory glance I have been able
to, give the Bill, I dbo not think any expenditurc should be incurred until the provinces that
so desire corne under it. Who is the chief
officiai here?
Hlon. Mr. KING: There will be a director.
lon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: A director of
pltysical culture?
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes.
lon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Before any
property is acquired or any expenditures are
incurred, a programme ought to be carefully
worked out for ail the sehools, collegiates and
universities, and also for sea scouts, boy
scouts and similar organizations. Sucb a oDrogramme sbould also take into account the
ai of tbe girls and boys. It would nlot
do to allow eaeb province to use its own
judgment in regard to what constitutes physical training. It migbt, for instance, be of a
certain character in this province and totally
different in another. The work sbould be
futlly co-ordina ted.
Hlon. Mr. RING: I thiak' that would be
absolutely esseatial.
Hon. IVA C. FALLIS: Hloneur able senstors, perhaps I migbt approacb this measure
from an angle somewhat different frem that
takcn by the honoiirahle leader of the Goverament (Hon. Mr. Ring) and tbe beneurahle leader on tbis side (Hon. Mr. Ballantvne). Naturally ayone interested in the
future welI-being of the citizens of Canada
rýannot do other than give support to the
principle and ideas involved ia tbis legislation.
I for une feel it is greatly to be regrctted
that there bcd to be a war to bring out
records of the standards of Canada's healt.b.
I agree witb wbat botb leaders bave said,
that every member of this Chamber was
shocked wben the statistics were revealed
early in the war, sbowiag the number of
young men rejected from military service because of physical unfitness.
lon. Mr. KING.

There were many causes for that. One
whicb was stressed particularly, and whiýh
1 sbould lilce to speak on for a moment, was
malnutrition during the growing years. The
rtcord in itself proved the need of a national
movement te promote physieci fitness among
our citizens, and no doubt this was in large
measure responsible for the legislation now
befole us.
But while aIl the programmes that.have
bcen outlined for facilities for physical training
are quite proper, and I arn entirely la accord
with tbem. I tbink aIse that part and parcel
of cmx' physical flîness is the question of
ntutri tien,Hlon. l\r. RING: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: -and that, in turn,
involves the question of the means by which
citizens of aIl classes shaîl have the right, in
years to corne, to a sufficient inceme witb
wbirh to ptircbase the preper kiad of food.
Althougb the question of nutrition ties in, to
a certain extent, with empînyment and moaey
w~ith whicb to purcbase the right kiad of food,
it does not neýcessarily follow that, given the
money, every parent will provide proper food
for bis cbildren,flua. Mr. RIN_ýG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: -or that every aduît
will eat or drink only wbat is gooci for hirn.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: Those of us-and I
tbinlk it includes probably every member of
this Chamber-wbo during the years of depressien, when relief was being adrnistered in
large sums. bcd experience in helping te administer that relief, know that the meaey then

a question of muney, for the mest expensive

It la a question of educatiag peuple se they

Then there is the question, in whicb I have
always been interested, cf the proper distributien of fresh fruits and vegetables, which are
so necesscry in providing proper nutrition. During my first or second session in this Chamber
I remember referring te the fact that there bad
been a very abundant crep that year, especichly in Western Ontarie, and that peaches,
tematees, and apples in great quatities were
rotting on the greund, and at the same time
there was an mithreak cf seurvy in Nerthern

notify by telephone the City Fire Department
of any emergency that may arise. The City
Fire Department is constantly co-operating for
frequent firç inspections of the building. The
Chief of the Fire Department and the senior
fire inspector have assisted constantly with
their advice as to fire precautions and fire
prevention. Fire drills have been held in the
building, supervised by the Chief of the Fire
Department, in which the entire personnel of
the building have been evacuated. The personnel of the building are fully acquainted
with the proper fire exits to use and the necessary precautions to be taken. There has been
appointed for each directorate in the building
a fire warden with the necessary number of
assistants. They have been fully instructed in
their duties and have carried them out efficiently during the recent fire drills. A meeting
of all fire wardens was held, with the senior
fire inspector present. From him the fire
wardens obtained a great deal of valuable instruction as to the proper performance of their
duties. Each floor of the building is equipped
with fire axes, sand and water buckets. The
duty watch is fully instructed in their use.
Additional precautions are two alarm bells on
the outside of the building, which will ring if
the sprinkler system goes into operation. There
are six fire hydrants on the outside of the
building, as well as twofire connections for the
sprinkler system. There will be installed
shortly a complete electric fire alarm system
in the interior of the building, which of course
will be an addition to the present safeguards.
The sprinkler system is not effective on the
outer wooden walls of the building. The exterior of the building is covered with asbestos
shingles.

eventually disappearing.
Hon. Mir. KING: I do not -think that wiill
be the case. My hope and desire is that the
Committee on Finance will deal with war
financial measures, and that the Committee
on Banking and Commerce will continue to
deal with other measures which are usually
referred to it. This allocation of our work
has been very satisfactory this year, and I
am convinced that for the duration of the
war it will be well to continue to send war
financial measures to the Committee on Finance, but not for the purpose of in any way
diminishing the standing of the other committee.
The motion was agreed to.
TAFFERT DIVORCE CASE
INQUIRY AND DISCUSSION

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, I rise to a question of privilege with
respect to a matter which, to me, is of some
importance. On Tuesday evening His Honour
the Speaker, as I understood, in referring to
a number of private bills that had come to
bis hand from another place, dealt with various
divorce cases, and I beard him intimate something about the Taffert divorce case. I have
searched our records and the records of
another place, and cannot find what happened
to that.
I am somewhat interested in the Taffert
case because it was that which caused the
black-balling of me from the Divorce Committee. This, of course, has saved me many
hours' work. I was black-balled because I
was standing up for a woman who, I believe,
is absolutely clean, honest and decent, and
I was fighting against a petitioner who, on
his own sworn statement, is a cheat and a
prevaricator. That is the record.
I wnt into the Taffert case even after I
was removed from the committee. What did
I disceover? Mr.Cheat and Prevaricatorsecured
a woman working in an establishment just
across from the cerner of St. Antoine and
Windsor streets, where you get out of the
C.P.R. elevators. You all know the location.
He secured her because she was about the
ige of his wife, looked somewhat like her,
and was wearing a red hat. Then a man,

of course, had also ta be secured, and that
man was secured in a rented room at 96
Sherbrooke street west. Do not forget that
this Taffert case was handled on the 17th
day of March, 1942. I filed at that time a
minority report to the report of the Divorce
Committee, and we heard nothing more
about the case until about the middle of
July, when, as a result of a convivial fishing
expedition in the Gatineau, or some other
important thing, the Taffert case wasThe Hon. the SPEAKER: I understand the

ready ta scrap the Atlantic Charter to prevent
the facts being brought out. I admit that.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I am bound by
the rule.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I rise to a question
of personal privilege which affects me as a
member of this body who has been misquoted
and misrepresented as a result of the action
I took on behalf of an honourable woman
against a thief, or a prevaricator and cheat.
As I was saying, this case was not heard
of any more from the 17th of March until
nearly the middle of July, when my honourable friend and seat-mate, the Chairman of
the Divorce Committee, was absent and at
his home, and somebody else took up the
case.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I rise ta a point
of order. We hashed this all over last year.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Yau do not want
to hear the facts.
The Hon.. the SPEAKER: I am bound by
the rules of the House. If the honourable
senator has a question of privilege, he may
proceed; but in following his words I have
been unable to find that any question of
privilege is involved in the matter he has
raised. If there is anything in which he is
personally concerned and in regard ta which
he desires to make a statement as a matter
of privilege, it is undoubtedly within the rules.
Otherwise, without the unanimous consent of
the House, I am boundHon. Mr. MURDOCK: The question of
personal privilege is this: What happened to
the Taffert case? I can find nothing in our
records or the records of the committee ta
show what happened to it, but, as I have said,

375

I heard the honourable the Speaker mention
the case. I can find nothing in the records
of another place. I should like to know
what the record is, where the Taffert case
stands, and if justice at last has been done
to a decent, honest woman and her sixteenyear-old daughter.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The matter bois
down to a question of procedure. I cannot
find in the inquiry, as to how the Taffert
case was disposed of, any question of privilege
for any honourable senator.
On the question that has been put as to
what has become of the Bill bearing letter J3
of the Senate, and relating to the Taffert
divorce case, I may say that this Bill was
forwarded to the House of Commons, leaving
the Senate with a number of other bills. What
disposition the House of Commons made of a
bill that we sent to them is not a question
that can properly come before this House,
because once we have sent the bill to the
other House, whether it refuses its assent to
it or nat is within the privilege of that House,
and it is not obliged to report to us.
I can only say, speaking from the records
of the Senate, that Bill J3, concerning the
Taffert case, was sent over to the House of
Commons.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: But, Your Honour,
what did you say the other evening when I
distinctly heard you refer to the Taffert case?
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Did you?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Yes.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I do not recall.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: You referred to
various bills returned from the House of
Commons, and said something about the
Taffert case. What it was I have been trying
to discover. I understood it to be "except
the Taffert case."
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I cannot recall
the incident ta which the honourable member
is now referring, but I shall not fail tu consult
the Minutes of the Clerk, and Hansard, and I
shall certainly be very pleased to inform the
Senate in that respect.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I am quite sure
your clerk will have the minutes you were
reading from, and they will convey the information I desire.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I find in the
Minutes of the Proceedings of the Senate,
No. 47, of July 20, the following:
Messages were brought from the House of
Commons by.the.ir Clerk to return the following
Bills, and to acquaint the Senate that they
have passed the same without any amendment

376

SENATE

Then on pages 306 and 307 of our Minutes
there is a long list of bills, mostly divorce
bills, and after the letter 13 you will see that
Bill J3, the Taffert Bill, which one would expect
to find between Bill 13 and Bill K3, is omitted.
We have nothing to do with that. The Bill
was not returned from the House of Commons
to the Senate.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I think I can help the
honourable member. The Bill is still in committee in the House of Commons.
It could
not have been mentioned the other day.

Hon. Mr. KING: The honourable gentleman
has no right at all to say that.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: -just

was insisting on protecting a decent woman
and her sixteen-year-old daughter.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Order!
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I was removed from
the Divorce Committee, and I am not sorry
for it.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I hope I am not
to be held responsible for that!

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I am positive it
was mentioned, or I would not have raised
this question. I told my distinguished leader
that J was going to raise the question because
the Taffert case was referred to.

Hon. Mr.
excused.

The Ho.n. the SPEAKER: I cannot recall
having mentioned the Taffert case at all. In
that I may be wrong; my memory may be at
fault. The only thing I can say is that I
mentioned the bills returned from the House
of Commons, a list of which was subsequently
published in our Minutes of the 20th of July,
and there it would appear that the Taffert
case was net returned. The honourable senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) advises
us that it is still pending in the committee of
the House of Commons.

Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, we
have reached the Orders of the Day, but as
it is nearly six o'clock and I do not think it
would be possible to complete the business
of the Senate between now and then, I would
suggest that His Honour call it six o'clock.

The Hon. the SPEAKER:

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I heard it mentioned on Tuesday evening, or I would not

The Hon. the SPEAKER: I cannot recall
it. I must say the whole question is out of
order. If a question is put, on the Orders of
the Day, it must either be on a matter of
urgent publie importance, or a question of
privilege affecting an honourable member.
The question which the honourable gentleman
has put is as follows: "What has become of the
Taffert case?" I can only say that, so far as
my information goes, the Taffert case has not
yet been returned to the Senate from the
House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That question

in the committec of the House of Commons.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The only thing
I mentioned, apparently, was that the Taffert

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Your Honour,
would not your language at that time properly
he put upon some record of this Huse?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I do not 1ik-e to object,
but this is not a question of privilege.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: It is a question of
whether we are going to have statements

The Hon. the SPEAKER: The statements
made are net recorded in the Minutes of the

UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. KING moved the second reading
of Bill 136, an Act to amend the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1940.
He said: Honourable senators, the honourable gentleman from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) has kindly consented to explain
this Bill.
Honourable
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN:
senators, this is a Bill to amend the Unemployment Insurance Act of 1940 in a number
of respects. The original measure, which

received the Royal Assent on August 7, 1940,
provided for the setting up of a wide scheme
of unemployment insurance applicable to a
large number of employees in this country,
and for the administration of that scheme by
a body known as the Unemployment Insurance Commission. It will easily be appreciated that before a complicated measure
of this kind could be brought into effect a
good deal of administrative preparation was

required in the way of setting up a large

number of regional offices all over the country, engaging and training the necessary
employees, prQviding the forms and methods
by which contributions should be paid and

received from the different classes of employers and employees, and in general putting into motion the machinery needed to
make the measure work.
The Unemployment Insurance Commission
took slightly less than a year to get the
machinery into operation, with the result
that the first contributions to the scheme

su

were payable and were paid on the 1st of
July, 1941. So the scheme bas now been
in operation for a little over two years.
I thought it might be of interest to honourable members that before discussing the
details of this Bill, which incidentally contains the first amendments to the Act, I
should give à few figures showing the extent
to which the Act bas come into operation, the
scope that it has achieved and the amounts
that have been collected under it. These
figures, which .I received yesterday from the
commission, cover the two years from the lst
of July, 1941, when the first contributions
were received, to the 30th of June, 1943,
and I do not think they have yet been made
public. In this two-year period, the number
of employees who have been brought under
this scheme is something in excess of two
and a quarter millions-not quite, I am told,
two and a half millions. At any rate, it
amounts to between one in five and one in
four of the whole population of the country.
The total amount received during that
period from employers and employees was
$108,111,000. The commission was unable to
give me a breakdown of that figure as between employer and employee contributions,
but I am advised that they are approximately
on a fifty-fifty basis, with a slight variation
in favour of the employees. That is, the
employees' contributions in this total figure
are perhaps two or three million dollars greater
than the employers' contributions. During the
same period the Government's contributions,
which by the terms of the Act are stated to
be approximately one-fifth of the contributions by employers and employees, have been
$21,622,000. In addition, the fund has been
augmented to the extent of $3,182,000 by
interest received on the investment of the
fund-the investment, I might say, being entirely in Dominion Government short-term
bonds. So the. total receipts in this period
of two years amount to $132,915,000.
From that there falls to be deducted the
amount of benefit payments made during that
period, namely, $1,078,000, the net result
being that the total assets of the fund as
at the 30th of Jtne last were $131,836,000.
There is perhaps one further figure that I
might infliet upon the House. The present
book value of the commission's investments,
as shown in its books, is $126,191,000. As I
said a moment ago, the investments consist
entirely of Dominion Government short-term
bonds.
Honourable senators will perhaps recall that
when this measure was under discussion in
the session of 1940 we were told that the
Minister of Finance was in favour of it for

378

SENATE

two reasons: first of all, that in time of
war unessential spending should be restricted
as much as possible, and that the measure
would have the effect of withdrawing from
earnings of employees a large amount of
money which would otherwise go into the
spending stream; and, secondly, that the total
receipts of the fund would temporarily be
invested in Dominion Government bonds and
thereby help the country's war effort. I
think honourable members will agree, after
hearing the figures I have just quoted to
them, that both these objects have undoubtedly been achieved.
At this point it is only fair to say that
the Unemployment Insurance Commission deserves a great dal of credit for the excellent
and effective work it has done, first of all
in setting up the machinery under this Act,
and secondly in administering the machinery
during the past two years.
I think the
general impression among all who are connected either with the employer or the employen classes is that the operation of the
fund is well conducted, that there are no
complaints as to the machinery for collection,
and that generally speaking this measure has
become a very important feature of social
security for the industrial classes of our
couin trv.
Honourable members will also recall that
the Act as passed in 1940 contained provisions
setting up an employment service. They will
be intercsted to know that since then there
has been set up a nation-wide employment
service, with 205 offices throughout the country and five or six thousand employees. It is
probable that this House and the public generally have as yet hardly begun to realize
the present and prospective future value of
that nation-wide employment service with a
centralized adminstration.
Of course the
value of such a nation-wide employment service at a time when employment is very
general and there are more jobs than men
to fill them is net perhaps as evident as if
is likely to becorne when this country has
to face the large amount of re-employment
and the changes of emp}oyment which are
bound to take place when the war cornes to an
end.
But there has already been one considerable
advantage derived from the setting up of this
national employment service under the terms
of the Act. The local officers of the commission. in their offices throughout the country,
have recentlv been charged with the administration of national selective service, which has
to do with the application of the man-power
of this country to the prosecution of the war
in the best possible way, and if this national
Hon.

Mr. HUGESSEN.

employment service had not been set up by
the measure of 1940 it would have been necessary for the Minister of Labour to evolve
some other machinery for the purpose.
Now, there is another prospective benefit
from the establishment of this employment
service. It has its origin in the possible extension of the present unemployment machinery
to other branches of social security which
could be set up in the future, following upon
that part of the Speech from the Throne at
the beginning of this session dealing with the
necessity of a broad scheme of social security
for this country. In that connection, with the
permission of the House, I should like to
quote a few words from the report on social
security prepared by Dr. L. C. Marsh, under
the general heading cf unemployment insurance, at page 43 of his report. I quote:
It is an immense advantage te have. in the
unemployment insurance system, the basis for
systematic attention te a large part of the
inemployment problem. Its operation during
the war period means that exeerience in
administration is being aecumulated as well as
contributions te the unemployment insurance
fund.
Net least of the advantages is the
strengthening of the employment service as an
administrative agency: and also the growing
improvement in statistical reqources. Both the
analysis of unemployment insiurance records.
and the inventory of curren-t labour movements
now, being developed through the emploiment

service, have obvious relevance for advance
forecast and actual administration on the postwar period.
As the biggest piece of social
îxsurance mn Canada se far. its coverage. rates
of benefit. and general principles of cOpstruictien

aie of speci.al importance. No extensions of the
social.srciity structure can afford te ignore
its existence and the necessi-ty cf co-ordination
with it wlierever this is reasonable.
So much for what I may be permitted to
cal] preliminary observations.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I do net think
the honourable senator told us what the cost
of administration is, and where the money
comes from.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Speaking subject to
correction, I think the Federal Government, as
part of its contribution, pays the cost of administration of the scheme. The figure I gave
of the Federal Government's contribution of
$21,000,000 is exclusive of whatever was the
actual cost of administration.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: But you have not
the figures?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: No. I have no
figures of the cost of administration.
Before dealing with the details of the Bill
itself, there are two further observations which
I think I should make in order that the
Senate may b fully aware of all the facts.
It will be recalled that the Act of 1940
provides for an advisory body, known as the

JULY 22, 1943
UnempLoyment Insurance Advisory Committee, an unpaid body consisting of representatives of employers and employees. This
committee is charged with the duty o~fadvising the commission on various matters with
respect to the possible extension of the Bill
to other classes of employees, changes in the
rates of contribution and benefits, and other
matters. The committee had been consulted
by the oommission before this Bill was brought
in, and I arn informed that it unanimously
approved the principle of the measure.
There is a second matter 1 should mention.
This is an insurance scbcme. It is designed to
provide payment of certain premiums against
certain risks, and it, of course, should at alI
times bo actuarially sound. No changes in
rates of benefit or rates of payment should be
made unless they can be shnwn not to affect
prejudicially the actuarial soundness of the
schemc as an insurance scheme. So before it
was introduced this measure was submitted
to the chief actuary of the Department of
Insurance, and hie has reported to the commission that none of the amendments now proposcd adversely affect the fund or its actuarial
soundness.
The Bill itself is fairly long, comprising
twenty-eight sections. I must say that the
great majority of the amendments are more
or less of a minor character and are intended
either for clarification or to simplify administration, without in cither case affecting the
principle of the original Act. In some instances the amendments are intended to
correct slight errors of draughtsmanship whicb
are almost bound to creep into a complicated
measure of this kind. I do not propose to
deal with that class of amendments bore.
Tbey will more fittingly be dealt with when
the Bill- is considered in the appropriate
committee.
But there are a few amendments which do
make substantial changes. The most important are contained, in sections 21 and 22.
Before, however, dealing with them. I think I
should direct the attention of the Senate to
tbree proposed amendments wbich, though in
a comparatively minor way it is true, do
affect the classes of persons intended to be
covered by the Act. Two of these amendiments
wi]l have the effect of increasing, and one of
decreasing. the number of persons wbo will
become subject to the Act.
The first of these, clause 19, relating to
Part I of the First Schedule of the Act, provides that employees, resident in Canada, of
governmcnts of other countries, either Great
Britain or foreign countries, may ho brought
within the termis of the scheme, in every case

with the consentof the government concerned
and with the approval of the Unemployment
Insurance Commission.
The next is clause 20, which deafs with the
employees of hospitals and charitable institutions. Wben the Act was passed in 1940 such
employees were excepted fromn the measure
under Part Il of the First Sehedule; but it
bas been found that a considerable number
of these employees have asked to be included
in the measure. They were excepted in the
first place because it was thought that hospitais and institutions of that kind, which operate
without purpose of gain, might not in certain
cases be able to afford the employer contribution which would otherwise be imposed upon
them. This amendment perinits such employees
to be brought within the scbeme if the hospitai or other institution agrees to pay the
employer contribution.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Might 1 be
permitted to intervene for a moment? My
honourable friend knows that most employees
in hospitals are only temaporary, and they are
coming and going, especially in war-time. 1
do not see how you could very well take
them in.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: 0f course, the whole
object of the Bill is to, bring in persons whose
employaient is temporary. They are precisely
the kind of people who ought to be covered by
unemployment insurance. But in any event it
will only be in cases wbere the hospital or
charitable institution is itself willing to pay
the employer contribution that the commission
can bring the employees within the Act.
The third clause is number 24. It bhas the
effect of taking out of the schemc employees
who would otherwise fall within it, but who
resicle in distant parts of Canada where there
is very littie insurable employment, such as the
extreme northerly areas of Canada, and where
the cost of administration by the commission
would be greater than the result of tbe insurance of a small number of persons would
justify.
1 turn now to one of the more important
clauses of the Bill, number 21. It relates to
governmental employees, that is, employees of
feeaprovincial and municipal governments. I might say with respect to, employees
of government that the original Act proceeded upo>n the theory that there were a
number of governmental employees, Dominion,
provincial and municipal, whose employment
was so, permanent and the possibility of whose
unempînyment s *o small that they should
be excepted fromn the Act, and it was provided
that such governmental employees should be

this amendment carries it will bring in under
the Act approximately 200,000 additional
employees.
If this measure is given second reading, it is
my intention to move that it be referred to the
Committee on Banking and Commerce. At
the meeting of that committee any information
honourable members require can be furnished.
It goes without saying, however, that if any
honourable member wishes to ask a question I
shall do my best to answer him.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: The honourable
senator has given a very clear and full explanation of the Bill. In his opening remarks he
made one statement to which I should like
to refer. I understood him to say that two
and a half million employees are now under
the Act. That is about twenty-two per cent
of the people. In view of the large number
of persons too young to come under the Act,
the large number of an advanced age who
cannot come under it, and the large number
in uniform, as well as the many engaged in
seasonal occupations, such as farming, fishing
and lumbering, who cannot come under it, I
am surprised that the number should be two
and a half millions. Is that the total number
brought under the Act, or are we to understand that at any given time two and a half
millions are under it, on an average?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: My information
was obtained from the commission. I asked
to be furnished with a statement, as close as
possible, of the number now under the Act.
The answer I received was that it could not
give me an accurate figure, but that the total
number now under the Act is in excess of two
and a quarter millions.
With reference to young people, of course.
persons under sixteen do come under this Act
if they are employed; and there is a provision
that their contribution shall be paid by their
employer. I t.hink perhaps another explanation is that the apparently large number-and
I agree that it does seem to be a very large
number-is the result of the large employment
of women that has taken place within the
last two years, particularly in war industries.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: May I ask a question
of the honourable gentleman? Wihen this Bill
was being revised was the matter of the rate
discussed at all? As I undexrstand the honourable senator, the commission has paaid out
something over a million dollars.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: And there is an accumulated fund up to date, after the operation
of two or three yeare, of $131,836,000. Would

that not indicate that the schedule of rates
paid is probably too high and might be
reduced or graded downwards?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I think I may give
the answer that it does indicate that at the
present time we are in a period &l very full
employment, during which it should be anticipated that the fund would grow very rapidly;
but in view of the very uncertain future that
will be before the fund when the war comes
to an end and all the changes in occupation
that will necessarily be involved come about,
I would hesitate to suggest that the contributions be reduced. I think the general experi-ence of countries operating unemployment
insurance schemes is-and it is only natural
-that in periods of heavy unemployment the
fund drops very rapidly, whereas in periods
of full employment it increases very rapidly.
I think I am right in saying that in Great
Britain at the present time the unemployment insurance fund amounts to a truly
colossal sum after the four years she has
been at war, and the full employment which
has resulted. It will be recalled, however,
that during the period of depression the unemployment insurance fund in Great Britain
fell to a very low level, and had to be supplemented by special annual grants, if I
remember correctly.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: The reason I bring up
that point is this. You may not know that
there is growing up a new attitude among
employees regarding all these deductions from
their pay envelopes. Nearly every wellconducted business to-day has group sickness
insurance and group life insurance. If you
add to that unemployment insurance and the
very heavy taxation we all pay at the present
time, you will sec why there is a new attitude growing up on the part of employees
regarding all these deductions. Employers
are now being asked for a certain net wage
in the pay envelope on Saturday night, regardless of deductions.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The honourable gentleman said there were two and a quarter or
two and a half million people employed. What
record is kept of a man who comes under
the insurance scheme and then joins the army?
Is his name struck off, or what happens?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I cannot answer
that question off-hand, but I think there is in
the measure a provision that a man who was
insured under the Act before he enlisted in
the army will be entitled, upon his return
frorn the forces, to any benefits that he had
accumulated under the Act.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I also should like
to ask the honourable gentleman a question.
Has the Government given any consideration
whatever to the exemption of married women
from. the provisions of this Act?
Before the honourable gentleman answers the
question, I should like to make a few remarks.
We ail know that at present many married
women who have neyer worked before since
their marriage are now employed. The husbands of many of these worqen have fuli-time
positions and receix e good incomes, but the
Government. companies and individuals who
are short of help have persuaded the women
to accept positions. I have two of them
working for me. There is absolutely no chance
that these married women will be able to colleet bock froma the Unemployment Insurance
Commission anything on account of the
premiums that are being paid in by themselves
and their employers.
At least, I do not
know of any provision that would allow themn
to make a dlaim. I may be wrong in making
that statement, but I do not think I am, for
after the war is over nobody will be expected
to give employment to married women, and
wben they atep out of their wartime positions
they will not be considered unemployed. It
seems to me they should be exempted under
the Act, and 1 sbould like to know if the
Government lias given any consideration to
that motter.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: 0f course, I cannot
answer the question in the way in which it is
put. 1 do not know whether the Goverument
lias or has not given any consideration to that.
But there is in the Act a provision that may
hielp my honourable friend. Paragrapli (p) of
Part Il of the First Sehedule of the Act
authorizes the commission to exempt employment which is "of sucb a nature that it is
ordinarily adopted as subsidiary employment
only and not as the principal means of livelihood." Lt may be that whiere a woman aimply
takes a job to fill in spare time, hier normal
occupation being that of housekeeper-

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I could not say. I
neyer thought of the matter until I was reading these amendments, and then it struck me
that something shoiild be done with regard
to the case of married women.
I may say that I have read the Act very
carefully, and aIl the amendments, and I have
no serious objection to any of them. Before
taking my seat I want to congratulate the
honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hug-essen) very heartily upon the manner in
which hie bias explained the Bill, and to thank
him for the information hie bias given. May
I ask himi if lie can state the exact amount
that it hias cost the country every year to run
the Unemployment Insurance Commission?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:
If the Bill is
referred to coinmittee and is taken up there
to-morrow morning, 1 shall make it my bus~iness to find thiat out for the honourable
gentleman.
Hon. Mr. MURD0CIK:
I think if the
honourable senator froin Wesct Central Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) would look
at section 16 of the Bill hie would find what
hie la looking for. That amenda section 93
of the Act by adching the following subsection:
Any special order made unider the provisions
of this Act may be varied or revolzed, by a
special order mode in like maniner.
The explanatnry note~ says:
This subsection la new and ýis intended ta
remove ony possible doubt as to -the powver of
the commission to vary or revoke any spccial
order mode under the provisions of the Act.

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I know that married
women and their employers are now paying the
money in every week.

In reference ta the point raised by the
honourable senotor from. Kingston (Hlon. Mr.
Davies), may I say that I think hie and others
will remember that five or six years; ago some
25,000 or 30.000 railroad men, with from. five
to twenty-fuve years' seniority, were uncmployed. Such a condition no longer exista, as
these men ail are working now and paying
their ante into the unemployment insurance
fond; but. sonie unempîcynient may develop
later, although, we hope, net to as great an
extent.
I want ta touch briefly on section 22 of
the Bill. I spoke to the honoturable senator
from. Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) when
1 came into the building to-night, and hie
gav e me aone information of whichi 1 proviously had not the slightest inkling. The
explanatory note opposite section 22 says:
The presenit ceiling of $2,000 la raised ta
$2,400 ýand the first proviso te, the section, as
amenuied, is entirely new.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Has any application
been made for an exemption?

That sounda very well, but it doca not tell
the story. The newx limait is up ta S3,600 or

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: There are thousands
of such womien right now.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: It may be that the
provision I have juat quoted would f orm. a
good basis upon which to, apply for exemption in such cases.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: With regard to section 22,
if what the honourable member frein Parkdale
has said is true, and apparenitly it is, I cannot imagine a draughtsman slipping in an
amendment that does net say what it means.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Does not my
honourable friend know that those railway

honourable friend know that sometimes there
is camouflage in provisions of law?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I have tried to find out
who put the nigger in.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: It is right there in
cold black and white.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I am under obligation to
my honourable friend for pointing it out. I
thought the wording meant people in temporary employment.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: No; people who
are employed at so much a week or hour, or
who are paid by mileage. That obviously
includes, as I understand it, 'trainmen and
conductors, to whom my honouraBle friend
from Parkdale refers. I do net think there
can be any nigger in the woodpile in the
history of this amendment. As I pointed out,
it received most careful consideration from
the advisory committee after public hearings
of which ample notice was given.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: It is a consistent
and logical intention to bring into the unemployment insurance scheme all those classes
who are paid hourly or mileage rates.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I submit it is clearly

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Apparently. Why was the

understand this proviso. If it has been drafted
se that it will net be noticed in a quick
reading, then the intention is made plain by
this clause. and apparently my honourable
friend from Parkdale is right-much to my
surprise. The honourable gentleman in charge
of the Bill says there is no camouflage. I
submit there is. The interpretation of that
clause, on a first reading, would be that $2,400
a year is the limit, and the purpose of the
exception clause would be to bring in persons
about whose total earnings there might be
some question. I cannot imagine a commission
putting in a $2,400 limit and then, right in
the saine section, lugging in by the ears some
fellow making half as much again. I think

again?

Mr. MURDOCK:

Might I explain

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Sure.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The $2,400 under
the existing provision is surely a system
whereby trainmasters, locomotive foremen,
master mechanies, and superintendents are
excluded. I do net know their rates of pay,
but they get better than $2,400 a year, better
than $200 a month. They are paid on an
actual monthly rate.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: They do net come in.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: No, they do net
come in. They are paid on an actual monthly
basis, and I suggest you could not insert there
a schedule providing a limit of $3,600 or
$4,000 without bringing thein in.
When
you insert this language: "provided that the
employment in which the contractual rate of
remuneration is an hourly rate, a daily rate, a
weekly rate, a piece rate including a mileage
or other rate being a sum of money per unit
of physical measurement of work," you include
all men engaged in such employrnent on
the railroads. But you do net include the
trainmasters, master mechanics, locomotive
foremen and superintendents. Why? Because
their monthly earnings are better than $200.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: On the honourable gentleman's statement, why should you leave 'out a
man drawing $2,600 on the railroad and put in
a man getting $3,600?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: You are not doing
it as a mat-ter of fact, because you are paying
a piece rate or a mileage rate to a man who
may or may not earn $2,600 or $2,800: it
depends on how he applies himself throughout
the year. If a man is getting so much by
the month you know what he is earning.

JULY 22, 1943
But wvhen he is on a nvileage basis the coinmissioners say, "If you are on that basis we
are not going to, wait until the end of the
year to find out what you arc earning; we
will bring you under the Act whether your
renjuneration is $2,400 or in excess of it." In
othier words, they change the measuring stick.
1 think thc reason is that at the beginning
of the year, since a man is paid on a mileage
rate, the commissioners could flot tell what
hie was going to earn, as this would depend
on how much he cared to work.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: What about a yearly
salary?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Then the limit is
$2,400. My honourable friend from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Haydcn) has explained the matter
iii much clearer tcrms than I could. What
I tricd to, say was that great difficulties had
been f5und in attempting to, determine, when
these men were paid by piece rate, or by
the week or hour, whether or not they were
earning $2,400 a year and came within the
purview of the Act. This amcndment makes
it perfectly clear that 'men paid on that basis
do fali within the Act, irrespective of how
miich they may earn in total in the course
of the year.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That is it.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: May I apologize
to the honourable leader opposite for the misinformation I gave him a few minutes ago.
Ther'e are three commissioners. The chief
commissioner is L. J. Trottier, and his associates are R. J. Talion and Allan Mitchell.

That whereao serions complaints have been
addressed to the Government, Parliament and
Press concerning certain commercial operations
or proceedings of the Montreal public abattoirs;
WThereas, if these complaints were well

and an intolerable abuse;

Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators,
since my honourable frîend (Hon. Mr. Sauvé)

had an interesting debate, but it was not
entirely confincd to the motion; on the contrary, it extcnded into, the field of meat packing and slaughter house practices throughout

felt that his statements were of such a character that they should be brought to the
attention of the Minister of Finance. I sent
a copy of his speech to the Minister, who
naturally referred it to the officers of the
Price Control Board. A memorandum from
that office was, in part, read by my honourable
friend from Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair) when
he resumed the debate a few days ago.
There has been a suggestion that a committee, possibly the Committee on Agriculture, could be used to investigate and
inquire into matters such as this, which may
come up in this Chamber or in another place.
I can sec where the standing committees of
this House might be of value, but I should
not like to be the one to communicate to this
Chamber the information that our committees
would be used to clarify hearsay statements or
gossip that may be heard around the street
corner or across the counter. Statements
made by members of this House who are convinced that something is wrong, and who are
content to charge irregularity in the matter
of governmental activities, could very well be
referred to one of our committeas. My own
idea is that we are not utilizing our.committees
as much as we might. I can very well see
where the Committee on Agriculture could be
usefully employed each year in making a
study of agricultural developments, not
only in Canada, but also abroad, and in
hearing officials of the Department of Agriculture, and persons engaged in agriculture or
representing agricultural associations. The
Committee on Health could undertake something of a similar kind. The question of health
is not merely provincial, but is national and
international in scope. That committee could
be very well employed in making inquiries
into health matters in Canada and what is
being done by our Health Council and health
authorities generally.
I am now going to confine myself to the
resolution moved by my honourable friend
from Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Sauvé). In his resolution he says:
Whereas, if these complaints were well
founded, they would constitute a great injustice
and an intolerable abuse;
In the opinion of this flouse it is expedient
that the Government consider the advisability
of setting up, if it has not been made, an
investigation into the said operations and proceedings, under the direction of a commission
competently representing the Government, the
producer and the dealer.
That is what my honourable friend desires.
I think, judging from the evidence brought
before the House by my honourable friend
from Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair), that we are
Hon. Mr. KING.

conversant with conditions and that the Government or the Senate would not be justified
in pursuing this matter further.
The story is a simple one. A farmer, Mr.
Godin, brought into Montreal on the 17th
of November eight hogs. He employed a
drayman, Mr. Sarrazin, to take them to the
meat packing house. He accompanied the
trucker, and negotiated a sale of his eight hogs
with the East End Market. I think honourable gentlemen will agree with me when I
say that if a man goes to sell something, be
it butter, meat or fish, and it is his own
property, it is his responsibility to see that he
gets credit for proper weight. Therefore Mr.
Godin should have had knowledge of the live
weight of his hogs, and I do not think there
can be much complaint on that score. We
know that under the Weights and Measures
Act the Government of Canada keeps a very
close supervision over the mechanical adjustment of weighing machines, and that very
severe penalties are imposed if the scales are
tampered with. Mr. Godin, in consultation
with the buyer, decided to sell his hogs on the
dressed weight basis. That is, the hogs
were to be killed and dressed, and then
weighed. And that is what happened. We
are informed by one or two 'honourable senators that the weighing apparatus is automatic and self-registering, and that weight
tickets are to be had; so there could be no
question in regard to the correctness of the
weighing of the dressed hogs.
There was one incident that may have
caused some little trouble. Mr. Godin's eight
hogs were grouped with thirty-four other hogs,
because forty-two went on to the killing floor
together. Mr. Godin's hogs were tattooed
with "Y-773," and when the hogs had been
killed it was found that during the process the
tattoo mark had been sheared off one of the
hogs and was not identifiable. However, on
examining the other forty-one hogs and finding that only seven bore Mr. Godin's mark,
it was reasonable to assume that this one hog
had been the property of Mr. Godin.
It bas been shown by the grader's letter that
Mr. Godin's hogs graded out on an average
with the other hogs in the kill; so I do not
see where there can be any great complaint in
this regard. It is true that my honourable
friend in his statement on July 13 said:
When the farmer received his money, a few
days after his return home, he protested to the
Government officiaI, who made many calculations
and examined the weight slips, but was unsuecessful in explaining the difference about which
the seller was complaining. Finally the official
offered $5 in settlement-

JULY 22, 1943
and so on. There is in his statement an implication which, I am sure, my honoureble fiiend
would not like to have circulated, namely that
Mr. Godin, the farmer, was dealing with a
Government official who finally offered Mr.
Godin $5. As a matter of fact, the evidence
shows that it was not a Government official
who offered the $5, but an official of the packing house. I know my honourable friend
will be glad to have that cleared up.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: What kind of evidence
is this?
Hon. Mr. KING: It is the evidence of a
responsible officer of the Crown, given in a
letter, and there is no reason to doubt it.
If there had been any doubt, this man would
not be an officer of the Crown to-day. He is
Mr. Paul Laliberté, a grader in whom the
officials of the department express every confidence. The letter states among other things:
Mr. Godin then met Mr. Morris Pinsky, chief
buyer for Modern Markets. The latter, after
having listened to Mr. Godin's story and having
checked everything, stated that everything was
in order and that he owed this farmer absolutely nothing. He added, however, that considering the fact that Mr. Sarrazin was a regular shipper and that le wished to keep bis
goodwill, lie was willing to offer him $5 out of
his own pocket.
That is the story as written and signed by
an officer of the Government. My honourable
friend from Saskatchewan North (Hon. Mr.
Horner) smiles. He will not as a member of
this House declare that that is an untrue
statement, or that that letter written by this
officerHon. Mr. HORNER: I am just smiling
because I know of several incidents of this
kind.
Hon. Mr. KING: That is another story.
This is the letter of an officer who is said
by the chief officer of the department to be
reliable.
I have no desire to carry the discussion
further. I feel that my honourable friend
who moved in this matter did so, undoubtedly,
with the best intentions in the world. He is
an experienced public man, and it is not for
me to take exception to his manner of
approach in this matter. He has been a
minister of the Crown, holding a responsible
portfolio, and lie probably has had experience
similar to that which other ministers have
had with suspicious people who think they
bave reason to complain, and who write to
officers of a department in preference to
making a direct approach to either the
Minister or the Deputy Minister.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: That is not the case.

Hon. Mr. KING:- One can understand such
action'on the part of the man in the street,
but it is hardly to be expected of an honourable member who enjoys the confidence my
honourable friend has enjoyed as a minister
of the Crown. I do not complain of his action
in this matter. I know from my own experience
that ministers do give great consideration to
letters and requests from former ministers or
others who have held responsible positions in
the Government service; *but the other course
I have referred to is the one usually pursued.
There has been a full discussion of this
matter. Accordingly, I am going to suggest to
my honourable friend that it would be well if
lie would withdraw his motion and let the
matter rest, at least for the present. If at
some future date lie has further evidence and
wishes to bring it before the Senate, lie may
do so.
Hon. ARTHUR SAUVE: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the SPEAKER: I should like
to point out that if the honourqble gentleman
speaks now lie closes the debate.
Hon. ARTHUR SAUVE: Honourable senators, my first word is to thank honourable
members who have participated in the debate
on my motion. I highly appreciate their loyal
and valuable contributions. I am satisfied that
even those who, like the honourable senator
from Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair), differ
as to the mode of investigation to be instituted, admit the need for investigation in
view of the complainte revealed in the correspondence tabled in this House and originating from representatives here and in the other
House, as well as from other sources.
I do not understand how the honourable
leader of the Government in this Chamber
(Hon. Mr. King) could seriously oppose the
proposal and suggestion of hie honourable
frienda the senators from Queen's, Lethbridge
and Peel (Hon.' Mr. Sinclair, Hon. Mr.
Buchanan and Hon. Mr. Marshall), who declared themaselves in favour of an investigation
because they realize the matter is so serious
that public interest demande it be investigated.
The honourable leader of the Government
has given me a sort of lesson.
Hon. Mr. KING: No, no.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: I know what I mean. I
understood his words and his intention. Yes,
I still have a responsibility in the Senate and
in public life. I have had responsibility as a
man in public life for a long time. It is true
that I was a minister, as the honourable leader
says, and he telle me that in taking up this
matter I should have written directly to a
minister. I would remind him that I wrote to

SENATE
a number of ministers, and that they referred
me to their officers. I hope the honourable
leader of the Government understands me
clearly. It was established before this House
that more than once I wrote to departmental
officers at the suggestion of one or more ministers, and those officers referred me, not te
ministers, but to other officers, whom they
represented to be experts on the matter under
discussion.
As was established by the correspondence
laid on the Table, I sent two letters before this
motion was moved, but I received no satisfactory answer. I received no answer from
Mr. Peterson. And I received no answer from
Mr. Savoie, though he promised I should have
one after an examination was made of the case.
Honourable senators, by means of my two
motions and of questions dealing with these
complaints, I aimed at making public during
this session the voices of the farmer, the producer and the honest dealer, who claimed to
be the victims of frauds and of uncontrollable
meddling-in other words, of an unfair and
intolerable system. I laid these complaints
before this House because the correspondence
had no worth-while results. The complaints
have been before both Houses for two months,
while we have been waiting for some action
by the Government.
The honourable senator from Queen's
(Hon. Mr. Sinclair) presented more or less
a defence of the officers on whom rested the
responsibility for the existing system and the
abuses complained of. I must declare before
this House that I never intended to deny the
technical competency of these officers for
the fulfilment of their duties. It is not surprising that they attempted to free themselves from the charges by cleverly falling
back on the regulations and Orders in Council
dealing with control of the markets in the
light of the needs created by the war and
exportation conditions resulting from competition on the London market. My motion
in no way affects the principle of this control,
but it concerns the unfairness and the lack
of competence or efficiency with which the
control is applied at the Montreal abattoirs.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: If the explanations given
by these officers, as cited by the honourable
senator from Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair),
were clear, obvious, irrefutable and sufficient,
why does my honourable friend suggest an
investigation at the next session? Why have
an investigation by the Committee on Agriculture if there is no truth in the complaints?
Hon. Mr. KING: That is what I say. It
is hearsay evidence. Nothing has been proved.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE.

Hon. Mr. SAUVE: I fear the honourable
leader does not grasp' my point.
Before the next session starts, these affairs
will have been straightened out. I presume
that the abuses which were denounced will
disappear, that the system of inspection and
control will be modified in such a way as
not only to give satisfaction to those persons
who have made complaints, but also to serve
the interests of a class of production which is
so essential, especially in wair-time.
If, after complaints had been made by
the honourable gentleman who represents the
federal constituency of Chambly-Rouville in
another place-a Liberal member-which complaints were made subsequently to mine, the
Government had sent a competent officer
incognito to the markets of the Montreal
abbatoirs to investigate the system, and the
complicity and meddling of certain speeulators, the honourable senator from Queen's
would, I presume, have had many other things
to say. It is of no use to have an inquiry
made by an officer who bas some responsibility
for the system and who himself might be the
subject of complaint. Te get at the facts it
would be necessary to send a man who is
unknown te the speculators and competent
te inspect the whole system in a proper manner. It seems that se far there has not been
an investigation; but one should be made
immediately, not a year from now.
From farmers in my province I have
received many letters, one of which I will
read. It is in French:
(Trnslation)
Nicolet, July 19, 1943.
Honourable Senator Arthur Sauvé,
Ottawa, Ontario.
Dear Sir:
I wish to congratulate you on the fine work
you are doing in connection with abattoirs, and
I must state all my customers are following
this matter with keen interest.
As a matter of fact, this question is of interest not only to dealers, but also to the entire
farming community and the public in general.
I would call your special attention to a very
important point, namely, the public markets in
Montreal. Until last year we were allowed to
buy cattle on the hoof on the Montreal market,
and to do so in our own name for slaughter on
our own account. This privilege is now exclusively reserved for a few companies.
Montreal butchers can no longer buy on the
open market in Montreal. We cannot even
buy live stock in the country for shipment by
truck for slaughter in Montreal on our own
account.
If you would like to have a petition signed by
at least twenty-five buyers, they could readily
state that whereas last year they had the
right to buy on the open market, they cannot
do so this year. I should be glad to supply
you with such a petition. Any further information required will be gladly given.

JULY 22, 1943
Aliow me to state how pleased and how weli
satisfied are all citizens of the province -of
Quebec with what you are doing.
I trust these f ew words will encourage you
in your efforts to obtain an inquiry into the
matter of abattoirs.
Yours truly,
J. 0. Houle,
Nicolet,
'PO. Box 272.
(Text) The letter expresses a firm hope that
the authorities will put a stop to existing
abuses aud frauds. The people demand, and
rightly so, a restriction on abuses by exploitera
in other lies, and no exception should be
made with regard to meat markets.
As to the Godin case, I believe it is wel
founded. Godin keepa -bis slips on the advice
of a lawyer welI versed in legal procedure and
abattoir methods. Albert Godin is a very
intelligent farmer, and, far from being a liar,
ia reputed to be a truthful man. The amount
involved is, I admit, emali, but the fact is
important, as the honourable senator from
Peel (Hon. Mr. Marshall) said when hie spoke
on this motion.
Iu the Senate Hansard of JuIy 20 (Unxevised Edition), there is a mîsrepresentation
of my reply to the 'honourable senator from
Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair) with respect to
Mr. Peterson. 'I am ireported as saying: "I
wrote to Mr. Peterson, but received no answer,
either fromn him or from Mr. Baird." What
1 dîd aay was: "I wrote to Mr. Peterson.I
received no answer froin him, but heard from
Mr. Baird."
Hon. Mr. KING: That is right.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: As to Mr. Peterson, this
is what I said in the course of my remarks on
Juiy 13:
I do not see anything lu the file. I am
flot talkiug about Mr. Baird, a technician, 'who
does flot touch on the points raised.
That does not imply that I did not receive
any answer from Mr. Baird. Mr. Peterson did
not answer my letter, and Mr. Baird based bis
reply on Orders in Council and regulations.
He was asked to reveal facta, to ascertain, by a
thorough field investigation by an indepeudent
person honestly representing the parties interested, whether or not the aliegations of fraud
by violating or bypassing these Orders in
Councîl and regulations were weli founded.
The honourable senator from Queen's id
not say a word about the attitude of .Mr.
Alfred Savoie, senior officer for the administration of the Prices sud Trade Board. As
stated in the correspondence, Mr. Savoie was
the officer charged by the chief of the agricultural production services in Montreal, Mr.
L. C. Robitailie., to get full information froi

389

Mr. Godin. lu a personal interview with Mr.
Godin, after receiving a full explanation, Mr.
Savoie said to him: "I will carefully examine
your case and then I will communicate my
conclusion to you."1 He made me the sanie
promise, but hie never communicated with
either of us. I wrote him, as did Mr. Godin,
asking for the result of his investigation, but
we received no answer. Why? Where is the
report of Mr. Savoie to Mr. Robitaille or
to Mr. Baird?
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: May I point out to
the honourable gentleman that the order of
reference on bis motion did not cail for that
kind of correspondence at ail, but cailed for
correspondence between farinera complaining
and the Goverrument officiais.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: The honourable gentleman referred to my remarks.
Hon.. Mr. SI:NCLAIR: They do not change
the motion.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: I ünderstand, that my
honourable friend is not interested in thia
part of the case. He did not mention thia
point. After llstening to bis speech, the
honourable senators from Lethbridge (Hon.
Mr. Buchanan) and from Peel (Hon. Mr.
Marshall) expressed themeselves in favour of
un investigation by our Committee on Agriculture at the resumption of the present or
the beginning of another session. I appreciate
their impartiality and their fairness.
Hlon. Mr. KING: 'I wouid not object to
an investigation if my honourable friend
would make a definite charge that there is
something wrong in the conduct of the Montreal abattoirs and would furnish evidence in,
support. But the case he has set before us
does not indicate that an investigation is required. If my honourable friend wants a further investigation next year, hie can have it.
Hlon. Mr. SAUVE: I understand my honourable friend is not in favour of an investigation iimited to the ternis of the motion.
Hon. Mr. KI.NG - I think the motion has
been answered by the correspondence and
the evidence we produced, and the charge
fails to the ground. Mi,however, my. honourable friend wishes to make a further charge
in regard to irregularities, I have no objection
to an investigation.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: By a coihmittee?
Hon. Mr. KING: Or a commission.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: Is the honourable leader
making bis deciaration in the naine of the
Government?.

390

SENATE

Hon. Mr. KING: I am making this statement: If my honourable friend, as a responsible
member of this Senate, will make a charge of
a nature that would indicate there are
irregularities requiring investigation, I will
endeavour to see that the committee does
inquire into it; but not on such evidence as
we have here. In his speech the honourable
gentleman implies that an officer of the Government offered Mr. Godin $5, but the correspondence shows it was an officer of the packing
house. There is quite a difference between the
two. That is what I take exception to, and
I am dealing with the Godin case.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: I am glad to learn that
and to modify my opinion on the declaration
of the honourable leader. That declaration
convinces meHon. Mr. KING: It is something to think
about.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: -that the matter raised
in this debate is serious.
In agreeing to postpone an investigation
until next session, as was suggested by
honourable members on the other side, I
should not wish the Senate to discourage the
Government from taking immediate steps to
put an end to the abuses which were denounced. The producers should not continue
to suffer from the unfair practices they
complain of, pending an investigation by the
Senate Committee on Agriculture. I would
request the Government to make a sincere
endeavour to stamp out the abuses which
were denounced in the other House by the
member for Chambly-Rouville and by myself
and others in this House, in order that the
producers may feel they are protected. That
is what the public interest demands, and what
we desire.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Does the honourable gentleman withdraw his motion?
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: If the House unanimously consents?
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: May I say that
the honourable senator from Rigaud (Hon.
Mr. Sauve) stated very plainly that he was
willing to let this matter stand over until
next session, when in all probability it would
be investigated by our Committee on Agriculture or by some other body. But he was not
withdrawing his motion; he was satisfied to
let it stand.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: That is right.
Hon. Mr. RING: I do not see much
difference. If he wishes the motion to stand,
it will naturally go off the Order Paper.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: With the unanimous consent of the Senate, the motion
stands.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at
3 p.m.

PRESS REPORTER OF THE SENATE
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. WHITE presented the sixth report of the Standing Committee on Internal
Economy and Contingent Accounts, as
follows:
1. Your Committee have in obedience to the
order of reference of the 21st July, instant,
considered the second report of the Standing
Committee on Debates and Repor.ting, nominating Mr. Georges Langlois to fill temporarily
the vaoancy on the reporting staff eaused by
the death of Mr. J. Fortier.
2. Your Committee recommend that the
Senate concur in the eaid report, and that
Mr. Langlois be paid at the rate of $10 per

Parliament.
All which is respectfully submitted.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall said
report be considered and concurred in?
Hon. Mr. WHITE: Now.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Next sitting.
Hon. Mr. KING: I know the hope has
been expressed on the other side of Parliament
that it may conclude its business to-day, and
unless my honourable friend bas particular
objection, I think it would be better to accept
the report now.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I should like to
see in writing what has just been read. We
have not yet before us what was done yesterday. I should have liked to see that, but I
cannot. So I respectfully insist on the rule
being complied with.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Would the
honourable gentleman agree to have the report considered if the Senate sits after dinner?
It is only a question of expediting business.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: May I be permitted to intervene for a moment and say
to my honourable friend from Parkdale that
the honourable leader of the Government has
been good enough to take me into his confidence and tell me there is a fair prospect

391

JULY 23, 1943
of Parliament adjourning to-night. There is
nothing of any great importance in this report, and I am sure that the Senate would
appreciate the honourable member agreeing
to its being considered now.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: .It would not
unduly interfere with the affairs of the nation
if this report did, as it should, die a natural
death; but out of consideration for the request of His Honour the Speaker, if Parliament is likely to adjourn to-night, and there
is to be a second sitting of the Senate to-day,
I will not raise any further objection.
The motion stands.

SENATE
PRICE OF BACON IN CANADA
INQUIRY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators,
before the Orders -of the Day are called, I
should like to ask the honourable leader of
the Government, and through him the
Government, a question that I think is of
national importance, in connection with the
production of bacon. Since there is a set
price paid by the British Government for our
bacon, why does the price to the bacon
producers fluctuate from day to day and week
to week? Why is there not a set price to
the producers?
Hon. Mr. KING: I do not know that I
quite understand the honourable gentleman's
question.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: There is a set price
for the bacon sold to the British Government,
a ceiling price paid to the packers. Why, then,
is there a fluctuating price ta the producers?
Why should hogs on Tuesday be 25 cents lower
than on Monday, and go up 25 cents again the
next day? My reason for putting the question
is this. One day there will be trainloads of
hogs going ta the market by fast freight, and
the next day scarcely any hogs at all will be
shipped. I believe that the price is reduced
10 ta 25 cents on the days when large shipments are received by the packers. Can the
honourable leader explain why the price should
not be the same every day?
Hon. Mr. KING: I arn not sure that my
honourable friend is correct in his statement,
although there is a fluctuation in the price.
We had the Minister of Agriculture before
our comiittee only a few days aga, and he
outlined the policy. The British Government
agreed ta pay a certain price for our bacon,
and the Government of Canada pays a subsidy
in addition ta that. As to the variation in the
price of bacon on the market, I have no knowledge. I shall make inquiry, and endeavour ta
obtain a reply ta my honourable friend. His
statement will be brought to the attention of
the department and the Government.
WAR APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 3
SECOND READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading
of Bill 139, an Act for granting ta His Majesty
aid for national defence and security.
He said: Honourable senators, we now have
before us an Act for granting ta His Maiesty
aid for national defence and security, commonly known as the War Appropriation Act
of 1943. We have been in session since the
Hon. Mr. KING.

28th of January, nearly six months, and with
the exception of the bills dealt with in the
last day or two, practically all the measures
considered by us since that date in January
have related ta the war in one way or another.
The abject of the Bill before us to-day is
the granting of -money to meet our war expenditures, that is, those incurred on account
of Canada's armed forces and all the activities
of the various departments engaged on war
work. The sum asked for is very large,
$3,890,000,000, one-third of which has already
been passed by this Chamber in the War
Interim Supply Bills, leaving a balance of
$2,593,333,333.34.
This stupendous sum could not have been
foreseen nor pictured in our wildest dreama
a few years ago. It portrays in dollars and
cents the value of Canada's war effort as it
pertains ta her activities as a member of the
United Nations, in which group she holds a
very high and responsible place. Money values
can be estimated and stated, but, unfortunately, in war it is impossible ta estimate the
value of human sacrifices made by those who
are representing us in the fighting forces, or
by those who are closely related ta them.
Their sacrifices are incalculable.
Previous ta two weeks ago our military
forces had only been engaged with the enemy
on comparatively rare occasions, but we now
know that they are associated with the British
and American forces in the conquest of Sicily,
and that they are acquitting themselves like
men, and will bring glory and distinction ta
the Canadian Army, as did many of their
ancestors on the battle-fields of Europe in the
last war.
As for our Air and Naval Forces, they have
been performing their duties in a manner
gratifying not only ta the Canadian people,
but ta all who are associated with them in
the work of clearing the skies and the seas
from the menace which at one time seemed
almost insurmountable, and they are rendering a distinctive part in what has now become
the greatest combined fighting force the world
has ever seen.
Owing ta the procedure we adopted earlier
in the session of examining the resolutions preceding bills brought before the House of
Commons, we have through our Standing Commiteee on Finance been able ta make a careful survey of Government expenditures as set
out in this Bill. We were able ta bring before
that committee the various Ministers and
officers of the war departments, and give them
an opportunity of explaining, not alone the
necessity for the expenditures, but also the
manner in which these expenditures were ta

JULY 23, 1943
be made. I think it wilI be generally agreed
that this new and unusual procedure in aur
parliamentary waýrk bas been a benefit ta the
members af the Senate as a whole, and a satisfaction to those senatars who found it convenient to attend the meetings of that coinmittee. I amn aiso, pleased to report that its
wark is looked upan with favaur hy the Ministers who appeared befare it, and hy the
officers af the various departments interested.
The Bill is now autharitatively befare us for
second reading. It is nat my intention ta
deal at great length with the discussions that
accurred in ano-ther place, where each of the

Ministers spent some days in. efining the work
and intentions of bis department. I think
aur Standing Committee on. Finance, by its
inquiries, tbrough the various Ministers 4nd
officers, has accamplished this resuit in a more
direct and thorough manner.
The Minister of Finance gave a complete
breakdown of the expenditures by the various
departments concerned. I shall read the
primary breakdown as to the comparative
expenditures in the departments between 19421943 and 1943-1944, and ask that it be placed
an Senate, Hansard for aur convenience and
for reference. It is in this form:

Colonel IRaIston ini the other Chamber, on
May 14, 1943, gave a very comprehiensive
study and report of hie department's activities.
It will ho found at page 2696 of Gommons
Hlansard. 1 know my honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) is interested in
these figures; so I 'wiII quote from the Minister's speech. He said that we Lad over
100,000 general service personnel in Canada
of suitable age and category-that is, including those in the training centreÈ--for overseas
service, either trained or ini training, who are
available or by orderly withdrawal and replacement could be made available to, be sent overseas as reinforcements should the need arise.

Since last May, I may add, many of these

men have been sent overseas as reinforcements.
The Minister went on toe ay that we had
hesides, in the training stream, in the operational units and in the administrative and
servicing units, over 50,000 category A personnel called, up for training and service, who
could be made available if the need arose and
action were taken under the National Resources Mobilization Act. Our strength. in
Canada as of Mardi 31, the end of the lust
fiscal year, was more than 250,000. These were
made up of operational troop-Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Would the Minister be good enougli te give us the figures for.

SENATE

4w)

Canada? Do 1 understand that we have
bere 100,000 men for overseas?
Hon. Mr. KING: We have 100,000 men of
category, A available for overseas or for any
other service. In addition there are 50,000
men of category A called up, who could be
made available for ovorseas if action were
takon undor the National Reeources Mobilization Act.
The Ministor said that the strength of the
Army in the North American area was roughly
250,000 of ail ranks. These consisted of
80,000 operational troops, over 80,000 in home
war establishments and over 80,000 in the
training Stream. Also included in the 250,000
were both gonoral service personnel and mon
called up under the National Resources
Mobilization Act. The strength of the Canadian Army overseas as of March, 1943, was
193,000. Since thon there has heon a decrease
in the number of mon in Canada, but an
increaso overseas. It is estimated that the

number of mon required for the Army during
the fiscal yoar 1943-44 is 100,000, of which
numbor 75,000 will ho for service overseas.
This gives an idea not on]y of the strength
of the Army ovorseas, but also of the Army
as it is composed in Canada.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Are the Home Guard
figures included?
Hon. Mr. KING: No, they are not.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I arn sorry to
interrupt my honourable friend, but although
we already have the information, I think, it
would do no harmn to, repeat how many fighting divisions we have ovorseas. This information would ho intensely interesting to honourable members. We are supposed to have two
army corps. If the whole army took the field,
whnt would ho the strength?
Hon. Mr. RING: I wiIl just givo this hy

SENATE

Hon. Mr. WHITE: May I ask the honourable the Minister a question? Is it the intention to send any further divisions overseas
as divisions, or will the troops now in Canada
be used as reinforcements?
Hon. Mr. KING: I think it is the intention not to increase the number of divisions,
but to reinforce the troops overseas.
At the request of the honourable leader
opposite I have had a statement placed on
the desks of members so that they might
have complete information as to expenditures
on the various operations of the Department
of Defence. I think it is unnecessary for me
to dilate on these expenditures. The Ministers have given a very complete analysis,
which is on record in the House of Commons
Hansard, and we have had an opportunity
of hearing these Ministers before our Committee on Finance. I would only say this.
It is to be expected that this year, especially
now that the Canadian army has gone into
action, expenditures will be greatly increased.
As shown by the figures I have given you,
the vote this year is nearly $600,000,000 more
than it was last year. That is only an estimate, however. The actual figures depend
upon the activities of our army and the necessities of that army. One thing I think we
can say, and say with some satisfaction: that
our troops are well equipped.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. KING: They have probably the
finest equipment of any army in the world;
it is at least as good as any; and I am sure
it is the desire of the Canadian people that
our soldiers should be provided with everything
that it is possible te provide for them.
With regard to the Air Service, honourable
members will re.call that there was an air
conference held in Ottawa last spring, attended by representatives not only of Great
Britain and the United States, but of other
countries as well. At that time the air training scheme was in operation. Schools had
been established throughout Canada, and
many students from various countries came
to take part in the air training programme,
which, I think I may say, is a great credit
to those who have had it under their charge.
That scheme to some extent increased the
estimates for the Air Service. In addition
to that, however, the Canadian Government
has now arranged to maintain thirty-eight
purely Canadian squadrons overseas, and,
furthermore, it has undertaken to look
after the Canadian personnel in the Royal
Air Force. It may be rather startling to
honourable gentlemen to learn that, although
we have a very sizable air force of our own,
Hon. Mr. KING.

for every man in the Royal Canadian Air
Force there are eleven Canadians in the
Royal Air Force. We are beginning to realize
just how much Canadian youth is doing not
only for Canada, but for the defence of the
Empire in this great war.
In the Naval Department as well we find
a considerably increased expenditure. I think
it is easily understood why this should be so.
We started out as a very humble naval power,
but we have grown rapidly. To-day the
Canadian Navy is largely responsible for
guarding the transport of goods across the
Atlantic, and in order that it might be able
to accomplish this, not only have we had to
build in our own yards ships suitable for that
class of work, but we have also had to buy,
especially in Great Britain, a larger type of
vessel that will give us greater striking power.
The Canadian Naval Service is something
of which we may well be proud. From reports of speeches of that great leader, Mr.
Churchill, and information we have been able
to glean from the Press and what has been
said by Ministers in Parliament, it would
seem that the Canadian Naval Service has
at least put a curb on what at one time was
a very serious problem, namely, the submarine
menace.
In this work there is a combined effort
by the Naval Service and the Air Force. The
Royal Canadian Air Force is to-day patrolling
convoys out of Halifax, Sydney and Newfoundland.
Using British, American and
Canadian planes, they are operating half-way
across the Atlantic, to where the work is
taken over by British planes. The increased
efficiency of our Air Force, coupled with the
work of the Navy, has had much to do with
overcoming the submarine.
Now, I do not wish to continue at greater
length. I am pleased to have the honour of
presenting this Bill and asking that it be
given second reading.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I am sure we are all greatly indebted
to the honourable leader of this House for
placing before us in such a comprehensive
and detailed manner the budget for our three
armed forces, the Army, the Navy and the
Air Force. We are also indebted to him
for arranging to have so many Ministers appear before the Standing Committee on
Finance, thus enabling us to secure much
interesting and valuable information. We

Agriculture, Hon. Mr. Gardiner; the Minister
of Labour, Hon. Mr. Mitchell; the Minister

also mystified.
I will conclude my rcmarks by rnaking one
more reference te that' arrny of 50,000 or
60,000 men wvho bave signed up for the defence
of Canada. In 194 the senior Minister of

Minister of Defence said in anether place that
we sheuld net refer te this military force in
Canada, ns a reserve nrrny, but rather as an
active armny. It is quite true that these men
wbo are pledged te serve in this country
alone can be said te, belong te the active
armay, but I do net knew wbat tbey will be
active about. I tbink, as I bave said before,
that the case for the Gevernrnent and the
Minister would be strengthened if these young
men, after receiving one year's training, werc
put back inte useful occupations; and then,
if we ever bave compulsory service under the
National Resources Mobilization Act, their
military training will prove valuablo. But
for wbat purpose de we keep tbemn in Canada
wben food and clotbing are se scarce? I do
net know, except fer their being pbysically fit.
I corne back te the Bill. 0f course everybody on this side of the flouse is in faveur
of the $3,800,000,000 of war expenditures. We
must back tip our armed forces. Canada's
effort, by and large, is good. I arn net se
narrow-minded as te say that it bas net

tbe sake of carping criticisrn, but solely
because of my desire, and the desire of the
people of Canada, te be assured that we shahl
bave a sufficient number of men overseas te
replace tbe casualties that are bound te oceur.
In conclusion, I should like te, say tbat we
as Canadians are filled with pride te read in
the Press the words of cemmendation of our
troeps tbat bave fallon from the lips of

JULY 23, 1943
Hon. W. MeL. ROBERTSON: Honourable
senators, the honourable leader of the Government and the honourable leader of the other
side, drawing on their long experience in public
affairs, have touched the pertinent points in
connection with this Bill. With your indulgence I should like to deal with an aspect of
war expenditure that is more general than
specific in its nature.
In yesterday's Montreal Star there appeared
a dispatch dated from London with this heading, " Modern War Cost Fantastic." The
writer estimated that the cost of the first great
war was $186,000,000,000, and that the estimated cost of the present war to all the
participants will be five times as great. It is
interesting in this connection to note the
expenditure of Canada in the last war and in
this. For the six fiscal years ending in 1920
our expenditure on the first great war, including
the cost of demobilization, was $1,670,000,000;
whereas up to the present time our total
expenditure, including this amount of $3,890,000,000, the billion-dollar contribution to Great
Britain, and the billion-dollar appropriation
for lend-lease purposes, has reached the sum
of $10,900,000,000-and the end is not yet.
No serious-minded person, honourable
senators, can 'contemplate the magnitude of
the effort called for by total war without the
gravest misgivings for its possible consequences. The monetary value of the effort
being put forth by Canada and the other
United Nations, whose economie structure
approximates ours, has reached such staggering
proportions as to be almost impossible of comprehension; but such is the importance of our
objective that no man would say it nay. In
the words of Winston Churchill, "Hitler has
asked for total war, and total war he shall
get." On that point there are unquestioned
unanimity and unfaltering resolution.
We should do well, however, as we stand
participants in and spectators of this unprecedented and unforseen state of affairs, to contemplate as best we can the possible conseWe
quences that may follow in its train.
should, I suggest, give the most serious consideration to the potential danger to the
economie structure of our country that exists
in these unparalleled conditions, and seek by
every means in our power to avert the danger
by endeavouring to minimize its effects.
We should, I think, refresh our memories
as to the first world war. We won that war,
and we are resolved to win this war. But in
the period that followed hostilities twenty-five
years ago, despite the fact that our efforts were
small as compared with what they are to-day,
victors and vanquished alike suffered disturb-

ances of their economic structure of a most
serious and far-reaching nature. Two economie
systems, Russia's and Germany's, collapsed
entirely. France for years suffered serious dislocation of her economic structure, and, though
in due course the situation was stabilized, it
left in its train a heritage of suspicion, bitterness and distrust-factors that no doubt contributed greatly to her present unhappy position. In Britain, the United States and Canada
conditions were less serious, but these countries
too, in due course, felt the effect of these
influences to an extent that we hope we shall
not experience again.
Broadly speaking, the effect on each participant falls into two classifications: the loss
in human lives, and the effect upon its economy. With the first there is little we can do
except to see that our men and women are
well trained and are provided with ample
quantities of the best equipment for making
war and conserving lives that science can devise and money buy. With the second there is,
I believe, a direct responsibility for the people
of Canada generally, and for Parliament
specifically. We should, I believe, address
ourselves to it with every energy and resource
we have at our command. We owe it to our
country, and to those who in due course will
proudly return with victory perched.upon their
shoulders, and to the memory of those who
will have given their lives in the defence of our
way of life.
So far in this war we have learned much
from experience-as indeed we should. This
applies both to the battle front and the home
front. I have supreme confidence that if we
do out share at home as, we know, those on
the battle front will do theirs, we shall achieve
a military victory. I am by no means confident, however, that we on the home front,
preparing for their return, will be equally
successful.
I want to suggest to you, honourable senators, that we can emerge from this war, not
only victoriously, but with no serious dislocation to our economic structure, if we have the
wit to maintain the home front intact. Stupendous as are our efforts on the economie side,
they are after all but the products of brains
and brawn. The major tragedy is the irreplaceabl'e loss of life. In the economie sense
the simple truth is that our productive capacities can provide not only a sufficient minimum
standard of living for those at home, but also
a huge surplus for the purposes of war, without
any serious depletion of any irreplaceable national resources. If we forget for a moment
the monetary equivalents and think only in
terms of production, the situation is quite

4vri

SENATE

simple. Now and for the duration of the war
aur productive capacity is very high, and the
civilian population at home supplement what
they had at the outbreak of war with the
smallest possible amount of goods and services currently produced, the surplus production being directed to the needs of war.
When hostilities cesse, the productive capacity
which will still exist can remain high, but
the naiture of our production will be ýchanged
ta satisfy the illimitable and delayed needs
of aur people as a whole.
Unfortunately the problem. is not so simple
as that, since aur economy is tied ta monetary standards, which in past wars have radically changed. Up ta the moment, however,
as a result of the experience of the last war,
it bas functioned along the same lines, largely
because this time, unlike the period of the
last war, we have succeeded so far in keeping
the price level from radically changing. The
key ta the future lies in whether we shahl
continue ýta do so.
We have reached the stage, 1 believe, when
we should face up ta this problem. We should
get clearly in aur minds what wauld happen
if we lest this battle on the home front, and
what we can reasonably look-forward ta if
we win it.- To-day the cost-of-living index
stands at approximately 116 per cent of prewar levels. If the dam broke and contraIs
became ineffective, the index would undoubtedly go ta the 198 per cent iL reached in 1920,
and probably much higher, since inflationary
forces are much more powerful now than during the last war. As it rose, the position of
thosQ on fixed incomes and in the lower incorne brackets would become increasingly
diffleult, and their standard of living be constantly depressed. Those with incarnes more
readily adjusted to the changing conditions
would not suifer as much, but, as experience
bas taught, their standard toc, would suifer.
There is a minority class whose grass income
would materially increase, but even in their
case it ja douhtfiil if, after the incidences of

any business ta benefit, even ternporarily.
Constantly increasing demands for higber
wages on the part of its ernployees would
largely offset any gains resulting fromn the
price level, and, even if larger profits ensued,
excess profits taxes and heavy incarne taxes
would take the major part of them.

purpase, and produce great hardship and
general uneasiness.
Sa far as possible, the
war should be paid for in accordance with
the democratie decisions of the people at
large, expressed in the fiscal measures adopted
by the Government.
'If uncon'trolled inflation should develap,
these democratic decisions could not be made
eff ective.
The problems of government
would be immeasurably increased. Increasing
monetary values would increase the amount
of maney required for war purposes. Revenues
from taxation would probably increase, but
the constantly decreasing value of the dollar
would strike a fatal blow at voluntary participation in Government loans, unless the
whole policy of voluntary participation in
war loans were abandoned. The only alternative would be higher interest rates, which,
in turn, would seriausly depreciate the value
of the Government's present obligations. Ail

them ta-day, if the price level got out of
hand the resuIt might well be the use of the
printing press; and if it were resarted ta,
aur econamy as we know it would pass out
of the window.
I should nat like ta go so far as ta say
that a serious break in the price level would
cost us the war, but I believe it would seriously affect aur chances. The effeet on the
moarale of aur fighting men would be most
pronounced, since they would feel, and rightly
so, that the home front had failed them;
that the position of the-ir dependents at home
would be increasingly difficuit; that the resulting labour unrest would seriously interfera with the supply of the weapons of war,
and that even on the cessation of hastilities
the stage would be set for an ecanomic
collapse.
I said the stage would be set for a collapse,
and surely that is what would ensue. If,
when hostilities cease, a price level of 300
Lo 400 per cent were ta exist, there is not one
business in a hundred but would be canvinced
that the price level wvas due far a serious

unable or unwilling ta assume the risk of
undertaking ta produce consumer goada. This
fact, coupled with the ather factars, wauld
precipitate a collapse greater than we have
ever known. the conqequences of which no

As evidence of our relative success it is
interesting to note that the League of Nations'
Economie Section's estimates, as published in
the New York Times, July 3, 1943, indicate
that botween December,
1939, and
the rise in the wholesale price May, 1943,'

This is very gratifying. It is true that Germany makes a hetter showing than we do, but
it is due, no doubt, te, the fact that their price

s0 vivid a recollection of the effeets of failure

to do everything possible to prevent it from

But, though we may agree that the contro]

relief from immcdiate danger, and with it an
unconseicus relaxation of the self-discipline
wbich was much in evidence when the danger
wvas the greatest. Both in our country and
in the United States there arc growîng instances which indicate that self-restraintand
willingness to subordinate individýual and group
aspirations te the common goal of proteeting our way of life are beginning to falter.
And therein lies the danger.
I refuse to believe that any people in
Canada, exccpt -a very sinail minority, are in
faveur of uncontrolled inflation througb a
collapse cf our efforts to hold the price level
down. A preminent United States public man
said recentlv that Hitler rounted on the inability of democracies te control the price
level as a factor in the presentL confliet. I
do nlot know the souîrce of bis information, but
I can readily beliex e it. I can believe that
every Axis agent in Canada, and in the United
States as well, is to-day part of that minerity.
Any political group who thouglit their only
chanee cf attaining power would arise froým
the chaos resulting from uncontrolled inflation,
much as Hitler's did in Germany, would be
included in the minority, as well as a few
human vultures who xvould feel that their
nimblencas cf mind would enable them, under
these circumstances, to reap tremendous fortunes eut of the lesses cf otIiers.
The vast maj nrity cf Canadian citizens, however. want ne sucha condition, and weuld net

That, some may unconsciously do s0 is the
danger. It is the duty cf ahl in authority,
the great agencies which do se much te mould
public opinion, and ail citizens cf good intention, te ]end their moral support in miaking
sure that this battle on the heme fr-ont is wvon.
For my part, I believe that it is desirable
te continue these centrols, net only for the
dluration of tbe war, but aise for as long thereafter as the danger exists. Indeed, it is possible that the danger will be greater when
hestilities cease.
The cost-of-living index,
which reached 157-6 in November, 1918, at
the end of the last war, went to 198 by July,
1920, twenty months later.
When the war is over there will be a tremendeus accumulation of purchasing power
in the formn of increased bank deposits, cempulsery savings and voluntary participation in
war Jeans. This ability te buy will be accempanied by a prenounced inclination te, do se,
since there wilJ by that time be a vast accumulated shortage of censumer and capital geods.
Our productive facilities would, of course,

mancîs, but it takes time, and there will be

JULY 23, 1943
as weli the additionai demands of a ravaged
and hungry world. The danger may be even
greater than it is now.
We are bound to recognize that the
machinery of price contrai is diff cuit ta
administer. Many of its provisions are exceedingly repugnant ta a people, most of
whose lives have been iived in a relativeiy
free economy. It is the simplest thing in
the world ta pick flaws in the provisions, ta
point out inconsistencies and unfairnesses
that are incidentai ta its operation. Though
most admit the necessity in the abstract,
there are literaiiy hundreds of applications
aimed -ta break it in specific cases, and each
is supported with excellent arguments 'ta
prove the case in point. It is possible that
ta the ordinary difficulties may be added
others. If it should happen that the United
States does not attain the degree of success
that we do in maintaining the price level,
the spectacle of muc'h higher prices for many
primary products there, as compared with
ours, will create a great deal of unrest.
Indeed, there are many evidences that it is
accurring now.
It is here that we can render the greatest
service. If aur efforts to, contrai prices fail,
the failure will corne from the chaîn of circumstances which resuit from one group in
our economy seeking and securing increased
prices for the goods or services which they
suppiy, and this action in turn prompting other
groups ta do the same. In the course of time
the situation gets out of hand and the
attempt at contraI collapses. In peace, and
under normai conditions, it is a natural impulse for everlyone ta try ta get the highest
possible return for hîs efforts. That has been
one of the outstanding features of free enterpRige. In wax, this canniot be, it must not
be-indeed, it is not, in my opinion-the
guiding principle; and as witnesscs to the
fact I would eaul the hundreds of thousands
of young men and women who have offered
their ail for their country on the battle-field,
and the thousands of faithful men and women
throughout the length and breadth of this
land who fromn the outbreak of war have given
unselfishly of their time and talents ta their
country, without thought of recompense.
But that is nat ail. I believe that the vast
majority of those engaged in the production of
supplies, whether as employers or as employees, are animated by the same guiding principle. And, after ahl, how could it be otherwise, since the boys on the battle fronts, using
these materials, are the flesh and blood of those
who are prod.ucing them? There are, of course,
exceptions ta this rule, and often the excep-

409

tions exercise an influence, far out of proportion ta their numbers, over their feilows. But
when these exceptions assert that those with
whom they are associated-whether they be
employers or employees, whether in factory,
farmn or forest-wiil only put forth their
maximum effort if they secure an ever-increasing return in dollars and cents, it is our
duty ta suggest ta them that they are not
truly reflecting the spirit of the Canadian
people, and that any effort ta wring a peculiar
advantage from their country's extremity,
when their country is battling for its life,
does not present a very edifyîng spectacle.
I yield ta no one in this House in the belief
that the price level that existed on the outbreak of war, the level which, for my part, I
am seeking ta maintain, involves grave incansistencies and unfaîrnesses as between not only
variaus economie groups, but various geographical sections as well. I believe that this price
level, whie normally considered ta be the
result of the play of forces in a free economy,
ýwas in actual fact, nothing of the kind. I
believe that it represenýted a basis in which, in
the main, the price levels for secondary industry were artificially raised, largeiy at the expense of, and to the great detriment of, the
vast body of primary industry in this country.

I believe that in due course the rectifying of
this injustice, not only between groups in this

country, but also generally in relation ta conditions existing south of the border, wiii be one
of the most pressing problems with whieh
Canada is faced. But any general proposai
ta upset the equilihrium by attempting ta
rec'tify it naw, when men are dying on the
battle-field, is absurd and would ha the height
of folly.
But there are those who fear that we, as a
small nation subi ected ta, titanie world
forces, cannot expect ta do otherwise than
swim with the tide and follow the example
of nations larger than we are. May I remind
them of the advice of a great public man in
the United States, but born in Canada, who
recently visited Ottawa, when he counselled us
ta "have faith-have faith in ourselves."'
,On the only other occasion on which I had
the honour and privilege of addressing this
House, I spoke, in part, as follows. I hope

JULY 23, 1943

that he even thought it worth while to appear
and diseuse his plan, for he has a low opinion
indeed of this honourable body. Dr. Marsh is
one of the joint authors of the textbook of
the C.C.F. It is called "Social Planning for
Canada." It is written by a number of men
who think alike, and we are told in the foreword that the book is a joint production. Now,
let us set what this book, of which Dr. Marsh
is a joint author, has to say about the Senate:
We have so far omitted all mention of the
one great change affecting Parliament which
must bput in he forefront of the demands of
the C.C.F. That is, of course, the abolition
of the Senate. Almost every economie and
political project which has been advocated in
this book and which would requýire legislative
action by the Dominion Parliament would meet
with obstinate and bitter opposition in the
Senate. In its composition and in its activity
it is one of the most reactionary Chambers
among all the free Governments in the western
world.
Those, honourable senators, are some of the
words of Dr. Marsh and his co-authors. The
criticism continues:
But, strange to say, the Fathers of Confederation in thus creating a Senate as a bulwark of
provincial rights against the central Government
entrusted the power of making appointments to
the Senate to that very central Government
upon whom it was to operate as a check. Those
bard-headed politicians of the Quebec Conferenee must surely have had their tongues in their
cheeks when they presen.ted this particular
specimen of their handiwork to a credulous
populace.
Honourable senators, I suspect Dr. Marsh
and his associates must have had their
tongues in their cheeks when they wrote those
words. For my part, I think the Fathers of
Confederation had far-sighted vision when
they realized that this honourable body might
some day be needed to put a check upon
men with the ideas that Dr. Marsh evidently
holds. The book, of which, as I have said,
Dr. Marsh is an acknowledged joint author,
proceeds:
Actually the Senate bas never operated to
rotect provincial rights, unless accidentally. It
as steadily acted on behalf of a .party recently defeated at the polla to thwart the
Government that bas just been ohosen by the
people; and its powers of annoyance in this
respect would long ago have compelled some
Government to undertake reforms were it not
for the fortunately high death rate among its
aged members.
A cheerful gentleman, indeed, is Dr. Ma.rsh.
But let us see how near he is to the facts.
The late Sir George Rosswrote a book on the
Senate of Canada, and I desire to quote this
passage from it:
It is commonly said that the Senate has used
itspolitical majority adversely to the political
majority of the House of Commons whn the

411

two Houses were not in accord, and on this
supposition the charge of partisanship is made
againstthe Senate. From 1867 to 1903 the
party was paramount politically in
a
e
the Senate. For twenty-four years of that
period the same party was in control of the
House of Commons. The analysis of the statement shows but very little difference in the
number of Bille amended or rejected by the
Senate during those two different periode. For
instance, in the twenty-four yeare of Conservative majority in bath Houses-1. The total number of Bille before the Senate
was 2,569.
(a) Amended-673 (or 26.2 per cent).
(b) Rejected-44 (or 1-7 per cent).
In the twelve years with a Conservative
Senate and a Liberal majority in the House of
Common-2. The total number of Bills before the
Senate was 1,261.
(a) Amended-282 (or 22.3 per cent).
(b) Rejected-44 (or 3-4 per cent).
In the eight yeare with a Liberal majority
in the Senate and a Liberal majority .in the
House of Commons (1903-11)3. The total number of Bills before the
Senate was 714.
(a) Amended-258 (or 36 per cent).
(b) Rejected-17 (or 2-3 per cent).
In the two years with a Liberal Senate and
a Conservative House of Commons (1912-14)4. The total number of Bills before the
Senate wae 415.
(a) Amended-60 (or 14-4 per cent).
(b) Rejected-1.
The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation textbook, of which, I repeat, Dr. Marsh
is a joint author, continues in this strain:
But in recent years,-This is awfully good.
But in recent years, the real function of the
Senate has been to act as a bulwark of property
intereste, i.e., of the interests of large propertf
owners, individual or corporate. T he remarkable number of company directorships held by
senators is the most significant fact about our
upper House. No one who has ever watched its
sleepy deliberations will be misled into beieving
that the old gentlemen are appointed directors
because of the services they are expected tW
render at the board meetings of our tig corporations. The real motive is, of course, the
services they are expected to render in throwing
out bills of which these corporations do not
approve. The Senate has, in fact, become one
additional line of defence for the real ruling
classes in this country, and it can be relied upon
to express the opinions of St. James street as
consistently and as permanently as does the
Montreal Gazette. Under present political conditions big business is surely powerful enough
in the influence it exercises, directly or indirectly. over the House of Commons. It does
not need a second line of defence. The Senate
must therefore be abolished.
Dr. Marsh is a young man. So far as I
can find out, he bas never done anything yet
except advise other people how to do things.
I know very few St. James street directors.
In fact I know nothing about St. James street.

translate sound theory into productive ternis of
men and machinery.
So many Canadians have been engrossed in
winning the war that the deliberations of amnbitious planning groups have not received the
close public attention they would in peace-time.
This circumstance imposes a great responsibility
on the planners: to keep a watchful' eye on
extremist influences in their midst. Canadians
emphatically do not wish to discover on the
day of victory that, while they have been
swatn and bleeding, their post-wrlvshv
been ai mapped out for themn along lines of
imported theories incompatible with their
traditions, theories which they thought they
were fighting to get rid of for good. The point
is that while we are working with our noses
to the grindstone andi radical theorists are
travelling along with their eyes to the skies,
responsible planners should be looking for the
real pitfalls straight ahead.
Surveys of pu.blic opinion have shown very
good reason why at present there iS. littie
interest in Ieft-wing thinking amonýg Canadians
generally. It is simply that visionary idealism
may souuid fascinating when discussed in placid
pre-war drawing roonis, but when.i is necessary
in war-time to impose rigid restrais on people
to attain victnry, they g et more than their f111

day when essential wartime controls may be
relaxed sud they can breathe f reely again. At
a tume like this, t-herefore, f ew Canadians see

tigliter restrictions after the war in order to

Millions of words have been written about
glittering post-war social programmes; not so
well known is, the basic f act that the flrst
requisite for supporting them is the re-establishment of trade sud industry on a healthy foundation. If far-reaching social refornis are to
be introduced, the steadiest, surest headway cau
be made by a graduaI process of adopting plans
as they are tested and found workable-a process of evolution rather than revolution.
That, honourable senators, is a very good
article, taken fromn a very excellent newspaper,
and I imagine it expresses pretty clearly the
opinion of the province of New Brunswick.
Now, 'let us get one thiug fairly into our
mindes: Canadian business cannot survive for
any length of years under the taxation which
it bas become uecessary to enforce during the
war. When we are planning for post-war
social reconstruction and security, we muet
plan on a basis that this country can afford.
We are indeed living in a strange age. We
are living in an age when speakers are going
up and down this country tryiug to convince
our young people that there is nothing immoral about reaping where they have not
sown and gatbering where they have not
strawed. We are living i the age of the

become second only to the Bible. I bave reada great deal of it, and I must say there is
mucli in it with which I do not agree.
On page 73 of the proceedings of tbe special
committee we are told by tbe honourable
senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lamibert) that
anyone wbo is interested in social security
should by this tîme be fully aware of Dr.
Marsb's capacity to diseuss the subi ect. I
quite realize that the bonourable senator from
Ottawa was sincere in wbat bie said, but I am
not at ail sure i my own mind whether Dr.
Marsh is fully capable of discussing the subject
fromn the proper Canadian standpoint. I muet
confess that I find some of bis arguments a
bit confusing; but I always try to keep in
mind the fact that Dr. Marsh is a Socialist,
and that I am not a Socialist and am not
favourable to any soheme wbich will help on
the establishmnent of a Socialist government
i this country. On page 72 of the special
committee's report, Dr. Marsh telle us that

social security disbursements are in theniselves

one means of rnobilizing purchasing power.
He further tells us that mobilizing purchasing
power is an econornie weapon which we can
use, if we are clever enough, to help out postwar transition. As I said before, I ar n ot an
economist, and 1 may be very dense, but this
sounds to me very much like trying to make
ourselves rich hy taking in each other's
washing.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: I must confess that I
fail to sec how much better off a business man
is going to be if he pays out $100 in taxes and
this amount is distributed among certain
people in his community who then corne back
to him and purchase a hundred dollars' worth
of his goods with his own rnoney. As I say, I
may be dense, bu~t it serns to me that somehow or other he is goiag to be out $100.
Dr. Marsh on the sarne page tells us, in
answer to a question frorn the honourable
senator from Aima (Hon. Mr. Balantyne),
that in England they have a budget of six
hundred and scventy-nine million pounds for
the first year of the Beveridge schcme. They
expect insured persons to contribute one hundred and ninety-four million pounds, the employers one hundred and thirty-seven million
pounds, and the tax revenue the balance.
Dr. Marsh goes on to say that roughly that
means that almost exactly one-haîf cornes from
Govcrnment sources and the other half from
employces and employers. But where doos
the Government money corne frorn in the first
place? The bulk of it cornes out of the
pockets of the taxpayers, of course; therefore,
1 think it is only fair to assume that the cm3loyce and the employer, in addition to their
»wn contributions, will have to provide rnost
Df the three hundred and forty-cight million
pounds contributed by the Govcrnrncnt.
I arn merely ýmentioning these things as they
appear to me. If I arn wrong, I shaîl be glad
to be correctcd. But what 1 want to know is:
Wherc is the rnoney comning from? Where it
,ornes fromn in Great Britain is not rny immediate concern, but I arn very rnuch igterested iii
where it is to corne from in this country.
In rcply to some questions put to hirn by the
honourable senators from Aima (Hon. Mr,.
Ballantyne) and Peterborough (Hon. Mrs.
Fallis), Dr. Marsh said:
There will always be certain persona who
not subrnit willingly to a contributory fo.rrnwil
of
insurance; but if it is made coenpuleory, they
cannot refrain.
That staternent is open to question. There
bas been compulsory insurance of a sort ini
Great Britain for many years. Dr. Marsh rnay
flot have had experience of that, but I have.
Eon. Mr. DAVIES.

If Dr. Marsh had had experience he would
knowv that so far as the insurance of domestic
servants is concerned, much of it is not paid
for by the servants themaselves. He would
know that when domestic servants are hired in
Great Britain, where they have compulsory unemploy.ment insurance, it is a common practice for themn to make a stipulation that their
wages shaîl be so much a week and insurance,
so that the whole burden really falîs upon
the employer.
I have heard of several cases reccntly in
which employees have asked their employers
for increases in wagcs. They have said: "I
want s0 rnuch in the envelope every Saturday
night. I arn not interested in taxes; keep
those out; do what you like with them. I
want so much in the envelope every Saturday
night." And that attitude is hecoming more
prevalent in this country. I have discussed
it with Dr. Clark, the Deputy Minister of
Finance, who tells me it is illegal, and that
his department has flot heard much about it
as yet. Bu~t 1 know, honourable senators, that
that spirit is growing among some of our
labouring classes.
On page 82 Dr. Marsh made sorne references
to children's allowances. I arn in favour of
children's allowances. As a matter of fact,
I arn in favour of rnuch of the programme of
post-war eecurîty which is being planned,
but I want to see it planned on a basis which
we can afford, without putting too heavy a
hurden upon business and the srnall income
tax payer. I want us to cut our germent
according to our cloth. I want to see.us adopt
social sccurity gradually.
I realize, as well as anyone else doce, the
difficulties with which we rnay be faced after
the war is over. We shaîl have hundreds of
thousands of young men and wornen corning
back frorn overseas, and they mnust be our
flrst care. Also there are a great rnany workers
now engaged in war industries who will then
be unemployed, and they wiIl have to be
taken care of. In rny own city of Kingston
there are several industries working twentyfour hours a day at war jobs. I realize,
honourable senators, ýthat we must find some
method of looking after all these people during the transition period. But what I ehould
like to point out je that in planning for social
security we are planning for people of differcnt mentalities and different ideals. It would
be a happy solution indeed to many of our
problerne if we could make absolutely sure
that there need never be any more want in
this country. But have we yet reached the
point where we can afford to do that? Muet
we not do it gradually?

JULY 23, 194M1
We all know that those people wha need
assistance are, ta put it as charitably as passible, flot any mare honeat nar perhaps any
more dishonest than the rest of us. Welfare
workers, however, are wdll aware that one
of their greatest problems is keeping track
of the chiseller and the spendthrift. It seems
ta me that we are going too much on the
assumption that all men and women arehonest. I regret ta say that this is nat so.
I have urged that taxation must be eut
severely after the war is over, in order that
businesses which are being starved ta-day can
recoup stocks, replace worn-out machinery,
pay their debts and build up their reserves.
There is*another reasan why we must eut
taxation as drasticslly as we can, and vhy, in
my opinion, we cannot affard ta take upon aur
shoulders a huge scheme which vill coat us
hundreds of millions of dollars a year, until
*business and agriculture have readjusted themselves. That reason is ta be faund in aur prospects for immigration. I am quite sure every
honourable senator believes that after the
ver is over Canada wili experience a great
wave of immigration, provided conditions in
The obviaus
this country are attractive.
reply of some bonourable senatar might be
that the mare attractive aur social security
sehieme, the more immigration we are apt
ta attract. But I do nat think ve want the
type af immigration that is attracted by a
social security scheme.
We shaîl vant ta attract capital as well as
warking classes ta this country after the var
is over. And if we are ta attract capital for
industrial developxnent, we need twao things:
cheap power and loy taxation. That, ta my
mind, is another argument in faveur of nat
trying ta spend tao much money before we
have earned it.
In bis budget speech delivered on the 2nd
af March, 1943, the Hon. Minister af Finance
told us that in income tax alane hie hoped ta
raise this year $1,372,500,000, made up as follows: from individuals, $460,000,000; frorn the
national defence tax, $80,500,000; from corporations, $530,000,000; from interest, etc.,
$27,000,000, and from the excess profits tax,
M45,000,000. This is an enormous sum ai
money and certainly impinges very seriausly
on business. We are reaching the place where
the progressive income tax is becoming s0
high that mare business is not worth getting.
This is nlot the time ta discuss aur exces
profits tax, but I might mention that I do nat
think it is a fair tax. This tax has alvays
seemed ta me ta do twa thingB: it keepe dowu
the man who vas davn during the four years,
1936, 1937, 1938 and 1939, vhich are used by

the Government in estimating average base
profit; and it allows the man who was making
'big profits during those years ta keep on
making themn without paying any abnormal
sumn to the Goverument. The man whose
-profits have remained fairly stationary, noa
matter how large, pays a corporation tax of
about 40 per cent; but the man whase profits
have increased since the war started-whether
that increase is due ta hetter management,
normal development or expansion due ta the
war-pays 30 per cent of bis base profits ta
theGovernment, and 100 per cent beyond that.
As a result many businesses have bejen very
severely crippled. I think it would be much
fairer if the Government taxed the profits of
every business 30, 40 or 50 per cent, as the
case rnay be, and treaked everyone alike. It is
my opinion that under the present scheme nlot
ail businesses are treated fairly, because the
Government assumes that ail excess profits are
due ta war expansion.
In conclusion, honourable senators-and I arn
sure you will be glad 1 say "in conclusion"ý-I
want ta make a few constructive suggestions.
The greatest. problemn with which welfare warkers have ta do is ignorance. The honourable
senator from Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis)
has had some experience in welfare work, as I
have, and I arn sure vill agree with this. Sir
William Beveridge pointed out the same thing
in his remarkable report ta the British Government. We must do something about this.
We must try ta raise the level of intelligence
among aur Canadian people through education.
Some years ago, when I vas chairman of a
board of education, I made a study of crirninal
statistics with regard ta education, and discovered some very interesting f acts. I discovered that the great mai arity of aur criniinals
had neyer gone farther than the public school.
The percentage of aur criminals wha had had a
high school education was very smaîl, and the
percentage vho, had had a university educatian
was practîcally nil. I do not knaw what the
school-leaving age is in other provinces, but I
believe at the present- time in Ontario it is
sixteen years. Unfartunately this provincial
regulation is too aften nullified by requests
fram parents vho want their children ta start
earning. Wheu Ontario raised the age limit
from fourteen ta sixteen, certain pravisos were
inserted. I sheuld have preferred ta have it
raised ta fitteen years without any pravisos.
In order ta imprave conditions after the
war, I would teach domestie science to the
girls of the advanced classes ini every school
of this land. By making it compulsory and
passible for every girl during hier Iset tva yeaMu
at schoal to learu ta cook, ta bake, to. ov,

SENATE
and to make up and understand household
budgeting, we shall not only improve the financial management of the large mass of the
homes of this country, but we shall also improve the health of our people to an extent
that it is difficult to estimate.
One more word. Let us, by all means,
plan for the physical well-being of the people
of Canada, to the extent that we can afford
to do so without having to resort to a crippling taxation. Let us plan that every child
shall have enough to eat, be warmly clad and
have proper medical attention. Let us plan
also for more extensive recreational facilities
throughout our land: municipal bowling greens,
municipal golf courses, municipally aided baseball and hockey teams, and everything which
will contribute to the health of our young men
and women. But, at the same time, let us
not forget the spiritual and cultural side of
our national life. Let us plan to encourage the
amateur drama, the young novelist and the
young artist; let us try to establish art galleries, however small, in some of the smaller
as well as the larger cities of our land; and
let us look forward to the day when we shall
have a happy and contented people, when
our cultural life shall have reached as high a
standard as that of any country in the world.
All these things we can do, honourable
senators, if we proceed carefully and slowly,
giving business and agriculture a chance to
readjust themselves after the war. But let us
not be hurried into plans which we cannot
afford by professional planners and those
people who are expert at spending the money
earned by others, but who themselves have
shown no great ability in the matter of
building up a business or cultivating a farm.
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN: Honourable senators, I have only a few words to say, and I
think I am bound to say them in view of the
remarks which have just been made by my
honourable friend from Kingston (Hon. Mr.
Davies). As the chairman of the subcommittee on social security, it was I who took the
responsibility of asking Dr. Marsh to appear
before that body and give evidence. And I
am in no way sorry that I did so.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I very much regret
the attack which my honourable friend from
Kingston bas seen fit to make on Dr. Marsh.
And that for several reasons. I think if my
honourable friend had been longer in this
Chamber he would have realized that it is not
permissible to make an attack in Parliament
upon a public servant, in the pay of the
Government, who bas no possible means of
replyizg for himself.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES.

In the second place, my honourable friend
is attacking a witness who appeared before one
of our committees which has made no report
to the House other than an interim report.
Now, the bases upon which my honourable
friend from Kingston attacked Dr. Marsh seem
-if he will allow me to say so in all kindness
-to smack somewhat of prejudice. He said
that Dr. Marsh was an adherent of the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation party
and a Socialist. Personally, I am totally unaware of Dr. Marsh's political beliefs, but I
do submit that whatever they may be is not
material to the question of setting up a scheme
of social security for this country along the
lines laid down in the Speech from the
Throne at the beginning of this session, along
the lines established~ at the Winnipeg convention of the Progressive Conservative party,
also along the lines of the report presented
by Sir William Beveridge in Great Britain and
approved and to be carried into effect by the
Churchill Government.
In these circumstances I say that, if a man is an expert on the
subject of social security, I am willing to
listen to what he has to say, regardless of
what his political views may be.
My honourable friend has cast some doubt
upon Dr. Marsh's ability to advise the Senate
on social security. Of Dr. Marsh's qualifications I have very little knowledge other than
that he was for a number of years a student
under Sir William Beveridge at the London
School of Economics. But I will tell the
House this: I discussed with Sir William
Beveridge the Marsh report, and he said to
me that he was extremely surprised that so
comprehensive and able a report had been
prepared in such a short time by Dr. Marsh.
My honourable friend may disagree with me;
he may not think Dr. Marsh has any qualifications for the preparation of a report on
social security for Canada; but I tell him
quite frankly that, as between his opinion
and that of Sir William Beveridge, I prefer
the opinion of Sir William.
An Hon. SENATOR: I should not.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: How long bas Marsh
been in this country?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: At least ten years.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: What positions bas he
held?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: He was a lecturer
at McGill University for several years. I have
no particular knowledge of his career.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: What did he lecture
on at McGill University?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Economics.

JULY 23, 1943
to make what seems to me a personal attack
upon a witness who appeared in all good
faith and at my suggestion before the subcommittee of the Senate to give evidence.
It does not say very much for -the type of
evidence that may be adduced before our
committees in the future if later on witnesses
are to be subject to attack in this Chamber
on the ground of their political views.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: What do you think
of the attitude of a man coming before a
Senate committee after he had collaborated
in writing a book condemning this body and
abusing its members?
Hïon. Mr. HUGESSEN: In reply to my
honourable friend, I would say that the very
best way of convincing Dr. Marsh or anybody
else that this Senate is not the representative
of the vested interests of this country will be
for us to take an active and partieîpating interest in the provision of social security for alI
our people.
I have little else to say, honourable senators.
I have spoken without preparation, but I did
nlot want this occasion to pass by without
commenting-I hope, 'not ton severely or unkindly-on what my honourable friend from
Kingston has seen fit to say.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Honourable members,
I want to say that I very much enjoyed the
address of the honourable senator from
Kingston. As to Dr. Marsh's accusation
against members of this Chamber, surely I
shal nlot be accused of supporting vested
interests after what I have said in this
Chamber dxiring the past winter.
While Dr. Marsh was being qucstioned in
our social security committee, I was reminded
of a political meeting out in Saskatchewan.
There was present an old gentleman who
could accornplish almost anything in a practical way. One of my supporters was a
wonderful speaker who could tell you how

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: That, of course, is gentlemen, hie is nt practical enough to track

We were told by the honourable senator
that Dr. Marsh was the author of a volume
put out by the Co-operative Commonwealth
Federation party, in which there were a number of criticisms directed at the Senate. I
have not seen the volume. I understand,
however, that it was prepared by three or four
gentlemen and bears their nomes on the titie
page. I suppose to the extent that a man is
a joint author of a book he cLoes assume
responsibility for jts contents, but I do nlot
think my honourable friend was quite fair in
leading this House to believe, as I think he
did, that Dr. Marsh himself wrote the criticism
of this body which the honourable gentleman
quoted.
Hon. Mr. HAIG- No; joint author.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: 1 think the honourable
gentlçman from Inkerman is under a misapprehiension: The book bears the title of
"Social Planning for Canada." The foreword
says that the book is a joint production and
that the views expressed are the views of
the authors-of whom Dr. Marsh is one.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: And you can judge a
man by the company he keeps.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: As my honourable
friend says, they may be jointly responsible,
but I certainly gathered the impression that
lie thought Dr. Marsh had himself written
the criticism of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: So far as anybody
knows, he may have written that chapter.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Whether he did
or not.is, I submit, not germane to the discussion of the question of social security
for Canada. Is not the honourable gentleman
really trying to drag a red herring across the
trail? Whatever views Dr. Marsh or anybody
else may hold about the utility or inutility
of this body, I amn willing to listen to him
if he can give me sound ideas on social

.ny honourable friend's opinion.

Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: I submit that the
gist of what the honourable senator from,
Kingston said in criticism of the Marsh report was that he would. not pay very mucli
attention to Dr. Marsh if lis knowledge of
social security was commensurate with his
knowledge of the Senate; and I agree witb
the honourable senator.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I can only say, as
I said before, that I regret the honourable
senator from Kingston should have seen fit

That about expresses what I thought of Dr'.'
Marsh.

that if ho had begun to look pale, I would
have got out of the way.
My only reason for rising was the somewhat invidious comparison made by my hionourable friend liere (Hon. Mr. Hugessn> as
to whosc opinion hoe would take, that of Sir
William Beveridge or that of the honourable
senator from Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies). If
the honourable gentleman would read, as I do.
about three or four farm weeklies published in
England and Scotland, hoe would got somo notes
on Sir William Beveridge that would make
bim boeeve that gentleman is flot sueb a great
man after aIl. These farm journals are al
against him. and I believe the majority of
farmers of England and Scotland, who lead
the wvorld in farming-. are opposed to the
Beveridge report. Letters and editorials appear every week opposing it, and they are
always careful to point eut that the Beveridge
report bas not been adopted. As a matter
of fact, it is only a report to the British
Huse; yet wc talk bore as though thjs man
had donc a great job and it had been accepted.
If I arn any judge of what these people are
saying now, as I road it in theso farin journals,
it will ho a long time before the report is
adopted in toto, bocause the opinions of the
farming population are entirely against it, and
they are going to have a gond deal of wveight.
My only purpose in taking your time bas
been to say that, se far as I arn concerned.
judging from what I have heard and read
about Sir William Beveridge during the last

valuable.

article published by the Searle Grain Company, and asked that'the Government give
some attention ta it. I promised at that time
that I would make inquiry. In the absence

follows:
It is true that the representatives of the two
Departments of Agriculture~

-have met in committee on two occasions and
discussed their respective agricultural programmes with a view to relating them as much

As f ar as grain production is concerned, the
main understanding developed has been with
respect toinreased production of coarse grains
in Western Canada, with a view to mnaking
surplus quantities avaîlable to the United
States.
Wheat for feed purposes was also considered
and it was understood that, if necessary the
United States department would draw on éJanadian supplies for feed purposes.
With respect to the wheat production policy
as a whole, this was not deait with specifically,
At being recognized that there is provision in
this regard under the Wheat Agreement. The
recent action of the United States Government

REPORT OF COMMITTEE CONCURRED

IN

The Senate proceoded to the consideration
of the sixtlh report of the Standing Committee
on Internal Economy and Contingent Accounts, as follows:
1. Your comnittee have in obedience to the
order of reference of the 21st July, instant,
considered the second report of the Standing
Committee on Debates and Reporting nominating Mr. Georges Langlois to fill temporarily
the vacancy on the reporting staff caused by
the death of Mr. J. Fortier.

be paid at the rate of $10 per week during
the forthcoming recess of Parliament.
All which is respectfully submitted.
Hon. Mr. WHITE moved concurrence in
the report.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable senators, only two or three words. All honourable
members know that I am opposed to the
principle involved in this motion. I do not
know the distinguished gentleman referred
to in the report. To the best of my knowledge, I have never met him; so there is
certainly nothing personal about my stand.
The practice to which I object bas been going
on, it is said, since 1913, long before I ever
dreamt I should be here. If we judge by the
past few years and figure the thing out at
$1,500 a year, it means that $45,000 lias been
spent. For what? To boost the stock of the

money. , It is truc that the comiittee sat for
sixteen minutes yesterday and concurred in
the report that is before us. Personally, I
am against it. I may be in an absolute
minority, but I do not think we should spend
the people's money in this way. I think we
should stand on the merits of the Senate, and
net boost our own stock by hiring, with the
people's money, somebody to give us mention
from finie tu time.
The motion was agreed to.

REPORT

OF THE

PROCEEDINGS

Members of the Senate, Members of the
House of Commons, and the general public
assembled on Parliament Hill, Ottawa, at 12
o'clock noon on Wednesday, August 25, 1943,
to hear an address by Mr. Franklin D.
Roosevelt, President of the U.nited States of
America. The President was introduced by the
Prime Minister, Right Hon. W. L. Mackenzie
King, and thanked by the Speaker of the
Senate, Hon. Thomas Vien, and the Speaker of
the House of Commons, Hon. James Allison
Glen.
Right Hon. W. L. MACKENZIE KING
(Prime Minister): Mr. President, Your Excellency, Your Royal Highness, members of
the Parliament of Canada, ladies and gentlement,-To-day will be for all time a memorable day for Canada. I need not remind
you, Mr. President, how often I have expressed the desire that you might visit
Ottawa during your term of office as President of the United States. We have hoped
that on such a visit you would speak to the
members of the Senate and the House of
Commons, either within or without the walls
of our Houses of Parliament. You know,
too, how frequently Ris Excellency the Governor General and Her Royal Highness the
Princess Alice have expressed the wish that
they might have the honour of a visit from
Mrs. Roosevelt and yourself at some time
during Ris Excellency's term of office as the
representative in Canada of Ris Majesty the
King.
Perhaps I may be allowed also to mention
how greatly, for personal reasons, I have
looked forward to the pleasure of welcoming
to the seat of government and to my own
home one whose friendship, in ever closer
association, I have been privileged to enjoy
over many years. To-day all these hopes and

423

wishes, so warmly cherished by the people of
Canada, by their representatives in Parliament, by His Excellency and Her Royal Highness and by myself, are being happily realized.
On behalf of all Canada I extend to you
to-day, Mr. President, the warmest of welcomes to the capital of our country. I thank
you for having honoured our capital city by
your presence at a time which is without
parallel in the history of human affairs.
The Canadian people will, I know, wish me
to express to you the admiration which they
feel for you and for your great career. We
recognize in you one who has always had a
deep concern for the well-being of his fellowmen. We have long known that your services
to the cause of freedom far exceed limits of
race and bounds of nationality. We honour
you as an undaunted champion of the rights
of free men and a mighty leader of the forces
of freedom in a world at war. We feel, too,
a special affection for a lifelong friend of our
country.
This is the first occasion on which a President of the United States has visited Canada's
capital. It is particularly pleasing to us that
this visit should have its association with your
momentous meeting in the ancient capital of
Canada with the Prime Minister of Great
Britain. Over the past two years your meetings with Mr. Churchill have been the signal
for great events. The conference at Quebec
just concluded will, I am confident, mark a
further advance towards final victory.
The city of Quebec is the birthplace of
Canada. Beneath its cliffs, in 1608, Champlain founded a settlement and established
a seat of government; upon its height is
erected a monument commemorating in a
single shaft the chivalry of Wolfe and Montcalm in the decisive battle of 1759. It is the
city in which, in 1864, the fathers of the Canadian confederation assembled in conference to
fashion the Canada that was to be. We were
indeed delighted when we learned that Quebec
had been selected as the place of meeting
between Mr. Churchill and yourself.
We rejoice, Mr. President, that your visit
to Ottawa comes at a moment when for the
first time in our long history as close neighbours, soldiers of Canada and the United
States have fought side by side. Combined
British, United States and Canadian forces
have just completed the occupation of Sicily
as a first step in the liberation of Europe.
Combined United States and Canadian forces
have just occupied the last Japanese outpost
in the Western Hemisphere.

SENATE
The rapidity with which the American
people gathered their strength, and the
momentum and magnitude of their war effort,
have filled the world with amazement. All
Canada joins in admiration for the efficiency
and heroism of the men of the fighting forces
of the United States. In the south-west
Pacifie, in the Alcutians, in North Africa, in
Sicily, in the skies over every battle-front
and on all the oceans of the world, their
deeds are recording a glorious chapter in the
history of freedom.
In the combined efforts of the military
forces and the peoples of the United States
and the British Empire, joined with those of
the heroie peoples of Russia and China and
of the other United Nations, lies the certainty
of complete victory over the forces of tyranny
which have sought the domination of the
world.
Canada counts it a high privilege to have
the opportunity of drawing into relations of
closer friendship, understanding, and goodwill,
the United States and the nations of the
British Commonwealth. We are firmly convinced that in the continued close association
of the British Commonwealth of Nations and
the United States of America lies the surest
guarantee of international peace, and of the
furtherance of the well-being of mankind
throughoutt the world.
(Translation): Mr. President, once more,
and using tis time the other official language
of our country, I wish to extend to you the
nost cordial welcome on behalf of all Canada.
Mr. FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT (President of the United States): Your Excellency,
Your Royal Ilighness, Mr. Prime Minister
and members of the Parliament, and all my
good friends and neighbours of the Dominion
of Canada,--It was exactly five years ago last
Wednesday that I came to Canada to receive
the high honour of a degree at Queen's University. On that occasion-onc
year before
the 'invasion of Poland, three years before
Pearl Ilarbor-I said:
We in the Amerieas are no longer a faraway continent, to which the eddies of controversies be.cond the seas couli bring no
interest er no harn.
istead. we in the
Americas have beeome a consideration to every
propaganda office and to every general staff
beyond the seas.
The vast amcount of our
resources, the vigour of our commerce. and the
strength of our, men have made us vital factors
in world peace whether wre choose it or not.
We did not choose this war-and that "we"
includes each and every one of the United
Nations. War was violently forced upon us
by criminal aggressors who measure their
tanlards of morality by the extent of the
Riglht

Ion. Mr. MACKENZIE KING.

deatih and the destruction that they can infliet
upon their neighbours.
In this war, Canadians and Americans have
fouglht shoulder to shoulder-as our men and
our women and our children have worked
together and played together in happier times
of peace.
To-day, in devout gratitude, we are celebrating a brilliant victory won by British,
Canadan and American fighting men in Sicily.
To-day. we rejoice also in another event for
wvhich we need not apologize. A year ago
Japan occupied several of the Aleutian islands
on our side of the ocean and made a great
"to-do" about the invasion of the continent
of North America. I regret to say that some
Americans and ,some Canadians wished our
governments to withdraw from the Atlantic
and the Mediterranean campaigns and divert
all our vast strength to the removal of the
Japs from a few rocky specks in the north
Pacific.
To-day, our wiser councils have maintained
our efforts in the Atlantic and the Mediterrancan
iandthe China secs and the southwest Pacifie with ever-growing contributions;
and in the north-west Pacifie a relatively
small campaign has been assisted by the Japs
themselves in the elimination of the last Jap
from Attu and Kiska.' We have been told that
Japs never surrender; their headlong retreat
satisfics

us just as well.

Great councils are being held here on the
free and honoured soil of Canada-councils
which look to the future conduet of this war
and to the years of building a new progress
for mankind.
To these councils Canadians and Americans
alike again welcome that wise and good and
gallant gentleman, the Prime Minister of
Great Britain.
Mr. King. my old friend. mtay I through
you thank the people of Canada for their
hospitality to all of us. Your course and
mine have run so closely and affectionately
during these macy long years that this meeting adds another link to that chain. I have
always felt at home in Canada, and yo, I
ihink. have always felt at home in the United
States.

During the past few days in Quebec, the
combined staffs have been sitting around a
table-which is a good custom-talking things
over, discussing ways and means, in the manner of friends, in the manner of partners, and
may I even say, in the manner of members
of the sane famiilv.

JANUARY 26, 1944
We have talked constructively of our common purpoýses in this war-of our determination to achieve victory in the shortest possible time-of our essential co-operation with
our great and brave figliting Allies.
And we have arrived, harmoniously, at
certain definite conclusions. 0f course, I arn
flot at liberty to disclose just what these conclusions are. But, in due time, we shall communicate the secret information of the Quebec
Conference to Germany, Italy and Japan.
We shaîl communicate this information to
our enemies in the only language their twisted
mmnds seem capable of understanding.
Sometimos I wish that that great master of
intuition, the Nazi leader, could have been
present in spirit at the Quebec ConferenceI arn thoroughly glad lie was not there in
person. If lie and his generals had knuwn
our plans they would have realized that discretion is stili the botter part of valour and
that surrender would pay them botter now
than later.
The ovil characteristie that makes a Nazi
a Nazi is lis utter inability to understand
,and therefore to respect the qualities or the
rights of his fellow-mon. lis only method
of dea]ing with his neiglibour is first to delude
hirn with lies, then to attack him treacherously, then beat him down and step on him,
and thon either kîll hlm or enslave him. And
the same thing is truc of the fanatical militarists of Japan.
Because their own instincts and impulses
are essentially inhuman, our enemies simply
cannot comprehend how it is that decent,
sensible individual human beings manage to
gct along together and live together as neiglibour.s. That is why our enemies are doing
their desperate best to misropresent the purposes and the results of this Quebec Conference. They stili seek to divide and conquer
Allies who refuse ta be divided just as cheerfully as they refuse 'to lie conquered.
Wo spend our energies and our resources
and the very lives of our sons and daughters
because a band of gangsters in the community
of nations declines to recognize the fundamentaIs of decent, human conduct.
We have been forcod to caîl out what we
in the United States would caîl the7 sheriff's
posse to break up the gang in order that
gangsterism may be eliminated in the community of nations.
We are makîng sure-absolutely, irrevocably sure-that this time the lesson is driven
home to them once and for aIl. Yes, we are
going to be rid of outlaws this time.
72542-28

425

Every one of the United Nations believes
that only a real and lasting peace can justify
the sacrifices we are making, and our unanimity gives us confidence in seeking that goal.
It is no secret that at Quebec there was much
talk of the post-war world. That discussion
was doubtless d.uplicated simultaneously in
dozens of nations and hundreds of cities and
among millions of people.
There is a longing in the air. It is flot a
longing to go back to what they cali "the good
old days.' I have distinct reservations as to
how good "the good old days" were. I would
rather believe that we can achieve new and
better days.
Absolute victory in this war will give greater
opportunities for the world because the winning
of the war in itself is proving, cortainly proving
to ahl of us here, that concerted action can
accomplish tliings. Surely we can make strides
toward a grcater freedom from want than the
world lias yet enjoyed. Surely by unanimous
action in driving out the outlaws and keeping
them under licol for ever, we can attain a freedom from fear of violence.
I amn everlastingly angry only at those who
assert vociferously that the four freedoms and
the Atlantic Charter are nonsense because they
are unattainable. If they had lived a century
and a haîf ago they would have sneered and
said that the Declaration of Indopendence was
utter piffle. If they had lived nearly a thousand years ago they would have. laughed uproariously at the ideals of Magna Charta. And if
they lied lived several. thousand years ago tliey
would have derided Moses when lie came from
the mountain witli the Ten Commandments.
We concede that these great teachings are
not perfectly lived up to to-day, and we concode that the good old world cannot arrive at
Utopia overniglit. But I would rather lie a
buder than a wrecker, lioping always that the
structure of lifo is growing-not dying.
May the destroyers who still persist in aur
midst decrease. They, like same of our
enemies. have a long road to travel hefore they
aceept the ethies of humanity.
Some day, in the distant future perhapsbut some day witli certainty-all of them will
remembor with the Master-"T7hou shaît love
thy neiglibour as thysoîf."
(Translation): Mr. Prime Minister, my visit
to the old city of Quebc lias recalled vividly
to my mind that Canada is a nation founded
on a union of two great races. The harmony
of thoir equal partnership is an exemple to ail
mankind-an example everywhere in the world.

the werld. Our hearts and yeurs, 1 am sure,
shared the overwhelming grief cf France,
follow-ing the defeat cf that unbappy country.
We shaîl neyer fcrget that, fer the second time
le the life cf this generatien, yeur country
has genercusly gcne te the assistance cf a
France in mortal danger repeating Pershing's
ucdying werds: "La Fayette, we are here!"
When. with the propcr perspective that cnly

be wiitten. you will stand in the ferefrent
Tion. 'Nr. VIEN.

cf that brilliant grcup cf leaders-with Churchill, Mackenzie King, Stalin, and Chiang
Kai-shek-who have se, nobly served humanity.
May 1 be allewed, Mr. Presideet, te express
the deep satisfaction I feel ini reiteratieg to,
ycu the heart-felt thaeks cf the Canadian
Parliament and people for having henoured
us with yeur presence bere to-day and havieg
cheered us witb ycur very cemforting remarks.
We pray Ged that He may grant yeu His
fax ours in abundance. that He may bless you
and the great Republie whese destinies ycu
guide, until such time as we may aIl glorify
Hum tegether in final victery on the thresheld

Canada bas been afferded the unique privilege

cf a long-standing invitation given by the
Righit Hec. Mackenzie King te cne whc bas
been an intimate friend fer more years than
either cf them xveuld care te say. 1t. is well
sir, that yeu sheuld tax the bcspitality cf your
friends occasienally. and I can state ccnfideetly
that ex-erycce, yeung and eld, in this vast
assembly befere ycu, together witb that great
unscen listeeing audience threugheut the whole

regard whichi is bestcwed w-hen a much-lcx ed
guest heneurs cur home. I hepe I shall net he
misundeî-stecd w'hee 1 say that many Canadians affectienately caîl ycu "cur Prcsident."
Canada will nover ferget the dark and dismal
years cf 1940 and 1941, cor w-ill it ever ferget
that tînparalleled act wben ycu, as President
cf yeur great country, gave that genereus and
screly needcd lend-lease help which aided
Great Britain te withstand and repel a cenquering andi then a seemiegly invincible foe.
National as well as buman memories, with

indelible blet ce cur escutcheen if at acy

It is therefere w-ith real pleasure we belicld
in ouir capital -,eur un-mistakable figure and
listen te that; beld and confident veice se familiar te our ears. And what makes this da'y
se memorable te us is the kncw-ledge that it
is te Canada particularly yen speak. We bave
shared with the werld in these intimate secalled fireside chats wbich yeu have addressed

JANUARY 26, 1944

pressive and enduring, the product of a gifted
and balanced judgment, made their striking appeal because they are based on the
-ternal verities witbout which, as we believe,
nothing is. To-day, sir, your speech is an outstanding example of those utterances which
have endeared you to our people and caused
dismnaying fear to our foes.
The road stili may be long and dreary and
the end not yet in sight, but the issue is no
longer in doubt; and upon you, sir, the- trernendous responsibilities of victory will be part of
your destiny. You will require the assistance of
all who, like you, believe that gond is the
final goal of ill. We are confident that in
Canada you will find that co-operation in peace
which we bave shared in war. AlI we desire
is the riglit to exercise the four freedoms upon
wbich. an enduring demnocracy must be based.
If I may say s0, your own phrase-now a
household word-l'the gond neighbour," definitely emnbodies these principles. We invoke
the blessing of Almighty ýGod upon you. May
He strengthen and sustain you until victory
is achieved and peace and bappiness restorcd
to, this war-torn world.
Mr. President, in the namne of and for Canada I thank you most cordially and sincerely
for your presence with us to-dýay, and for your
noble address.

The Honourable Thibaudeau Rinfret, Chief
Justice of Canada, having corne and being
seated at the foot of the Tbrone; and the
Huse of Commons having been sumnmoned,
and being corne with their Speaker, the
Honourable the Speaker of the Senate
informed members of the Senate and of tbe

Governor General had been pleased to cause
letters patent to, be issued under bis sign
manual and signet constituting the bonourable
Thibaudeau Rinfret bis Deputy to do in lis
Excellency's namne all acts on his part necessary to be done during His Excellency's

the Deputy Governor
The Honourable
General was then pleased to close the Fourth
Session of the Nineteenth Parliamnent of the
Dominion of Canada witb the following
speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the bouse of Commons:
When the present session opened a year ago,
the initiative taken by the United Nations gave
72542-281

427

promise of impressive victories. During the
year, that promise ha& been fulfilled.
The Axis forces in North Africa have been
destroyed. The European mainlandi has been
invaded. Italy bas surrendered unconditionally.
On the long Russian front the armies of the
Soviet Union have relentlessly driven baek the
Nazi invaders. The Japanese advance in the
south-west Pacifie bas been definitely halted.
The invasion tbreatsý to Australia and New
Zealand have been removed. On the mainland
of Asia, the Chinese armies and people have
continuedý tb hold back the Japanese tide. The
destructive enemy Pubmarine campaign in the
north Atlantic bas been brought under control.
On both aides of the globe the United Nations
have maintained supremacy at sea and gained
,ascendancy in the air.
To-day, in Italy, German forces, dispite
stubborn resistance, are being compelled to
yield ground. In Russia, great German armies
face unparalleled destruction. In south-eastern
Europe, there is growing unrest among Germany's satellite states. In the occupied countries, the people await the signal for open
resistance. An ever-increasing aerial bombardment is destroying the war potential of Germany. It is bringing the war home to the
German people.
In the campaign against the U-boats, Canada's
Navy bas had a prominent part. It bas belped
to maintain, the bridge of ships across the
Atlantic on whieh offensive action in Europe
depends. During -the year, all Allied naval
'forces in the north-west Atlantic were placed
under a Canadian Commander-in-Chief. Units
of the Canadian Army were among tbe first to
land .in Sicily, and again on the mainland. of
I-taly. In b-ard battles won and- hundreds of
miles of difficult ground taken, our soldiers bave
bad their full share in the accomplishments of
this important campaign. Tbey bave made a
record unexcelled by fighting men.
On the
opposite aide of the world, Canadian forces
joined witb those of the United States in the
occupation of Kiska in the Alentians. In the
attacks upon the Uýboats, in the aerial assaults
against Germany and occupied Europe, and over
battlefronts around the globe, increasing numbers of Canadian airmen continued to take a
telling part.
During the autumn, the Minister of National
Defence visited Canada's overseas forces in
Britain and in Italy. The transport of mail
to the forces overseas bas been greatly improved by the establishment of air mail services.
Provision of aid to our Allies continued to be
a major factor in Canada's war effort. War
supplies are beîng sent to Russia, to China, to
Fr ech forces in Africa, as well as to the
United Kingdom and other nations of the
Commonwealth. They are supplied under the
mutual aid legislation. enacted during the
present session, and are allocated by the Mutual
Aid Board in accordance with strategie needi.
A considerable portion of Canada'r, mutual aid
bas been transported across the seas in Canadian built ships, manned by Canadian crews.
For more than a year, Canada bas been
sending wheat to Greece every month to aid in
relieving the starving population. To assist in
relieving famine conditions in Bengal, the Government bas also taken stepa to ship Canadian
wheat to India.
