OFFICIAL REPORT

THE SENATE
Tuesday, January 30, 1951
The Parliament of Canada having been
summoned by Proclamation of the Governor
General to meet this day for the dispatch of
business.
The Senate met at 2.30 p.m., the Speaker in
the Chair.
OPENING OF THE SESSION
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that he had received a communication from
the Governor General's Secretary informing
him that His Excellency the Governor General
would arrive at the Main Entrance of the
Houses of Parliament at 3 p.m., and, when it
had been signified that all was in readiness,
would proceed to the Senate Chamber to open
the Fourth Session of the Twenty-first Parliament of Canada.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
At three o'clock His Excellency the Governor General proceeded to the Senate Chamber
and took his seat upon the Throne. His
Excellency was pleased to command the
attendance of the House of Commons, and that
House being come, with their Speaker, His
Excellency was pleased to open the Fourth
Session of the Twenty-first Parliament of
Canada with the following speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
Since
of last
oration
tion of
United
danger

you met In special session in the autumn
year, there has been a further deteriin the international situation. The intervenChinese forces in active opposition te the
Nations forces in Korea has increased the
of a general conflagration.

So far the efforts te achieve a peaceful settlement
in the Far East have not succeeded. While aggression cannot be condoned and will continue te be
resisted, it is the view of my ministers that the door
te negotiation at any time a cessation of hostilities
in Korea can be arranged must be kept open.
The increased menace In the Far East reinforces
the mounting evidence that Communist Imperialism
is determined te dominate the world by force or
the fear of force, and that the only hope of maintaining peace with freedom lies In the rapid increase
of the combined strength of the free nations. It Is

equally important that the free nations should make
it abundantly clear that they have no aggressive
designs and that they are resolved ta aid in constructive endeavours ta improve the standards of
human welfare in under-developed countries.
My ministers have endeavoured ta uphold these
International objectives in the deliberations of the
United Nations, at the recent meeting of the prime
ministers of the Commonwealth countries, and in
our diplomatic relations with aIl nations and governments.
Units of the Royal Canadian Navy and the Royal
Canadian Air Force have shared from the outset in
the United Nations action in Korea. One battalion
of the Canadian Army Special Force is now in
Korea, and the rest of the force is at Fort Lewis,
Washington, where it is available for service in
Korea or for other employment in discharge of our
international obligations.
Progress has been made in the organization of
an integrated force in Europe under the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization. The Supreme Commander, General Eisenhower, bas recently visited
Canada ta consult with the Government and the
Chiefs of Staff. You will be asked early in the
session ta authorize Canadian participation in this
integrated force as part of our program for national
defence and security. You will also be asked ta
approve substantially increased expenditures for
defence.
The urgent need of the St. Lawrence seaway and
power project in relation ta the security of this
continent is becoming Increasingly apparent. It is
the view of my ministers that the Canadian authorities should be kept in a position ta co-operate
promptly in undertaking construction of the project
once affirmative action has been taken by the
appropriate United States authorities.
Your approval will be sought for an appropriate
Canadian participation in the Colombo plan and In
technical assistance te under-developed areas.
The policies of the government are designed te
prevent war, but the dangers of the international
situation and the magnitude of the defence effort
required as a deterrent have, in the opinion of my
ministers, created an emergency situation. You will
accordingly be asked te approve legislation vesting
In the Governor in Council additional powers ta
ensure adequate defence preparations te meet the
present emergency and to prevent economic dislocation resulting from defence preparations.
You will also be asked ta approve a bill te establish a Department of Defence Production te act as
a procurement agency for the defence forces of
Canada and also for such defence requirements of
our allies as may be met from Canadian production.
Amendments te legislation relating te the armed
forces will also be submitted for your approval.
Legislation will be submitted respecting the application of the Benefits of the Veterans Charter te
members of the Special Force. Amendments will
be introduced te legislation concerning pensions for
veterans and their dependents ta relleve difficulties
being experienced by certain groups of pensioners
provided for thereunder.

SENATE
Appropriate amendments to the Canadian Citizenship Act will be introduced te prevent the retention
of Canadian citizenship by persans wha have renounced their allegiance or shown by their conduct
that they are nlot loyal to Canada.
The high level of employment and production
within our country give our people increased capacity to meet the demands of national and International security.
The spirit of unity sa hsppily reflected in the
conferences between the federal and provincial
goverrnents is further evidence of our ability to
make an effective national response ta the emergency.
Proposais were laid before the provincial goverfiments for new tax agreements and for a contributory old age pension pragram along the lines
recommended by the joint committee at the last
regular session.
The provincial governents are at present giving
consideration to these proposais and to proposaIs
for constitutional amendments which may require
to be submitted to you before the close of the
present session.
You will be asked to consider measures respecting
federal granta to municipalities in lieu of taxation
of Crown property, the abolition of the requirement
of the fiat in the case of petitions of right, and
the bequests of Laurier House and Kingsmere.«
You will aiso be asked to consider a complete
revision of the Indian Act and the Consolidated
Revenue and Audit Act.
Other measures to be introduced will Include
amendments to the Immigration Act, the Post Office
Act, the Central Mortgage and Housing Act, the
Gold Mining Assistance Act and the Customs Act.
It is anticipated that the reports of the Royal
Commissions on Transportation and on National
Development in the Arts. Letters and Sciences will
become available during the course of the session.
Members of the House of Comnmons:
You will be asked to make provision for national
defence and the meeting of aur obligations under
the United Nations Charter and the North Atlantic
Treaty. as well as for all essential services.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
May Divine Providence bless your deliberations
and give to our people the fortitude and patience
to sustain the trials of these troubled times.

The House of Commons withdrew.
His Excellency the Governor General was
pleased to retire.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR CONSIDERATION

Hon. Mr. Hugessen (for Hon. Mr. Robertson)
moved that the Speech of His Excellency the
Governor General be taken into consideration
on Thursday next.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I think
the government has been wise to introduce
this motion now. Frequently, in the past,
several days have elapsed at the beginning of
a session before the Senate has done any business, with the resuit that at the end of the
session it has been forced to rush through a
great deal of work.
I arn heartily in accord with the government's motion, and I hope that this is indicative of the course to be followed in the conduct
of our business throughout the session, and
that when we have no work to do we shall
adjourn and go to our homes until suých time
as the House of Commons catches up with us.
We shall do our job so that there can be no
protestations against our conduct.
The motion was agreed to.

REPORT 0F COMMITTEE 0F SELECTION
Hon. A. K. Hugessen presented and moved
concurrence in the following report:
The Commjittee of Selection appointed to nominate senators to serve on. the several Standing
Committees for the present session, have the honour
ta report herewith the following list of senators
selected by them to serve on the Standing Commitee on Divorce, namely:
The Honourable Senators Aseltine, Baird, Campbell. Euler, Farris, Fogo, Gershaw. Golding, Horner.
Howard, Howden, Hugessen. Kinley. Roebuck, Ross
and Stevenson. (16)

Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
before the motion is put, I should like to
make one or two brief comments about the
work of the Divorce Committee. At the
meeting of the Committee of Selection this
morning it was unanimously agreed that the
Divorce Committee should endeavour to hear
ail its cases before the Easter recess. I arn
heartily in agreement with this policy and,
as a member of the Committee of Selection,
I would warn ail lawyers who appear before
our Divorce Committee, particularly those
from Quebec, and perhaps Newfoundland,
that they had better have their cases ready to
be heard before the Easter adjournment.
These lawyers are given ample notice to
enable them. to prepare their cases, and if
they are not ready to proceed before Easter,
and the temperament of the Divorce Committee should happen to be the same as that
of the Committee of Selection, these cases
will flot be heard this year. I understand
that the Divorce Committee is to sit four days
next week and five days the following week in
an attempt to clear Up its work at an early
date, so that its members will be free to
attend the meetings of our other Standing
Committees.
After much persuasion by the honourable
leader of this house (Hon. Mr. Robertson) and
mysell, the honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)-my deputy and
associate in this ýchamber, whose services I
greatly appreciate-has consented to serve
for a further period on the Divorce Commlttee. However, his decision was reached
upon the definite understanding that he would
flot be asked to perform any duties in connection with the Divorce Comm ittee after

the Easter recess. I know also that the other
members of the Divorce Committee feel as he
does.
1 have neyer found anyone in this house
who wishes to see the granting of divorces
by parliament continued, but as yet no other
method has been found. The lengthy sittings
in the provincial courts across Canada make
it reasonably easy to have a divorce hearing
postponed for two or three weeks because
of the absence of important witnesses, and so
on, but the situation here is not the same,
especially as honourable senators are performing a duty which they do flot find
pleasant.
Opinion across Canada, and
especially in this chamber, is that divorce by
the Senate is an imposition on the Parliament
of Canada.
Again 1 want to voice the view that lawyers who have cases to corne before the
Divorce Committee of the Senate, ard ultimately before the Housýe of Commons, had
better be ready to proceed between now and
Easter; otherwise, as I gathered from the
temper of this morning's meeting, they wil]
not be heard till next session.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: Can the honourable leader
opposite state whether the Divorce Committee will be able to expedite matters by
sitting in two or three sections simultaneously?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I can answer that question,
because we had it before us this morning.
Theoretically there couid be a section of the
committee for every three members, but the
committee clerks inform us that our present
equipment, reporters and other staff, are
sufficient to take care of only two sections. I
believe that already there are about 300
applications in; and if the commit-tee sits in
two sections, five days a week, we ought to
be able to take care of that number between
now and the Easter adjournment. As will
be seen from the notices on the back of the
Order Paper, the committee is getting down
to work right away, with its first hearings set
for Tuesday next and others following on
Wednesday, Thursday and Fridlay. I have no
doubt that this chamber would authorize further appointments to the staff if it were
thought necessary for the committee to spllt
into more than two sections; but the present
view is that two sections can handle the
business.
The motion was agreed to.

part of February. I hope to again provide
facilities, similar in form if not in substance
to those afforded last year, for the closest
possible scrutiny of the Estimates. It has
been suggested to me that the Senate might
well consider asking the Finance Committee
to inquire into and report upon the Senate's
own estimates. Another suggestion is that
the committee might also be asked to consider the present and contemplated distribution in Canada, from a geographical standpoint, of production for defence.
I am presenting these proposals to the
house at this time for the information of
honourable members. No doubt individual
senators will have constructive proposals of
their own.
Hon. Mr. Farris: May I ask the honourable
leader whether it is the intention of his
colleagues, in accordance with the amendment of our rules, to introduce their bills
in this house early in the session so that we
may have some government work to deal
with?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I cannot say that I
have any specific information on that point.
Last year, after the house closed, I issued a
statement on the very considerable volume
of business initiated in the Senate, the
extent of which astounded me. There are,
of course, measures of the nature of money
bills which cannot be introduced here, but I
believe that last year all the measures which
could be initiated in the Senate, with but
one or two exceptions, were actually introduced here. I have consistently urged this
course upon my colleagues in the government, and they have invariably expressed
willingness to follow it. Although at this
moment I have no specific knowledge, I am
sure that the practice will be continued.

Business, however, claimed no monopoly of
his energies. His association with the Canadian Militia was long and distinguished. A
veteran of the First World War, he served
ten years with the old 6th Fusiliers, which
became the First Grenadier Guards of Canada,
and commanded the 13th Scottish Light Dragoons. During the war of 1914 he was active
in raising the 245th Service Battalion, and
as its commanding officer took it overseas.
Senator Ballantyne entered political life in
1917, after having served as a harbour -commissioner for Montreal for six years, and as
Mayor of Westmount. He was appointed
Minister of Marine and Fisheries and Minister of the Naval Service in 1917, and was
reappointed to the same portfolio in the
Meighen Ministry of 1920. Our late esteemed
colleague was called to the Senate in February, 1932, and ten years later was named
leader of the opposition, in which capacity he
served until 1945.
Senator Ballantyne is survived by his
widow, the former Ethel Maud Trenholme
of Montreal, and by three sons.
I need hardly remind honourable members who enjoyed his friendship, that in the
passing of Senator Ballantyne, Canada has
lost one of its most distinguished public men.
His wide knowledge of business and finance
and his long experience in public life made
his counsel and advice of the greatest value.
His comments on matters under discussion
were always to the point and invariably
received the closest attention.
To his wide knowledge of public affairs
were added an essential fairness of viewpoint
and a kindly manner. I can personally bear
testimony to the many courtesies he extended
to me when I was first appointed to the
Senate; and I extend the deepest sympathy
to the members of his family who, together

urged him then to remain longer, but he said
that the state of his health would not permit
him to do so.
We of this house will miss him very much.
His business knowledge was valuable, and
his experience in connection with the first
world war was useful to parliament during
the second world conflict. One whose membership of this chamber has extended over
eighteen years has given a long period of
service-much longer than the average-and
the gap occasioned by his passing is probably
more evident as our ranks grow less and less.
I very, very sincerely regret the death of
Charlie Ballantyne, and I join with the leader
of the government in expressing sincere
sympathy to his wife and family.
Hon. J. H. King: Honourable senators, I
feel it incumbent upon me to associate myself
with the words of the two leaders with respect
to the passing of Senator Ballantyne. Following our friendly association as senators,
it fell to our lot in 1942 to assume the leadership of the respective parties in this chamber,
and thus our association was continued in
the control and work of the Senate.
Senator Ballantyne was thoroughly conversant with the public life of this country.
He had a keen, well-trained business mind
and was a man of great stature in the parliamentary circles of Canada. My good fortune in being associated with him in the
work of this house will ever remain in my
memory.
I desire to express to Mrs. Ballantyne and
the other members of his family my personal
regret and my sincere grief at his passing.
Hon. Vincent Dupuis (Translation): Honourable senators, may I add a word of tribute
to the memory of the great man who has
passed away, Honourable Senator Ballantyne.
I was deeply grieved at the news of the
death of this worthy representative of my
province. I had a personal reason for thinking
highly of him. In 1919, I had the privilege
of being one of the law students who represented McGill Univerity at the funeral of Sir
Wilfrid Laurier. Mr. Edward Beatty, then
president of the Canadian Pacific, who was
aware of my limited means ordered a pass
issued for my trip from Montreal to Ottawa
and, upon our arrival here, the Honourable
Mr. Ballantyne, who was then a minister of
the Crown, met us at the station and very
kindly looked after all our needs during our
stay in Ottawa.

Ten years later, when I became a member
of parliament, I had occasion to know him
intimately, and it was with pleasure and a
sense of gratitude that I used to call him my
benefactor.
In my opinion, the outstanding trait of our
departed friend was his constant care to see
that our fellow-citizens of other provinces
should get better acquainted with the population of the province of Quebec. It may well
be said of him that he was one of our most
active promoters of mutual understanding
between racial groups.
I, therefore, consider it a sacred duty to
add my humble tribute to that of my colleagues, and to offer to the bereaved family
my most sincere sympathy.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I think I should add just one word to what has
fallen from the lips of a number of honourable senators this afternoon about the death
of Senator Ballantyne, more particularly
because I come from Montreal, a city which
he adorned for so many years and in which
he was one of our commercial and industrial
leaders. He made a great position for himself in the commercial life of that city before
he ever entered the political sphere.
The honourable leaders of this house were
quite right when they referred to Senator
Ballantyne's great and profound sense of
duty. I think it was that sense of duty which
induced him to enter the political life of
Canada at an age when he had already established himself in other activities. I think,
too, it was that sense of duty which carried
him through the political era in which he
was a Minister of the Crown. I am sure that
his name will always be associated with the
beginnings of our Canadian navy and our
Canadian merchant marine.
Honourable
senators will recall how vitally interested our
late colleague was whenever any question of
the navy or the merchant marine came up in
this house in recent years. He never failed
to have a word to say on these matters, and
I think he would really prefer to be remembered in this house and in the other house of
parliament, and by the people of Canada, as
one of the first to have an intimate connection with and a great deal to do with the
development of our Canadian navy and our
Canadian merchant marine.
I join with my honourable colleagues in
expressing to his widow and to his sons our
profound regret at his death.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

the petitioner less printing and translation costs.
The motion was agreed to.

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I have
some big news. It is not as dark as some of
the news that we get these days. The big
news of the day in Manitoba is of the finding
of oil at Virden. It is the real thing, evidently
the highest grade of oil so far found in
Canada. The single drawback is that at
present the production is only about 72 barrels
per day.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
His Excellency the Governor General's speech
at the opening of the Fourth Session of the
Twenty-First Parliament of Canada.
Hon. J. Wesley Stambaugh moved:
That the following Address be presented te His
Excellency the Governor General of Canada:
To His Excellency Field Marshal The Right Honourable Viscount Alexander of Tunis, Knight of the
Most Noble Order of the Garter, Knight Grand
Cross of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath,
Knight Grand Cross of the Most Distinguished Order
of Saint Michael and Saint George, Companion of
the Most Exalted Order of the Star of India, Companion of the Distinguished Service Order, upon
whom has been conferred the Decoration of the
Military Cross, one of His Majesty's Aides-de-Camp
General, Governor General and Commander-inChief in and over Canada.
May it Please Your Excellency:
We, His Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects,
the Senate of Canada, in parliament assembled, beg
leave to offer our humble thanks te Your Excellency
for the gracious speech which Your Excellency has
addressed te both houses of parliament.

He said: Honourable senators, I wish at
once to express appreciation of the speech
delivered in this chamber on Tuesday by His
Excellency the Governor General. The extension for Lord Alexander of the normal term
of his office has given the greatest satisfaction

SENATE
to Canadians in all walks of life and in every
part of the nation. It is a unique tribute to
a unique man and leader.
The honour conferred on me of moving the
Address is one that I feel very deeply. I
realize, of course, that it is, above all, a
recognition of the steadily growing importance
of Alberta in the Canadian picture. The fact
that George Prudham, of Edmonton, has
recently been appointed a member of the
Canadian Government as Minister of Mines
and Technical Surveys is recognition of a
man of proven practical worth and ability.
It is also a testimony of the increasing
influence of the province that he represents
in the cabinet.
Mr. Prudham succeeds another Albertan
who enjoys high esteem in this chamber and
amongst Canadians generally. I refer to he
Honourable James A. MacKinnon.
Honourable senators we live in a most
critical time. Statement on statement in the
Speech from the Throne points to the gravity
of the international situation. The effect of
the crisis on the Canadian economy and mode
of life is evident in many of its references. I
want to say at this time that the seriousness
of the world outlook is not only serving to
strengthen Canada's national unity, but is
increasing the determination of Canadians to
do their full and proper share first to save
the peace, and failing that, to defend freedom
wherever it is threatened.
By its actions in Korea the United Nations
has shown that it does not intend to tolerate
aggression. We in Canada are proud that
elements of all three branches of our armed
forces have been providing assistance to the
cause of the United Nations in Korea.
At the close of the Second World War there
seemed to exist among the victorious nations
a sincere desire to co-operate in times of
peace as they had in times of war. This hope
was doomed to failure because there was no
substantial co-operation from the government
of the Soviet Union. We, therefore, find ourselves in a very different world today than
that for which we hoped in 1945.
Our Prime Minister has recently returned
from a visit to London and to Paris, where
he met with various leaders of the Commonwealth and members of the French government. That trip emphasized to us the importance of two of our international ties. The
visit to France showed the cordial relationship and traditional friendship that exists
between that country and ours; the conference at London revealed the strength of
the Commonwealth.
Canada has taken a firm stand in the North
Atlantic Treaty organization. We in the
western world believe in freedom of thought

and expression, and in freedom of religion.
This organization was formed to protect
these freedoms and our right to live our own
lives in our own way.
It is true that Canada, like other nations
which have an earnest desire for peace, is
being obliged to devote an increasing proportion of her resources to provide for her
own national security. In this regard our
Prime Minister has said:
. . . because the risk bas become greater, the
premium on our national insurance policy bas become more costly. We are providing that insurance
by building up our strength in co-operation with
other countries that also want peace in the hope
that our strength and resolution will discourage the
Communists from unleashing a third world war.

In the Speech from the Throne the government announced that there are to be substantially increased expenditures for defence
purposes. Such a defence programme is part
of our share in the partnership of the North
Atlantic Treaty organization. We heartily
approve of the appointment of General
Eisenhower as Supreme Commander.
The Speech from the Throne has made it
clear that Canada intends to fulfil her obligations in the world. I rejoice in our good
relationship with the United States; our
alliance with that country and with Great
Britain is, we feel, vital to our future.
I should now like to speak of matters
closer to home. In 1905, when I went to
Alberta, the eastern part of the province
was a vast rolling prairie, a waving sea of
grass. As one travelled westward one came
first to the bush land, then to the forests and
the mountains.
Generally speaking the Rocky Mountains
form the boundary line between Alberta and
British Columbia. To give a fair picture of
Alberta as it was in those days, I may say
that, looked at from about the centre of the
province,

to the

south

practically

all

the

land would have been seen as rolling prairie;
to the east, prairie; to the north, bush land,
and to the west, forest and mountain.
At the western side of Alberta, situated in
the Rocky Mountains, are the finest parks in
existence. I refer to the Jasper, Banff and
Waterton Parks, which extend north and
south over three hundred miles. A magnificent highway, running practically north and
south, traverses the centre of Jasper and
Banff Parks. It is, I suppose, one of the
world's greatest scenic highways: I hope all
of you will travel over it one of these days.
At every hill and around every curve you will
find something new, beautiful and interesting. About the centre of the Jasper-Banff
Park the highway crosses the height of land,
and there is situate the Columbia icefield.
This glacier covers an area of over fifty

FEBRUARY 1, 1951
square miles. It is the source of three great
rivers flowing into three different oceans;
the Columbia flows into the Pacific; the Athabaska empties into the Mackenzie, which
flows into the Arctic; and the Saskatchewan
flows into Hudson Bay and then into the
Atlantic. In the summer time, at one point,
a little distance from the highway, you can
divert with your hand the waters from the
Atlantic to the Arctic. It is, I think, the only
place in the world where a diversion of this
kind would be possible. It is a beautiful
spot. The height of land is somewhere between seven and eight thousand feet: on the
one side is the Columbia icefield, the source
of the Athabaska River; on the other side,
are mountains and valleys. The rivers and
lakes teem with fish. Honourable senators
who like to fish may be interested to know
that from a fishing point of view we have
probably the nearest thing to virgin waters
of any part of the world. I might mention a
little experience of my own. Two years ago
I went into the Athabaska Forest Reserve
and followed for about eighty miles the old
road which was built by the Imperial Oil
Company when they were drilling in that
district. We were able to travel the road in
a car. I went back about ten miles from this
old road to the stream and followed it to the
road, fishing as I went. Within a short time
I had my creel full; and let me tell you that
it does not need many of the fish you catch
up there to fill your creel. Go back into the
type of stream where the water rushes down
possibly for half a mile, white water all the
way, and catch fish in one of those deep
pools where the big fellows lurk.
Hon. Mr. King: The honourable senator
should tell us the name of that stream.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: It is .called the
Muskeg River.
Hon. Mr. Grant: And what is the name of
the fish?
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: Trout.
Mr. Grant: And I suppose that some are
as big as whales?
Some Hon. Members: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: There is the Dolly
Varden trout, but the particular fish that I
am fond of are the Rainbow trout, and these
are what I am talking about. I want to give
you a little warning that if you get into
one of these pools where the big fellows
lurk, before you cast your fiy you had better
brace yourself. The water is very cold and
I would not want you to be hauled in.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: What about hiding
behind a tree with your rod and reel?

Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: You might try that.
You can have a lot of fun, and just so you
will not fill your creel too full, I suggest
that you throw back anything you catch
that's under twenty inches long, and give it
a chance to grow.
Hon. Mr. Euler: This is quite a fish story
all right.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: Alberta is rich in
natural resources with 75 million acres of
agricultural land, part of which is open
prairie and part bushland. There are almost
100 million acres of forest land in Alberta,
of which possibly one-quarter is fairly good
for agricultural purposes.
I live at Bruce which is situated on the
main line of the Canadian National Railways
about 75 miles south-east of Edmontonabout the centre of the province from north
to south. The provincial constituency, as well
as the hamlet, carries the name of Bruce. I
understand that there is a county bearing
that name in Ontario.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: It seems that a good
many people from Bruce County in Ontario
have emigrated to Alberta and other western
provinces. As a matter of fact, so many people
seem to have left Bruce County, Ontario,
that I wonder whether anyone is still left
there. This is certainly not the situation in
Bruce, Alberta, because nobody wants to
leave there. The few that have left returned
as soon as they could.
The Bruce district of Alberta is a mixed
farming area located on the western edge of
the prairie. When I first -arrived in the district
in the spring of 1906, the land was about 25
per cent bush and 75 per cent prairie. In the
north and west these conditions gradually
change, the percentage of prairie land
decreasing and the bush land increasing.
As an illustration of the progress made in
that part of Canada, I may say that the first
trip I made from Edmonton to my Bruce
homestead was in a covered wagon hauled
by oxen. This journey took five full days.
Today, it is not unusual for me to cover the
same distance by automobile in two hours.
As another indication of the rapid advances
made in the same area, I may say that I
began farming operations by using four oxen
and a walking plow, and I was capable of
breaking about one acre per day. Now I farm
with a tractor, pulling five plows, and I have
turned over fifty acres in a single day.
The hamlet of Bruce is just on the western
edge of the Viking gas field, which has
supplied the city of Edmonton with natural
gas for over thirty years.

SENATE
A considerable number of the members of
the Canadian army's special force were
recruited in Alberta, and trained at Wainwright, not far from Bruce. That portion of
the Special Force now serving in Korea
is led by Lieut.-Colonel Stone, a former
Commander of the Loyal Edmonton Regiment.
It is also an interesting fact that many of
our prairie boys are serving with the Canadian Navy.
While Alberta bas a population of less
than a million people it produces a very large
percentage of what might be called the new
wealth of Canada. There are over 200 coal
mines operating in Alberta with an annual
production of approximately 9 million tons,
or about half of the total Canadian coal
production.
Incidentally, while travelling
about fifty miles south of Edson in the
Brazeau branch I was amazed to be shown a
seam of coal which ran 300 feet deep. I had
never imagined that such a large seam of coal
would exist in the world, but apparently this
huge pocket was created at the time of the
great upheaval which formed the Rocky
Mountains. It is several hundred yards long,
about 100 yards wide, and over 300 feet
thick. The rock which had completely covered
this coal seam had been blown away from the
top and face of it, and huge power shovels
were loading the coal on to trucks, for haulage
to the railroads. I understand that there are
many other large coal seams to be found in
Alberta and in parts of British Columbia,
particularly along the Peace River and Hudson Hope, and up around Finlay Forks. It is
officially estimated that there are 48,000
million tons of mineable coal in the province.
This represents more than half of all Canada's
coal reserves.
At the present time Alberta has over twenty
natural gas fields, and there are about forty
other places in the province where gas has
been discovered. Recent work carried out by
Doctor G. S. Hume and other officials of the
Department of Mines and Technical Surveys,
indicates that the total proven and probable
natural gas reserves in Alberta are close to 7
trillion cubic feet.
I suppose everyone is interested in oil. I
notice that the honourable leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Haig) has mentioned the discovery
of oil in Manitoba. Well, in Alberta we
would hardly bother with a well that did
not produce more than seventy barrels a day,
so I am going to tell you a little about our
oil wells in Alberta.
In the last few years my province has
become the Texas of Canada. As of January
1, 1951, there were approximately 2,000 wells
producing crude oil in commercial quantities
in Alberta. Their actual production is 100,000
barrels of crude oil per day, and it is estimated

that the known oil reserves in the province
are at least one and a half billion barrels.
This figure does not include the Athabaska
tar sands, about which I shall also have
something to say.
The potential production in the province is
throttled down to less than one-half of its
capacity because of the lack of refining
facilities. For instance, in the Golden Spike
field adjoining Edmonton there is one well
capable of producing 12,000 barrels in a
single day. Two years ago a well in the Leduc
field known as "Atlantic No. 3" blew wild and
produced as much as 14,000 barrels in a day,
and at present the Golden Spike field is shut
down.
Hon. Mr. Howden: You can buy gas much
cheaper there, I suppose?
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: It is a little cheaper
than it is here in Ontario, but not nearly as
cheap as we should like to have it. A considerable portion of the price we pay for gas
in Alberta is made up of the tax levied by the
provincial government. The Schoepp Well,
to which I have referred, has a pay thickness
of 600 feet. Oil production in Alberta in 1950
totalled nearly 28 million barrels, and last
week 22 new wells were brought into production. The producing depths in the oil fields
range from about 3,000 feet at Redwater to
over 9,000 feet in the Turner Valley.
By means of the newly-built pipeline from
Edmonton to the head of the lakes, when
navigation opens tankers will carry oil to
Sarnia. In this way it will easily be possible
for Alberta oil production to keep Sarnia
refineries operating at capacity. I might say
that at the present time, besides having three
refineries at Edmonton and one at Calgary,
Alberta is keeping Winnipeg and Regina
refineries supplied with crude oil as well.
Enormous as these Alberta oil resources
are, there is an even greater source in the
fabulous oil sands of the McMurray region.
It is estimated that this area covers about
5,000 square miles. The visible field extends
from McMurray 80 miles north along the
Athabaska river to a distance of 30 miles on
each side of the river. S. M. Blair, a
petroleum expert, has estimated in a recent
report that these tar sands contain over 200
billion barrels of petroleum. These sands
represent the greatest single known deposit
of petroleum. In fact, the deposit is far
greater than the total of all other known
reserves in the world.
The federal government has spent several
million dollars in experimenting on a practical method of extracting this oil from the
sands. The experiments were carried on
chiefly by the National Research Council and

FEBRUARY 1, 1951
the Department of Mines and Technical Surveys, and the results have been turned over
by the federal government to the provincial
authorities.
I do not intend at this time to catalogue
fully all of Alberta's wealth of natural
resources. I think I should mention, however, the province's vast forest resources, of
which the greater proportion is as yet undeveloped. The principal tree species found in
the province, in order of their present commercial importance, are spruce, lodgepole
pine, Douglas fir, balsam fir, white birch and
tamarack. The chief products of these forest
resources are lumber, pulpwood, railway ties,
mine props and fence posts. The annual production of lumber alone in the province is
nearly 400 million board feet.
A great part of these Alberta forests is
situated on the east slope of the Rocky
mountains. This east slope is particularly
important, because it forms the watershed
of rivers that are vital to Canada as a whole
and especially to the ,prairie provinces. The
federal government has recognized this fact
in the establishment of the Eastern Rockies
Forest Conservation Board and the allotment
of $6 million of federal funds to aid conservation measures in the area.
Notwithstanding the other great resources
and industries that I have mentioned, farming is still the most important industry in
the province. In 1950 Alberta farmers produced over 30 million pounds of butter and
over three million pounds of cheese. And
in order to help sweeten and preserve this
a bit, Alberta produces each year about
80 million pounds of sugar, as well as more
than half a million pounds of salt. About
one-quarter of all the grain grown in Canada
comes from Alberta.
The farming industry is not in as prosperous a condition as I should like to see it.
The floor prices under cheese, butter and
eggs have helped the dairy industry to a
certain extent, but these prices are fixed
just barely at the cost of production. It has
been extremely difficult to get competent
help in this industry.
The producers of grain have had a very
difficult year. It was a cold, backward spring.
A considerable part of Alberta was too dry,
and in August we had a severe frost that
reduced both the quality and the quantity
of the grain. To add to these troubles, Alberta
had a wet fall, and a large portion of the
grain which was threshed was low grade,
tough or damp. We had an early snow, and
a considerable portion of the grain north
of Red Deer is still unthreshed.
I am pleased to note that the government
recently announced an interim payment on

both wheat and coarse grains of the 1950
crop. I am glad to see that the government
has recognized the plight of the farmer in
this way.
I should like at this time to urge the government to close out the five-year pool at the
earliest possible momentHon. Hr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: How much are they
going to pay us?
Hon. Mr. Sfarnbaugh:-and, in doing so,
to have regard to what I feel is the just
claim of the Western grain farmers. I refer
to the manner in which these farmers subsidized the Canadian people to the extent of
30 cents per bushel on domestic consumption
of wheat and wheat products during the
period from March 1945 to February 1947.
Also at this time I wish to draw attention
to the great contribution made by the federal
government toward the opening up of the
north -country generally by building the
Mackenzie highway. The fishing industry of
the far north-to take only one examplebenefits tremendously by the completion of
this highway from Grimshaw to Hay River.
Thousands of tons of fish are now trucked
out over this road to markets in Canada and
the United States.
The federal government is to be commended on the way it has gone forward with
irrigation in southern Alberta. You would
have to see this to appreciate it fully. Last
July I travelled by car from Medicine Hat to
Lethbridge, and just east of Taber I came to
the irrigation district. Up until then the
treeless land was dry and had hardly any
crop, the grass was dry and brown and the
weather was very hot. On entering the irrigation belt, however, it seemed to me like an
entirely different world. The temperature
dropped at least ten degrees. Trees and
shrubs were in full foliage, and flowers were
in bloom. Crops of peas and beans, corn
and sugar-beets were in excellent condition.
One of the things that impressed me deeply,
and a scene that I can still vividly recall, was
a great field of flax in full bloom. This waving mass of purple was one of the most
beautiful sights that I have ever seen. It is
no wonder that the honourable senator from
Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw) is so
enthusiastic about irrigation.
I have enumerated some of the natural
resources of Alberta, but the greatest natural
resource of the province, as of Canada, is its
people. Their energy, resourcefulness and
courage are qualities that make me feel
optimistic about the future of our country.
As far as the crucial international situation
is concerned, I feel that we have excellent

SENATE
men representing us at the United Nations.
Canada has done her part well in the past,
and we can depend upon it that this country
will acquit herseif equally well in the future.
After reading the Speech from. the Throne
and reviewing the history of this government under the able leadership of the present Prime Minister, the Right Honourable
Louis Stephen St. Laurent, I feel that Canadians can look ahead with high confidence.
Although we may not be able to find a perfect
solution to ail our problems, we can and will
find a workable one.
Hon. Jean Marie Dessureault (Translation):
Honourable senators, I take great pleasure in
seconding the motion, so ably presented by
the Senator fromn Bruce (Hon. M.r. Stambaugh).
I feel deeply the great honour be.stowed
upon me of secoriding the Addresis in reply
to the Speech from the Throne for whiých I
thank the leader of this house most cordially.
I arn grateful to the leader of the govern,ment for the token of esteema which he has
off ered to me as well as to the county off
Quebec East, which is proud of having
numbered among its representatives the only
two French-Can.adian prime ministers, both
off whom are among the most illustrious. This
tribute is also meant for the city off Quebec,
which I have the honour off representinig in
this chamber.
I would like to share in the tribute paid
by the leader of the government, the leader
off the opposition and ýby those off my
colleagues who spoke beffore me, to the
memory off Honourable Senator Ballantyne,
who passýed away during the adjournment
since last session, and I wish to extend to
the members off his family my deepest
condolences.
As a representative in the Senate off the
province off Quebec, I also wish to express
my deep sympathy to the population off Three
Rivers, especially to the families off the victims off the tragedy that happeneci yesterday,
when the Duplessis bridge crumbleci, plunging
several families into mourning.
I aise take pleasure in mentioning the
recent appointment off three new senators
freim Newffoundland, and in congratulating
themn and welcoming the one off the three who
is already among us (Hon. Mr. Pratt).
It seemns fitting to point out that today, the
lst off February, is the 69th birthday off our
most esteemed, andi distinguisheci
Prime
Min ister, the Right Honourable Louis St.
Laurent. I think I arn expressing the feelings off every memnber off this house when I
wish himn a happy birthday and voice the
hope that Providence may long keep him. as

active and as energetic as he is today, so
that he may continue to lead the destinies of
our country.
Without unduly praising the governmnent
and its leader, I believe that we have reason
to be pleased and to thank Providence for
having given us, to leadý the destines of Our
country in these difficult and troubled times,
such a worthy and able prime minister.
Mr. St. Laurent is regarded by his Frenchspeaking and English-speaking fellow-citizens,
flot only as an ordinary politician, but as a
great statesman, who is a credit -to them in
the national and international fields.
Hîs
advice as chief off state is of inestimable
value. I believe rny colleagues shaýre these
feelings, and I arn convinced that they reflect
the views of the whole country. The great
European newspapers have recognized our
Prime Minister as an authority, and they
have been unanimous lin praising the various
sta-tements which he made during h.is recent
stay in Europe. As usual, Mr. St. Laurent
showed during the London and Paris conferences, that he possessed exceptional qualities
off judgment and a deep knowledge off
present-day problems.
His services as
mediator between the different members off
the Commonwealth seem to have been highly
appreciated-. Among other comments, the
Figaro off Paris had this to say on January 13
last:
His influence as chairman of the Canadian delegation to the San FranIcisco conference. and ister to
the flrst and second sessions of the general assembly
of the United Nations, helped to give his country
a foremost place among the great powers.
Mr.
St. Laurent is not only "an eminent jurist and a
highly esteemed politician," as the Times recently
called him, he is a typical honest man in the fullest
sense of the word.

In the light off such praise, honourable
senators will agree, I believe, that we may
well be proud off his able leadership.
Anyone who ffollowed his work during the
recent conference off the Prime Ministers off
the Commonwealth, in London, and who
accompanied him in thought to, Paris, would
be gratified at his wisdomn andi his leadership.
For instance, we have noticeti that other
countries have also benefited: ffrom his sound
counsel.
Our Prime Minister has been
1detifed with the wise steps taken by India
in atternpting to reach a reasonable settiement
off the difficulties which are keeping the
whole world in a state off anguish.
Canada is one off the first signatories off the
Atlantic Pact to co-operate with the United
States in the United Nations action in Korea.
The government has ffollowed, a sound and
far-sighted. policy, in keeping with the varlous
racial elements off our population.

FEBRUARY 1, 1951
In this troubled world, Canada has become
the inspiration of free nations and a ray of
hope for all those who still have faith in
freedom and d:emocratic principles. Canada
wishes to co-operate in upholding in the
world an order based on justice and charity.
Our country is taking ber place among the
great nations of the world, in order to accomplish the lofty purposes which Providence
seems to have assigned to us.
Notwithstanding the complicated international situation and the difficulties of the
moment, Canada ts the envy of most of the
other countries of the world. It is probably
in this country that one may best live happily
while enjoying the greatest measure of
freedom. During the last decade, especially,
Canada has become conscious of her true
stature, which has been recognized by the
whole world. She has reached a state of
development and an era of prosperity second
to none. She has acquired an envi-able and
foremost place among the nations of the
world.
Maintenance of national unity is an arduous and highly important task, aind I believe
that it is the duty of each one of us who
is fully conscious of his responsibilities to
contribute to this task. All our provinces
must work hand in hand in order to preserve
national unity, which must be the cornerstone of all our efforts.
Both federal-provincial
conferences, of
September 25, in Quebec city, and of December 4, in Ottawa, have taken place in an
atmosphere of calm co-operation and good
will which has brought great comfort to our
people. Substantial progress has been made
in the sphere of federal-provincial relations.
It is true that these conferences have not as
yet completed their work, which is not surprising in view of the important and, complicated problems involved; but the resulits
attained' -so far are most gratifying and give
rise to the hope that the delegates will
eventually reach mutually satisfactory conclusions. The fact that the constitutional
conference of last September was held in
Quebec city gave the delegates an opportunity to enjoy the hospitality for which the
province of Quebec is famous, and which
moved them deeply.

our friends, is designed to prevent war. While
our allies and ourselves are doing our utmost to bring a lasting peace to the world,
we must nevertheless be prepared for any
eventuality. For these reasons it seems to me
only prudent that the government should
have decided to introduce those measures
which have been mentioned in the Speech
from the Throne. The attempts of the United
Nations to prevent aggression, to localize the
conflict in Korea, and to bring about a peaceful settlement in the Far East, are well
known. The government has played an important role in these activities. The invasion
of Korea concerns the whole world, and is a
test of strength between the Communists and
the free world.
To assist under-developed areas, we are to
be asked to make an appropriate contribution
under the Colombo plan.
But not only in the Far East does there
exist a threat to world peace. In Europe the
Communists by their activities have left little
doubt as to their real intentions to dominate
both that area and the rest of the world. It
is against this danger of Communist expansion and domination that member nations of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are
pressing on with their preparation for an
integrated force to deter any such aggression.
The appointment of General Eisenhower as
its supreme commander is a most welcome decision. Having been supreme commander of the allied forces in Northwest
Europe in the recent war, he is eminently
qualified for the gigantic task of welding
into an effective body the forces of the
various member nations. The government bas
recommended to parliament that Canada
should participate in this force.
Amongst other things, Canada is providing
training facilities for the instruction of air
crews of members of North Atlantic Treaty
Organization. The exiperience we gained
under the Commonwealth Air Training Plan
during the last war will prove of valuable
assistance in this new program.
We are today turning out Canuck and
Sabre aircraft, two of the newest and best
fighter planes in the world today. Naval
supplies including ships and guns, and all
kinds of military equipment, are to be produced. The government is creating a new
department to deal with the various problems
(Text):
arising out of the increase in production for
The Speech from the Throne emphasizes the needs, not only of Canada's armed
the seriousness of the world situation. The forces, but also of those of our allies in the
government's policy, together with that of North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

SENATE

My own province of Quebec will, I have
no doubt, be playing an important role in
this expansion of production for defence purposes. The rapid increase in industrial potential and capacity in the province of Quebec
over the past few years has been highly
remarkable. There have been new and large
developments in the titanium mining and
refining industry near Havre St. Pierre in
the Saguenay district and at Sorel. There has
been almost a three-hundred per cent increase in mineral production in Quebec over
the past six years. New hydro-electric power,
such as that from the Trenche development
on the St. Maurice river, has added a total
of over one-and-a-half million horse power
to the province's output in the same period.
The development of iron ore in the Ungava
district has been very 3xtensive, with an

accompanying expansion in the production
of steel. The twelve million dollar order for
anti-aircraft guns, recently given by the
United States Navy to a pla.nt in Sorel, is
indicative of this expansion.
It is such potential and development that
will provide our part of the country with the
opportunity to play an important part in
Canada's contribution to the defence supplies
for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
T have not attempted to exhaust the list of
ways in which my province contributes to
the industrial potential of our country. I have
only cited a very few examples. I have mentioned these only by way of indicating the
capacity and the new developments in many
fields in Quebec. I have not referred to the
tremendous output of pulp and paper, of agricultural products, of base metals other than
iron and titanium, of aluminum, of asbestos,

Korea. Our Minister for External Affairs has
contributed a great deal of sane and practical
advice to the General Assembly at Lake
Success. Not appeasement at any price, nor
war at any price, but a satisfactory solution
for a peaceful agreement has been the basis
of our Canadian delegation's policy .at the
United Nations.

Such consideration as I have given to the
economic health of our nation and the international state of unrest shows the need for
our preparations for our own defence and
security, and the need for the special powers
mentioned in the Speech from the Throne.
The stresses and strains of the present
require that every Canadian be prepared to

give his contribution to the national cause
and to the international cause of freedom and
peace. The province from which I come is
willing and able to play its part in this struggle for world peace and for the freedom and
integrity of all citizens.
I am glad to see that the Citizenship Act
will be amended to prevent the retention of
Canadian Citizenship by those who have renounced their allegiance or shown that they
are not loyal to our country.
I have referred, both in French and in
English, to the subjects mentioned in the
Speech from the Throne which to me appear
most important; but the program refers to
many other important questions for the
security, progress and welfare of the Canadian people.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from Thursday,
February 1, consideration of His Excellency
the Governor General's speech at the opening
of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr.
Stambaugh for an Address in reply
thereto.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
am in a very fortunate position, for as none
of my party colleagues are yet in the
chamber, the party for the time being is
unanimous in its approval of the words I am
going to utter tonight.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Haig: There is not a single dissenter.
I first want to join with the mover (Hon.
Mr. Stambaugh) and the seconder (Hon. Mr.
Dessureault) of the Address in offering congratulations to the Governor General on the
renewal of his term of office for another year.
I am one of many who wish it had been
renewed for another five years, for he has
been a great credit to Canada and has given
distinguished leadership in the difficult times
through which we have been passing.
I wish to congratulate the mover and
seconder of the Address. The mover is a
comparatively new member of this house,
and he acquitted himself well as a representative of the province of Alberta. I was unable
to follow all that the seconder said while he
was speaking, but I have since read a translation of his speech in Hansard, and he also
made an excellent effort.
The usual practice in the debate on the
Address is for the first opposition speaker
to discuss the Speech from the Throne in
some detail; but although many things
worthy of discussion are mentioned in the
Speech, I do not propose to follow that
practice tonight.
The fact is that this session has been called
to consider two matters, the first of which
could be put under the heading of either
international affairs or defence. Under present
conditions those two headings are synonymous. The second question, which has not
been dealt with as fully as it might have
been, is the cost of living. I shall deal with
these two problems to the best of my ability.

I should first like to say a word about
the United Nations. I have said on previous
occasions, and I repeat it now, that I am In
favour of the continuation of the United
Nations. I readily admit that that organization has made a great many mistakes. Time
and again we have been concerned about
its actions, and I have no doubt that a critic
of that organization could find many mistakes
to complain about. But I say most emphatically that until someone suggests a better
method for the settlement of the differences
of the nations of the world, I know of no
other way than that of meeting around the
table in the United Nations organization.
Some Hon. SentMors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: In my professional experience, and in life generally, I have found
that the differences between men and women
can best be settled by meeting around the
table. The differences never seem so great
when both sides are present. Like some other
honourable senators, I have had the honour
of attending the United Nations organization
as a Canadian representative, and while I
was disappointed and at times angry about
its operations, when I thought about the
matter afterwards I wondered what I could
have suggested that would have been any
better.
I turn next to the matter of the agreement
among the twelve Atlantic nations, called the
Atlantic Treaty. While I will touch only
briefiy on this subject, I wish to say that
our government, along with other governments, is entitled to a good deal of credit
for the organization of this body. In my
general discussion of international affairs
honourable senators may conclude that I am
in doubt as to whether it will succeed. True,
I have my doubts, and only the future will
show; but the Atlantic Treaty gives us a
chance to get the viewpoint of other countries, and this may be very important to us.
Before laun-ching into my main topic I
should like to touch on the question of the
Canada Wheat Board. As the five-year pool
has ended, this matter becomes most
important to the three prairie provinces.
During the five-year period there was
handled approximately 1 billion 400 million
bushels of wheat. I have no inside information, but my estimate, based on reports of the
audit to the end of April last year, is that
the balance of proceeds available for distribution amounts to five or six cents per busheL
If anybody wants to read the details-I do
not know why he should-he can obtain in

wheat.

providing half of this amount by way of senses would even suggest to any government

FEBRUARY 5, 1951
that labour is justified in asking that prices
be controlled when wages remain free from
control. I have no doubt that our government will not for one moment even think of
adopting a policy of price control unless at
the same time it imposes a control on all
wages. Of course, it is a difficult matter to
control wages. Whereas in 1939 we had a
surplus of labour in Canada, we now face a
labour shortage and are talking about bringing in Europeans to fill our job vacancies.
Another thing that affects the cost of living
is rents. A good many people claim that
because the government controlled rents, it
therefore kept down that particular item of
the cost of living. But is that the fact? A
house which was built in 1941 would be under
rental control now; but a house built after
January 1 of 1948, I think, or January 1949
is not under control for rental purposes. What
made the cost of building rise? A house that
in 1941 cost $5,000, today costs $10,000, and
even at this inflated price it is grabbed up
as soon as it is built. What is in the $10,000
bouse that was not in the $5,000 bouse?
The cost of
Nothing except occupation.
labour and material has increased, but the
fact is-as I have said before, and I say it
again-that there was no inducement for
anybody to build a house for rental purposes
so long as rent control remained. The result
has been that for a period of approximately
ten years there has been practically no home
building in Canada for rental purposes, and
now it is claimed that rent control will be
removed. But here is a point about rent control on which nobody bas ever answered me.
If the government got as a tax the surplus
rent that the tenant ought to have paid, there
might be some reason for the control. But
just ronsider what happens if I let a house at
$45 for which I should have got $100, I lose
$55 every month. Who gets that? Not the
government. No. One individual alone gets
that benefit, and he pays no tax of any kind
upon it. Can that be justified? In effect
that is a secret tax put on by the government to benefit the individual who happens
to be renting a house at less rent than be
should be paying. That is something which
cannot be justified in any way at all. A tax,
to be fair, must be imposed on all under the
same conditions.
I know it is not popular to advocate lifting
the control on rent. I am aware that there
are one . hundred tenant-voters to every
owner-voter; but a consideration of that kind
should not affect government policy in a
democratic country. The government ought to
say, quite candidly, "We are going to allow
rents to rise to whatever level people are
willing to pay, but we will take as a tax

everything over what the rent would be if
fixed on the 1941 level." That is what the
government ought to have done, and what it
could have done without any difficulty at all,
and then some individuals would not have
been receiving benefit at the expense of
others.
My honourable friend from Rosetown (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) having come into the chamber,
I no longer have my party's unanimous
approval of what I am saying.
Some Hon. Members: Oh, oh!
Hon. Mr. Haig: The situation arising from
rent control is one of the factors in the high
cost of living. In every big -centre across the
country-in Montreal, Toronto, Hamilton,
Winnipeg, Vancouver and so on-the cost of
building has gone so high that many people
who otherwise would be building houses for
rent can no longer afford to do so. What is
going to happen? Fortunately the Finance
Minister of this country has had the judgment
to say that after the 30th of April rent control
will be lifted. I understand that the provinces
of Quebec and Ontario are at once going to
put their own systems of rent control into
effect. Well, thank goodness that in Manitoba we have not got people who will do that
kind of thing.
Let me refer to another factor in the high
cost of living. At the recent conferences of
the dominion and the provinces the question
of old age pensions came up, and the federal
government said it would pay all pensions of
people of seventy years and over without
requiring any contribution by the provinces.
That is in accordance with the recommendation of the committee which studied the
question. The federal government also said,
as I read it that it would pay half of the
pension for people from sixty-five to sixtynine years of age, provided that they were
subjected to a means test and that the provinces paid the other half. Then the provinces
raised the question, "Where shall we get the
money?" And somebody-some bright boy
from each of the provinces of New Brunswick,
Quebec and Saskatchewan-suggested that
there should be a 3 per cent sales tax.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: In Quebec we already
have a 5 per cent tax.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I did not know it was as
bad as that. That is a big factor in causing
the cost of living to go up. And that kind of
tax is particularly bad because it hits the
people who are least able to pay it.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: A man with a large family
has to pay proportionately more than the one
with a small family. Mrs. Haig and I have

SENATE

no children at home-we used to have some,
but they have all gone-and neither of us
buys many new clothes, for we make the old
ones do, so we would not be seriously affected
by a tax of that kind. But what about a
neighbour with say, six children? The cost
of everything he buys for his children goes
up by 3 per cent. There is one good thing

difficult periods in the world's history. I may
be reminded that the world went through
troublous times in the Napoleonic era and
when Alexander the Great was pursuing his
conquests. I may be asked if there was not
a time when the Tartars marched across
Europe. Did we not engage in a great struggle
to defeat the Kaiser in World War I, and
another great struggle to defeat Hitler in
World War II? Yes, but I say the present
is the darkest period in world history. I
have two reasons for this.
In the first place, we are now facing a
country of vast manpower that can ultimately be armed with the most modern
weapons. Just think of some of the reports
that have corne out of Korea. One reportand I have no reason to doubt its accuracystated that before the Chinese took Seoul
they deliberately sent their soldiers out to
march over the mines that had been laid to
protect the city, and troops kept coming on
until all the mines were exploded and the
army could then advance in safety. Apparently human life means nothing at all to
them.
In times such as these it is our duty to
urge governments to eut down expenditures
to the very minimum, to save every possible
cent-not only at Ottawa, but at Winnipeg,
Quebec, Toronto, Fredericton, Halifax, St.
John's and every other provincial capitalin order that we may make our maximum
contribution to the public welfare.
Now I come to my second reason. The
Governor of the Bank of Canada was reported
to have said in a speech at Toronto-and I
am surprised that a man of his ability should
say such a thing-that taxes should be levied
as a means of taking money away from the
people. My opinion is that if there is to be a
further tax levied it should take the form of

ment's sales tax: the amount of it is stated
on the bill that you pay. If your bill for
goods is $100, you see plainly stated that in
addition there is a sales tax of $8.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: It has to be shown on
the bills in Quebec too.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Then that is a point to the
credit of Quebec. But ordinarily these provincial sales taxes are hidden from the people
who pay them. Why should the governments
of New Brunswick, Quebec, Saskatchewan
and British Columbia desire to impose salas
taxes? Either they are not spending their
money wisely or they are giving too many
services. The people of my province are
seriously debating whether they would even
agree to a sales tax. I hope they do not. I
can find no newspaper which has given
editorial support to such a tax. I think I
speak for many members of this house when I
say that it is something we should guard
against. The Fathers of Confederation were
wrong about many things, but I believe they
were right in deciding that the provinces
should impose only direct taxes. That seeems
to me a wholesome restriction, for it is
designed to make sure that the people know
where their government gets the money it
spends, and which otherwise they are apt to
think comes out of the sky.
The honourable member from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) may say to me,
"What is your remedy?" He is very clever at
asking that kind of question. I do not blame a savings tax. That is to say, the money

FEBRUARY 5, 1951
for the curtailment of spending. In my
opinion the action could have been more
drastic.
I come next to the question of production.
Many people have advocated the levying of
taxes in such a way as not to interfere with
maximum production, and the giving of
compensation for maximum and not minimum production. Let me illustrate. A man
earning $20 a day shouldi be encouraged to
work harder, and earn $30 a day. The
difficulty today is that the average man does
not wish to earn more money on which he
will have to pay a higher tax. Obviously,
labour is not as productive today as it once
was; and we ourselves are not as productive
as we were. For myself, when I know that
of every dollar I earn fifty cents is going
to be taken by the government, I see no
reason why, when my income has reached a
certain point, I should, not go to Bermuda for
two months. Something should be done to
remove such an attitude of mind on the part
of the people.
I believe that the high cost of living is the
cruelest thing we have to face today. It
matters not how economical we are-and it
is for the most part the women in the home
who do the saving-the cost of living is so
high th-at all savings are swept away. People
on fixed incomes, for instance, those who
carry a few life insurance policies or who
have kept their bonds, are poorer today than
they ever were. Although the cost of living
index is said to be 172-5, it is actually much
higher than that. By reason of this condition man-y people are facing stern privation,
and I do not blame labourers, or teachers, or
artisans for demanding more pay to meet
the increasing costs. Parliament must look
most seriously into this problem.
The last point to which I wish to refer is
international affairs, or, if you will, defence. I
have some knowledge about the First World
War, but know very little about the events
which led up to it; I was a member of this
cham!ber in 1939, and saw the war clouds
gathering over Europe; but this is the first
time I have had an opportunity to view world
affairs in a broad sense. Today we are faced
with the threat of a war of ideologies. The
nations who believe in God are opposedi by a
purely materialistic nation which believes
that might is right. Some of the followers of
Hitler in World War II may have had that
ideology, but it did not appeal to a whole
nation, as it does today.
I have never been able to understand why
communism has an attraction for some people
who enjoy the freedom of democracy. It is
beyond my comprehension why some people
in the city of Winnipeg should vote for a

communist as a school trustee, and as alderman. Why some people in the province of
Manitoba would vote for a communist candidate for the legislature, I do not know. I
have in mind a certain man in Toronto; I
knew his father and his uncle before him;
whose belief that communism would help
Canadians is something I completely fail to
understand.
We have never before faced a dictator with
the political power and modern weapons
which Stalin has. The Russians at one time
were supporters of Karl Marx, but they have
long since left Marxism behind. That country today is beyond any doubt a dictatorship
of power.
I can appreciate why a man in this country
might want to belong to a labour union and
go out to fight for its policies. In this connection I should like to repeat what I said on
a previous occasion about an experience I had
some years ago. In 1914 I ran for office in
a district which was almost completely
labour. I used to start about 4.30 in the
afternoon to canvass the people in that area.
One afternoon I called at a home where the
father of the family, a labour man, worked
in the Canadian Pacific Railway car shops,
I believe it was. As be returned home his
children ran to meet him in the same way
as my children ran to greet me, and I was
struck with the thought that be must have
the same feelings that I have, and that he is
entitled to the same consideration that I am.
I never forgot the lesson which that experience taught me. Though the attitude of
some men may appear to me to be wrong, I
do not quarrel with them for joining a union
and supporting its policies. But to return to
a thought I expressed earlier. To me it is
incomprehensible that any person in this
country-or for that matter in the United
States, Great Britain or France-should advocate communistic ideologies. But, as the
investigation which took place in Ottawa
showed, there are people in Canada who do
such things.
There was a time when international
affairs, or questions arising between our government and the representatives of such
countries as China and Japan could be discussed in an objective way. But today international affairs mean defence. We can no
longer separate the two. Canada is a small
country with a scattered population and
great natural resources. I do not need to
enlarge on that first proposition. Canada has
14,000,000 people; the United States, 150 million; Britain, I suppose, about 45 million;
Russia, 180 million. Were all our people
located in Ontario and Quebec, their numbers
would be quite impressive, but they are scat-

SENATE
tered over a territory about 4,000 miles wide.
No matter how much we may prefer to fight
our battles in Europe-and I hope they will
never have to be fought in Canada-we must
keep a certain number of men in our own
country if we are to carry on at all. So in
our international relations regard must be
had to that fundamental consideration.
In the second place, Canadians always
think on these matters in terms of Europe,
looking to Britain and France as our mother
countries, but at the same time recognizing
that we are as American as the Americans.
To a large extent our affections incline
towards Britain and France; but our business
instincts are wholly American.
I believe
that that statement is as true of our people
in Ontario, or Quebec, or the Maritimes
as of those in the Western provinces. However that may be, in this struggle we as Canadians will put the needs of Europe in the
forefront. I am not so critical of the present
government and the extent of its efforts in
Korea as I would have been had those efforts
been made in Europe. But I repeat also that
we are as American as the Amerièans, and
when we criticize something the Americans
have done, we should remember that we are
in effect criticizing ourselves, since our reactions are very much the same as theirs.
In the third place, I would say that the
future of the world will depend mainly on
the efforts and the success of the United
States.
While we note her mistakes and
shortcomings, let us never forget that the
United States believes, what we believe infreedom, and the supreme importance of the
individual.
These are three of the propositions I have
set down on the subject of international
affairs. I notice that in another place an
amendment bas been moved in criticism of
our government for having voted for the
United Nations resolution to declare China
an aggressor. I want to say that on this
question, as far as I am concerned-and I
hope I speak in this matter for the whole
Conservative party, not only in this house
but outside as well-we are one hundred per
cent behind the government.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear,
Hon. Mr. Haig: If we denounce aggression
when it is pursued by some small state, and
ignore it when the offender is one of the
great nations, there is something wrong with
our mentality.
My fourth proposition is that the world
struggle with communism will be fought out
in Europe; and in the supreme task of saving
the world from the kind of slavery which
Russia is practising, we must stand foursquare with the people of the United States.

Perhaps, although it is contrary to good
manners to do it in a debate of this kind, I
may be permitted a personal reference,
because this is a subject which deeply moves
me. I think that our country stands at the
cross-roads, confronting a great evil. I do
not want to alarm anybody, but I hope all
Canadians will realize that if the world is to
be saved for freedom, and all that it means
to the individual to live in a free country,
we shall have to make a supreme effort. My
readiness to support Europe may be partly
due to the fact that three of my grandparents
came from Scotland and one from Ireland;
that my wife is of Scottish birth, and that one
of her grandmothers came from France. So
our roots in these old countries are deep, but
not so deep as they are in Canada. Canadian
boys went with credit through the last
struggle, and we believe that if those of the
present generation are called upon to face
another conflict, they will give just as good
an account of themselves as the generation
which served from 1914 to 1918, and their
successors who served from 1939 to 1945.
Speaking for my party in this house, and for
myself, I say that we will do everything we
can to assist the government to make the
best possible effort. We shall indulge in no
carping criticism.
We shall support them
wholeheartedly.
If the government make
mistakes we shall feel free to point out those
mistakes, but we shall do so as friends, in a
spirit of good will.
I ask all honourable senators to show the
same attitude to the people of the United
States.
Speaking personally, I want the
American people to feel that we Canadians
are behind them to the utmost. They may
make mistakes; it may be-I have no doubt
about it-that the British are more experienced in diplomacy, and that the French
might have done better in that respect. Yet
the Prime Minister of Great Britain and the
Prime Minister of France, after their visits
to Washington, have told the world that the
United States are ready to give them full
support.
I believe that we Canadians are
regarded, particularly by the people of
Britain and France, as best fitted to act in
the role of interpreter and to advise them
as to their attitude towards the United States.
And if we want the cause of freedom to win
in the world, we have got to stand shoulder
to shoulder, not only with Britain and
France. but with every other free nation,
and do our best to drive back the invader
if be should attempt aggression.
Some

Hon. Senalors:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Wisharl McL. Robertson:
Honourable senators, I heartily echo the compliments and the kindly references to the
virtues of the mover and the seconder. Of

FEBRUARY 5, 1951

course every province in Canada is important
in its own right as respects its wealth and
resources and the achievements of its people;
but at the moment there is something
particularly fascinating about the provinces
to which the mover and the seconder respectively belong, namely Alberta and Quebec, by
reason of the glamour of the tremendous
resources which have more recently come to
light and which create so bright a prospect
for their future. The honourable senator
from Bruce (Hon. Mr. Stambaugh) and the
honourable senator from Stadacona (Hon.
Mr. Dessureault) are eminently equipped to
refresh our memories and renew our inspiration by telling us of the tremendous part
which their provinces, in common with the
others, will play in the future of this country if, by God's grace, the terrors and dangers which our civilization is facing assume
in time less hazardous and threatening
proportions.
I listened with a great deal of interest to
the speech just made by the honourable
leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig), and I must
compliment him on it. I do not see the logic
of his argument about wheat payments, but
I must siay that *he has been a consistent
champion of his cause down through the
years. I think the honourable senator from
Northumberland (Hon. Mr. Burchili) was
right when he said that practically all those
engaged in the export business suffered in
the same way, although perhaps not to the
same extent. It was one of the characteristics
of the times through which we passed, and
indeed it may again be characteristic of the
times we are facing.
There is very little I can criticize in my
friend's remarks about the cost of living. I
think it was the Prime Minister who pointed
out in the debate on the Address that the
government contemplates asking for the
power necessary to enable it to introduce a
system of price controls, if it feels that such
controls would serve a useful purpose. Many
of those who have a fresh memory of the
situation which existed during the last war
are more or less convinced that however
necessary price controls may be as a temporary measure, they will not really solve
anything and merely delay the inevitable
result of a conflict between an increasing
purchasing power and a diminishing supply
of goods. The government of that great
country to the south, with whom our trade
is so bound up, have seen fit to impose a
drastic control of prices because of the alarming way in which the price level was rising
in that country. Their action will affect our
economy for a time at least.
80713-4

In thinking about this the other day I
realized just how vulnerable we are in the
matter of prices. The step taken by the
United States government wiill certainly
affect a whole range of manufactured goods
-automobiles,
electrical appliances and so
forth-in this country. Goods which are frozen
at $1 in the United States will almost automatically be frozen at $1.25 in Canada. That
is the situation we face, but I am afraid we
do not fully realize it. Whatever temporary
measures may be adopted, I suppose the one
reason for the rising price index is lack of
competition. Practically speaking there has
not been any competition in the manufacturing field since the early part of the last war.
People have been too busy producing to compete-I am speaking generally now-and as
far as I can see this situation will continue
for an indeterminate period. Since we are
all in the same boat, it seems to me that it
would be the part of wisdom if the various
countries which have a common interest were
to get together and effect, even on a temporary basis, an exchange of goods and services without having prices automatically
raised. Prices are already at such a high
level that they could seriously affect our
whole economy. The old argument that you
impose high tariff s in order to keep out goods
and maintain employment has gone by the
board, and it will be a long time before there
is any change in that respect. As I have said,
I think it would be wise for those countries
which are bound together to integrate their
manpower and productive capacity, as well as
their military strength, in order to solve this
problem in the only possible way-through
competition and the manufacturing of sufficient goods to meet the demand. However,
this is not as easy to work out as it may at
first appear.
I agree with the honourable leader opposite
that important though the subjects introduced
by the Speech from the Throne are, they
dwindle into insignificance when compared
with the general international situation, and
I am going to follow my honourable friend in
saying a word about this matter.
The international situation overshadows
everything in importance and seriousness.
There has been much evidence recently that
our way of life is in very grave danger.
Twice before it was seriously threatened;
twice we survived. It may be more difficult
for us the next time, since, while we will be
better prepared, the nature of the weapons of
offence and defence that will be at the disposal of the contestants is such that we
shudder to think of the hollowness of the
victory that would be ours. "Total war is
tragedy" said General Eisenhower recently.

SENATE

"It would probably be the suicide of our
civilization." Our best hope at the moment
is that-as the responsible authorities feelthe size of our preparations may well deter
aggressors for years to come. General Eisenhower recently spoke of the possibility that
our efforts to deter war might well last for
from twenty-five to thirty years. Then behind
our ramparts we can strengthen ourselves
morally and economically, help to remove
the causes of war by assisting those less fortunate, confident that in due course the
ability of the aggressors to make war will
wane, and that a new era of peace and prosperity will dawn over a troubled world.
There can be no doubt that the fate of the
free world rests largely on the leadership of
the countries of the North Atlantic Pact. If
they can unite successfully, and stay united
with one common purpose and aim throughout the long years that lie ahead, our way of
life will survive; if not, the prospect is dark
indeed. It was in this spirit and with this
idea that we entered into the North Atlantic
Pact. The fact remains, however, that there
are those on this continent who think otherwise. They would have us, in effect, tear
up the North Atlantic Treaty; they would
leave Western Europe to its fate; they would
have us retire to this continent, confident
that here we could enjoy safety, peace and
prosperity, indifferent to the fate of mankind
elsewhere. For my part, I am firmly opposed
to their proposals.
Like my honourable
friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig), I stand foursquare behind the North Atlantic Treaty, and
I shall do everything in my power to make
it a success. I range myself squarely behind
General Eisenhower, who was quoted as
having said recently: "There is no acceptable
alternative, because standing alone and isolated in a world otherwise completely
dominated by communism, our system would
have to wither away.
We would suffer
economie atrophy and then finally collapse."
Difficult as the task is, energetic action in
building defences in Western Europe has, it
seems to me, an excellent chance of succeeding in deterring aggression for sôme time at
least. We know nothing, of course, of the
real plans of communist imperialism. I am
prepared to believe that the communists are
anxious to accomplish the downfall of the
Western world. I can well believe that as a
first step they would like to bring all Western
Europe under their domination and control.
The reserves of manpower, the natural
resources and the productive facilities which
would thereby be added to their own would
completely change the balance of power. If
the prospects were that this could be done
immediately by armed aggression with little
organized resistance, they might well attempt

it at an early date. On the other hand, if
they felt they could only win this area after
fighting a well organized defence force, it
seems to me they would think twice before
undertaking it, for even if they overran Western Europe, they would find nothing but a
shambles. They are more likely to try other
tactics. Their chances of gaining control of
it intact without firing a shot are infinitely
better.
This, then, is the situation. The United
States and we are bound legally-or, should
I say, by treaty-as well as morally and by the
dictates of common-sense with our partners
in Western Europe for our common-self preservation. This is, in effect, union of the new
world with the old, and it is not in the interest of Western Europe any more than of ourselves. One half of the union-our half, Canada and the United States-is relatively safe
from attack for some time to come. The
Western European half is in more immediate
danger; but even there, for the reasons I just
gave, there may be a considerable respite.
Wars and rumours of wars may exist elsewhere, and they are serious, but here the real
issue will be joined. If we succeed here,
mankind will survive. If we fail, darkness
will settle over the earth.
We all should resolve to dedicate our energies, intelligence, patience and good will to
the common cause. And, honourable senators,
there will be ample opportunities for their
use. The problems and difficulties are great,
but they can be surmounted. We expect our
governments to give definite leadership from
time to time, but in democracies that fact does
not absolve others, particularly members of
parliament from responsibility. A problem of
such seriousness and importance as this should
have, I believe, our most careful consideration
in order that we can contribute as much as
possible. First we should take careful note
of what we have to work with, appreciate the
problems that have to be surmounted, face
squarely up to them and, as occasion demands,
assist as best we can in solving them.
Now briefly, what have we to work with?
Our union-I am using that term at the
moment because there is a union of interests
-consists of two countries on this continent
with a combined population of 165 million,
and ten in Western Europe with a combined
population of 172 million, a total of 337
million. The national income of the two
countries on this continent in 1949 was over
$234 billion, and that of the ten countries
in Western Europe about $73 billion, a total
of over $300 billion. As far as armed manpower is concerned, present plans contemplate that by the end of 1951 the total of
men under arms in our half of this union
will be not less than 3,500,000 and in the

FEBRUARY 5, 1951
European half something over 2,500,000 or
a grand total of well in excess of six million.
Out of this pool present plans envisage the
creation of an integrated force under the
command of General Eisenhower, to be
stationed in Western Europe, and to comprise approximately 750,000 men. Supporting
this huge armed strength is a wealth of
natural resources, productive bcapacities and
scientific skill. Though the area to be
defended is huge, the size of these armed
forces, if well organized and trained, united
and skilfully led, would nevertheless seem
to provide an effective defence against any
possible combination of enemies.
How to unite these forces is another question. And, honourable senators, make no
mistake about it, it is a problem. Though
we on this continent have much in common
with our Western European partners culturally, a combination of circumstances has
created a wide economic gulf which will be
difficult to bridge. Most of us have participated in two world wars, but we on this
continent have felt their impact to a far
lesser extent than have the people of Western
Europe. The per capita income in the United
States and Canada is probably three or four
times as great as that on the continent of
Europe. So the problem of integration will
present numerous difficulties. The problem
of integrating the armed forces will itself
be very difficult, involving as it will questions of different rates of pay, dependents'
allowances and living conditions. In addition,
there is the ever-present problem arising
from the fact that each individual country,
while bound under the treaty, has the right
to determine the extent of the assistance
which it will give.
While the prospect of armed forces in
excess of six million men is a comforting
one from the viewpoint of defence, the cold
fact is that it will be a very expensive necessity. The cost of maintenance and of equipment has reached staggering proportions, and
on the present basis will be a continuing
one indefinitely. However in one way or
another it must be paid for, and, in addition,
from the collective resources there must be
provided very material assistance to the
peoples of countries less fortunate .than we
are, lest they permanently align themselves
with communism. For it must be remembered,
honourable senators, that if concurrently with
the other efforts that I have mentioned a
satisfactory standard of living is not maintained for the peoples of our respective countries, there would inevitably be much social
unrest which would seriously handicap our
common cause.
80713-Q

Assuming again that armed forces are
created and maintained in being, there comes
also the question of direction and control. In
recent days we have had one example of the
inherent dangers of conflicting foreign policies among allies. In the negotiations at
Lake Success we seemed for a few days to
be on the edge of a precipice, and the end is
not yet. What arrangements can be worked
out in order that the foreign policies of the
respective countries which comprise the North
Atlantic Pact can be integrated so as to prevent a recurrence of that recent experience
will be of the utmost importance. One such
experience in a lifetime is enough. Although
we are hopeful that the process of integrating
the conflicting interests of the twelve members of the North Atlantic Pact will be in due
course accomplished, there arises also the
problem of enlisting on our side countries in
the peculiar position of Western Germany.
The problem of whether in the years that lie
ahead she will align herself with the western
world or with the group led by the Soviet
Union, will be a difficult one to solve; but
there is little doubt about the desirability
of having her with us rather than against us.
The question of inflation remains a problem
which will be common to all members of the
pact. Quite possibly it will exist in its most
acute form in the western European part of
the union, but it will also be a severe problem
in the United States and Canada. By reason
of the assistance extended through the
Marshall Plan, combined with her own
efforts, Western Europe has accomplished a
very satisfactory degree of recovery from
the effects of war; however, her standards of
living are well below ours, and she will have
to face further belt-tightening in order to
provide the wherewithal in goods and finances
to carry her additional defence efforts.
The joint plans seem to contemplate that
this continent, by reason of the great extent
of our productive facilities, and the fact that
such facilities are relatively safe from bombing attacks, will be called upon to provide
a very large proportion of the munitions of
war. For us this will mean shortages of
consumer and capital goods for civilian purposes. Running concurrently with the need
for production of goods for defence will be a
continued demand for such items as housing
and various types of new construction. If the
productive effort of the various countries
could be co-ordinated, it would not be
unreasonable to suggest that at least during
the periods of shortages there might be a
much freer exchange of goods and services
than exists at the moment. If, while we are
supplying Western Europe with arms, that
country could supply us with some badly

SENATE
needed civilian goods, it might be mutually
advantageous. The trading of guns for bathtubs might be worth considering.
The eminent British historian, Dr. Arnold
Toynbee, recently delivered a series of
lectures at Stanford University, in California.
His remarks, which have occasioned widespread interest in the United States, have
such a direct bearing on the problems which
we face that I should like to place on the
record, for the information of honourable
senators who may not have read them, some
extracts of what he said.
Dr. Toynbee offered two challenging ideas
with respect to the situation which the free
world, faces today. He said:
We shall have to become supra-nationally minded
instead of national minded.
We shall have to
become religious minded again instead of being

nonreligious minded.

He was convinced that a tremendous struggle
for the minds of men was developing between
two great schools of thought, and he believed
that with the advent of the airplane and the
splitting of the atom, crystallization around
one
world
centre
was
inevitable.
He
continued:
I think there are two open questions which are
not only important, but really decisive for the
future of the western world and the whole human
race. Around which of the two possible alternative
centres will this decisive superiority of power forn
itself? Will it be around the Soviet Union? Or
will it be around the United States? And then, of
course, is the second open question:
Will the
formation of one irresistible political centre of
power be accomplished with or without a third
world war?
That's quite a grave question for
people who are on the edge of the western worild.

Of great significance to him was the
approaching formation of an Atlantic Union
army, with General Dwight D. Eisenhower
as head. He remarked:
That commander will be commanding, I suppose,
the first common army that our western community
has had since the last of the crusades. And, of
course, in its present technological and social conditions a common army implies, I suppose . . . a
whole echelon of common institutions, one behind
the other supporting it-common weapons behind
the united troops; common factories behind the
weapons; common supplies behind the factories;
common finance behind the supplies, and as you
can't go very far in common finance without some
form of common government, we come very near to
seeing something like common government behind
the common finance.

Dr. Toynbee seemed to believe that in the
rallying of the countries of the western
world some new constitutional instrument
would have to be forged in order to make
their defence efforts successful. He added:
Let us give nationality in our western world scope
in all linguistic, cultural, educational lines, in
sports, but don't let's-because we can't afford this
in face of our presont Russian adversary-do not let
us leave any edged tools in the hands of these
factions in the western world, let us place edged
tools under the control of a central western power,
crystallized around a North America of such irresistible strength that neither Russia nor anybody else
outside can afford to challenge it.

Convince'
that
the present
situation
required new co-operation, Dr. Toynbee concluded with these words:
Let us take the moderate, statesmanlike . . .
way, but in taking li let us not shirk the problem
of providing not merely a common western army,
but a common democratic form of self-government
for our threatened and precious common western
world.

As I read the remarks of this eminent
man I thought of the resolution moved last
session by the honourable senator from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler), which was
debated so eloquently and convincingly by
honourable members of this house. On a
recent trip to Washington I had the pleasure
of meeting members of the United States
Senate and of the House of Representatives,
and to learn of their intense interest in the
reasons that prompted the honourable senator
to move his resolution. When I read the
thoughts of some of the greatest thinkers in
the world today, I am proud of the leadership the Senate of Canada has given in this
field. This house planted a germ of thought
which has had a profound effect on public
thinking far beyond our boundaries.
While there are many other problems of
foreign relations to be considered, I believe
that our efforts to co-ordinate the defences
of democratic countries in these trying times
will be a challenge to the best thinkers and
the finest statesmen the western world can
produce.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed frorn yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Stambaugh for
an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. J. A. McDonald: Honourable senators,
in the first place I would like to join with the
two leaders in their complimentary remarks
about the speeches made by the mover and
the seconder of the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne. We enjoyed a treat
last evening: we expected good speeches from

the honourable leaders, but I believe they
excelled themselves. There was much in
their speeches to invite our best thought, and
I only wish that I could keep the debate on
as high a plane.
Honourable senators, with your indulgence,
before I proceed with the two major parts of
my subject today, I am going to refer to the
motion of which notice was recently given by
our honourable leader. If this motion is favourably considerered by honourable senators,
it will give us an opportuniity to inquire into
and report upon whatever action in our opinion may be necessary or expedient to enable
the Senate to make its maximum contribution to the welfare of the Canadian people.
As one humble member, I shall be pleased to
support this motion, hoping that a thorough
study of the organization and reponsibilities of
the Senate will result in recommendations
which, if accepted, will have the effect of
making the Senate even more useful than it
has been.
Among the questions which I think should
be studied are these. First, could changes
be made in the method of appointing at
least a portion of the senators which would
make this a more democratic body? Second,
should there be any age limit for senators?
It is necessary, of course, if the Senate is
to render the greatest possible service, that
it have the most generous co-operation of
the governments. It is encouraging to know
that we have this co-operation now because,
as the government leader said a few days ago,
at the last session of parliament, all bills not
dealing with money matters, with one exception, were introduced in this house. Our
nation has undergone great changes since
confederation, and it may be that a study
will show how we can better accomplish
those things for which the Senate was
established, including the protection of
minorities. If there are changes that can be
made to enlarge the sphere of usefulness of
the Senate, I believe that they should be
suggested by the Senate itself, and with this
I should think the government would agree.
The United Nations Assembly and its
important committees have done good work
and have made much progress during 1950.
An important step was taken by the
Assembly when the representatives of the
nations of free peoples voted to deal in the
Assembly with further possible aggression
by the communists, should desired action
be vetoed in the Security Council.
We would be remiss if we did not at this
time express the appreciation which we feel
for the valiant and the self-sacrificing services of the United Nations soldiers in Korea.
I am certain that I am expressing the sentiments of all honourable senators when I say

SENATE

that we desire to extend our sincere sympathy to all who have suffered the loss of
loved ones in this unfortunate struggle.
May I congratulate the members of our
own parliament who were delegates to the
United Nations Assembly, and who during
the last session took an active part in its
discussions. I feel sure that special words of
commendation are due to our Minister for
External Affairs for the fine judgment and
the great ability he has shown. May I also
at this time compliment the government upon
the outstanding public service which it
rendered, as a group, and individually,
throughout the trying year which has
recently been brought to a close.
The major crisis in Korea has somewhat
overshadowed other government and United
Nations Assembly proceedings.
The problems of the Far East are so complicated, it
seems to me, that it would be wise to take
the advice of men like the Honourable Mr.
Pearson, whose business it has been to make
a study of these affairs. I wish to say, however, that a small price to pay for the avoidance of prolonged entanglement in the Far
East would be to give the People's Republic
of China a seat in the United Nations
Assembly, on condition that all fighting stop,
that a no-man's land be declared at the 38th
parallel in Korea, and that the people of
South Korea be given the assurance that
they will have their freedom. Through a
representative
in
the
United Nations
Assembly the people of China might be
helped in understanding that the democratic
nations of free peoples were only trying to
prevent further enslavement by communist
aggressors, and that they had no ulterior
motives such as the Chinese have declared
they fear.
Because of our most pressing obligations
within the North Atlantic Pact of nations
it would seem advisable not to spend in the
Far East too much -of what may be essential
in Western Europe. As unity of purpose and
action is so necessary to achieve the ultimate
within our own nation, so it is within the
countries that have united to oppose communism and thereby make it possible for us
to maintain our most highly prized freedoms.
Particularly would it appear that we should
be on the alert to prevent the saying or doing
of anything which would disrupt in the least
the friendly relations existing between
America and Britain. I pray that the new
Peace Committee or Good Offices Committee
soon to be appointed by the United Nations
Assembly will receive the richest blessing of
divine guidance.
So far as we are concerned in Canada, the
most effective means of dealing with communism here and preventing its success is

to achieve and maintain the maximum of
unity, of confidence and understanding among
ourselves. If we lack that confidence in
each other and do not trust each other, then
we shall have a divided nation which is apt
to fall an easy prey to the revolutionary
forces operating in our world today. We
therefore need to strengthen our confidence
in our way of life, and determine to make
our Canadian institutions the most efficient
and most successful in the world. If we are
to achieve the greatest degree of unity among
our people we must adopt tolerant and
intelligent policies, and be prepared to
co-operate to achieve common purposes.
Although in the cause of peace we must
speed up military defence and adopt again a
measure of undesired controls to prevent
further inflation and make certain that
necessary materials are available for defence,
I believe that if the people of the free nations
are to prevent the further spread of communism, it is particularly important that
more attention be given to solving economic
problems. Figures released recently by the
United States statistical office show that the
United States people have a per capita
income of $1,453 a year. Canadians are in
second place, with $958. The British, in sixth
place, after New Zealand, Switzerland and
Sweden, have $775.
The Russians, in the
twenty-third place, have $308. The poorest
people in the world are the Indonesians, with
an annual income of about $25; and next
come the Chinese with $27 per year. People
with such low incomes as those of the citizens
of some far eastern nations, and even of
some sections in our own western nations,
provide fertile fields for the spread of
communism.
The United States and Canada are to be
commended for all that they have done to
assist our brother nations that required
assistance in rehabilitating themselves after
the Second World War. They are still doing
much and planning to do more to help those
who require help to protect themselves
against communism. It was heartening to
learn that Canada had recently assisted
Yugoslavia with food as well as arms, since
that country's people were facing starvation
because of a crop failure last year resulting
from drought. This is all to the good, but I
feel very strongly, honourable senators, that
there should be an organized effort by all
the free nations to send their surplus pooled
foods to those in want. There would have to
be, as has been suggested, a separate international organization or a subsidiary of the
Food and Agricultural Organization, financed
by those members of -theUnited Nations who
would support such a plan, to pay the cost
of production to the producers and sell to

FEBRUARY 6, 1951
the intended consumers for what they could
afford to pay. If that were done, some of
our most pressing economic problems both
at home and abroad would disappear.
In some countries, such as parts of South
America, and in the United States and
Canada, there are farmers who are afraid
to produce to their maximum capacity for
fear that because of surpluses they will
receive less than the cost of production,
although in other countries millions of people
go hungry.
In this connection I would repeat what
Prime Minister Nehru of India said to the
Canadian Parliament on October 14, 1949.
These were his words:
There can be no security or real peace if vast
numbers of people in various parts of the world
live in poverty and misery, nor can there be a
balanced economy for the world as a whole, if the
undeveloped parts continue to upset that balance
and drag down the more prosperous nations.

As a solution of this most serious and vexing problem of feeding the starving peoples
of the world and alleviating the difficulties
of agriculturists, I would suggest that our
government and the governments of other free
nations again give serious consideration to
the projects suggested by the Food and Agricultural Organization and the International
Federation of Agricultural Producers, the
latter of which proposed the establishment of
an international clearing house under the
sixty-three-member Food and Agricultural
Organization. I would urge the United Nations
Assembly and the governments of the free
nations to give the details of this proposal
most serious consideration, for in this way
some way can surely be found to compengate
the producers of food products for their surpluses. If a pool were formed, Canada could
contribute such commodities as grain, processed fruits and vegetables. These surplus
foods could then be sold to the countries in
greatest need at what they could afford to
pay. The financial position of some of the
most needy might be such as to permit them
to pay little or nothing for these goods, for
we know that the hunger of large numbers of
people creates fertile ground for the spread
of communism, and we might in this way help
to arrest this robber of freedom.
The year 1950 has in some respects been
an outstanding one in the history of Canada.
The value of all goods and services produced
in this country during the year was about $20
billion, or between nine and ten per cent
above that of 1949. About half of the estimated increase in the value of the gross
national production in 1950 was due to higher
average prices than prevailed in 1949; the
other half of the increase was due to greater
output. Although the value of output has

more than trebled since 1939, the physical
output last year exceeded that of 1939 by
about 75 per cent. In the same period the
value of farm production increased by 10 per
cent. During this period there was an increase
of 25 per cent in the number of persons
employed, and in spite of an increase in the
labour force, unemployment today is only a
fraction of what it was before the war. The
output of farm products in 1950 was about
15 per cent higher than it was in 1949, the
gain being due to increased yields of grain.
Early frost damage substantially reduced the
size of the wheat crop, and to a great extent
its quality.
The value of exports of Canadian farm
products will be found to be below that of
the preceding year, which totalled $969 million. The most marked increase in exports
has been in the movement of beef cattle and
of beef and veal to the United States. There
has been a sharp drop in egg exports, mainly
due to the loss of the United Kingdom market.
We had only three export contracts with the
United Kingdom in 1950, namely wheat,
cheese and bacon. The four-year wheat agreement ended on July 31 of last year, and the
other two contracts continued to the end of
the year. The 1950 Anglo-Canadian cheese
contract has apparently been extended until
next May.
The prices support program of the federal
Department of Agriculture covers butter, eggs,
cheese and bacon. In the case of butter,
the Prices Support Board offers 53 cents a
pound, basis Halifax, St. John, Montreal and
Toronto, and 52J cents at Vancouver. This
will be continued until April 30 next. For
eggs stored to the Board's specifications for
the period from December 1950 to May 30,
1951, the board will pay 38 cents a dozen for
Grade A large, and 36 cents for Grade A
medium. As for cheese, the board will continue the price of 28 cents a pound at seaboard, namely at Montreal or Halifax, until
April 30 of this year. The board guarantees
bacon prices at $31.45 per hundredweight for
Wiltshire sides from Grade A carcases, basis
Toronto, and $30.95 for Grade B carcases.
I do not intend to deal extensively with
the grain question for the reason that I am
not as well informed on that subject as are
many other honourable senators. It would be
interesting if those who are familiar with the
matter would tell us what is the situation
as regards supply and costs. In passing, I
wish to note the prices at which the Canada
Wheat Board is now buying wheat, oats and
barley. The figures, basis Fort William, are
as f ollows:
Wheat, No. 1 Northern, $1.60 (up 20 cents);
Oats, No. 2 C.W., .75, (up 10 cents);

SENATE
Barley, No. 3 C.W., 6-row barley 1.13 (up
20 cents).
On the whole, prices received by farmers
in 1950 declined slightly from the 1949 level,
whereas the costs paid by farmers for goods
and services used for production and for
living continued their upward trend.
Canadian farmers are hopeful that the
government will find it possible to continue
the livestock feed freight assistance policy
inaugurated in 1941. If for some reason this
policy were discarded, our producers would
find themselves in a most difficult economic
position. The policy helps not only the deficient grain producing areas in British Columbia and the six eastern provinces, but it also
gives a very necessary additional market to
the producers of coarse grains in the prairie
provinces. For these reasons, the policy has
the support of farmers in all parts of Canada.
Fortunately, the attention of the leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) is otherwise engaged,
or I am sure he would have something to
say on this question.
I feel certain that I voice the sentiments
of all honourable senators when I say that
we are very sorry for the many grain growers
who last year suffered losses through frost,
and we sympathize with the unfortunate
potato producers who are taking a loss
because of insufficient markets for their good
crop.
But the hardest hit of all primary producers
were Canada's apple growers, particularly
those in British Columbia and Nova Scotia.
The growers in Ontario and Quebec have
the advantage of home markets for a large
part of their crop. If the growers in British
Columbia and Nova Scotia could find additional markets elsewhere, it would be most
helpful. The two heavy apple-producing seaside provinces, which sold a large portion of
their crops in Great Britain, lost that market
at the outbreak of the recent war, and have
not since regained it because of exchange
and monetary troubles in that country. It
should, however, be noted that the governments have on several occasions since the
close of hostilities, helped to market surplus
apples in Britain, as they did during the war.
The British Columbia fruit growers suffered
severe loss last year by reason of frost
damage, which killed 335,000 trees of the
most profitable varieties. I trust that the
federal and provincial governments may find
a way of compensating these growers, to
some extent at least, for the loss they suffered.
We should keep in mind that the growing

of an orchard requires from eight to twelve
years of expenditure before it will produce
sufficient fruit to be profitable.
The apple producers of Nova Scotia are
feeling the loss of the British market most
because a larger percentage of their crops
went overseas prior to the war, but also by
reason of the fact that the producers in the
eastern provinces have had a smaller proportion of their orchards in the better dessert
varieties which are so much in demand on
our local markets.
With your indulgence, honourable senators,
as I know the situation from first-hand
experience I shall deal with it in a little more
datai]; and I would like honourable members
to assist us by getting in touch with members
of the government and trying to impress
upon them the need of doing something to
help apple-growers, who are more numerous
in British Columbia and Nova Scotia than in
any other province, and need, I believe, more
than any other class of producers, the assistance and co-operation of the government.
The following figures will give some idea
of the reduction in shipments. During the
1934-1938 period, 46 per cent of the total Canadian production, and 82 per cent of the production in Nova Scotia, were forwarded to
export markets. Ten years later, in the
period 1944-1948, Canadian apple exports fell
to 18 per cent, and Nova Scotian apple
exports to less than 10 per cent-a drop of
72 per cent. A market bas been found in
Britain for only about 10 per cent of the
1950 crop, or 200,000 boxes, and this contract
had to be accepted at $2 a box for some of
the best varieties. Because the contract was
signed so late in the season, I believe, a very
large portion of the crop had already been
sent to the processing plants, so that in the
result it is doubtful whether more than
75,000 boxes will be shipped to Britain.
The assistance which bas been given by the
dominion and provincial governments with
the hope of helping to save this valuable
industry bas been greatly appreciated. Since
the loss of the British market, the chief market for Nova Scotia apples, financial aid has
been provided by the federal government
each year up to last year, and I am hopeful
that some aid may ba forthcoming for the
1950 crop, as without it I do not know how
many of the growers can pay their production costs.
The assistance rendered Nova
Scotia growers bas been helpful to producers
in other provinces, because it lias prevented
a flooding of Canadian markets by our fruit.

FEBRUARY 6, 1951
When necessary, considerable portions of the
crops have been processed and sold or given
away by the government.
In rehabilitating this industry, over 600,000
old trees, and those of unprofitable varieties,
have been removed, the larger portion of
this number under bonus, and the provincial
government has helped in grafting the
younger trees of poor varieties with better
dessert varieties. The growers are hopeful
that the government may very soon agree to
pay a bonus towards the cost of removing
another 400,000 trees this spring.
Although many apple growers have done
well by getting into other branches of farming, such as growing small fruits, dairying,
or the production of beef, poultry or hogs, a
large number still require assistance to purchase needed stock and equipment. It is for
these farmers who have not yet completed
the change-over, through getting rid of
unprofitable old trees and grafting marketable varieties, and who have not the necessary funds to buy needed stock and equipment to enable them to take up other and
more profitable branches of farming, that I
make at this time an earnest appeal to our
governments to grant necessary help. This
group of our people have lost their main
market, and are in greater need than others
if they are to maintain a decent standard
of living. I have thought that one practical
way of assisting them would be to offer loans
at low interest rates through appropriate
farmers' organizations, for the purchase of
needed good quality stock and equipment.
Had more of our farmers several years ago
made the changes required for their rehabilitation, they would be in a better position
today; but at the present time they have not
the money necessary to buy good stock and
equipment; and that is why I have suggested
a way in which they could now be started
in more profitable branches of farming.
Our farmers also require the continued
assistance of our government in developing
new markets; the further lowering of tariffs;
and the provision of reasonable and proper
transportation. I still think that the Maritime Commission should find some way of
providing an improved and, regular annual
steamship service from western Nova Scotia
to the central New England markets. It
should be realized that it is but an overnight trip from the ports, of western Nova
Scotia to the New England centres which
constitute a more natural market for our
produce than do markets that are a thousand
miles or so westward. It was this consideration that used to move one of my friends,
a very talented man, to half-mast his fiag

on Dominion Day. This improvement of
service I have mentioned is essential if
those engaged in the farming and fishing
industries are to maintain and improve their
standard of living, and it is also important
to the tourist industry.
Real progress has been made through the
medium of cold storage, box packing and a
marketing program to supply markets with
the quality and varieties of apples that consumers demand. Our system is practically
the same as the growers of British Columbia
have been following with outstanding success.
I earnestly hope that Cornwallis-Annapolis
Valley growers will not have to experience
the very difficult times through which British
Columbia growers passed in their trial and
error method before adopting the present
system.
Recent court cases have shown that the
Marketing Act and the regulations under it
should be carefully reviewed by competent
legal talent with the co-operation of the
Attorney-General's department. The Nova
Scotia fruit industry would also benefit by
carrying on an efficient advertising campaign.
Advertising has spelled success for the citrous
growers of the south, and has helped the
British Columbia growers in the marketing
of their crops.
With the growth of population the number
of potential apple consumers is increasing.
We should market at least twice as much
fruit at home as we have been doing. The
per capita consumption of apples in Nova
Scotia is only one-half bushel per year, or
one apple every five days. I think everyone
will have to agree that the Apple Marketing
Board has greatly improvei the storage and
packing of quality fruit. I have been proud
of our apples -as they have been displayed
during recent marketing seasons. I suggest
that more thought should be given to increasing sales of apples to those who cannot afford
the prices of top-grade fruit.
We have a wonderful people. I know of
no finer anywhere. I confidently believe that,
with their industry and ability, and the continued co-operation of our governments, the
difficult problems with which they are confronted -can be solved. We have an excellent
product which can be sold in larger quantities in our domestic market; and if there is
a continued improvement in world affairs and
an easing of currency problems, profitable
overseas markets for our apples will be available again, though not by a return to the
pre-war methods of marketing.
In conclusion I would respectfully urge
that the government, when placing war industries, should keep in mind this depressed
fruit area, where labour is available. And,

SENATE
since military training is again to be taken up
in earnest, we hope that Aldershot, one of
the best camps in the last war, will be used
to capacity.
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
first of all I wish to congratulate the mover
and seconder of the Address on their splendid
contributions. I was particularly pleased to
hear the mover give such a clear-cut description of the great resources of the province
of Alberta.
On practically every occasion that I have
spoken in another place and in this chamber
I have urged the powers that be to bring
moisture and water to the dried-out areas
of southern Alberta. Much has been done
along this line, and plans have been made to
give relief to those settlers who have suffered
so much from drought. While I do not claim
any credit for myself in this matter, I wish
at this time, on behalf of the people of those
districts, to thank the Minister of Agriculture,
the Honourable Mr. Gardiner, and the
Minister of Trade and Commerce, the Honourable Mr. Howe, for the support which
they have given to this irrigation program.
I realize that at this time the issue which
transcends all others is that of preparedness
to resist the forces of communism throughout
the world. Since 1917 the Third International have set out to expand their territory
and extend their doctrine. They liquidated
the kulaks in their own country, and they
have started out to eliminate the class enemy
in every other country of the world. This
subject has been discussed by other speakers,
but I think that the way to discourage communism in our own country, and to have our
way of life known as a good one, is to improve
economic conditions within Canada and the
general conditions within the homes of our
people. For this reason I wish to briefly
discuss today the health situation in Canada
and to make a special plea for those who are
physically handicapped and those who are
suffering from incurable diseases.
Never in the history of our country has so
much been spent on health measures as is
being spent at the present time, and certainly
never has so much been accomplished in the
way of curing and preventing disease and
spreading health measures to the remote
areas of this far-flung dominion.
During this session of parliament it is quite
possible that the Indian Act will be revised,
so I wish to make a few observations about
health conditions among our Indians. Away
back in 1874 the Mounted Police made their
amazing march from Eastern Canada across
that great vacant country to the foothills of
the Rockies. At that time the police doctors
did what they could to help the Indians. As
was always the case, the traders and mis-

sionaries were the first to go into the great
unknown land, but there was also an overflow of bad men from Montana and other
states who entered the country and secured
valuables from the Indians in exchange for
their liquor, which was called "firewater"
because it was so potent that it would burn.
Then the liquor-crazed Indians began scalping and killing the white settlers. But never
was a more terrible revenge devised than
that carried out by a trader named Evans,
after he and his partner had been attacked
by the Indians in the Cypress Hills. The
Indians killed his partner and stole their
horses, and Evans swore to wreak vengeance
on them.
He went down to St. Louis,
Missouri, where he secured great bundles of
blankets which had been affected by an
extremely virus type of smallpox. He shipped
these blankets up to the Indian country,
where they were left on the banks of the
rivers for the passers-by to find. The Indians
found his treasure-trove, and as a result
perhaps tens of ýthousands of them perished
from smallpox. In 1877 the Dominion Government sent out doctors in an attempt to
vaccinate the entire Indian population, but
despite this effort the disease raged for many
years.
Up to the present time the health of the
Indians has not received a great deal of
attention. Five years ago the 8,000 Eskimos
and the 130,000 Indians in our country
received about $2 million for health services,
whereas this year the government is planning to spend $10,700,000 on health measures
among these people. In fact, a campaign is
being waged against disease, malnutrition,
and ill health wherever it may be found.
At the present time there are approximately
1,000 health workers among the Indians.
Something like sixty doctors, a number of
dentists and 185 nursing sisters form a permanent staff, and there are also a number of
part-time health officers assisting in this
work. The effectiveness of the efforts of these
people will, of course, depend entirely on the
quality of service they render; but from what
we know of the people who are dealing with
this problem, we can be sure that the spirit
of adventure has not disappeared. They are
skilfully and unselfishly living up to the
highest traditions of their noble professions.
Airplanes have been brought into service to
take in needed vaccines and to bring desperate cases out to the hospitals. Tuberculosis,
which spreads like wildfire among these
people, who had no immunity, has been a
great scourge. By modern methods of treatment the mortality rate has been reduced by
40 per cent. Children are vaccinated with the
BCG vaccine, and chest X-rays were taken in
1949 of about 75 per cent of the entire
population. The benefits of modern medicine

FEBRUARY 6, 1951
are being given to these people, and those
who are working among them say that
because they are now receiving the family
allowance their children are better clothed,
better fed and are getting better care in
every way.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: Much has been done in
the general field of medicine, but much still
remains to be accomplished. Away back in
the time of Julius Caesar the expectation of
life was only twenty-three or twenty-four
years. One hundred years ago, in 1850, life
expectancy was thirty-nine years. In 1900 the
life expectancy rose to forty-nine years, and
at the present time it is about 67-7 years.
These figures are perhaps a little deceiving
in that the greatest advance has been made
in conquering contagious diseases of children
and various other infantile diseases. At the
present time a man or woman who has
reached the age of fifty can only look forward
to a life expectancy of about two years more
than he or she could have looked forward
to in 1900. Much remains to be done in
conquering certain adult diseases, and under
the able leadership of the Honourable Paul
Martin the Department of National Health
and Welfare has embarked on a large scale
health program. Over a period of five years
something like $165 million is to be provided
for this purpose.
There are three objectives in view. The
first is to assist the provinces to make surveys
in order to definitely determine their needs.
Twice each year provincial and dominion representatives are to meet here in Ottawa to
talk over these problems, to co-ordinate their
activities, and to prevent overlapping and
duplication of efforts.
The second objective is to assist in hospital
construction. Hospitals all over the country
are overcrowded.
Prepayment plans and
other schemes have induced people to use the
hospitals more, so that there is a great need
for more accommodation. Here I want to
voice a complaint which is being expressed
among medical men and hospital men generally. I do not know how carefully emigrants
who leave distant shores are screened before
coming to Canada, but the complaint has
been made that quite a few displaced persons and other immigrants afflicted with
chronic ciseases like tuberculosis are finding
their way into the hospitals soon after arriving in Canada. I do hope that a very strict
physical examination of prospective immigrants will be made, because at present our
hospitals are very crowded.
The third great objective of the department
is to provide sums for research and assistance
in combatting specially devastating diseases.
Tuberculosis is the Great White Plague. As
you, Mr. Speaker, well know, it could be

called one of the "the captains of the men of
death". It can be eliminated, and to a great
extent it is being eliminated, for the causes
and progress of the disease are now well
known. A total of about four and a half
million dollars is being made available by
the dominion to the provinces for research
and assistance, each province being paid a
flat sum, plus an amount based- upon population and number of cases.
Just here may I say that recently discovered
drugs have given new hope to those suffering from tuberculosis. Among these drugs
A number of cases of
is streptomycin.
tuberculosis were carefully x-rayed and it
was found that the sputum was positive and
the disease fairly well advanced. After the
patients had been treated with streptomycin
for a period of about three months, examination then revealed that in approximately 89
per cent of the -cases the sputum was negative,
and the x-ray films showed that considerable
healing had taken place. The hospital stay
of the patients was therefore shortened.
However, cancer is still the great scourge
of mankind. In some mysterious way cancer
seems to be linked with the aging of our
tissues, and owing to the steady increase in
the proportion of people in the older age
group the disease is of course becoming more
common. As you so well know, Mr. Speaker,
when a cancer begins the cells multiply
rapidly, take on a wild overgrowth, and in a
short time there develops a malignant tumor,
which will spread by metastasis to different
parts of the body. No one knows why the
cells take on that wild overgrowth; that is
a problem which is being studied today in
universities and national cancer institutes.
The Department of National Health and
Welfare is spending about three and a half
million dollars a year with the provinces on
a matched basis for the support of research,
a sum which averages per capita about three
times as much as is being spent for the
same purpose in the United, States.
Of course, a good deal has been discovered
about cancer. In its treatment the X-ray,
radium and surgery all have a place. Time
is the important factor, because nearly all
these tumors can be cured if treated early.
It is found that in about eighty-five out of
one hundred cases early and complete removal
by surgery offers the best hope of permanent
cure. In these days much more can be done by
surgery than was possible in days gone by.
To begin with, the diagnosis has been greatly
facilitated by use of the X-ray and the modern

microscope.
administered now with much less shock to the
patient than was usual in the past. Intravenous treatments and blood transfusions are
also very helpful. However, more important
than all these is the effect of penicillin and

SENATE

allied drugs. Since Lord Lister's discovery
that infection was caused by germs, medical
science has made it possible to prevent infection in many ways. Penicillin, a drug which
goes a long way towards curing infection
once it has started, was recently discovered
by Sir James Fleming, of London.
Another very devastating and disabling disease is arthritis. It causes pain and
deformity, and often is complicated by kidney
and heart trouble. This disease also presents
a problem which science has not yet been
able to solve, and, as honourable members
probably know, a number of associations are
engaged in a study of the problem. Recently
such drugs as ACTH and cortisone have been
experimented with to quite an extent, and
though they have been found helpful their
effect is quite limited. That is, the symptoms
subside while the drugs are being given but
return after treatment is discontinued. However, progress has been made, and we are
probably on the threshold of greater developments in that line.
I wish to make a special plea for the handicapped, those forgotten people who have
become permanently disabled in some way
by disease or accident. Many people besides
those eligible for financial protection by workmen's compensation boards suffer accidentsthe loss of a limb or limbs, the breaking of the
spine, and so on-and are permanently
deformed and disabled. Total disability is also
frequently caused by cerebral and nervous
diseases. Young people with ambition who
would like to be self-supporting are often
attacked in this way, and afterwards find
themselves unable to secure employment.
Take the disease of disseminated sclerosis,
for instance, of which there are many cases
here. This disease was discovered in 1835,
and no case that has been correctly diagnosed
has ever recovered.
At numerous spots
throughout the nervous system of the body
the disease causes a shrinking and atrophy
of small areas.
This is accompanied by
blurring of the vision, by disturbed reflexes
and scanning speech, until complete paralysis
sets in. There is no spontaneous cure, and
no treatment that very materially affects
the course or outcome of the disease. The
considerable number of people disabled by it
are in a particularly sad plight, especially
if they have not the means to pay for their
own treatment because then they have to
apply to the municipality for help or depend
upon charity.
The department has taken
the matter under consideration and is now
making a survey to learn the number of
sufferers from this and other incurable diseases and how many of them have no personal
incomes. I do hope that it will be possible to
do something for these people.
I realize

how very difficult it is to administer a sickness pension, and to see that justice is done.

There are, however, many incurable cases
which merit help and assistance.
In closing I wish to point out that health
means complete physical, mental and social
well-being. To this end education by means
of films and pamphlets is most helpful. Good
food, adequate housing and mental contentment also have some influence. The extensive
social security program which has been
put into operation in Canada, at a cost of
about $455 million per year, is making many
of these things at least possible.
Of this
amount $97 million goes into old age pensions.
I am hopeful that before this session closes
provision will be made whereby these senior
citizens need no longer divest themselves of
all their assets, or make statements to the
effect that they are almost poverty stricken,
before they can benefit by the pension. Family
allowances, which cost the country about
$297 million a year, are bringing sunshine
into a great many homes. Some help is being
contributed by the provinces by way of
medical care for pensioners and recipients of
the mother's allowance.
Although much has been done in this field,
one gap remains to be filled in the relief of
human suffering and distress.
I refer to
those who have incurable diseases and who
suffer severe physical handicaps. These persons require education and training, rehabilitation and physical restoration, as well as
sheltered employment and something by way
of material assistance. Simply expressing our
heartfelt sympathy for them is by no means
enough. These people have to live with their
disabilities; their hopes for the future are
dim indeed, and their lives are darkened.
When those of us who are healthy suffer
some minor ailment we complain most bitterly, and we forget that these people live
in an atmosphere of twilight.
The following few lines of poetry seem to
express the situation very well:
Sorne murmur when their skies are bright
And wholly clear to view,
If but one speek of dark appear
In their great heaven of blue;
And some with thankful joy are filled
If but one ray of light,
One ray of God's great mercy,
Gild the darkness of their night.

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: If they will allow me
to be so presumptuous as to say so, I think
that both of their speeches were very
admirable and on an extraordinarily high
level.
All the speeches which have so far been
heard in this debate have dealt in very large
part with the present international situation,
and the speakers have really done nothing
more than to reflect the Speech from the
Throne itself. I propose to follow their
example.
Perhaps the most pregnant paragraph in
the Speech from the Throne is the third,
which I may be allowed to quote:
The increased menace in the Far East reinforces
the mounting evidence that communist imperialism
is determined to dominate the world by force or
fear of force, and that the only hope of maintaining
peace with freedom lies in the rapid increase of the
combined strength of the free nations. It is equally
important that the free nations should make it
abundantly clear that they have no aggressive
designs and that they are resolved to aid in constructive endeavours to improve the standards of
human welfare in under-developed countries.

ADDRESS IN REPLY

SENATE

I was filled with admiration for the statement on this subject made in the other place
by the Prime Minister last Thursday afternoon. I think that the way in which he
expressed the intention of the government
to deal with these questions in a completely
dispassionate and impartial manner, meeting
the questions as they arise and telling the
country from time to time what our necessities may be, is perhaps the highest form of
statesmanship, and I for one am perfectly
willing to leave to the Prime Minister and
to our government the final determination on
all questions of that kind.
Now, what is our situation today? Canada
and the other nations of the Atlantic Pact
are called upon to make a great effort to
increase our military strength, and so far we
can see no end to that effort. One feature
that lies at the very root of the whole thing,
and which has been emphasized time and
again by General Eisenhower, and is also
emphasized in the gracious Speech, is that it
is essentially a defence effort. It is not an
effort which involves any aggressive designs
against anybody in the whole wide world. All
that we of the Atlantic Union nations are
doing is to follow that wise old Roman precept, which some of us learned in our Latin
lessons in our school days, which goes,
si vis pacem, para bellun, meaning, if you

wish for peace, prepare for war.
The gracious Speech says that:
. . . communist imperialism is determined to dominate the world by force or the fear of force-

I am inclined to think that it is the fear of
force, rather than force itself which is the
main weapon in the communist armoury
today. I shall have a few words to say on
that branch of the subject a little later. But
what we are now setting out to do is to meet
and to overcome the fear of force in the only
way in which it can be overcome, that is, by
ourselves becoming so strong that the fear of
force will have lost its power to affect us. A
well-armed nation is not afraid, and we must
become a well-armed nation.
The few observations which I wish to make
this afternoon on the international situation
will be largely confined to Europe. Although
Korea and the Far East are much in our
minds, I do not intend to deal with them, and
that for two reasons which seem to me to be
good and sufficient. The first is that the
present position in Korea and the Far East is
so fluid, so difficult to assess and so apt to
change that anything which one might say
this week may next week be completely inapplicable. Secondly, I think it is perhaps wise
to leave what is to be said and done in the
Far East to those who have expert and up-todate knowledge, of which company I do not
profess to be one. And, here, I want to pay

respectful tribute to the actions and speeches
of the Prime Minister and of the Minister of
External Affairs throughout this whole
Korean crisis. I think they have done honour
to Canada. I should like also to extend a
word of praise to the whole of our delegation
to the recent session of the United Nations,
including our own representative, the honourable senator from Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon).
Perhaps I should add, as a third reason why
I do not intend to discuss Korea this afternoon, that the honourable gentleman has been
to Lake Success and knows the situation
thoroughly, and we are going to have the
pleasure of hearing from him tomorrow
afternoon.
There is, however, one thing about Korea
that I do want to say. It was said most
admirably by the leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig) on Monday evening last, but I think
it bears repetition. We hear criticisms, from
sources in this country and in England, of
certain aspects of the Far Eastern policy of
President Truman and the United States
Government. It may be that some of these
criticisms are justified. Personally I would
be more inclined to criticize certain public
men and certain organs of public opinion in
the United States which seem to me during
the last few weeks to have indulged in
hysteria and to have been perfectly willing,
with complete irresponsibility, to plunge us
all at once inte full-scale war against communist China. Be that as it may, I do say
that, looked at in the very broadest way, the
policy of Mr. Truman and the United States
Government in Korea has been both right
and courageous. Let me ask honourable
senators to cast their minds back only six
months to last July, when Mr. Truman first
authorized American forces to help the
South Koreans in their fight against North
Korean aggression, and when he asked for
and obtained the support of the United
Nations to resist that aggression. The whole
free world applauded, and the whole free
world was right to applaud, because after
all that was the first real test of collective
security under the United Nations charter.
It was a challenge, and a challenge that was
successfully met under the leadership of
President Truman. So I repeat that, as a
whole, United States policy in Korea has
been both right and courageous.
Let me remind honourable senators-and
the reminder perhaps is a rather painful
one-that there was a very similar test under
the League of Nations only twelve years
ago. In that case the nation concerned was
not Korea but Czechoslovakia, and the
principal personality involved was not the
President of the United States but the Prime
Minister of Great Britain. Oh, there the
result was neither right nor courageous!

FEBRUARY 7, 1951
Whatever has happened in Korea, there has
been no appeasement and no Munich pact.
For myself, I find it difficult to tolerate
criticisms of President Truman and of the
United States Government by people, wherever they may be, who approved of the
Munich pact and of the betrayal to Hitler of
the gallant little republic of Czechoslovakia.
But whatever we may think about Korea,
I suppose we shall all agree-and it has been
said several times already in this debatethat Korea is only a side-show. The future
of the western world will not be decided in
Korea but in Europe; and it is certain phases
of the European situation which I now ask
leave to discuss.
There is one great unanswered question in
Europe today, a question that each of us
asks himself from time to time, and it is
this: Will Soviet Russia start World War
III by attacking Western Europe within the
next few months or years? The apprehension and the uncertainty about the answer
to that question is the "fear of force" which
îs referred to in the Speech from the
Throne. Anyone who tries to answer that
question at all reasonably must do so with
many qualifications. First of all, he must
admit that conditions are likely to change
very quickly and to vitiate any judgment
which one might now form. Secondly, he
must admit that there are some factors
which perhaps are totally unknown, and
other factors of which the relative weight
is very difficult to assess. Thirdly, he must
say quite frankly that he may be entirely
mistaken in his judgment. But having done
this, and having made all these qualifications,
I venture to say, with great temerity, that
as conditions exist today I believe that an
all-out attack by Soviet Russia on Western
Europe is unlikely; or perhaps I should even
qualify that and say, not very likely.
Let me give the house the reasons which
have led me to that view. In dealing with
Soviet Russia we have always got to remember
'hat we are dealing with two different factors.
We are dealing first of all with Marxist
dogma, and secondly with Russian imperialism. It is a mixture; and the proportions
vary, they are not constant. Now I think it
is true to say that at the beginning of the
revolution, in the days of Lenin, the Marxist
dogma as he expounded it was supreme.
Lenin, as honourable senators will recall,
denounced and renounced. Russian expansionist aims. Under Stalin conditions have
changed. Russian expansionism has come
more and more to the fore and is now, I
would say, by very long odds the predominant element in the mixture. Nevertheless, Marxist doctrine is still professed as the
official belief of the rulers of Russia.

Looking at the question of military
invasion of Western Europe from the viewpoint of Marxist doctrine, the answer seems
to be clear. As I have had occasion to point
out once before in this house, that doctrine
is that the capitalist countries are bound
inevitably, sooner or later, to collapse from
their own internal weaknesses and stresses
and strains. If that is so, and if that is what
the rulers of Russia really believe, obviously
war is for them an unnecessary gamble; they
have nothing to do but wait, and sooner or
later the prize will fall into their lap. A few
years ago I would have been inclined to
give more weight to that argument than I
would today, because as the years roll on
the realization must be increasingly forced
on the rulers of Russia that the economy of
the western world, which they confidently
expected to collapse immediately after the
war, and which all their literature shows
that they confidently expected to collapse, is
giving no sign of collapse but is in fact
getting stronger; and I would suppose that
the faith of the leaders of Russia in that
particular Marxist dogma must by now be
somewhat dim. But to the extent that they
still believe in the Marxist theories which
they continue to profess, that belief is, for
what it may be worth, an argument against
their going to war.
To turn from economic theory to cold facts
and political realities: I think there are a
number of cogent reasons in support of the
view that I have expressed. The first is the
atom bomb. As you all know, in the view
of Mr. Winston Churchill the atom bomb
is the chief protection of the West at the
present moment. Of course the extent and
duration of western superiority in the atom
bomb are unknown, but I think there can be
no doubt that today the Soviets greatly fear
this weapon. If you want to get an inkling
of what is in the minds of the leaders in the
Kremlin, you can very often derive it from
a consideration of the propaganda that is
being put out by their puppets in the Western
World. We know what that propaganda has
been during the last year or two. There has
been the Stockholm peace pledge, and there
have been those so-called peace conferences
in various centres throughout the world,
upon which a vast deal of money and time
and effort have been expended. It is interesting to note that the chief feature of the
Stockholm peace pledge and of these peace
conferences has been the slogan "Ban the
atom bomb". I think that is a significant
indication of what the leaders of Soviet
Russia wish to accomplish by this propaganda, disguised under the name of peace.
They want to develop a public opinion in

years. I refer particularly to the satellite arouses in opposition to it one of the most

FEBRUARY 7, 1951
powerful forces in the human mind today,
the force of nationalism and nationalist
feeling.
We have had one very striking example
of that process in the case of Yugoslavia.
Sa long as it was merely a question of a
united belief in the doctrines of Marxist
communism, Yugoslavia was perfectly willing
to follow along with Soviet Russia, but as
soon as it became clear that what the leaders
of the Kremlin really wanted was not Marxist
communism but complete subservience ta al
the economic and political designs of Russia,
Yugoslavia broke away. Now, can the leaders
of the Kremlin be certain of the satellite
peoples and of the satellite armies? Can
they be sure that if occasion arise there
will be no more Yugoslavias? That is the
sort of question which the Soviets will have
to ponder very seriously before they decide
ta attack Western Europe.
I mentioned Yugoslavia. I think there is
something more that should be said about that
country. Yugoslavia is a member of the
United Nations, but it is not a party ta the
Atlantic Treaty, and the obligations of
the western world ta Yugoslavia are not
as great as they are to our own allies of the
Atlantic Pact. Nevertheless, on the basis
that what we have to fear in Europe is not
so much the theory of communism as the cold
fact of Russian aggression, I believe that we
of the West should give Yugoslavia al
the help we can ta meet that aggression. In
the last few months there have been rumours,
and indeed more than rumours, of large
increases in the satellite armies of Hungary,
Rumania and Bulgaria, al immediate neighbours of Yugoslavia, trained by and equipped
with weapons supplied by Russia. Though
I have expressed the opinion that to me it
seems unlikely that Russia will herself start
aggression in the West, it may be nat so
unlikely that she might try to push those
satellites into an attack on Yugoslavia. Well,
I think the leaders of the West should make
it perfectly plain to those satellites that an
attack by them on Yugoslavia will mean war
with the West. Yugoslavia, let me remind
honourable senators, is no second Korea. It
has a numerous and gallant, but poorlyequipped army. If the satellites knew that
we would supply equipment, and perhaps an
air force, I believe they would think twice
before they would tempt providence at the
urging of their masters in the Kremlin.
There are many other aspects of this whole
situation which could be discussed, but with
which I do not wish to weary the bouse today.
I hope I have said enough to give reasons
why in my view the Soviet is unlikely ta take

the risk of plunging Europe into war today.
But, as I said before, those conditions may of
course change.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: Why would you
favour helping one commiunistic country
rather than another? Why would you favour
helping Yugoslavia, which is just as communistic as Russia or China?
Hon. Mr. Farris: Not as imperialistic,
though.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Simply on the basis
that what we have ta fear in Europe is not
communism, but Russian expansionism and
imperialism. I hoped I had made that plain.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: I do not like any
communistic country, no matter what its
name is.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Well, even if Russia
does not go ta war with the West, the threat
of force is still there. And of course there
is little doubt that today the military might
of Russia is far greater than anything that
Western Europe can set against her. It now
becomes the business of Canada and of the
other members of the Atlantic Treaty ta
remove the fear of force in Western Europe
as quickly as we can by providing the
counter-force which will remove that fear.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I do not wish ta interrupt my honourable friend's very excellent
speech, but as he has referred ta the attitude
of the West, may I ask whether he has given
any thought ta the position that France,
Western Germany and Italy might take in
connection with a possible attack on
Yugoslavia?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Well, that is of course
a very difficult question ta answer. The
policy which the Soviets spem ta have pursued
up ta now has been not ta engage their own
forces, but just ta engage the forces of their
satellites in cases where it appeared that a
swift and easy victory was certain. I am sure
that that is what they thought they were
going ta achieve in Korea. And it is felt
that they may have the same feeling about
Yugoslavia, that if they could get the satellites
ta attack Yugoslavia and vanquish that
country the West would sit back and regret
it but do nothing. I think they probably
have been undeceived by what has happened
in Korea. Al I was attempting ta say was
that I think we of the West should make it
quite clear that we will go ta the help of
Yugoslavia just as we went ta the help of
Korea. And, probably with much more
reason.
Somebody once said that Russia is neither
as strong nor as weak as she appears ta be
at any given time. Perhaps we are inclined
ta exaggerate her strength today, just as we

SENATE

were inclined to minimize it in the years
following the Bolshevik revolution of 1917.
But I do want it to be thoroughly understood
that nothing 1 have said this afternoon is ta
be taken as belittling the danger that exists
in Europe today, or the urgent need for
rearmament. After ail, aur Minister of
External Affairs is the man who must knaw
mo:st about this situation, and, as he said in
his admirable speech in the other place last
Friday, the danger in Europe is great. But
I do think there is no reasan for us to hecome
hysterical, as certain political figures and
certain publications in the United States have
given evidence of doing during the last few
weeks. I arn glad that there has been no
refiection of that hysteria in this country.
What I have tried ta do is ta analyse certain fcatures of the European situation along
the Uines suggested by General Eisenhower
in his broadcast ta the American people last
Friday evening, when he said:

dictatorship on the ane hand and democracy
on the ather, that matter; it is the men behind
thase systems. If we of the western world
keep together and if we stand true ta aur
belief in God, in the sacredness of the human
personality, and in the free and unfettered
play of the human mid, we have an immense
advantage over the deluded and downtradden
dupes of any dictatorship. The free man is
always worth mare than the slave.
The other day I came across an English
translation of a Greek paem, written more
than 2000 years ago, which expresses very
aptly the idea that I amn trying ta convey. This
is how it reads:

We should examine the current situation fearless1y, neither shutting our eyes to obvious dangers
nor pcrrnitting fear to warp our judgment.

Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Honourable senators, I
beg leave ta move the adjouraiment of the
debate.
The motion was agreed ta, and the debate
was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

Honourable senators, in these difficult and
critical times there is one thought in which I
find much consolation. When you get down

SENATE

In the face of inflation and the lowered
interest-earning capacity of bonds, the United
Church of Canada, in common with other
religious and charitable institutions, has been
confronted with the problem of making its
funds meet the growing demands. The investments of the Church, which have been limited to trustee security bonds, are to be
increased and extended in accordance with
the authorization given under the Canadian
and British Insurance Companies Act. The
purpose is to improve the status of the pension fund.
The General Council of the United Church
was authorized to make this application in
1948, and in this connection I may say that I
hope this legislation will not come too late
to give this organization an opportunity to
improve its position. It frequently happens
that circumstances change so suddenly that
it is not possible to realize the full advantage
to be gained.
If the house sees fit to give this bill second
reading, I shall move that it be referred to
the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous
Private Bills.

on behalf of all the peoples represented at the
General Assembly who were not already prejudiced against the free world. As you know,
sixty nations are now represented at the
General Assembly, and I think that our own
Secretary of State for External Affairs
unquestionably stands highest in general
regard among the representatives of all these
nations.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: He is esteemed in that
enviable way not alone by the delegates
representing members of the Atlantic Pact,
and our sister nations of the British Commonwealth, but as well by the delegates of all
the free countries, regardless of their
geographic location and to a large degree
regardless of the political views held by
them.
As honourable senators know, in addition
to its five official delegates Canada was
represented by five alternate delegates. Then
there was a group of departmental adivisers
and assistants, mainly firom the Departments
of External Affairs and Finance. And I would
not be true to myself if when speaking here
today I did, not at once pay tribute to those
departmental advisers and- assistants for the
manner in which they carried out their duties.
They worked hard, very hard, day and night,
their work was always well done, and, their
advice was always substantial and well worth
the most serious consideration.
We also were fortunate in having there
with us a group of unofficial parliamentary
advisers. It is unnecessary for me to tell
you that all our politicial parties in parliament were represented there-Conservatives,
CCFers, Social Crediters and; Liberals. Every
morning, six days a week-every day except
Sunday-the Canadian delegation met in the
Biltmore Hotel at 9 o'clock. We went from
there about a quarter after ten by motor
cars to Lake Success or Flushing Meadow, and
we got back at night whenever the work was
finished, anywhere from half past six to
eight o'clock, and then carried on our studies
in order to be ready for the next morning's
meeting. And at our morning meetings
everything was discussed openly among us
all; nothing was given only to the official
delegates and held back from the parliamentary or departmental advisers. We discussed
what had taken place the day before and
the attitude that it would be wise for the
Canadian delegates to take on m'atters
expected to come up that day and possibly
the next day. And I want to say here that
at no time whatever did the government send
us any direct instruction as to what action
we should take on any particular item that

was coming before the General Assembly. The
official delegates discussed everything freely
with the parliamentary and departmental
advisers and in this way we formed the best
judgment we could.
I also wish to point out that two members of
this chamber-the leader of the government
(Mr. Robertson) and the senior senator from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert)-joined us after
awhile and, although not official d'elegates,
sat around the table in conference with us.
Two other senators were in New York, but
found it impossible to take part in our
deliberations.
In June last the honourable gentleman
from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Gouin), Chairman of the Senate Committee on External
Affairs, presented to this house the committee's report, which contained an item
drawing attention to the fact that Canada's
contribution to the expenses of the United
Nations was, in the committee's opinion,
too large in proportion to that of other
nations. Without question the implication of
the report was that the Soviet bloc were
not contributing the same percentage of their
national income as was Canada. Now, as
honourable members here know, the assessment against each member country of the
United Nations is based first upon the
national income, and then other factors are
taken into consideration, such as the per
capita income, the ability of the nation to
secure foreign currency, and particularly the
degree of destruction and economic discomfiture suffered by the country during the
last war. Now it is unnecessary for me to
point out that certain countries did suffer
much more in that respect than Canada did.
This was the first time that I was present
at a General Assembly of the United Nations,
but from what went on when the United
Nations Administrative and Budgetary Committee was dealing with the question of
national assessment, it was quite apparent
that members of the Canadian Parliamentboth from the Senate and from the House
of Commons-who had been previous delegates to the United Nations, had performed
their task well in laying the foundation for
changes in the appropriations.
The changes provided that the percentage
to be paid by the Soviet Union be increased
by ten per cent, while that of Canada be
increased by one-tenth of one per cent. An
increase of ten per cent was imposed also
on Byelorussia and the Ukraine. I may say
that this is the first time since the United
Nations came into existence that there has
been an increase in the percentage paid by
the Soviet Union.

FEBRUARY 8,1951
Hon. Mr. Reid: I apologize for interrupting
my honourable friend, but may I ask how
many of the nations are actually paying their
appropriation?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: The payments so far as
the United Nations is concerned have been
very satisfactory. Up to 1949 nearly every
dollar had been paid; there were a few countries in arrears in 1950, and what will happen
in 1951 I cannot say. There are only six
nations-the five big powers and Indiawhich pay a larger percentage than Canada
pays. In the change of appropriations India's
percentage was increased by five per cent.
We were able to judge and appreciate the
excellent work done by those who have
represented us previously on the Administrative and Budgetary Committee. I understand
that our colleague the honourable senior
senator for Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) was
a member of that committee a couple of years
ago, and the fine work done at that time is
finding expression today.
I may add that from now on the percentages will be made as the committee rightly
interprets the national incomes in accordance
with the requirements of the United Nations.
It may be of interest to honourable senators
to know that the total operating expenditure
for the United Nations in 1951, exclusive of
the specialized agencies, will be approximately $47 million, less an anticipated
income of about $6 million.
One of the organizations carried on by
the general assembly of the United Nations,
of great interest to all members of this
chamber, is UNICEF, or what is commonly
referred to as the Children's Emergency
Fund, which has expended $150 million in
aid of needy children throughout the world.
The life of this body has been extended for
a period of three years. The Children's
Emergency Fund, to which there are twentysix subscribing countries, has as its president
Dr. Ludwik Rajchman, the delegate from
Poland, who is about to retire. It has a
program committee consisting of ten members, and the chairman of that committee is a
Canadian. I refer to Mrs. Sinclair of the
Department of National Health and Welfare,
who was one of our alternate delegates to the
last general assembly. Under her direction
and that of the chairman of the general fund
the group has done a great deal of work.
The Senate of Canada, through the activities of a special committee, has shown much
interest in the question of human rights. The
No. 3 committee of the United Nations dealing
with human rights has met with a great deal
of trouble, and I fear that the implementation
of the draft covenant will be delayed. I
80713-5

recall that at the last session of parliament
we were hopeful that the implementation
would take place this year, but I now have
doubts that this will be accomplished. One
of the causes of the delay is the request by
Canada, the United States and some other
countries for a federal reservation clause
which would permit Canada, for instance,
to sign the covenant with all the measures
of implementation, without feeling that as a
national government she would be assuming
the rights and invading the constitutional
field of the various provinces. The suggested
federal reservation clause was not accepted.
A further reason for delay was a dispute
over whether human rights and fundamental
freedoms should include cultural, social and
economic freedoms as well as political and
civil freedoms. The question is still open
and I regret that the implementation of the
covenant-not the making of it-by the member nations of the United Nations will be
delayed.
I come next to matters affecting the International Refugee Organization, a subject to
which our Standing Committee on Immigration and Labour has in the past three or four
years given careful consideration. As honourable senators know, the arrangements
recently made by IRO will continue until
the end of September, 1951. A new high
commissioner was appointed to take office
oh January 1, and the definition of "refugees"
for future use has been amended to apply
to those who become refugees or displaced
persons not later than January 1, 1951.
It is understood that the IRO has sufficient
funds to carry on until the end of September
next, after which time the high commissioner in charge will be practically without
funds. After that date the organization must
do what it can to provide a legal status for
refugees and displaced persons. In this connection I suggest that the honourable senator
from Rockcliffe (Hon. Cairine Wilson), chairman of the Committee on Immigration and
Labour, should call a meeting of that committee fairly soon, so that we may go into
the whole situation affecting refugees and
displaced persons.
I turn now, honourable senators, to the
question of the resolution passed by the
United Nations at its general assembly,
declaring that the invasion of Korea by the
Chinese was an act of aggression. Although
that action has been questioned by some, I
absolutely assert that that was the only
decision that could have been reached by the
United Nations. I would point out that the
UN had already declared the invasion of
South Korea by the North Koreans to be
an act of aggression, and that the trespass

SENATE

on Korean territory by anyone-whether
Communists or others-would be an act of
aggression.
Criticism has been offered by some to the
setting-up of the Cease-Fire Committee,
which was an effort on the part of the United
Nations to stop the war before the resolution
denouncing China as an aggressor was passed.
It has been said by some that the setting up
of the committee was an act of appeasement.
Again I say no, it was not appeasement, but
an effort by members of the United Nations,
supported by Canada, to save the world from
the bloodshed which at any moment may
befall it through a general war. Those of us
who agreed to the establishment of the
Cease-Fire Committee were anxious to take
every step that could postpone and perhaps
dissipate the fear of, and the possibility or
probability of war. But, just as I approve
of the work of the Cease-Fire Committee, so
also I assent to the application of the term
"aggression" to the invasion of Korea by
Chinese Communists.
The resolution which declared the act of
China to be aggression also provided for
sanctions and other measures against the
aggressor. Largely at the suggestion of
Canada's chief delegate, the Secretary of State
for External Affairs, the application of that
part of the resolutions which related to sanctions, and other measures of what I may call
punishment, was ýpostponed; and I am hopeful
that something will take place to bring about
a cease-fire before the imposition of sanctions.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I ask my honourable friend to make clear whether or not
those references in that resolution to sanctions were not entirely dropped from it, and
that it was confined merely to condemnation
of aggression? The clauses dealing with
sanctions or the consequences of aggression
were, I understand, omitted.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: I think that what the
honourable senator has in mind is that the
resolution was changed through an amendment by the delegate from Lebanon. But at
any moment the matter can be raised again
and the United Nations may apply sanctions;
and it was upon that understanding that the
change was agreed to.
What I am about to say relates to what
the honourable senator has in mind. My
recommendation, naturally, must be regarded
as purely personal. It is this: that, before
the United Nations alpplies what are termed
sanctions, it should request the President of
the General Assembly, without awaiting
any further communication from Peiping,
publicly to ask the Chinese Government to
have their armies withdraw from South

Korea as far as the 38th parallel; at the same
time, provided the Chinese Communist Government accepts the proposal, he should
request the unified command of the United
Nations to halt their troops at the 38th
parallel. The President could tell both parties
to the conflict that acceding to his request
would permit the Good Offices Committee of
the United Nations to start work immediately.
There has been much comment on the
refusal of the Chinese Communists to agree
to the proposal of the cease-fire committee
for a general conference. Personally I cannot understand why the Chinese should
refuse, or even hesitate. Who are the members of that committee? The chairman, Mr.
Nasrollah Entezam, is himself the President
of the General Assembly. He is also the
chief delegate from Iran. We all know that
Iran is a part of the Middle East, and that
its great natural resources of oil and- other
products would make a battleground in a
war between Russia and Europe. It is certain that the Chief Delegate from Iran wants
to avoid war with Russia. Another member
of the committee is Sir Benegal Rau, of
India, whose government has recognized Communist China and is openly on terms of
great friendship with it. Sir Benegal Rau
does not want war. He is an admirable man,
of whose attainments any nation might be
proud. He has done a great deal for India,
and helped largely in the general work of
the United Nations. The other member of
the committee is Canada's own representative, Mr. Pearson. Acting as head of the
Canadian delegation, Mr. Pearson presented
a motion, which was adopted by the General
Assembily, to set up a committee to study the
question of what group should represent
China in the General Assembly; that is,
whether the representatives of Nationalist
China or Communist China should be recognized. Incidentally this is the first time
that the possibility of recognizing Communist
China's claim has ever been contemplated
by official action. But the Chinese communist group refused to meet this committee. I
am inclined to think that they have forgotten
some features of past history to which I shall
take a little time to refer.
I have alreadýy remarked that comn unism
is used by the Soviet Government as a
political weapon. For centuries Russia set
herself to arouse public opinion and employ
human reactions for definite objectives. When
the Czars ruled the empire, they sought, and
for a short period secured, a monopolistic
control of the Straits of Bosphorus and the
Dardanelles, connecting the Black Sea with
the Mediterranean. When they were deprived
of this prize, they took over a cultural campaign of Panslavism begun by some Germans

FEBRUARY 8. 1951
early in the nineteenth century and adapted
it as an instrument of Russian imperialism.
It will be recalled that at the Yalta Conference an agreement was made by the
U.S.S.R. with the United Kingdom and the
United States. At that time the terms of this
pact were kept secret, and no doubt properly
so, as they provided for the entrance of
Russia into the war with Japan. The details
were published later. I am impressed with
the significance of that agreement particularly in relation to the position of Communist China today.
It gave the Soviet
Government, first the Kurile Islands. Secondly-and I quote from the agreement, it
stated:
The status quo in Outer Mongolia (the Mongolian
People's Republic) shall be preserved;

I intend to deal with that later.
The former rights of Russia violated by the
treacherous attack of Japan in
1904 shall be
restored, viz.:
(a) The southern part of Sakhalin as well as all
the islands adjacent to it shall be returned to the
Soviet Union;
(b) The commercial port of Dairen shall be internationalized, the pre-eminent interests of the Soviet
Union in this port being safeguarded, and the lease
of Port Arthur as a naval base of the U.S.S.R.
restored;
(c) The Chinese-Eastern Railroad and the South
Manchurian Railroad, which provides an outlet to
Dairen, shall be jointly operated by the establishment of a joint Soviet-Chinese company, it being
understood that the pre-eminent interests of the
Soviet Union shall be safeguarded and that China
shall retain full sovereignty in Manchuria.

Honourable senators, these are the things
which I think justify my suggestion that,
despite the fact the Chinese communists have
been declared aggressors, the president of the
General Assembly should appeal to them to
withdraw inmmediately from South Korea to
north of the 38th parallel. Then the CeaseFire Committee, or whatever committee may
take its place, will be able to enter into negotiations. Here is the point:
It is understood that the agreement concerning
Outer Mongolia and the ports and railroads referred
to above will require concurrence of Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-shek.
The President-

That is the President of the United States.
-will
take measures In order to obtain
concurrence on advice from Marshal Stalin.

this

Today Soviet Russia is denouncing the
United States as aggressors and as having
imperialistic aims towards China, yet just
half a dozen years ago the Soviet Union,
through Marshal Stalin, requested the President of the United States to act as mediator
so that Russia could receive from China what
this Yalta Agreement provided she would
get if she went into the war against Japan.
Speaking in the Senate in April of 1948
I pointed out that one of the great causes of
80713-51

the dispute between Stalin and Trotsky in
the mid-twenties was the fact that Trotsky
at that time wanted to spread communism
throughout Europe. Stalin said they could
not spread communism in Europe until they
had secured some control over Asia. Stalin
pointed out that they could not get any control of Asia until they had control of China,
and particularly control of Sinkiang, the
northwest portion of China, Inner and OuterMongolia and Manchuria. Surely the communists in China remember that part of
Chinese history today.
Outer-Mongolia
belonged to the Chinese Empire until 1911
at which time Czarism was in control of
Russia, and Outer-Mongolia declared its
independence. In 1924, the very time when
Stalin and Trotsky were at war with each
other, a revolution sponsored and supported
by Soviet Russia took place in Outer-Mongolia and the Mongolian Peoples Party was
formed.
Again referring to the request made by
Russia that the United States act as mediator
in their dispute with China, we all remember
the "Open Door" policy, which was purely a
United States one, applied to China. The
United Kingdom was sympathetic to this
policy and helped in every way. The "Open
Door" policy, relating specifically to traffic
and tariffs and tolls, was particularly designed
to protect the integrity of China and to
make sure that Chinese independence and
ownership of its own territory would be maintained. This was the policy carried on
throughout the years, and after the Boxer
uprising in China, the United States received
a small portion of the reparations paid by
China as a result of this war; but they gave
back to the Chinese in money, four-fifths of
the total reparations they received froni
China. To show their appreciation, the
Government of China used that money for
the education of Chinese youths in China and
in the United States.
These facts partly explain why I make the
suggestion that the president of the General
Assembly of the United Nations should use
his voice in order to bring about the end
of the war in Korea. Just as Stalin and
communist Russia got control of OuterMongolia, they now want control of InnerMongolia and Manchuria, and through
Manchuria they want Korea. The RussoJapanese War of 1904 was fought directly for
control of Manchuria and Korea. That was
the objective of Japan as it was the objective
of Russia. Under the Czars, and later under
the Soviets, Russia has wanted control of the
warm waters of the Mediterranean and the
warm waters surrounding Korea and the
Yellow Sea.

SENATE
Part of our duty is to see that these things
are not forgotten, and to make sure that the
peoples of the world, particularly those of
Asia, realize that the so-called cold war is
being forced upon the world by an imperialistic policy of Soviet Russia that is exactly
the same as the old imperialistic policy of
czarist Russia. The only difference is in the
weapons. If those of us who are fighting for
the preservation of human rights and fundamental freedoms can only make this fact
known throughout the world, particularly in
Asia, we shall win the cold war and avoid
a hot war. I shall leave honourable senators
with this thought, and in closing I want to
say that I am glad to support the motion of
the Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Calveri C. Prait: Honourable Senators,
as a new arrival in the Senate of Canada,
may I be permitted to add my congratulations
to those already extended to the mover and
the seconder of the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne. I am fortunate
that on the first occasion upon which it has
been my privilege to sit in on the debates in
this Chamber I have had the opportunity of
hearing such speeches as were made by the
honourable senators.
I may be excused at this time from making
,any extended remarks on the subject of the
Speech from the Throne. I would like to
say, however, not only as a member of the
Senate, but as a citizen of Canada, how
thankful we all should be that we have
leaders in government who are prepared to
shoulder, self-sacrificingly and, we pray,
effectively, the heavy burdens placed upon
them in these 'trying times. As the years
have rolled on the Dominion of Canada has
grown in stature .and in world influence until
responsibilities of government are no longer
confined primarily to affairs at home. In the
great international emergency of this time the
welfare and future destiny of peoples are
largely shaped in what may be termed the
councils of the world, and not alone in the
parliaments of the nations. It seems to me
that the address to which we have just listened from the honourable senator from Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon) was very illuminating
and brought home to us forcibly how the
welfare of all countries is moulded by the
happenings in what I have termed the councils of the world.
I am sure it is the devout prayer and hope
of every true citizen of this land, no matter
what his politics, creed or class, that our
leaders in those councils, and those who direct

them, will be divinely guided in the tremendous responsibilities they have undertaken.
May I also be permitted to express my personal and very sincere appreciation of the
cordial greetings and good wishes which I
have received from so many honourable
members. I particularly appreciate the kindly
words of welcome which the honourable
senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen)
extended to me yesterday and to my colleagues who are about to enter this chamber.
And I am very happy to have been present
this afternoon when my good friend from
Newfoundland (Hon. Mr. Quinton) was sworn
in as a member of this chamber.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Prati: Newfoundlanders generally,
as well as the representatives of that province
in the Senate and in the other house, naturally
view the problems of the government and
economic life of Canada with fresh and
inquiring minds. Having until less than two
years ago lived apart from the Dominion of
Canada, we now find ourselves a part of this
great nation, and are in the process of
adapting ourselves to the new status. In the
past nothing but the greatest friendliness and
goodi will existed between us, but we were
just friendly neighbours; now we have
entered the family-not as adopted children,
but as blood relations; for after all, what
more potent relationship could there be than
membership in the British Commonwealth of
Nations, and a mutual love and respect for
our great traditions and the heritage of the
free institutions of our peoples?
Robert Frost, the well-known American
poet, in the poem known as "Mending Walls",
has penned a line in which the farmer in the
illustration says to himself as he is building
the fence, "Good fences make good neighbours". Newfoundland had its fences in its
tariffs and its laws, which were made to suit
the particular conditions of a self-governing
country. The only fence now remaining-the
Gulf of St. Lawrence-is not of our making or
yours. It is a very real fence, but not insurmountable with the spirit of mutual helpfulness. The other Canadian provinces removed
their fences generations ago, and the perfect
harmony which now prevails, if I may assume
such to be correct, is the result of adjustment and readjustment over the years; and
to preserve harmony that process goes on.
Now the man-made fences have been
removed, and we have come within the family
circle. The family life, however, is new to
us. To make the life happy, congenial and
helpful, calls for a complete understanding
by each of the other, and- the application of
the same process of adjustment and readjustment as we go along.

FEBRUARY 8, 1951

If I may presume to say so, in the interest of
the highest development of this family life,
desirable though mutual understanding certainly is, it is even more urgent that Newf oundland be well known through Canada than
that the rest of Canada be well known in
Newfoundland. Only in a small measure
can the unsolved problems of Newfoundland
affect the welfare of the dominion as a whole,
but the attitude of the federal government and
of the people of Canada towards our province
can affect us vitally. We have our immediate
problems of readjustment to the new status.
Some of them are inherent in our geographical position, away to the east; some of them
are due to Nature itself, as with every
country in varying degrees; and some of them
are born of the sudden change from the position of neighbours, each concentrating on her
own affairs, to one of living together under
one roof.
It is a pleasure for me to say that the
warmth of the welcome which the province
of Newfoundland received upon entering the
dominion has left a deep and abiding impression upon our people. Our province has been
visited by the Prime Minister, most of the
cabinet ministers, the Leader of the Opposition, and many of the members of the federal
and provincial parliaments, all of whom are
anxious to know us and understand us.
Neither have we been passed over by the
federal departments, the chief officers of
which have visited us frequently. All that is
to the good, and their interest and good will
is much appreciated. We wish to be better
known by the people of Canada 'as a whole.
This I realize will take time, but it will pay
off in good and friendly relations.
One sometimes hears the expression, even
in Newfoundland, that we should be treated
as the other provinces, no better and no worse.
On the face of it that may -appear to be quite
fair, but it is one of those generalities which
however well-meant is ill-considered and
dangerous. There is no precise yardstick
existing by which to measure the needs as
between the other provinces, nor indeed the
equitable treatment of Newfoundland. As I
have just intimated, your economy from the
Atlantic to the Pacific has been interwoven
and made to pattern over generations.
Inequalities may still exist, but time has
done much to provide the remedy. Our
economy to a great extent has to be re-made
to a new pattern which requires its own
treatment.
Being off in the Atlantic Ocean by ourselves, our trade-and it is by trade that our
people live-has not been interlocked with
Canadian trade any more than our politics

were joined with yours. Being producers of
goods which in the main are similar to those
produced in other parts of Canada, we found
our markets elsewhere, and in a great measure
we must continue to do so. For centuries
our fisheries have been supported by overseas trade. In these times of world upheaval,
when international commerce is complicated
and frustrated by inconvertible currencies
and restrictions of one kind and another
Newfoundland requires the special interest of
the Federal government to maintain the now
of goods which our people must produce to
live. In recent years Great Britain took us
under her wing in maintaining our European
trade for salted fish, which is vital to the
earnings of -a large portion of our people.
We exported our goods to certain European
markets under British trade and currency
clearance agreements in times when Canadian
exports to those same markets were much

restricted. Our European trade started more
than four centuries ago, and it has gone on
practically without interruption ever since.
It is a matter of vital concern that we be not
pushed out of these markets now in this
period of currency difficulties, and that our
plâce be not permanently taken by European
producers. We recognize that since the entry
of our province into the dominion this problem has received the close attention of the
federal government. No service that the
Government of Canada can render Newfoundland' is of greater urgency than this. Our
switch from the British tie to the Canadian
tie left this problem wide open. Unless the
flow of our salted fish to Europe can be maintained it will be disastrous to that branch
of the fisheries in the Maritime Provinces,
which would have to meet the competition
of our surplus supplies in the Western Hemisphere markets. One would indeed be fatalistic in his outlook if he were to regard such
measures of relief as are necessary in these
Extraordinary times as being of a permanent
character. We must certainly view the present international currency difficulties as
temporary, and all that is being done now
should be considered as just "holding the
line".
There is no other province that bas so little
opportunity of finding its basic trade within
the Dominion as has Newfoundland. Nearly
everything we produce is produced by the
other provinces, and in competing we are at
a geographical disadvantage. Canada is one
of the great exporting countries of the world,
and it may be of interest to point out that
the ratio of exports of Newfoundland to its
gross national product is nearly three times
as great as that of the dominion as a whole.
The whole dominion has a ratio of about 24
per cent of export trade to total national

SENATE
income. Newfoundland's ratio is 67 per cent.
Canada's ratio of imports is about 21 per cent,
while that of Newfoundland, if we include
purchases from other provinces as imports,
is almost 85 per cent. That is one of the outstanding problems of our province, particularly in these difficult times; but in the
over-all picture our export trade is of very
considerable advantage to the dominion. The
assistance which can be rendered by the
federal government in enabling Newfoundland to maintain its centuries-old trade with
soft currency areas, is a small matter compared to the other advantages that come to
Canada through our overwhelming dependence on exports. The greater part of our
export trade is to areas where we receive
dollars in payment, and in that no problem
exists. The margin requiring other currency
payments is relatively small, but is enough
to vitally affect the livelihood of a large proportion of our people.
When we were just friendly neighbours,
the fence between Canada and Newfoundland in foreign exchange was removed, and
we voluntarily placed ourselves under the
Foreign Exchange Control Board of Canada.
In times of Canada's great need for American
dollars, Newfoundland, through its earnings
by dollar exports, and by the American military base operations, contributed in some
years scores of millions of dollars to the
dominion. That contribution still goes on
in a very substantial measure.
From comments one frequently hears it
would almost appear that the impression is
held by many that the new province is
entirely on the receiving end of the CanadaNewfoundland union deal. Whether or'not
there is sufficient thought in that direction
to justify me in dwelling on the subject, some
facts of the province's contribution to the
dominion will not be amiss.
Giving and receiving is the essence of
good human relations, and you can be assured
that your new Canadian brothers will show
restraint in interpreting the sacred words"It is more blessed to give than to receive."
I have shown the vital interest that our
province has in exports. Conversely, we
have to bring into our province an unusual
proportion of the goods we consume. Historically, our importations were largely from
England and the United States. Just prior
to world war II, our purchases from the
Dominion of Canada ran about 35 per cent
of the total-mostly agricultural and dairy
products. We sflopped for the lowest prices
in all the world's markets, having custom
duties which applied equally to all countries,
except a minor preference on goods of British manufacture. In 1948, just before union,

we purchased from the dominion goods to
the value of about fifty million dollars, or
about 52 per cent of our total imports. These
purchases, of course, were on an export basis,
free of excise and sales taxes. With the
incoming of confederation and the substitution of the Canadian tariff, our own buying
position swung completely into the Canadian
orbit. While statistics are not available for
inter-provincial trade, it is safe to estimate
that we are now buying annually from the
other provinces from eighty to $100 million
worth of goods. The excess is made up
largely of manufactured products. This is
no mean figure in Canadian economy, and
reflects a substantial contribution to Canadian industry and government revenue. The
important fact to bear in mind in considering this aspect of our contribution to the
Dominion of Canada is that the sales from
Newfoundland to the other provinces still
remain in the vicinity of eleven million
dollars, that being the figure in 1948. In
that year Newfoundland was the fifth in
importance of the export markets of Canada.
It is fairly certain that the diversion of
trade to the other provinces since that time
would make the value of Newfoundland trade
comparable to that of Canada's third or
fourth most important export market. In
these days of multiple taxes, assessment on
goods as manufactured and sold, and on
corporation profits, the revenue of the federal
government on the volume of trade Newfoundland gives to the other provinces is
very considerable. I realize, of course, that
it is not possible to record the relative contribution of each province to the federal
revenue. The great manufacturing provinces
of Quebec and Ontario pay at the source on
the trade they do with other provinces that
are not so well established in manufacturing;
but there are probably more balancing factors on the mainland than apply to Newfoundland with its one-way trade.
Honourable senators, I have faith in the
future of our province. We are far from
outstanding in agricultural possibilities, but
that deficiency adds to the earnings of the
provinces which, in that regard, are more
generously blessed. Removed as we are from
the big centres of population, we shall not
in the foreseeable future be a great manufacturing province,
processing consumer
goods. Our progress will be in the development of our natural resources, for distribution to the markets of the world. Our great
iron mines at Wabana, situated at tidewater,
are right now undergoing great expansion.
Our mineral wealth, now being energetically
explored, appears likely to open up new
possibilities of importance. On our forest

FEBRUARY 8, 1951
resources have already been built two of
the greatest pulp and paper industries of
the world. We are now having a further
extension of the use of our forest wealth.
The great area of Labrador, with its ascertained forest resources, its undoubted mineral
possibilities, its unrivalled water power, its
fisheries and its climate-which is not nearly
as bad as its reputation-provide a setting
for future developments of great importance.
In assessing our future possibilities, it is
our fishing wealth which stands pre-eminent.
What it has produced in the past is no criterion for the future. Newfoundland was
populated by people from the British Isles
who came to fish. They scattered themselves
around in more than a thousand coves and
harbours, and on the headlands where fishing
was best. Salting was the only means of
preserving their products. No vocation in
life creates more self-reliance and sturdiness
than living off the sea. The life was a hard
one; but they stuck it out, for the sea was
in their blood. Those who came to Newfoundland to fish pioneered the trade from
the western hemisphere to Europe. In the
days when the standard of living was universally judged by whether or not there was
enough food to keep body and soul together,
they existed comparably with people elsewhere. They built their homes, their churches
and their boats. They enjoyed community
life.
But things have changed. It is idle to
speculate as to whether the old days were
better or more satisfying than the present.
Living standards of today are part and parcel
of our civilization. Only within the present
generation have Newfoundlanders had other
means of earning a living than by fishing,
and still 50 per cent of our people are
dependent upon the product of the sea. Only
in very recent years, with the development
of quick freezing and canning, has there
been a means of preserving the product other
than by salting. With the rapid increase of
population on the North American continent,
and the more palatable forms in which fish
can be preserved, the prolific supplies of
wide. variety along our coast will, to my
mind, cause a very great change in the
economic wealth of the province of Newfoundland. It will not come over night. It
will occur as rapidly as modern methods
of transportation and distribution to the
consumers of fresh and frozen fish are
developed. That development is under way,
and our fishing industry will, in the not
distant future, come into its own. Newfoundland capital and Newfoundland labour are
bringing about this change right now. Within

the last eight years or so, ten million dollars
-mostly local capital-have been invested in
new processing plants and refrigerated transportation in the province.
We are greatly encouraged by the active
interest that the federal Department of
Fisheries is taking in the problem of the
rehabilitation of our fishing industry. I cannot think of any other form of assistance that
can be rendered to the Province of Newfoundland that will produce such lasting benefits
in the economic life of our people. It is a
fortunate circumstance that the technical
services of that department are undergoing
great development at this early stage of our
entrance into the dominion.
The Province of Newfoundland is not standing aside and allowing the federal government to put things right in this adjustment
period. It is bravely striving to set its bouse
in order. Surveys of potential resources are
being actively undertaken; finances of the
province are being used to give .an impetus to
industrial development, and local private
capital is being invested to -a substantial
degree. Many of the manufacturing establishments, which produce a wide variety of goods
for local use, and employ several thousand
workers, have met the impact of competition
from the larger plants of the other provinces man-fashion by modernizing and fighting their way through. What is needed is
that public facilities and services, which are
a federal responsibility, be brought up to date
in the quickest possible time. These are
complementary to industrial progress. It is
true that expenditure for defence which puts
a great strain on public finance is of paramount importance. Nevertheless, in this
transitional period it is urgent that Newfoundland advance along the path of progress of the
other provinces, and that the economic level
of the people of Newfoundland be lifted to
that enjoyed by the people of the neighbouring provinces.
I have not the time, neither is this the
occasion, to particularize at length on the
details of such federal participation in these
matters. There are, two points, however, as
applying to industry-which subject is the
main theme of this talk-that I might mention. They have been emphasized by the
Premier of the province on more than one
occasion. The Industrial Development Bank
is, I understand, prevented under its charter
from rendering assistance to the fishing industry. I wonder why! Surely, so vital an
industry, one with such tremendous future
possibilities under modernized methods,
should not be debarred from the onerations of

52

SENATE

that institution. Another function which the
Federal Government could rightly undertake
is more active participation in industrial
resources surveys, which the province is flow
financing to a burdensorne degree.
Honourable Senators, I hoped I have flot
unduly delayed the progress of the debate.
1 have only tried to make some contribution
to the need, which I mentioned in the early
part of this Address, of making our province

and its problems better known to the people
of the rest of Canada.
Some Han. Senalars: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Grant: Honourable senators, I
move the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate

Prayers and routine proceedings.
FINANCE COMMITTEE
CONCURRENCE IN REPORT

Hon. T. A. Crerar presen-ted and moved
concurrence in the first report of the
Standing Committee on Finance.
The report was read by the Clerlc Assistant
as follows:
Your committee recommend that their quorum be

reduced to nine members.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, as a
member of this committee, may I ask when'
the committee met? No notice of the meeting was given to me.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The usual procedure
is to caîl a general meeting for organization
purposes. Ail senators who are named, by
the Committee of Selection attend this meeting and eiect the chairmen of ail standing
committees except the Committee on Divorce,
which elects its own chairman. Meetings of
the individual committees are flot; called at
the organization stage. However, this is a
young institution, and it may be possible to
make changes.
The motion was agreed to.
THE SENATE AND ITS WORK
MOTION

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved:
That a Special Comrmittee of the Senate be
appointed ta inquire into. and report upon. whatever action in its opinion may be necessary or
expedient to enable the Senate to make its maximum contribution to the welfare of the Canadian
people.

He said: Honourable senators, one day
shortly after I was appointed to the position
of leader of the government in the Senate, I
was forced to admit to the house, as I have
often had to do since, that there was no
business before us on the order paper. I
distinctly remember that an bonourable
senator sitting opposite-if I remember
correctly, the late Senator Ballantyneasked me if I would not use my good offices
with the government of the day to provide
the Senate with more work, and hie suggested specifically that more government
business might be introduced ini this house.
80713-6

I was only too willing to comply with his
request, which he presented in the courteous
manner cbaracteristic of bim.
At the first opportunity I sought an interview with the late Mr. Mackenzie King, who
was then Prime Minister. I explained my
problem, and bie at once agreed to place the
rxatter before bis colleagues. Subsequently
be did so. I was on the point of leaving
wben hie asked me to sit down, and in an
intimate and deligbtful conversation-such
as many honourable senators no doubt
recollect with pleasure-be proceeded to discuss with me the question of tbe Senate and
its functions. He took me back over the
years and mentioned tbe discussions which.
had taken place about the Senate since confederation. He told me about different times
when he and others had made proposais for
Senate reform, that books bad been written
on the subject and, as I understand it, that
some elections had been partly fought over
this question. He said that inevitably any
suggestion- of Senate reform arises to a
certain extent from the attitude of the government of the day, which perbaps has bad a
disagreement with the Senate, and tbinks
that something sbould be done about it. He
Said that over the years such differences of
opinion had been the cause of change in
Tbe
second bouses in various countries.
Prime Minister told me: "I have always bad
it in mind to do something about the Senate
before I cease to be Prime Minister, but
tbere are so many tbings to be done from
one day to another that it is difficuit for me
to concentrate on this question. I think
action should be taken at a time when the
relations between the two bouses are happy
ones, because then the change could be made
under very much better circumstances. After
all, any proposal that the government wouid
make would have to be concurred in by the
Senate." He .said: "My own view, for what
it is wortb, is that the Senate itself should
give consideration to this problem." Then
he turned to me and suggested that I, having
just assumed the responsibility of leader of
this bouse, at bis band, sbould take the
initiative. He went on to say that be could
give no undertaking; but that- if in due
course the Senate in its wisdom prepared
proposals whicb appealed to him as being
practical, and which would be looked upon
favourably by the country, he would submit
them to bis colleagues for consideration.
Honourable senators, needless to say I was
very much impressed by that convefsation. I
can particularly recall Mr. King speaking
about the growing complexity of modemn government, and how difficult it was for parliament to keep abreast of it all. He sald it was
a matter of regret that the Senate, whicb was

SENATE
equal in authority and responsibility with
the House of Commons, and which numbered in its membership men of vast experience and wide.general knowledge, could not
be made more use of in the general business
of the country. I returned to the Senate, and
in an informal way discussed this conversation with some of my colleagues. The idea
which had been advanced had a mixed reception. Some members were very much in
favour of it and, indeed, never ceased to
urge me to do something about it; others
were not so certain about it. I recall
one friend, who is not in the Senate now,
but whose judgment I depended upon a
great deal, being opposed to it. He did not
argue that sometime, somehow, some changes
would not have to be made, but he said to
me: "Your position is that of the government leader in the Senate, your responsibility
is to the government, to initiate legislation
and get it through, and the better your are
able to accomplish that the better you will
discharge your responsibility to those who
appointed you to office. True, you are also
leader of the Senate, but that is only incidental; your primary position is that of government leader". He went on to say: "You
are relatively new in this position, and my
advice to you is to concentrate on the business
of doing what you were appointed to do and
not worry too much about the Senate. It has
withstood a good many attacks and suggested changes of one kind and another. My
advice to you is to concentrate on carrying
out the duties of government leader." That
advice was very easy to follow then, and is
perhaps as easy to follow now. Primarily my
position was as outlined in that statement.
The government leader comes into this house
without having been chosen by his colleagues.
[ do not know what goes on behind the
scenes, but the peculiar fact is that the members of the Senate have nothing whatever to
do with the choice of their leader, except to
the extent that some of them may be able to
influence the government of the day.
So, honourable senators, from that day to
this, with one or two minor exceptions, I
have done nothing about the matter. But
it has been very much in my mind. I was
very proud and happy to be appointed to
this house. I consider appointment to the
Senate to be one of the greatest honours that
can come to anyone. It gives one an opportunity to render outstanding service to one's
country, particularly at a time when it is in
need of outstanding service, for, as Mr. King
said, the complexity of the problems that this
country faces and will continue to face is very
great. So far as I am concerned, I have

never ceased to thank my lucky stars that I
was appointed to the Senate, because I have
been in the past, and still am, desirous of
doing more than I have done.
May I say also that I have been delighted
to be associated with the men and women
who are members of this house. I doubt if
it is possible to find anywhere else, under
one roof, such an accumulation of talent and
of business and professional experience. We
have among our members, as we have had
in the past, leading newspaper publishers,
men who have achieved great distinction in
other lines of business, men representing in
a senior way all the primary industries,
prime ministers of provinces, senior ministers
of the Crown in both the federal and provincial fields-in short, men of such wide
experience and eminent ability in various
spheres throughout this country as to be able
to cope intelligently with any question that
comes before parliament. And it is to me, as
Mr. King said it was to him, a matter of deep
regret that, because of circumstances that
do not seem to be the responsibility of any
particular member, only a small fraction of
the ability and experience of our members
is utilized.
I repeat that I am proud of being a member of the Senate of Canada. So far as I know,
almost every country in the world has a
second legislative chamber in some form or
other. The reasons that brought this institution into being at the time of confederation
have kept it in being ever since, and in my
judgment they will keep it in being, in one
form or another, as long as Canada lasts.
But while I am proud to be part of this
institution, I regret to have to say that I
do not think it holds in the public mind today
the degree of prestige to which its past,
present and potential usefulness entitles it. My
placing of this notice of motion on the order
paper was not prompted by anything said to
me by the Prime Minister, or by any member
of the government or of this house, although
one or two senators have from time to time
urged me to do something about the matter.
If you like, it was my own conscience that
prompted me to the extent that I, a split personality so to speak-partly a representative

of the government, and to some degree at
least leader of the house-thought that I
should do something. Therefore I have placed
this motion before the house.
I am not going to promise that I shall not
take up the time of the house for some time
yet. What I am going to suggest that the
Senate should do is perhaps not very different

FEBRUARY 12, 1951
from what it is now doing; but I think that
in one way or another we might be able to
do more of it.
Now let me give my view as to what the
Senate should do.
1: First and foremost, I believe that the
Senate should continue to be the protector
of minority rights of all kinds. Though this
is the one most important reason for the
Senate's being called into existence and staying in existence up to the moment, it has
called for the least effort on the part of the
Senate, largely owing to the good judgment
of Canadian governments since confederation.
Nevertheless, the fact that the Senate bas to
pass upon government measures and has the
power to stop the passage through parliament
of those that it considers unfair, may have
had a deterrent effect on persons in government who otherwise might have put forward
proposals adversely affecting minority rights.
2: I think that the legislation that comes
before the Senate should be carefully studied
by us in all its stages. It goes without saying
that the study of legislation which is presented to us is one of our primary functions;
and without doubt, under prevailing practices
such legislation receives the most intensive
study in the Senate standing committees to
which it is invariably referred. An enviable
reputation for thoroughness in this respect
has been built up in the past. But the system
has two shortcomings. The first is that, for
one reason or another, the attendance at a
committee represents a relatively small portion of the total membership of the house;
and the second is that little or no publicity is
given to the work done. At various times
individ-ual senators have urged that we should
undertake a detailed consideration of legislation in Committee of the Whole House when
the bills are reported back from the standing
committees. Personally I have never objected
to this suggestion, although I have been
doubtful of its value unless there were provided greater facilities than exist at present
for the answering of questions which honourable senators might ask. There is no doubt
that in actual practice the failure to examine
legislation in Committee of the Whole House
deprives many senators of the opportunity of
participating in the consideration of legislation, and this failure eliminates an excellent
source of publicity as to the extent of the
Senate's work.
3: It should give the most careful consiieration to governmental expenditures.
While examination of the estimates by
Senate committees last year showed a considerable advance over previous years, there
is still room for improvement. It might be
80713-61

possible to have them also considered in the
Senate itself, through the medium of an
appropriate committee of the bouse. Needless
to say, the necessary facilities for explanation
in the house would have to be provided. I
would again point out that though the work
in committees is thorough, for some reason
only a relatively small proportion of the
membership of this bouse attends the
meetings.
4: The Senate should undertake at least
one public inquiry each session into some
problem of current public interest, and it
should report its conclusions. Through the
initiative of individual senators, inquiries of
this type have been carried on in recent
years, and I believe that a public service bas
thereby been rendered. This practice should
be continued.
5: The Senate should so constitute itself as
to play a useful and acceptable role in the
relations between federal and provincial
authorities, now that we are in the process of
acquiriig the right to amend our own constitution. In recent months the representatives of the federal and provincial governments have been discussing methods of amending the Canadian constitution in Canada. At
present the method of amending our constitution bas been by way of an Address from
the Senate and House of Commons to His
Maiesty the King, praying that a measure
covering the desired amendment be laid
before the Parliament of the United Kingdom.
As a matter of practice the British Parliament
bas always acquiesced in constitutional
amendments proposed by both Houses of
Parliament of Canada. But it has been contended that if a highly controversial matter
developed, the Parliament of the United
Kingdom would become the protector of
territorial and minority rights. When the
time comes that we have power to deal with
this important matter in Canada, the responsibilities of the Senate will be even greater
than they are today. The protection of
minority and territorial rights will, I suggest
be one of the duties of the Senate, and this
bouse should be so constituted as to be in a
position to discharge that responsibility to
the satisfaction of all concerned.
6: While in no way seeking an enlargement of its constitutional powers, the Senate
should seek a mutually acceptable agreement
with the House of Commons to share with
that body some of its ever-increasing responsibilities, thereby lightening its load. I cannot
undertake to say in detail in what way this
can be accomplished, but I base the reasonableness of my suggestion on the simple fact
that the House of Commons bas more work
than it can accomplish without sitting night
and day on a tiring and exhausting schedule

SENATE

We who have equal responsibility have time
to spare, and are willing to share the load.
This has been accomplished by mutual agreement as regards the disposal of divorce legislation. It might well be possible to accomplish it in some other matters as well.
May I now say a few words about my conception of the position and responsibility
of the Senate generally? I am indebted to
our Law Clerk and Parliamentary Counsel
for a very excellent paper which he prepared
last year on the ideas which the Fathers of
Confederation had in mind when confederation was being proposed.
In introducing the motion for the approval
of the resolutions passed at the Quebec Conference in the House of Assembly of Upper
Canada, and after discussing the difficulties
which had existed in the relations between
the two Houses in the Legislature of Upper
Canada, Attorney-General Macdonald, afterwards Sir John A. Macdonald, spoke of the
Upper House to be established under the
Canadian Constitution, as follows:
The Council was becoming less and less a substantial check on the legislation of the Assembly;
but under the system now proposed, such will not
be the case. No ministry can in future do what
they have done in Canada before-they cannot,
with the view of carrying any measure, or of
strengthening the party, attempt to overrule the
independent opinion of the Upper House by filling
it with a number of its partisans and political supporters. The provision in the Constitution, that the
Legislative Council shall consist of a limited number
of members-that each of the great sections shall
appoint twenty-four members and no more, will
prevent the Upper House from being swamped from
time to time by the ministry of the day, for the
purpose of carrying out their own schemes of pleasing their partisans. The fact of the government
being prevented from exceeding a limited number
will preserve the independence of the Upper House,
and make it, in reality, a separate and distinct
chamber, having a legitimate and controlling influence in the legislation of the country.
The
objection has been taken that in consequence of
the Crown being deprived of the right of unlimited
appointment, there is a chance of a dead-lock
arising between the two branches of the legislature;
a chance that the Upper House being altogether
independent of the Soverein. of the Lower House.
and of the advisers of the Crown, may act independently, and so independently as to produce a deadlock. I do not anticipate any such result. In the
first place we know that in England it does not
arise. There would be no use of an Upper House
if it did not exercise, when it thought proper, the
right of opposing or amending or postponing the
legislation of the Lower Hous.e. It would be of no
value- whatever were it a mere chamber for registering the decrees of the Lower House. It must
be an independent house, having a free action of its
own, for it is only valuable as being a regulating
body, calmly considering the legislation initiated by
the popular branch, and preventing any hasty or
ill-considered legislation which may come from that
body, but it will never set itself in opposition
t
aga nst the deliberate and understood wishes of the
people.

I believe, honourable senators, that Sir
John A. Macdonald and the other Fathers
of Confederation contemplated that the upper
house would be an independent house, and
that its constitution would prevent it ever
becoming swamped by any one party. However, I am quite sure the Fathers of Confederation never considered the possibility
that the efflux of time would bring about, in
as effective a way as if there had been
unlimited power of swamping, a composition
of the membership which they sought to
avoid. Honourable members will recall that
when senators were appointed to represent
three divisions, the British North America
Act provided that, if at any time it was
deemed fit, two additional senators for each
division, or a total of six, could be appointed.
With the amendment of the Act by which a
fourth section was added, provision was made
for the appointment of a total of eight additional senators, two from each division. This
would hardly be regarded as power to swamp,
in the ordinary sense of the term.
I emphasize the fact that the conception
was that this bouse would be independent
and would act in a semi-judicial capacity; and
I believe it has fulfilled its functions in this
regard. Speaking with a background of some
experience, for I have been government leader
for five and a half years, I confess that my
most difficult moments in this bouse have
been when the fate of some piece of government legislation which I have introduced has
hung in the balance. Those difficult moments
have not been occasioned wholly by the official opposition; they have come in large
measure from honourable senators nominated
by the same government that appointed me.
I believe that this house adopts a much more
judicial attitude towards legislation than the
country gives it credit for. But while it is
important to maintain this attitude, it is no
less important to have it recognized by the
public.
One of our problems at the moment is
that, because of unusual conditions, the
number of members of one party-appointees
of a Liberal government-has exceeded in
the last two or three years any party majority
which has existed since Confederation. That
disbalance is likely to become even greater
in the next few years. That problem, I think,
is one to which we should address ourselves
if we desire the Senate to maintain the
appearance of being what the Fathers of
Confederation desired it to be, an independent
house.
Until about 1945 the maximum number of
senators appointed by any one government,
representing either of the two major political

FEBRUARY 12, 19b1
parties, was sixty-three. There were in 1896
sixty-three Conservatives, ten Liberals, and
three Independents. By 1912 the positions
had been reversed, and the composition of
the bous"e was then seventeen Conservatives,
fifty-seven Liberals, and fine others. The
proportions varied from time to time until
1930, when appointees ôf the Liberal government numbered fifty, to forty-six Conservatives; by 1936, just before the elections, the
number of Conservatives had increased to
sixty-three. At the present moment, as
honourable senators know, eighty members
have been appointed by Lîberal governments;
there are eleven vacancies, which, were they
filled on the same basis as heretofore, would
make a total Liberal membership of ninetyone, and the officiai opposition consists of
eleven senators. What the future has in store
we do not know, but I think there cannot
be the slightest doubt that the situation which
has arisen is one that the Fathers of Confederation neyer anticipated, and although 1
have not lost sight of the practical questions
which must be faced in connection with these
matters, I will go so far as to say that it i.s
not a condition which commends itself to
the great body of the Canadian people.
In the light of this state of facts I intend
to make some suggestions which this committee, should it be set up, might consider,
although they are not intended to limit in
any way the scope of the committee's work.
1 would like thema to consider, first, what
policy might be devised to guarantee a
reasonably adequate representation in the
Senate of the various minority schools of
political thought. For seventy-five or eighty
years, conditions so operated that there was
neyer a time when the political thought of
the country was not adequately represented.
That situation does not now exist, and I
believe that as a coilsequence, in more ways
than one, the usefulness of the Senate has
been impaired. From. somewhat the same
point of view I would lîke the committee
to seriously consider what changes are likely
to occur when Canada obtains the right to
amend her own constitution. Provided that
virtually its entire membership is flot drawn
from. one segment ýof political thought, the
Senate was in a position to play a very
useful part in connection with the constitutional relations which will obtain between
the provinces and the federal government.
Once the right to amend our -constitution
has been obtained, should 100 per cent of
the Senate membership represent only one
political party, and that party be in power,
it might be that the provinces would not be
encouraged to regard the Senate as the sheet
anchor of their constitutional rights. So, for

more roasons than one, I hope the committee,
if appointed, will give this subi ect their
serious consideration.
I recali a saying of Sir John A. Macdonald
to the eff ect that while it is in the power
of the Senate to criticize and amend and
postpone, it cannot set itself against the other
house. I believe that view is absolutely
sound. The membership of the other place
represents the people, and as such its will
must finally prevail. As long ago as the time
of confederation, some honourable senators
and other people were of the opinion that our
systemn of appointments remove us too far
from the public; and there have always been
those who advocatecl an elective Senate. I
can see the argument in favour of it, but I
am opposed to it. It bas occurred to me,
however, that a useful compromise might be
reached.
1 would suggest that the semijudicial cbaracteristics of the Senate be maintained by appointîng two-tbirds of its
members as at present, and the remaining
one-third for five-year terms, at the expiration of wbich they should be eligible for
re-appointment.
Han. Mr. Farris: By whom. would they be
appointed?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: That would *be a
matter of detail. I doubt very much whether
any system could be adopted that would take
away from. any central autbority the appointment of senators.
Mind you, honourable
senators, we could recognize various types of
political thought just as easily as we have
recognized Canadian publie opinion on matters wbich are flot covered by our statutes.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: For instance, the
cabinet.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Or in the appointment
of Senators. For instance, in the matter of
appointing senators there have been no
statutory provisions stating that a man shall
be a Protestant or a Catbolic, or that he be
of this or that racial origin. But down.
through the yearscertain practices have beerk
followed, and because tbey have appealed to,
the common sense of the great mai ority of
people, they have ahnost had the force of law.
If this can be true of one tbing, it can be
true of another.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Wîll the honourable
leader permit me to ask a question?
Han. Mr. Robertson: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: If it were required that
ail or some senators return every five years
in order to have their re-appointment
confirmed by the appointing authority would

SENATE

that not destroy the independence of the
Senate, to which my honourable friend has
subscribed?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Does my honourable
friend ask why, if it is good for one-third of
the membership of the Senate it is not good
for three-thirds?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Exactly.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: That is a fair question, and I think that my proposals might

have been somewhat different had I discussed
these various points with a cross-section of
my colleagues. Perhaps I can answer my
honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck) by merely repeating that I
believe the essential characteristic of the
Senate is its semi-judicial capacity. This
objective might be achieved with a membership of ninety-six

senators as satisfactorily

the age of seventy-five. In passing, however, I would suggest that the compulsory
retiring age be seventy-five, and that upon
retirement pensions be provided from a contributory pension fund, and that the recipient
could elect that half his pension be paid to
his dependent on a basis similar to that
which is in effect for Suprerne Court judges.
These proposals have to do with the future
and not with present members; but, as honourable senators are aware, on more than
one occasion the wife of a senator has
suffered great hardships when left stranded
by his death.
I also suggest that consideration be given
to substituting for the position of "Leader
of the Government in the Senate" some new
machinery that would enable Senate members to be better informed on all aspects of
government policy, and which at the same
time would provide the Senate with leader-

as by a membership of a hundred and two
senators, just so long as appointments are ship of its own choosing.

FEBRUARY 12, 1951
and legislation. But this Senate of 102
members depends on how many for information? On just one. It is true that when a
bill is sent to committee the minister of the
department concerned will, at our request,
appear with his deputy and other departmental officials to answer any questions that
we may wish to put. But besides being able
to obtain information through standing committees, members of the House of Commons
and of every legislature can question ministers in Committee of the Whole.
My point is that in the Senate, to which
all legislative measures have to be submitted,
it is not possible for a senator to receive in
Committee of the Whole the information
which he is entitled to receive. To be able
to give a full explanation of every measure
that comes before us would require far more
ability and knowledge than I think any one
person possesses, unless he be a superman,
and I certainly make no claim to being that.
The fact is that my honourable friends opposite have been very tolerant. When they
have asked for more information than I
happened to have at hand, they have been
willing to wait for it, a week or two if
necessary, and have not complained. But
how much easier it would be to discuss
legislation intelligently here if there were
always present someone with a thorough
grasp of the whole matter being dealt with,
and if when a measure was being considered
clause by clause he was able to call upon one
or two departmental officials for the fullest
particulars upon any details.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: May I interrupt the
honourable leader? Do we not get full
information in our standing committees
now? Every member of the Senate has a
right to attend the sittings of any committee,
whether he is a member of it or not. I
personally can say that I have never left a
committee to which a bill was referred without feeling that I had ai the information that
I required.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Time and time again
I have emphasized in this house that every
senator is entitled to attend meetings of any
committee, whether he is a member of the
committee or not. But I think we will all
agree that in practice there are always some
senators who feel diffident about coming to
meetings of committees to which they do not
belong. That is particularly true of junior
senators. But whatever the reason for nonattendance of some senators, I can point to
bill after bill which has been considered in
committee by only a relatively small percentage of our total membership.
Now I come to another suggestion. I
seriously think that if the Senate is to be

what it is supposed to be, it should elect its
own leader, subject to its will. That is a
power commonly possessed by groups of persons banded together for any specific purpose.
I would elect the Senate leader at regular
intervals, say every five years, and have him
subject to recall, and generally deriving his
power from the house, as is usual in parliamentary institutions.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: Suppose the Senate
elected a Liberal as its leader, and the colour
of the other house changed very much from
what it is today. Would that Liberal senator
be given a seat in a Conservative government?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I suggest that the
leader of this house should not be a member
of the government. I am government leader
here by appointment, and I am leader of the
Senate by default, because no one else has
been appointed to the position. The members
of this house did not choose me, and whether
they want me or not as leader they can do
nothing about it. We have said time and
again that this is an independent house, and
I contend that an independent house ought
to be able to elect its own leader, whose
responsibility it would be to co-operate with
the administration of the day-no matter to
what political party the members of that
administration belonged-in expediting the
business of parliament according to the will
of the majority in the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I should like to ask a question of the honourable leader. Suppose the
Senate had been empowered to elect its own
leader, and suppose-it will take a lot of
imagination to consider this as at all possible,
but I am putting it just for the sake of the
argument-suppose that when the new parliament met at the middle of September, 1949,
a majority of senators had said, "John T.
Haig, we elect you our leader."
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: What would have happened?
Though then a member of the government, it
is quite possible that I should have had to
recommend to this house that certain government legislation be not passed. I think that
kind of thing would result in chaos.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I will take my honourable friend up on that argument. To begin
with, I am suggesting that the leader of the
Senate should not be a member of the government. And, secondly, I say that the representation of the government in this house is
a most important matter, so important that it
ought to be much better done than it is at
present, so far as concerns the giving of information to this house on government policy
and measures. I think that any possible
government, to whatever political party its

SENATE
members may belong, would have the
co-operation of this house. It is quite possible
that if a Conservative government were to
win the confidence of the House of Commons
tomorrow some people here might think that
government measures coming over for our
consideration were not up to the standard of
measures which used to come from the government when composed of Liberals; but I
feel sure that the Senate would co-operate
fully and treat every measure on its merits,
as it has done in the past. During the last
fifty years nearly every government has for
most of its period of office had a majority
against it in the Senate. Laurier had a majority against him here until almost 1912. Someone told me the other day-I think it was
the senator from Sherbrooke (Hon. Mr.
Howard)-that it was not so very long ago
when Mr. King said, "With that appointment
I shall for the first time have a majority of
Liberals in the Senate." I believe that the
leader of the bouse should not be fixed with
responsibility of the government by whom he
has been appointed and also have responsibility as a member of this bouse. I think
the two functions should be separated.
Hon. Mr. Davies: May I ask the honourable
gentleman a question? Does not the leader
of the government in this chamber of necessity have to be a member of the cabinet? If
he is not, how is he going to interpret the
view of the government on legislation presented to ýthis louse? Further, is it likely
that a leader appointed by this bouse would
be acceptable to the Prime Minister?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I again point out that
the government of the day appoints its leader
in the Senate to handle its legislation and
get the estimates passed. It so happens that
when a senator is appointed to represent the
government in this house he simultaneously
takes the position of leader of the Senate, by
reason of there being no other leader. In this
sense I refer to a majority leader, and I am
not speaking disrespectfully of my honourable
friend.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Is it not true that, if we
chose to do so, we could now appoint a leader
of the Senate, apart from the leader of the
government?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Certainly, it is true.
I would remind honourable senators that
when I considered speaking on this subject
on a previous occasion, a senator counselled
me not to bother. He said that my job was
to get legislation passed and to get estimates
voted with as little discussion in the bouse
as possible, and that if I did this I was doing
a good job. My view is that however good
that may be for the government I represent,

it is not a healthy state of affairs for the
Senate. We all know that when a club or
organization is formed, it immediately elects
a president, or leader, and he is continued in
office at the discretion of the organization.
Hon. Mr. King: By the appointment of one
leader it is assumed that this house is to be
of one mind. That just does not happen
here. If one leader is appointed, a second
leader should also be appointed.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I would suggest that
the question of who is to present the legislation is a mere detail. I come back to the
original conception that the Senate is to be
an independent body; and as such, it seems
to me, it is most elementary that it should
have its own leader who would co-operate
with the administration of the day. My view
is that the members of this bouse should not
be dependent upon having a leader sent to
them, as though they were not capable of
choosing one for themselves.
I must apologize to the house for having
taken so much time, but I have said what
I have because I am proud of this institution
and think it can make a greater contribution
to the people of Canada than it bas made
in the past. Honourable senators will, I trust,
treat my remarks as merely opening the
discussion. I hope that everyone will participate in it. Some may agree in whole or
in part with what I have said, while others
may disagree with me entirely. In any event,
I reserve the right to change my mind on
the subject after having heard the thoughts
of my honourable friends.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I do not intend to continue the debate tonight,
but I would like to say a few words to avoid
any misunderstanding. The remarks of the
honourable leader have been most interesting.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: May I rise to a point of
order? This motion has not as yet had a
seconder.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: It has been seconded
by the senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen).
Hon. Mr. Haig: Since my appointment as
leader on this side of the house in September,
1945, a most happy relationship has existed
between the leader of the government and
myself. Although on questions that come
before us we disagree more often than we
agree, I wish to say publicly that during all
this time he has never misled me by anything he said, and I have tried to accord him
the same consideration.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

FEBRUARY -12, 1951
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: Is it like "Freeman
and Stubbs, buttering each other from alternate tubs?"
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It has been suggested by
some of my friends in this house that such a
discussion as this might not be advisable. I
regret to say that I cannot agree with them.
In my opinion there is a tremendous misunderstanding on the part of the public as to
the purpose and work of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Would my friend include
parliament generally in that statement?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Perhaps we should include
both houses. But I do not think there is
much misunderstanding of the Senate on the
part of members of the other house, for
whenever one of them has an opportunity to
come here, he never publicly refuses. There
are many university professors and others
who rely on gossip appearing in the press,
and who have an entirely wrong impression
of the purpose of the Senate.
I am going to try to bring to the public
some information about what the Senate has
done in the past, what it is doing today, and
what it hopes to do in the future. If every
member of this house will take part in the
discussion, I am sure it will be thoroughly
worth while.
I agree with the honourable leader that no
more important appointment can be given to
a man or a woman in Canada than an appointment to the Senate. The responsibility resting on this house is very great. For my part,
I am not very much worried about whether
the composition of its membership is all
Liberal, all Conservative or what have you.
We need only go through the record to learn
that Sir Wilfred Laurier had very little
trouble with the Senate until he got a majority in it. The same is true of Sir Robert
Borden. When the Right Honourable Mr.
Bennett came into power his party was in the
minority in the Senate, but as soon as he
gained a. majority his legislation got kicked
all around.
Before concluding these few remarks, I
plead with all the members of my party to
take part in this debate, regardless of whether
or not they agree with my views on the question. If we have a full discussion the public
will understand the matter thoroughly. I am
quite sure that none of us want to be members of this house if we fail to give adequate
service to the people of Canada.
Honourable senators, I move the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. H. King moved the second reading
of Bill E, an Act respecting the British
Columbia Telephone Company.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to increase the authorized
capital of the company from $25 million to
$75 million. The growth in population of
the province and the area served by this
telephone company has been of a character
and kind to make further large expenditures
necessary. The company estimates that it
will require an expenditure of $10 million
per year for the next few years.
The company inaugurated an expansion
program in 1946, and has issued the capital
authorized to the extent of $20 million. I am
informed by the company that it is proposed
to issue the remaining $5 million of stock
shortly, probably before this bill is assented
to by the house.
The company operates 90 per cent of the
telephone lines, and the major portion of the

SENATE
long distance lines, in the province of British
Columbia. The population of that province
as computed by the Bureau of Statistics on
June 1, 1950, was 1,138,000, and of this number, 900,000, or 79 per cent of the population,
reside in territory served by the British
Columbia Telephone Company.
Between 1940 and 1950 the population of
British Columbia has grown from 805,000 to
1,138,000, an increase in ten years of 41-4
per cent. The increase in population in the
whole of Canada during the same period was
only 21-7 per cent. Since the end of 1945
the number of telephones of the company
has increased from 163,135 to 246,486, an
increase to December 31, 1950, of 50 per
cent. Notwithstanding this gain in stations,
the conpany had on file at December 31,
1950, 22,967 unfilled applications for service.
Surveys and economic studies indicate that a
heavy demand for service will continue for
some time. The company regrets that it has
not been able to fill all the applications on
hand, but this is partly due to the extraordinary population increase, and partly to
the difficulty of securing equipment and
material for these extensions.
In the year 1940 the company completed
1,688,397 originating long distance messages.
In 1950 they completed 5,469,408 such messages-a gain of 224 per cent. It is estimated that the originating long distance messages in 1951 will exceed 6,000,000.
The company serves the capital city of
Victoria and many outlying stations on Vancouver Island. It also serves the city of
Vancouver-the third largest city in Canada
-Greater
Vancouver, New Westminster,
adjoining municipalities, the Fraser Valley,
and the Kamloops district. It also has stations
throughout the Kootenay as far east as the
Crowsnest, including the towns of Trail,
Nelson, Creston, Cranbrook, Kimberley and
Golden, covering that important section of
the province. It connects with the northern
portion of the province, and utilizes on a toll
basis the government lines to Prince George,
and the Canadian National line from Prince
George to Prince Rupert. That gives it a
coverage in the northern portion of British
Columbia.
I have stated the main financial proposal
in the bill. There are two other proposals.
It is provided that the company be allowed
hereafter to issue preference or preferred
shares of a par value of either $25, or $100
each; to make provision for the subdivision
of any outstanding preference or preferred
shares of a par value of $100 each into shares
of a par value of $25 each, if deemed advisable by the directors, and subject always to
OnuTRA .xd ui ;uao iad s± ;suau ;e je ;uasuoo @q;

of the holders of each class of such preference
or preferred shares proposed to be subdivided.
This proposal is in line with what is taking
place in the larger companies, industrial,
insurance, banks and others, who wish to
make their stock more generally available to
the public, realizing that the public should
have an opportunity of owning or buying
stock and sharing in the profits that may come
from their business.
The company also asks that it be allowed
to pay a commission on 'the sale of its shares.
At the present time that is not permitted. It
will be done under the supervision of, and
the rate of commission to be paid will be
determined by the Board of Transport
Commissioners.
Telephone service has become one of the
most important public utilities in Canada. A
telephone is almost a necessity in every
home, office and business; and I have no doubt
that the moneys asked for the company will
be utilized not only for the advantage of the
company, but for the benefit of the people
of British Columbia.
Should the bill receive Royal Assent and
become law, stock issues of the company will
remain subject to the approval of the Board
of Transport Commissioners.
I think I have covered the three main features of the bill. If honourable senators
are sufficiently interested to read the bill,
they will find that the explanatory notes set
out the objects of the proposed legislation.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. King moved that the bill be

Hon. Norman P. Lambert moved the second
reading of Bill H, an Act respecting
The Dominion Association of Chartered
Accountants.
He said: Honourable senators, I should just
like to say a few words in explanation of
this bill. It simply asks for the change of
name of The Dominion Association of
Chartered Accountants, which was incorporated in 1902. At the annual meeting

present name would be changed to that of The

at the several conferences when Messrs.
Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin met, but who
accompanied Mr. Churchill to Moscow when
he met Stalin alone on the occasion of his
first meeting with the Russian dictator. Mr.
Churchill evidently had a very high opinion
of Mr. Harriman, and Mr. Harriman is one
of the few men living who know the intimate
history of all negotiations with the Soviet,
both past and current. He is today special
adviser on foreign affairs to President
Truman.
I was interested yesterd-ay to read in the
New York Times the following extracts from
a speech which Mr. Harriman delivered at
Philadelphia on Saturday before the World
Affairs Council of Philadelphia, at the University of Pennsylvania. Referring to the
present world situation, he said.:
This struggle cannot be won by any single method
-not by military strength only, nor exclusively by
economic and social programs, nor by moral force
alone. Anyone who attempts to find an easy way
out by concentrating on one area or one phase of
the conflict does not understand the character of the
threat we face and is courting disaster.

Expressing impatience with "people who
try to feel the pulse of the French and British
every day, as to whether they will fight or
not, Mr. Harriman said:
We Americans should remember there was a time
when people in Europe were wondering whether we
would fight. We gave them their answer, and they
will answer us when they are ready.

Mr. Harriman went on to say that

the

leaders of the Soviet Union are engaged in "a
financial mission" to impose their system on

the rest of the world, "and no country is
exempt from their designs."

He stated that

they have a world-wide strategy that "can
only be met by a global strategy" centred in
Washington.
He voiced "implicit confidence" in the outcome of the free nations' struggle against
the threat of communist domination. Having
"gained the initiative" through the Marshall
Plan and the North Atlantic Treaty, as Mr.
Harriman put it, the democracies are
strengthening the situation by building up
collective military forces in Europe under
General Eisenhower, by resisting aggression
in Korea, and by United States economic and
technical assistance to independent peoples.
And he made this significant statement:

unfortunate that civilization has not in its
higher development reached that stage where
reason and mutual trust and confidence will
prevail. It is evident that force and power
are still required. As in the government of
our cities and, communities the force of law
is still necessary to maintain order, so in
international affairs the policeman with a
strong arm is essential for the maintenance
of world peace. Great Britain, in the days of
its might and power, and with the assistance
of the British taxpayer, supplied that police
power, and the people of the rest of the world,
including those in the North American continent, relaxed under that protection and
thought the world a pretty good place to live
in. Today the world must look for another
policeman: the United Nations must take on
the job.
On one occasion when Lord Beaverbrook
was addressing some university graduates I
heard him say something like this:
If a man is to be successful he must be able to
cope with the uncertainties of life and learn to
improvise when occasion demands.

He pointed to Mr. Churchill's gift for
improvisation and stressed the fact that it
was this ability of that many-talented statesman which enabled him to lead England
through, particularly in the early days of
the war when she fought alone. Now, with
Lord, Beaverbrook's statement in mind, it
would appear that quick decisions again
might be necessary to meet world-wide
strategy with what Mr. Harriman describes
as "global strategy"-in Korea today, Iran
tomorrow, Yugoslavia next day.
It may be that the United Nations Security
Council will be required to improvise. At any
rate, during these momentous days its
machinery is on trial.

We pray that it may

be flexible enough to meet every thrust and
strong enough to restrain evil forces and
keep the peace. It should have the active
support of all free men the world over, for
tonight our Christian civilization depends
upon it.
In closing I wish to commend the policy
that our Secretary of State for External
Affairs has adopted on that Council. I feel
that he deserves the support and sympathy
of every member of this house.

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. P. H. Bouffard moved the second reading of Bill F, an Act to incorporate TransCanada Pipe Lines Limited.
He said: Honourable senators, I do not
think it is necessary to give a detailed
explanation of this bill. Its purpose is to
incorporate a company whose objective is
the construction of a gas pipe-line from the
province of Alberta to the city of Montreal.
It will serve the main centres along the lines
of the C.P.R. and C.N.R., and will have side
lines running through Toronto, Ottawa, Hull
and other' cities. The company may also
serve the territory eastward from Montreal
to Quebec.
It is an all-Canadian company which will
operate only in Canada. The proposed pipeline will measure about 2,200 miles in length
and, as I say, will serve the centres which I
have mentioned.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: What about Rosetown?
Hon. Mr. Euler: Where is it?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I have not got Rosetown
on my list, but if it is insisted upon that
Rosetown be served, and it is net too far off
the main line, we might give consideration
to running a line through there.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: The company intends
to spend a large sum of money in utilizing the
natural gas of Alberta. It will carry on its
work with the permission of the Gas Conservation Board of Alberta and it will also
adhere to any rulings handed down by the
It will be
Transport Board at Ottawa.
operated in accordance with the Pipe Line
Act.
The Trans-Canada Pipe Lines Limited is
an ordinary corporation with a capital stock
of 5 million shares. The clauses of incorporation are the usual ones found in similar
bills.

SENATE

At the beginning the pipe-line will carry
365 million cubic feet of gas per day, and it
may increase this amount to 500 million
cubic feet per day. The company will not
distribute the gas in any city in Canada, but
will make gross sales to the main distributing
companies across the country. In other
words, the company will not enter into competition with the existing distributing companies but will encourage the organization
of distribution companies to serve communities where gas is not now used. The company has entered into conversations with
most of the main distributing companies
operating where it is proposed to build the
pipe-line-among them being the Consumers
Gas Company of Toronto and the Montreal
Hydro Company-and it seems that it has
been greatly encouraged to spend money and
carry gas down east. At the present time
there is no company incorporated which proposes to operate east as far as Montreal. So
far as I know the only company which intends
to operate in the east at all is the Pacifie
Coast line, which will run to Winnipeg and
from there down to the States.
The financing of the company will be done
through the sale of its shares, and also the
sale of bonds and debentures. The company
intends to make a distribution of its bonds,
debentures and common stock amongst the
Canadian people to as great a degree as possible, so as to encourage investment in the
company among the people who will be consumers of its gas.
Hon. Mr. Lamber: Will my honourable
friend permit a question just here? In the
Montreal Gazette of this morning I noticed
that on the first page, prominently displayed,
there was a reference to this bill, and it
was stated that Texas capital would be
reprezented in it. Can my honourable friend
indicate the probable division of the capital
in the enterprise as between United States
and Canadian investors?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: The project bas not
advanced far enough to make it possible for
anyone to say anything definitely on that
point yet. The present sponsor of the whole
project is the Delhi Oil Company, a Canadian
concern, which is backed up by the Delhi
Oil Company of Texas. The company has
already spent a tremendous sum of money
in Alberta, and on the particular project
which this bill concerns it has already
expended more than $300,000. So far it has
been exclusively American money that has
been spent, but later the company intends
to invite Canadians to take as large an
interest as possible in the concern. I am sure
there will be a proper and just division of

the capital as between American and Canadian investors. It must not be forgotten that
the amount of money needed by the enterprise will be tremendous, at least $250
million.
May I say one more word about the whole
undertaking? If gas from Alberta is used
in the proposed project, Canadians will save
at least $60 million a year on their purchases
of oil and coal from United States fields. I
believe that in future we shall need to conserve our American funds, and therefore this
expected saving will be very much to the
good for the Canadian people.
If the bill is given second reading, I shall
move that it be referred to committee, where
an expert from the company will be present
to answer any technical questions that
honourable members may wish to ask. I
think that the mo ion for adoption of the
principle of the bill is not the proper stage
at which to discuss financial and other details.
Hon. Mr. Davies: May I ask the honourable
gen:leman a question? If this bill goes
through and the pipe line is built, does he
anticipate that there will be a reduction in
the cost of gas to the people of Ontario?
From what I have read in tne newspapers
today I gather that the price of gas to the
consumer is now quite high, and that it is
going to be higher. I wonder whether this
company which proposes to spend $250
million looks forward to a substantial reduction in cost to the consumer.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: It is rather difficult to
say what the reduction in cost will be, but
I would point out that the heating value of
natural gas is about twice that of artificial
gas manufactured from coal. In that way
the cost to the consumer will be reduced,
but we cannot now say to what extent. That
information may be available when the bill
is before the committee. I may say that the
companies which have been communicated
with as distribution outlets for the natural
gas are quite satisfied that they will be able
to sell better gas at a price that is lower
than today's price.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Will the large quantities
of gas to be brought to Eastern Canada by
this proposed line interfere in any way with
the export of gas to the west coast of the
Uni ed States? Is the supply sufficient to
take care of both markets?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: This question will be
submitted in detail to the Gas Conservation
Board of Alberta; but I would point out that
the gas to be exported to Eastern Canada
will come from other districts in Alberta
than the Peace River area, which is now the

FEBRUARY 13, 1951
source of the gas that is being exported te
the west coast. In any event, the Gas Conservation Board of Alberta will have the
matter placed before it, and it will decide
whether or not there is enough gas to serve
both eastern and western markets.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Does my honourable
friend anticipate a relaxation in the present
order of the Gas Conservation Board of
Alberta, which states that at the present
time there is no gas for export from that
province?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I understand that the
Gas Conservation Board has postponed the
consideration of all applications until next
September, when it will be in a better position than it is today to decide whether there
is enough gas for Alberta's needs and for
distribution all across Canada.
Hon. Mr. Davis: May I ask a question?
The Minister of Trade and Commerce last
Saturday issued an order restricting steel.
Does my honourable friend believe that he
can get enough steel to carry out this pipeline project?
Hon Mr. Bouffard: I regret that I cannot
answer that question at the present time, but
I shall try to get the information for my
honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. Gladstone: Honourable senators
will recall that in the session of 1950 there
was a prolonged debate in the other place
about the incorporation of various pipe-line
companies. As there will no doubt be many
applications this year, such a debate will
likely take place again. Whether we are for
or against the measure now before us, it
occurs to me that it might be well to delay
consideration of this bill and see what
develops.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Honourable senators,
my answer to that suggestion is that if we
want to know what will be the attitude of
the other bouse, at least one bill must be
submitted. I would point out that the long
debate which took place last year was
occasioned by the fact that the companies
then seeking incorporation wanted to distribute gas not only in Canada but in the
Southern United States, and that gave rise to
considerable opposition in the other place.
The attitude of the house was that the gas
should be kept for use in Canada. The bil
now before the Senate is to incorporate a
company to do the very thing which the
other house thought should be done, namely
distribute Canadian gas within Canada.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read a second time.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday, consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the opening of the
session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Stambaugh for an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. Thomas V. Grant: Honourable senators, this maiden speech of mine has been
postponed so

often that the few headings

which I have jotted down to keep me on
the track are beginning to look more like
a maiden lady.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Grant: This is the first time that
I have availed myself of the privilege rf
speaking in this historic chamber, and as it

SENATE
has been said that brevity is the soul not
only of wit but of wisdom, I shall try to
govern myself accordingly.
I wish at the outset to compliment the
newly-elected senator for Newfoundland
(Hon. Mr. Pratt) who spoke so ably in this
house on Thurday last. Mrs. Grant and I
visited Newfoundland two years ago, and we
returned home with many pleasant memories
of the good nature, humour and hospitality
of the people of that wonderful province.
I wish also to extend my sincere congratulations to the mover and the seconder of
the Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne. The address of the mover was very
and persuasive;
interesting, educational
indeed, had one not known better, one
might have been led to believe that Alberta
is a finer province than Prince Edward
Island. I read the address of the seconder;
and, having listened in the past twenty years
or more to many speeches on similar
occasions, I am convinced that it is up to the
highest standard of addresses of this kind.
Perhaps, on account of my age and waning
ambition, I did not come into the Senate with
any intention of taking a hand at reforming
it. But I should like to repeat something
which I have said on several occasions-that
it is a shame that the Speaker and his lady
should be obliged to stand for hours shaking
hands with the hundreds of people who attend
their receptions.
The practice has come
down, I suppose, from the days when there'
were no chairs, and people either sat on the
ground or stood up. Surely this primitive
practice might be changed by providing
cushioned chairs and nice footstools so that
the Speaker and his wife could shake hands
in comfort with people as they pass by.
Though I do not want to discuss the reform
of the Senate, because on this occasion it
might be a little premature, let me say now
that I am absolutely opposed to the principle
of an elective Senate.
Sone Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Grani: I shall give at least two
reasons for this. For the past twenty-five
years I have been running elections in the
interest of the Liberal party; and for ten years
previously, I was secretary-treasurer of the
party in my district. I succeeded in making
the county pretty safe for :the Liberal party,
and I enjoyed the work very much, although
I lost a great deal of time. However, I was
young then. But just one year before my last
election the Conservatives very wisely persuaded my old opponent, whom I was accustomed to defeating, to retire. I understand
they promised to put him in the Senate if their
party gained power. He was a good man,
and well worthy of the distinction. My new

opponent was a young man, a native of my
constituency, and a member of one of the
very best families. His word is as good as
his bond in any part of the province. He is
an honest lawyer.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hooray!
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Grani: Were I in trouble I would
engage him as rny lawyer. However, he was
nominated to run against me, and while I
was here in Ottawa at the session he was
going all over the county organizing and preparing for the election. To make a long story
short, although he did not defeat me, he cut
my small majority in half and sent me to bed
for three months.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Anyway, he was an honest
man!
Hon. Mr. Grani: He was a good man. I
ask, what condition would I have been in
following that experience, to fight an election contest against such an opponent for a
seat in the Senate. The elective principle
might have worked well for thd Conservative
party had it been in effect at the time.
I do not want to occupy too much time with
personal references, but I should like to mention, by way of illustrating my point, the
name of John R. MacNicol. No better representative of any party ever occupied a seat in
the other place. Mr. MacNicol ran elections
all his adult life; and it seems strange to me
that in 1935 the Right Hon. R. B. Bennett,
knowing that he was going to be defeated,
did not find a place for Mr. MacNicol in
the Senate. At the last election Mr. MacNicol
was defeated by a man in his twenties. It is
not impossible that Mr. MacNicol's defeat
hastened his death: had he been appointed to
the Senate he might have been alive today,
serving with us as one of our finest and ablest
members.
I repeat that to my mind the elective principle is unfair. We cannot go as fast as these
young fellows. They can do more canvassing
in a week than we could do in a month. I
am reminded of an incident which occurred
while I was in the other place. Two Social
Credit members occupied seats side by side
at the same desk One of these men was a
tall fellow; the other, a short man, was the
wittiest member of the house. Last year I
noticed that the tall member was no longer in
his old seat, and one day, while at the post
office, I met the shorter man and asked him,
"Where is your chum? Is he not here?" He
replied, "No, he is not here." I said, "Did
he run?" "Yes", was the answer "he ran,
but he didn't run fast enough."
To tell the truth, I was pretty glad to be
transferred into the Senate. My feelings are

FEBRUARY 13, 1951
well expressed by the remark of an old
farmer friend of mine who, when he heard I
was in the Senate, said "Poor Dr. Grant got
into Heaven without having to die for it."
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Grant: I feel that I am now
associated with the cream of Canadian public
life.
An Hon. Senator: We believe you.
Hon. Mr. Grant: In proof of this I need only
point to my two colleagues from Prince
Edward Island, the honourable senator from
Mount Stewart (Hon. Mr. McIntyre) and the
honourable senator from Prince (Hon. Mr.
Barbour). Both these men began life in
very humble surroundings, from poor but
honest homes, both went into business in their
respective counties; both made great success
in business; both entered politics; both became
Ministers of Public Works in turn, and both
were the best Ministers of Public Works
Prince Edward Island ever had. Should men
with this kind of background be required to
run for election to the Senate against some
young, well-trained athlete?
A noted author recently wrote in The
Martime Advocate:
I like to write sketches of maritimers who have
achieved success in their own province. The man
who is successful at home deserves far more credit
than does the man who goes far afield, for the
reason that it is harder to succeed in ones' own

province than it is to achieve greatness in a far off
country.

Honourable senators, I have been getting
somewhat personal, but I should like to refer
to a few other honourable gentlemen in this
chamber. First, let me mention the honourable leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig).
I remember him when he used to come over
and sit in the gallery of another place, where
I believe he attended the sittings more than
any other senator. Since coming here I have
come to love him, and the more one knows
him the more one loves him.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Grant: Sometimes I think he is
off the track in his thinking, but that makes
me love hirm all the more-because to err is
human. Next, I wish to speak about my own
leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson). I have known
him for some years, but came to know him
better on hearing him in caucus. I admire his
good common sense, and I am sure we all
respect him and agree that he is the best man
for the job.
I should like, also, to refer to His Honour
the Speaker. I think he is the light in this
house. When we assemble for prayers, and
he enters the Chamber, he seems to illuminate
the whole place. I saw the Passion Play in

Ottawa-some people call it "The Road to
Calvary"-and I thought the actors were well
chosen; but if I were asked to select some
people to act in a play entitled "The Road to
Paradise", I would choose His Honour the
Speaker to sit on the throne. Then I would
select the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) to play the role of Peter, because I
know he would find it difficult to turn anybody away. I am sure that when I came to
the golden gate he would say "Corne on in,
Grant. If you behave yourself nobody will
know the difference".
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Grant: This thought reminds me
of an incident which occurred twenty-five
years ago, when I was first a candidate for
federal nomination. Five of us were in the
running, and one day while I was on the
way to visit a patient I met a certain Scotchman who was a friend of mine. We had a
conversation and he said, to me "I believe,
doctor, that you are going to win this nomination". I asked him why he thought so, and
he replied, "Well, I was talking to some
delegates up along the north shore and they
all seemed to think that you were a clever
man, and I never told them the difference".
Sorne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Grant: Honourable senators, I
hesitate to touch upon anything controversial,
but there is a small matter in connection with
the civil service system of this country about
which I should like to speak. It might be
something that the Senate itself could, look
into. I refer to the system of taking people
into the civil service in the first instance.
Fifty two years ago I. was a school teacher,
and in 1899, as I was driving around the
district, with my father's grey mare and
wagon, the Liberal candidate, Mr. J. J.
Hughes, who later became a member of this
Senate, said to me: "Why don't you get a
job in the civil service? There is no money
in teaching school". I asked him how I would
go about doing this, and he advised me to
write William Foran, the secretary of the
Civil Service department in Ottawa, and
make application to write the required
examination.
I wrote to Mr. Foran, and in his reply he
enumerated the subjects on which I would
have to write. They were not like those
found on civil service examinations today.
For instance, there was high English and
advanced arithmetic; there was history-of
Canada, Britain, France, and the United States
-penmanship, composition and transcription.
I was told to report at a certain time and
place in Charlottetown where a Mr. Cameron,
the supervisor of schools, would preside over

SENATE
the examination. There were nine or ten
candidates, and when we were assembled for
the examination Mr. Cameron came in with
a large sealed envelope and told us that he
had received it from William Foran of Ottawa.
He said, "It has been sealed, and I am supposed to open it in front of you candidates".
Well, he opened the envelope and gave each
of us a paper and said, "Tomorrow evening,
when you are through writing your exams,
I am going to put your papers in this envelope
which is addressed to VIr. Foran in Ottawa.
Then I shall seal it in your presence and we
shall all go over to the post office together,
where I shall mail it to Ottawa." If I remember correctly, six of us passed the examinations. Some time later I got a wire from
Ottawa advising me to go to work as a mail
clerk in Charlottetown. The weakness in the
system was that when you passed the
examination you had to be recommended by
a member of parliament of the party in power
before you could have your name placed on
the eligible list. That practice has since been
done away with; but I had the honour of
being the last person from my constituency
to get a job in the Charlottetown post officeand there were several people from my
county working there when I started.
What happens today? When the postmaster
at Charlottetown-which is the distributing
office for the whole province-wants a clerk,
he employs one or two around Christmas
time, and after they have been trained a bit
he applies to the Civil Service Commission
to advertise the vacancy. These advertisements go out all over the province, to be
posted up in the various post offices, and
applicants from all over come into Charlottetown to be examined. And what do they find?
They are called in before the postmaster and
a couple of men who come down there from
Ottawa, and the fellows who were in the
post office for two or three months get the
jobs. Later on, the other men from all over
the province who went there to be examined
are notified that they passed tenth, eleventh,
twelfth, and so forth on the list, and that if
they are not appointed to a job in a year or
two their qualifications will have lapsed.
I just recall one other thing about my own
certificate of qualifications. The certificate I
received was fit to frame, and my qualifications were said to be good till I was 37, which
was the age limit for appointment to the Civil
Service.
Well, what happens to all these young men?
One young man from my county had been
all through the war, was wounded in Italy,
he was a first-class school teacher; yet he
was placed eleventh on the list of eligible
candidates. and was notified that unless he
was appointed to a job within one or two

years-I forget which-he would be no longer
eligible, and that if he still desired appointment after that time he would have to take
the examination all over again. I ask, what
happens to all these bright young men? They
get discouraged by this treatment from the
Civil Service Commission and go into some
other kind of work.
I will give you another illustration. Two
or three years ago the Department of
Fisheries notified the Civil Service Commission that six fisheries inspectors were
required for Prince Edward Island, and
advertisements for the position were displayed in post offices all over the Island. A
large number of young men applied, for this
was a pretty good job, and there would be
superannuation at the end of it. The candidates were called into Charlottetown-I
think it was to the office of the Supervisor
of Fisheries. When they got there they found
two men from Halifax or Moncton-I am
pretty sure they were not from Ottawa, but
one of them may have been-sitting with
the supervisor at a desk. The candidates
were then examined. They may have been
required to write a few things, but I do not
think they were. Instead they were questioned by these men about fishing and one
thing and another, and what grade they had
reached in school, and then they were sent
home. About a week later the news came
out that at least five of the six successful
candidates were from Charlottetown, where
nobody ever caught a trout. One of them
was the supervisor's son, another was the
supervisor's chum's son-the supervisor and
this chum were in politics together-another
was a son of this chum's son, and still another
was a son of a chum of a chum. The jobs
went to a friendly circle in Charlottetown,
if not a family circle.
Hon. Mr. Farris: There must be a family
compact.
Hon. Mr. Grant: Yes, a family compact.
One of the boys from my constituency, a man
who went all through the war and was
badly wounded, but not too seriously injured
to prevent his working, was placed eleventh
on the list. When I asked him who examined
him, he said two men from Halifax or Ottawa
and the Supervisor of Fisheries from Charlottetown. I said, "Was the supervisor sitting
there?" He said, "Yes". Now, that supervisor
-well, I am not going to say anything about
his qualifications. Anyway, I wrote to the
Chairman of the Civil Service Commission.
I asked him "What right has the Supervisor
of Fisheries to sit in on that examining
board and put his own son or his chum's
son at the head of the list? And do you know

FEBRUARY 13, 1951
what he told me in reply? He said that the
supervisor was only acting in an advisory
capacity. Well, I guess he did sit in there
in an advisory capacity.
I hope that someone will take up this
question and try to improve the methods by
which young people are taken into the Civil
Service. The kind of thing I am referring to,
the placing of the brightest young men at or
near the bottom of the list of successful
candidates, has been going on in my province
for twenty-five or thirty years.
Honourable senators, the Speech from the
Throne dealt largely with the serious' international situation, and after listening to
orations such as those delivered by the
senators from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen),
from King's (Hon. Mr. McDonald), from
Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon), and others, I
do not think I should be so unwise as to
add my remarks on that subject. I am
delighted, however, to note from the Speech
from the Throne that our aged citizens are
to receive adequate pensions without being
subjected to the means test nuisance. Honourable senators, considering its relatively small
population, Canada today is the greatest
country in the world.
Sorne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Grant: In conclusion I want to
express my conviction that despite communism, paganism and all other means of
the devil, the powers of light shall yet prev.ail
over the ipowers of darknessHon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Grant: -and that what was forecast in the closing lines of one of the illustrious Bobby Burns' poems shall one day
come true:
For a' that, and a' that,
It's comin yet, for a' that,
That man to man, the warld o'er,
Shall brothers be for a' thatI

Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Gordon B. Isnor: Honourable senators,
I do not propose to enter into a controversy
with the honourable gentleman from Montague (Hon. Mr. Grant) as to the merits of
appointment or election of future senators.
In rising to take part in this debate I do so
largely for the purpose of dealing with one
portion of the Speech from the Throne that
has not yet been touched upon.
But first I wish to join the speakers who
have preceded me in offering congratulations
to those who have already spoken in the
debate, and particularly to the mover (Hon.
Mr. Stambaugh) and the seconder (Hon. Mr.
Dessureault) of the Address in reply. I wish
especially to associate myself with the

remarks made by the seconder in the course
of his very fine tribute to that great Canadian,
our present Prime Minister. I also wish to
refer-and I want to come back to it laterto one paragraph in the seconder's speech,
where he dealt with the resources of the province of Quebec. He said, as reported on
page 14 of Hansard:
My own province of Quebec will, I have no doubt,
be playing an important role in this expansion of
production for defence purposes. The rapid increase
in industrial production and capacity in the province of Quebec over the past few years has been
highly remarkable.

I leave it at that, intending, as I have said,
to return to it later when I am dealing with
the question of the production and resources
of the province of Quebec.
I also congratulate the mover of the
Address upon the interesting word picture
that he painted of his province of Alberta, and
particularly upon his story of the development of the oil fields in that province. I
visited Alberta last September and had the
privilege of seeing some of the oil wells in
operation on the outskirts of Edmonton,
.within twelve miles of the city. I was
reminded of a trip I made some years ago
to the areas of Southern California where oil
development was taking place. I recal vividly
the operations at Signal Hill, where oil was
being pumped from .a great number of wells,
to bring tremendous wealth to that part of
the country. I believe that community eventually became so prosperous that there was
no such thing as taxes. In Alberta today the
future is very promising by reason of oil
developments. I was disappointed, and I feel
that other honourable members were too, that
the honourable gentleman from Bruce (Hon.
Mr. Stambaugh) did not give any tips on
oil stocks, with the assurance that if we
invested in them there would be no slump in
the particular development he suggested. Perhaps at some future time he may give us that
information privately. Seriously, we are
very pleased that Alberta is enjoying such
prosperity from her resources.
I was most interested in my honourable
friend's reference to Alberta's coal production. As you know, Alberta and Nova Scotia
produce coal for the rest of Canada. The
operations in the two provinces are, however,
quite different. Alberta's coal mining is more
or less a strip operation, at low cost, while in
Nova Scotia operations are expensive by
reason of the depths to which we must dig,
and the production per man per day is conse.
quently much lower than in Alberta. However, offsetting this disadvantage is the fact
that the coal of Nova Scotia is of good quality,
and we find it as far inland as Montreal and

SENATE
even Toronto. We are, of course, always
looking for a bigger market in Quebec and
Ontario.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I hope that my presentation
of the case for Maritime products will influence honourable senators to go back to
their communities with the feeling that everything possible should be done to promote the
sale of Nova Scotia coal to these two central
provinces.
The remarks by the honourable senator
from Bruce (Hon. Mr. Stambaugh) concerning the fish of Alberta interested me very
much. Once again, the honourable senator
made as good a case as he could out of small
fry. The fish of Nova Scotia are of an
entirely different variety, and it has been
said that one does not really appreciate the
taste of good fish until he has eaten Nova
Scotian fish. I do not wish to sound unkind
in my references to the honourable senator
from Bruce, but Nova Scotia is most anxious
to increase the sale of her fish in all parts
of Canada.

One could not help being impressed with
the very fine speech made by the leader of
the government, and the high plane adopted
in the contribution made to the debate by the
leader opposite. In years gone by I have
)ften said that I wished that all Canadians
:ould sit in the gallery of the House of
Commons and listen to some of the speeches
made there.
Hon. Mr. Horner: You mean "the other
place."
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I think I can now say with
greater emphasis that I wish all Canadians
could have been in the gallery to hear the
speeches made by the two leaders in this
house. Their remarks were most educational,
and can do much to familiarize the public
with the manner in which the business of the
country is being carried on in this chamber
I wish next to refer briefly to the remarks
of the honourable senator from Medicine
Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw), in which he touched
on the question of old age pensions and
other forms of social security. I was particularly interested in that portion of his speech
dealing with disabled persons. The day
following his speech I procured as many
copies of Hansard as I could, and sent them
to disabled persons who in years gone by
have written me of their plight. I trust that
through the remarks of the honourable
senator some better understanding will come,
and that some action will be taken to bring
greater relief to disabled persons.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Isnor: I now come to the speech
macle by the honourable senator from King's
(Hon. Mr. McDonald). My honourable friend
comes from Nova Scotia, and because of the
high regard in which he is held in that province I may be a little biased. He has an
extensive knowledge of all phases of agriculture, and was at one time the Minister of
Agriculture in the Angus L. Macdonald government. His advice is always worth listening to and considering. I was pleased to
hear him advocate the extension of more
assistance to the apple growers of the
Annapolis Valley. He touched also on the
vital question of the need for transportation
between the western section of Nova Scotia
and the New England States. I trust that
the leader of the government will carry the
request of the honourable senator from
King's to the Minister of Transport, or those
responsible for providing transportation
facilities in that section of the country, and
that as a result transportation services from
the mainland of Nova Scotia to the New
England States will be improved.
Reference was made by my honourable
colleague to the military camps at Aldershot
and Debert, which are no longer used to
their full capacity. These two fine camps
should again be put into use by the military
authorities to accommodate troops in that
section of the country.
I come next to what I refer to, with all
due deference to other speakers, as the most
outstanding speech in this debate, that made
by the honourable senator from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen). He outlined to us in a
very interesting manner the situation which
the world faces today in Western Europe,
and in his well-balanced and informative
style he painted a true picture of conditions
in that part of the world. I would be remiss
in my duty if I did not pay him a special
compliment for his carpful study of this most
intricate problem.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I would be most thoughtless indeed, if I did not make reference to
the able address delivered by my former
colleague in the other place, the honourable
senator from Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon),
in which he told us of the workings of the
United Nations Organization. From all my
reading on this subject I have been unable
to gain as clear a picture of the operations
of this great organization as that portrayed
in the honourable senator's remarks.
I wish to join with others in welcoming
the honourable senator from Newfoundland
(Hon. Mr. Pratt), who participated in this
debate and placed before us the possibility
of future wealth from the resources of his

FEBRUARY 13, 1951
province. As a Nova Scotian I am very
happy to be associated with Newfoundland,
the fourth Maritime Province.
I do not wish to deal at length with the
points raised by the honourable senator who
has just spoken, but in my opinion a committee of the Senate could usefully occupy
itself with a consideration of civil service
questions and the making of recommendations
which might be helpful in the making of
appointments to and the operation of the
service.
I now turn to that portion of the Speech
from the Throne to which I referred earlier,
and from which I will read two short paragraphs:
You will also be asked to approve a bill to establish a Department of Defence Production to act as
a procurement agency for the defence forces of
Canada.

That is No. 1. My second quotation is:
The high level of employment and production
within our country give our people increased capscity to meet the demands of national and international security.

In those paragraphs will be found the two
thoughts which I wish to dilate upon, concerning employment and development. I
sincerely trust that any words of mine will
not be misunderstood by honourable senators
from the two provinces to which I shall refer
by name-Quebec and Ontario-becauseHon. Mr. Haig: That lets out the rest of us.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: -because I am going to
deal with conditions in those two provinces.
I do not know just what my honourable
friend's interjection means.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not come from Ontario,
and therefore I am not bound by your
arguments.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Thank you. I always like
to hear an argument before I make a decision
about it. In dealing with the question, I
shall refer in the clearest and broadest possible way to the production and resources of
the two provinces I have mentioned.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I, in a spirit of helpfulness, ask the honourable gentleman a
question? I have never been able to understand why Ontario, especially, and Quebec,
to some extent, buy so much coal from the
United States rather than from Nova Scotia.
I wish the honourable senator would throw
some light on the problern for the benefit of
those of us who do not live either in Ontario
or Quebec.
An Hon. Senator: American coal is cheaper.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I thank the leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) for his question.
It is one which on some future occasion

might be usefully clarified-perhaps helpfully to the people of Quebec and Ontariowith a view to added sales and greater prosperity in the section from which I come. At
the moment, however, I wish to deal with the
subject of production and the distribution of
orders under the present system. May I
make it clear that the table I am about to
present is simply to emphasize the points I
shall endeavour to make.
We all have read of the progress which our
nation has made during the past fifty years.
Only the other day I saw in one of the publications of the Imperial Bank of Canada
some remarks by the senior Assistant General
Manager, John S. Proctor. In dealing with
the progress of Canada from the banking
standpoint during the past half century, he
stated that in 1900 bank deposits totalled
$276 million and that today they total $7,290
million; that in 1900 savings deposits alone
amounted to $99J million, and that today
they total $2,708 million. Referring to loans-.
whether this item is in point or not I do not
know-he mentioned that outstanding loans
today amount to a total of $2,352 million,
and that fifty years ago they were less than
$300 million. Investments in government and
other securities now stand at $4,348 million;
fifty years ago they were $50 million. In
other words, they have multiplied ninety
times in fifty years. I think that is wonderful
progress.
I pass now to the matter of employment.
and will quote from an article in the January,
1951 issue of the Labour Gazette, headed
"Employment Conditions, November 1950."
Dealing with Quebec, the article states:
Small lay-offs and other short-time work have
been occasioned in the heavy industries of Montreal
and other centres by shortages of steel. The demand
continued strong for steel-working skills, however,
and for aircraft production workers, although these
were already in short supply.

In other words, employment in Quebec was
at a fairly high level, and markedly different
from the position in 1939, when plants were
working at not more than 60 to 70 per cent
capacity.
There was a similar situation in Ontario:
In the Ontario region, industries beginning work
on defence contracts were conducting intensive
recruiting campaigns in search of such skills as
machinists, tool and die makers, foundry moulders,
and aircraft production workers.

There again we
ment at a very
But when the

have an indication of employhigh level.
writer turns to the Maritimes,
has to say:

The seasonal decline in employment in the Maritimes was definitely established in November as
farming, fishing, fish processing and construction
began to release workers in increasing numbers.

SENATE
So we find that employment was at a very
high level, almost 100 per cent in Ontario and
Quebec, while it was not so good in the
Maritimes. The Boards of Trade in the
Maritimes were stressing at that time, and
have continued to do so, that one of the
causes of unemployment in the Maritimes
has been the lack of decentralization. Those
Boards of Trade have gone on record as
favouring decentralization in the purchasing
of materials, supplies and equipment for
government requirements, for both ordinary
and defence purposes. They are also pressing
for decentralization in the placing of production facilities, and for consideration of the
maritime area should plants be built by the
government.
During World War II the tremendous
acceleration in industrial development passed
by this part of Canada, and the small
expansion which took place in this region
was not of a permanent nature. The need
for the most economical procurement of
government supplies is appreciated; yet it is
felt that due regard should be had for the
long-range economic costs which result from
an unbalanced concentration of industry,
when facilities and labour in other areas are
permitted to languish.
The honourable senator from Newfoundland
(Hon. Mr. Pratt) referred the other day to
the development of iron ore in Quebec and
Labrador. I am sure we are all very pleased
to learn about it. Personally I believe that
this and the huge development along the
St. Lawrence Seaway project should be
kept under constant study to ascertain the
benefits which might accrue to the Atlantic
region as well as to the two central Canadian
provinces and industrial points of the central
United States. The government's leaders
would be well adtvised to remember that the
benefits needi not be confined to the central
part of the North American continent. These
two big undertakings could, and should,, be
of profoundi importance to the economic history of Canada.
In that connection I would like to refer to
the brief presented by a labour organization
to the Premier of Nova Scotia last Friday.
The brief set out what this labour organization considered should be done as regards
steel expansion, and it impressed me very
much when I read it. We all recognize the
fact that there is a steel shortage, and that
there must be an immediate and substantial
increase in the production of steel in order
to carry out the program which the Minister
:f Trade and Commerce and the Minister of
National Defence have outlined to the
Canadian people. This being so, steps should
be taken to expand steel production. The
Nova Scotia 3teel ind-ustry is situated in the

very centre of the raw material supplies; it
is at tidewater, and has the necessary rail
facilities. Therefore it is the logical place
for expansion. It is interesting to observe
that despite the location of the Nova Sceotia
steel plant, last year the production
amounted to only 685,478 tons, whereas our
friends in Ontario were able to show a production of 2,526,920 tons. This does not seem
to be logical and reasonable to those interested in the general welfare of the Maritimes.
In its brief, the labour organization asked
the government to go into this matter fully.
Honourable senators, at this stage I think
I should compliment the Honourable Minister
of National Defence and his staff on placing
orders, particularly for shipbuilding, in the
province of Nova Scotia and at other points
in the Maritimes. I should also like to
compliment the Minister of Trade and
Commerce, who I believe is sincere in his
willingness to see that the things are done
which I am stressing today. To help make
his task easier I am placing these facts on
record, so that they may be studied. I hope
that relief and help will be forthcoming and
that greater prosperity will come to the
Maritimes.
At this time I wish to ,quote part of a brief
presented by an outstanding Canadian, Mr.
N. A. Hesler, director of the Bank of Canada.
He presented this brief at the annual meeting
of the Maritime Board of Trade at Moncton,
New Brunswick, on November the 9th, 1950.
Mr. Hesler has had considerable experience in
war production in both World Wars, and I
think his words are well worth considering.
He states:
Having been engaged in the production of defence
materials in the first World War, as well as the
second World War, I have been in a position to
appreciate the marked changes in the requirements,
between the first World War and the Second World
war. And now, the atomic bomb, guided missiles,
and many other developments since the last war,
make it imperative that we give constant attention
to the changes in the requirements and so organize
our efforts to get the maximum results, and decentralize our industries to the greatest possible extent,
regardless of the cost involved in its initial construction and operation, because the destruction
of one large plant would not only mean a big loss
in money but more particularly an interruption in
the flow of materials required in the war effort.

In my opinion that is sound reasoning, and
I think the leader of the government (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) would be well advised to think
this over and carry its message to his colleagues in the Cabinet in the hope of bringing
about what is suggested in this brief. I think
I should read from another paragraph:
I should imagine that as a result of their experience during the last war the government would
appreciate the necessity of decentralizing industry,
because many large manufacturers have appreciated
the value of this since and before World War Il.

being built in small towns outside larger
cities like Toronto and Hamilton. The province of Nova Scotia is also well aware of
the need for the decentralization of industry.

and New Brunswick joined with Upper and
Lower Canada, but with certain reservations.
They pointed out that it was quite all right
for Ontario and Quebec to agree to a House
of Commons in which there would be representation on the basis of population, but that
it was obvious that Ontario would have the
largest representation, Quebec the second
largest, and the Maritime provinces a very
small representation indeed. The Maritime
Provinces, therefore, made it very clear that
they would not enter confederation unless
there was to be a second chamber.
The Fathers of Confederation, rightly or
wrongly, were strongly of the belief that the
system of parliamentary government in Britain
was the best system. In that country they
had a House of Commons, and a second chamber known as the House of Lords. In most
confederations there has been a second
chamber. In the United States the second
chamber is composed of two senators from
each State. Formerly senators were appointed
by the legislatures of their particular States,
and the system worked so badly that the
people rebelled against it and adopted the
method of electing members of the Senate for
a period of six years, one-third of the membership to change every two years.
When the time came for Canada to deal
with the question of a second chamber, the
American system was not working well and
did not find favour here. Those charged with
the framing of our constitution preferred the
British system. If you read the debates of
that time you will find that it was decided to
confer on the Canadian House of Commons
practically the same powers as those possessed
by the British House of Commons, and to
form the Senate on the model of the House
of Lords, but with one marked difference.
Membership of the House of Lords is based
upon the hereditary principle, whereby, when
the eldest son of a peer succeeds to the title
he becomes a member of the upper house.
That principle was not accepted in Canada:
it was decided that, whether the method of
selection adopted were appointment or election, the determining factor should be merit,
not birth. Most of us in this chamber are old
enough to remember the struggle which
occurred in Great Britain when the then
Prime Minister, Mr. Asquith, announced the
government's intention to curtail the powers
of the House of Lords because that chamber
had threatened to reject certain legislation.
In Britain there is a provision whereby the
party in office has -the power to swamp the
House of Lords by adding to the peerage a
number of new members who will support the
government's policies. This is popularly known
as the swamping provision. In Canada the
number of senators was originally fixed at

seventy-two. At that time the government
was given the power to appoint six more
senators, but thereafter no more could be
appointed until the number dropped below
seventy-two. The number now that may be
appointed, excluding Newfoundland, is eight.
That is the only provision of the nature of
"swamping". The purpose is to provide against
a deadlock between the two houses should
the Senate membership be about equally
divided.
Why was it decided originally to limit the
Senate of Canada to seventy-two members?
Why was not the government, supported by
the House of Commons, free to nominate as
many new senators as it liked? Clearly there
was some reason. The reason was that the
delegates from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick-and although there is nothing in the
record to show clearly the sentiment of the
province of Quebec, I have no doubt, from
my knowledge of the history of Canada and
of Quebec, that its delegates were of the
same mind-felt that, as Quebec had only
sixty-five members while Ontario had eightyfive, it was wise to provide that a majority of
the House of Commons, as represented by the
government, could not swamp the Senate
through the appointment of new senators.
This safeguard was insisted on by Nova
Scotia and New Brunswick.
It has frequently been said-probably I
have said it myself, but I know now it is
wrong-that we are here to represent
minorities. That is not truc. We do represent a minority, but primarily the minority
we were established to represent consisted
of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, and to
some extent, considered from a numerical
standpoint, Quebec; but that function has
nothing to do with language, religion or
issues of that kind.
I remember well the leader of the government telling us how bitter was the feeling
in Nova Scotia against confederation, even
with the safeguards provided, and if I rightly
remember the record, at the election which
followed confederation, Sir Charles Tupper
was the only Conservative elected from that
province. He of course was in favour of
confederation. The public of this country
does not understand the role of this chamber.
From time to time politicians in speaking
about the Senate have talked as though it
represents minorities in religion, language
and so forth. The fact is that we are here
primarily to hold confederation together, to
give the less populous provinces a voice in
parliament which they do not possess in the
House of Commons.
Let me illustrate my meaning. Today
there are two hundred and sixty-two members of the House of Commons. Of these

making an extreme statement, but I have
no doubt about its accuracy. Nor, but for
this chamber, would the Maritime Provinces
have become part of Canada. So I suggest
that when outsiders criticize what the Senate
does, we should say to them, "All right; that
is why the Senate was created," and they
will have to admit the truth of what I have
said. Then ask them, "With that reason
before you, tell me of one instance in which
the Senate did not carry out its duty in that
regard."
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Does my honourable
friend mean to say that the Senate, in its
actions over these years, has always acted
as the protector of the provincial rights and
the minority rights of the country?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I would say, generally, yes.
I have been in the Senate now for fifteen
years and I have never seen a vote taken
in this house which has favoured Ontario and
Quebec as against the Maritimes, or any of the
other provinces.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Would it be clearer to
say that the votes which have been taken
in this house have been in the federal
interest? Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes. That is what I mean.
But you asked a definite question. I defy
anyone to point to one instance in which the
primary principle for which this house was
formed has not been carried out to the
letter.
I am going to divert for a moment. I do
not intend to deal with everything brought
out by the leader of the government (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) when he introduced his
motion, but I should like to refer to his suggestion about establishing a retiring age of
seventy-five. Perhaps he is right, but I think
honourable senators will probably agree that

is Winston Churchill.

one hundred and fifty-six come from Ontario
and Quebec, and a hundred and six from
all of the rest of Canada. But in this chamber Ontario and Quebec have only fortyeight representatives, and the rest of the
country has fifty-four. Yesterday the honourable senator from Halifax-Dartmouth
(Hon. Mr. Isnor) discussed the distribution
throughout Canada of contracts for war
supplies. Who can require the government
to give a fair share of war contracts to Nova
Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward
Island, Newfoundland, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia? This
chamber. We can protect minorities which
deserve our support. That is why we are
here. Majorities can take care of themselves:
they constitute governments, they control
the public money, and they have the right
to vote it.
That is my first point. The Senate reflects
the feeling which existed among the delegates when they framed confederation, that,
come what may, it should be held together
by the reciprocal regard of all parts of the
country, by giving those whose representatives in the other house are a minority,
equality in this chamber with the two great
central provinces.
Like my honourable
friend from Halifax-Dartmouth, I have every
respect for Ontario and Quebec. They are
great provinces; their people are able
industrialists; they pay a great part of the
national taxation; they can do practically
everything. But, being a majority, they can
always take care of themselves; it is the
minority which needs representation and
protection.
Let me make one further point. When the
Fathers of Confederation decided upon the
system of government that should be set up,
what were they expecting from this house?
I make the statement-and I do not think it
can be contradicted, for I have read the
record very carefully-that at no time during
the nearly eighty-four years that Canada has
been a dominion has the Senate acted otherwise than in accordance with the purposes
for which it was appointed. Not once!

Tennyson, Longfellow, Wordsworth, Browning, Whittier, Bryant, and a multitude of
other writers produced some of their finest
works when they had passed the age of
seventy-five. John Wesley was preaching
regularly when he was eighty-eight. Connie
Mack was the manager of the Philadelphia
Athletics in his eighties, and the Right
Honourable Mackenzie King was Prime
Minister of this country long after he had
passed the retiring age. My honourable
colleague from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder)
and a few others have been in this bouse for
a good many years and can speak with
authority. But I too can look back quite a
long way on what has gone here and, because
I have always taken a keen interest in the
proceedings of this chamber I think I, too,
can speak with considerable authority; and
I want to say that I have never found that
age has made any difference.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: If a man of seventy-five
is energetic and in good health, his brain is
just as clear as when he was sixty. I am
over seventy myself, and though you may
say that my headi never was right, I feel that
it is just as good as it ever was.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Let me tell you a startling
thing. When I came into this house a little
over fifteen years ago, I was ninety-third on
the list according to seniority. The honourable senator from Lauzon (Hon. Mr. Paquet)
was ninety-fourth, and two gentlemen who
are now d.ead, the Honourable Senators
Bourgeois and O'Connor, were ninety-fifth
and ninety-sixth. Today I stand eighteenth
according to seniority. Fifteen others who
were summoned to the Senate following my
appointment have also passed on. So I have
seen some ninety persons serve their country
here before being called to their great reward.
This has meant a turnover of six persons a
year, a turn-over which is considerably
larger than that which takes place in ordinary occupations. It also means that from
five to six people are addedi to the membership of this house yearly. Surely this would
indicate that a lot of new thinking is brought
into our midst.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: New blood.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes. Another thing: that
nearly everyone of the present senators has
been appointed by a Liberal government.
Hon. Mr. Duff: There is nothing wrong
about that.

Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not want to hurt anyone's feelings, but I would point out that the
great majority of persons here are former
members of the House of Commons or of
some provincial legislature. For instance, the
honourable senator from Saltcoats served for
twelve years in the Legislature of Saskatchewan before coming to Ottawa as a
member of the House of Commons. As I say,
most of us served in either or both of these
political fields and there are others here who
endeavoured to do so, but the people in their
constituencies would not vote for them.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Haig: If personal references are
not consideredi to be in bad taste, I should
like to say that I was a member of the Winnipeg School Board for fourteen years, and I
served sixteen years as a member of the
provincial legislature, being elected by the
city of Winnipeg on each occasion. I know
what it means to go to the people. Whenever
I got up in the legislature to make a speech
I had one eye on the Speaker and one eye
on the visitors' gallery.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Haig: If a member of the legislature did not make a practice of doing that
he would never be re-elected. When I was
in the provincial legislature political matters
were always uppermost in my mind. That
bas never been the case here, because I know
that I have to work with you men and women
as long as I live. The leader of my party
did me a very great honour when he appointed
me to this bouse. I felt that he was giving
me an opportunity to serve Canada as I could
not serve it otherwise. For that reason I
doubly appreciate the responsibility resting
on my shoulders to help make Canada a
better place to live in. Honourable senators,
I am taking longer -than I intended.
Some Hon. Senator: Proceed!

Hon. Mr. Haig: I wish to make a few more
personal references. When I entered this
chamber, in 1936, the leader of the government
was the Right Honourable W. L. Mackenzie
King. He had been elected by a large majority in the election of October, 1935, when
one of the main issues had been the annual
deficit of some $40 or $50 million of the
Canadian National Railways. Mr. Bennett,
who was Prime Minister from 1930 to 1935,
had changed the system of appointing directors of the C.N.R. by order in council. Mr.
King and most of his supporters had promised that if elected they would introduce a
program which would help solve the financial
problem of the C.N.R. The Bennett government had brought down legislation authorizing

FEBRUARY 14, 1951
the appointment of three trustees for the
C.N.R. The chairman was to hold office for
five years and the others for terms of less
than five years, and each of them was to be
eligible for re-appointment. I believe the
honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) was a member of the cabinet when the
King government introduced a bill to do
away with the Board of Trustees and ,to put
back in the hands of the directors the responsibility of endeavouring to make the railway
pay. The bill came to this house, where there
were at the time 62 Conservatives. Actually
there were 63 appointees of the Borden and
Bennett governments, but one of them was
a Unionist Liberal, and he voted Liberal. To
this chamber which at that time liad 62 senators appointed by Conservative Prime.Ministers-32 of them by Mr. Bennett-came the
legislation to do away with the Bennett commission. Now, anyone unfamiliar with the
fact will say to me, "Then the bill was killed."
But it was not killed. And why was it not
killed? Well, the railway problem had been
an issue in the election, and, the government
of the day had a mandate to try to solve it.
I had no special knowledge about railroads but, like everybody else, I knew that
at that time the Canadian National Railways'
annual deficit was a terrible drain on this
country, and it seemed to me, as no doubt it
did to the other Conservative senators, that if
Mr. King had a policy which might solve the
problem it was opr duty to pass legislation to
carry out that policy. So this house did pass
the legislation. Now, if there had been the
reverse
situation-if
Mr. Bennett
had
appointed some political partisans to run the
railroad and Mr. King had decided to substitute a railway commission-it could have been
said that we voted for Mr. King's bill because
we believed in the commission form of management. But it was the very reverse. It
was Mr. Bennett who appointed ,a commission
and Mr. King who brought down a bill to kill
that commission. Yet, realizing the immensity
of the problem then facing Canada, we voted
to pass that bill.
At the beginning I outlined what I deemed
to be the purpose of the Senate. I liked what
my honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) said the other day. In
reality we sit here not as politicians, but as
arbitrators or judges of legislation, and it is
our duty to say whether we think-rightly
or wrongly-that the legislation before us is
in the interest of Canada. And we feelrightly or wrongly-that if we do not protect Canada, it cannot be protected.
Remember this, honourable senators: no
government will willingly bring down in the
House of Commons any legislation which
during its consideration in the Senate might

receive publicity that would make the government very unpopular. And any piece of
legislation that the Senate felt was really
detrimental to the public interest would certainly be dealt with here in a way that would
attract publicity. Now, that is one way in
which the Senate has served through the
years. There is no evidence on it that I can
quote by reference to any specific case, but
I know enough about human nature to realize
that no administration wants to submit to the
Senate any measure which is likely to be
revealed here as being contrary to public
interest, and therefore almost certain-not
all at once perhaps, but sooner or later-to
become unpopular. Discussion of such a
measure in the Senate would be bad for an
administration. I say that that factor has
had and has a restraining influence upon
those responsible for the introduction of
government legislation into the other house.
If you look back over the last 83 yearsI do not care what period you take-you
will not find that any government ever made
the Senate's rejection of government legislation an election issue. Take the period of
Sir Wilfrid Laurier. When he came into
power, in 1896, his supporters in the Senate
comprised only a small minority of this
chamber's membership. I was old enough
then to read about and take an interest in
politics, for I was a teacher instructing
children in my own province, and I cannot
remember that in any single instance the
Senate's rejection of a piece of his legislation was so important to him that he had the
House of Commons dissolved and went before
the people to show that the Senate was
wrong.
Hon. Mr. Euler: How about the Yukon
Railway Bill?
Hon. Mr. Haig: The Senate killed that
bill and several others.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I understood you to say
that it did not reject any government legislation at that time.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, I did not say that. I
said that during Sir Wilfrid Laurier's term
of office no rejection of a bill by the Senate
resulted in the dissolution of parliament
and an appeal to the country on the issue that
the Senate had acted wrongly.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I am sorry, I misunderstood you.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The same thing was true
while Sir Robert Borden was Prime Minister.
When he came into power there was a strong
Liberal majority in this house, but so far as
I know he never threatened to call an election because the Senate changed some of his
legislation. There was the famous instance

SENATE
of the bill to increase the number of senators
from the four Western provinces. Sir Robert
thought that the number should be increased
from 16 to 24, so that the representation of
the West in this chamber would equal that
of the other three senatorial divisions, and in
1915 he brought down a bill to give each of
the four Western provinces six senators
instead of four. When the bill came to this
bouse the majority here was favourable to
the proposed increase in membership, but
felt that it should not come into effect until
after the next election. That opinion of the
majority carried, but Sir Robert Borden did
not have parliament dissolved so that the
issue could be threshed out in the country.
And I think that if he had done that he
would have been beaten.
As my honourable friend from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) knows, in the past a large
number of railway branch line bills were
rejected by the Senate, and this has resulted
in the saving of millions of dollars through
the years. I have no detailed information on
those bills before me. I can, however, refer
to one specific measure whose rejection by the
Senate, in 1919, bas saved to the people of
the four Western provinces an average of $26
million a year ever since. That was the bill
to amend the Crowsnest Pass agreement. The
government of the day, headed by Sir Robert
Borden, introduced that bill for the purpose of
doing away with the special freight rates
granted on grain and flour from the Prairie
provinces to Fort William and the Pacific
coast. The bill was passed by the Commons,
but the Senate made an amendment, which
bas produced for the West the good results I
have just mentioned.
Now I am going to do something that my
honourable friend from Rosetown (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) says I do very poorly. I am going
to read an article. Every now and then the
Financial Post, of Toronto, telegraphs people
asking for a hundred words of opinion on
such and such a matter. I suppose that from
time to time we all get these requests and
respond to them. Well, the Winnipeg Free
Press, of October 12, 1950, had an editorial
on an opinion expressed to the Financial
Post by Mr. Eliason of the Saskatchewan
Farmers Union, on the subject of abolition of
the Senate. Here is what the Free Press
says:
The public memory is notoriously short, but still
it is rather surprising to find a Prairie man, who
might be expected to have knowledge of past
events as they affect Prairie farmers, advocating
the abolition of the Senate.
In response to a question sent out by the Financial
Post, Mr. Frank Eliason, of the Saskatchewan
Farmers Union, Saskatoon, wrote in part as follows:
"Organized farmers believe that the Senate has
rarely performed the functions that were intended

at confederation and that the time bas come when
it should be abolished."
It is a matter of historical record that during the
second session (the special railway session) of parliament in 1919, the Union government brought
down legislation abolishing the Crowsnest Pass
rates on grain and flour. This legislation was passed
by the House of Commons but was challenged in
the Senate by the late Senator Robert (Bob) Watson
of Portage la Prairie. Upon consideration the
Senate struck out the repeal section, substituting
therefor a clause temporarily suspending the agreement. Had it not been for the Senate, the Crowsnest Pass agreement would have been irretrievably
lost to Western Canada in 1919.
As it was, the Senate saved the agreement, and
later on it became the most outstanding achievement of the Progressive Party that the agreement
was re-instated in 1925. What the Senate saved in
1919, the prairie provinces, through their membership in both bouses of parliament, have jealously
guarded ever since.
On evidence presented to the Board of Transport
Commissioners, the Crowsnest
Pass agreement
saved prairie farmers $26 million per year. That
figure is based on the difference between Crow rates
and the standard or commodity rates, as fixed in
the rate judgments of 1920 and 1922.
There was no change in the 1920-22 rate structure
until 1948, when the 21 per cent increase went into
effect.
Since then there have been additional
increases of 8 per cent, 7 per cent, and 3 per cent.
Because of the agreement none of these increases
affected rates on grain and flour and therefore, had
it not been for the Crowsnest agreement, the $26
million difference would have been well above $30
millions per year.
Thus the fact is that the Senate saved prairie
farmers $26 million per year for 29 years-or a total
of $754 millions. To this must be added another
$60 millions to cover the two years, 1948-49. The
grand total exceeds $800 millions and is increasing
each year.
All of the credit for this great saving to each
and every farmer in the prairie provinces goes to
the Senate. No other organization or body had a
thing to do with it. The Progressive Party, which
brought about the re-instatement of the agreement,
did not arrive on the scene at Ottawa until 1921.
Mr. Eliason, perhaps, would like to reconsider
his statement.

It must be remembered therefore, that the
savings thus effected are sufficient to pay the
expenses of the Senate for the next hundred
years-and those savings are still being
enjoyed year by year.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: One important fact which
the editorial omits is that when this vital railway legislation was considered in this house
the Conservatives were then in the majority,
the attendance being 56 Conservatives and 32
Liberals. Most of those Conservatives were
appointed by Sir Robert Borden, and yet
enough of them voted against the government to pass the legislation.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: To defeat the legislation.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: To amend it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes; there was an amendment. I point out that the expense of the

FEBRUARY 14, 1951
Senate to the country, even in those years
when we have had two sessions, is only
$1,200,000. Compare that with a saving of $26
million a year.
Hon. Mr. Euler: What about the $600 million
the western farmers lost on the wheat
agreement?
Hon. Mr. Haig: The answer is that the
Senate had already saved the money.
My honourable friend the leader had something to say about the reform of the Senate.
I would point out that the late Mr. King at
the convention of the Liberal party held in
1919, promised that the Senate would be
reformed. Mr. King later said, I think in a
jocular way, that he had certainly reformed
the Senate. Of course it was not in the way
that the resolution of the convention had
meant it. Why did Mr. King not keep his
promise? Well, if I were speaking on a
political platform I might say that he had his
tongue in his cheek when he made the
promise, but I do not believe that is the
answer. I firmly believe that if Mr. King had
had any proposals to off er by way of making
the Senate more useful to Canada, he would
have made them. He was challenged time
and again by the opposition in the House of
Commons to explain why he had not kept his
promise of 1919. I offer this explanation:
when the promise was made he was a young
man in political life, and that when he looked
with more mature eyes at the constitution of
the Senate and its record he had no proposals
to offer for its improvement.
With one more point, I shall conclude.

Hon. Mr. Haig: But I would strongly urge
that we keep away from inquiring into political problems, for in so doing I think we
would expose ourselves to the criticism that
the Senate, an appointed body, was trying to
oppose the wishes of the elected representatives of the people. We are appointed by the
government to represent the people of Canada
in a certain specific capacity, and we must
be careful not to overstep our jurisdiction.
I have never yet met or talked to thinking
people-except perhaps some college professors-who seriously advocated the abolition
of the Senate; nor have I heard a bona fide
suggestion that the Senate should be an
elected body.
I call the attention of the honourable members to a report made by the late Senator
Ross, in which he reviewed many of the statements made by such statesmen as Macdonald
and Brown. There one may read, the words
of the Honourable George Brown-a liberal
of Liberals-to the effect that there should
not be two elected houses of parliament for
the reason that there would be constant warfare between them. If we were elected for
a term of five years what would be the attitude today of my colleagues and myselftowards a government measure that was contrary to policy of our party? Why, we would
fight it to the bitter end. Men like the Honourable George Brown foresaw such a situation, and expressed themselves as opposed to
an elected Senate. Sir John A. Macdonald's
stand on the Senate was that it should be
regarded as a delaying body. That is to say,
if certain legislation was being passed too

taking place, only one will attend, and he has
nothing else to do.
I repeat my earlier suggestion that we
should refrain from interfering with political
questions. By and large, I think, all of us,
regardless of political leanings, favour this
broad approach, and as I said before, it has
been my experience that we have acted in
the best interests of this country.
Hon. Mr. Euler: My honourable friend has
quoted someone as saying that he believed
the Senate should be a delaying body.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Macdonald said it.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Does he believe that the
Senate should indefinitely obstruct legislation
which comes from the other house?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Or would he approve of
having some such restrictions as can be
applied, for instance, by the Parliament of
Great Britain?
Hon. Mr. Haig: My point is this. Let us
suppose that during the excitement of war an
election were held, and that a majority holding opinions of a certain kind were elected
to the House of Commons and then the war
suddenly ended. Often a war government is
different from a peacetime government.
Assuming that legislation proposed by a
wartime government was such as we believed
was not in the interests of Canada, we would
not delay its application forever, but we
might delay it a year or two. I will give an
illustration. Some years ago the government
of the day brought in a Foreign Exchange
Control Bill which was intended to remain
in effect indefinitely. I had a fear at that
time that the Commonwealth Co-operative
Federation might become the government of
this country.
Hon. Mr. Howard: You have changed your
mind since.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Oh, yes. Or rather, the
facts made me change my mind. I was then,
and still am, of the opinion that under the
Foreign Exchange Control Act a government
could direct the economy of this country
without having recourse to parliament for
any legislation at all. What did we do? It
will be remembered that my honourable
friend from Wellington (Hon. Mr. Howard)
was quite active in the matter, and I give
him credit for it. We said to the government: "Why not restrict the operation of this
bill to two, or not more than three years?
If the need for controls should remain in
existence after that time, we shall be just
as ready to face it then as we are now." The
then
government,
after
consideration,
accepted our viewpoint, and so amended the

law. It is action of that kind which I have
in mind when I speak of our "delaying"
function; and Macdonald, Brown and Cartier
were all in favour of the second chamber
exercising this function.
I want to say just one word about the
leader's speech. He made five or six points
of the nature of suggestions. Every one of
them, excepting that relating to retirement
at a certain age, could be carried out without
any further legislation. There is nothing to
prevent us from doing any of these things
that we want to do. But I do not think we
should appoint a committee to consider them.
I can see no possibility of such a committee
giving us any help at all. That may be
merely a personal opinion. I have outlined
the purposes of our existence as a Senate and
defined our fundamental duty, and that is all
that we senators ought to try to do, unless
we can show-and I do not think we canthat the Fathers of Confederation were
wrong in their concept of what the Senate
should be.
Further, I think that anybody who wants
changes in the legislation dealing with the
Senate of Canada should put forth some
definite indications of what they find wrong.
They say, "Oh, well, there's a lot of fellows
there who could not be elected." But more
members of this Senate have been elected
to parliament than anybody has any idea of.
When I came here this house contained sixtyfive former members of the House of
Commons and sixteen ex-members of legislatures; only sixteen were men and women
who had not been members either of some
provincial legislature or of the House of
Commons. I think that is a pretty good
record.
Secondly, it may be said that some of usand perhaps I am one-are not too clever or
active; that we have not made good business
men or doctors or merchants or artisans, or
whatever our vocations may be; but I believe
that this membership will bear comparison
with any cross-section of Canada and any
legislative body one cares to name.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I would not want to sit in
this chamber if all the senators were supermen and superwomen. I do not know what
would happen. I want to sit with a body of
men and, women who comprise a good crosssection of the Canadian people.
I do not believe in any limit of age. If a
senator is to retire at the age of seventy-five,
some provision for superannuation will be
necessary. My own experience-and I suppose i.t is shared by every doctor and lawyer
in the house-is that when one is in a
personal business one sees people walking by

FEBRUARY 14. 1951
his door and calling on some other partner,and it kind of hurts. A fellow came to me
last summer and said: "Jack, I know you are
my lawyer, but your associates are always
here and you are away half the time, and
I want to deal with somebody who is on the
spot and can look after me". Take the case
of a senator who is a physician. I venture to
say that he is in exactly the same position.
He may be one of the best medical men in
his province, but if he is down here for six
months, and his people cannot obtain his
services, they will go to somebody else. I do
not blame them; I would do the same thing.
You may say that we are paid for our
services here. That is not the point. The
experience each of us has had in every-day
life is given to the people of this country at
a figure which is very low for the services
rendered. If you engage a lawyer or doctor
or engineer or any other professional man
to do a piece of work, you will find that you
have soon paid out as much as the $6,000 a
year that we receive.
For these reasons--the fact that the membership changes to the extent of five or six
members each year, the fact that w are
assembled here for a certain purpose, the fact
that during eighty-four years no issue has
ever arisen on which the action of the
Senate was declared by the people of this
country to be wrong-I believe that the less
we say or do about this subject the better
the people of Canada will be satisfied.
Some Hon. Senators:. Hear, hear.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS

IN REPLY

The Senate resumed f rom yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Stambaugh for
an Address in reply thereto.
(Translation):
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancourt: Honourable sen-

ators, my first word is for His Honour the
Speaker. I am delighted to see him in such
good health this week. We are always pleased
to feel his kindly eyes following our -proceedings and to have him directing them.
After listening to my honourable colleagues
who spoke on the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne, it is my duty-and a
very pleasant one-to congratulate the mover
and the seconder on their speeches, and also
all those who spoke after them. It is hard to
say which speech was the greatest and which
80713-8

the most powerful. Truly, the elite of the
Canadian population should study them.
If my speech does not measure up to theirs,
I hope it will at least set off the value of the
previous addresses.
In certain quarters at present the reform of
the Senate is being mentioned, and means are
sought to make our work more efficient.
Those who know the work we are performing
and the way we are doing it, give us credit
for it, I believe. I was told, by a stranger
who attended a meeting of our Banking
Committee: "Your Committee is probably the
best of its kind that I have seen in either
Canada or in the United States." These
words were spoken by an American citizen,
and they constitute quite a tribute.
One of the reasons for the existence of the
Senate, according to the Constitution of 1867,
was that this non-elective house should protect minorities. The Senate bas given this
protection in the past and will, I hope, continue to do so. Two races built this country,
and it is only through the understanding and
good will of both that the necessary unity
will be ensured.
I am just back from Europe. As I went
through Switzerland - a country to be
admired for its scenery, and especially for its
national unity, although it is formed of
several minority races-a referundum was
being held in the Canton of Berne. We know
that the majority of the citizens of the Canton
of Berne are of German origin. Nevertheless,
in the Canton of Berne, it was requested that
the French language be put on an equal footing with German, and the immense majority
of the citizens of that Canton voted in favour
of such a measure. In Switzerland, French,
German and Italian cultures flourish side
by side, and the diversity lends a particular
charm to each canton. Do not tell a French
or Italian Swiss that he is German Swiss or
a French Swiss. He considers himself to be
Italian or German or French, but he will tell
you: "I am a Swiss." In his canton people may
speak French, Italian or German; but when a
Swiss citizen talks about his country he is
always a Swiss. And thus in this beautiful
country theré is a genuine and true harmony.
This unity was not created overnight; it is the
result of time and patience, and above all a
great amount of good will. Why should the
same situation not exist in Canada? Indeed,
with the co-operation of all men of good will
-and
there is good will everywhere-it
should be possible. God knows that we need
it in order to solve the numerous and complex problems which presently face us.
A few days ago, the honourable senator
from Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon), gave a very
good outline of the work which Canada is
performing at the United Nations.

SENATE

I wish to thank him for insisting upon the
participation of our country in world affairs
and, in the same strain, I would like to point
out that a former high official of the Department of Agriculture, Dr. Archibald, has
agreed to perform a highly .commendable
task by going to Ethiopia at that country's
request, in order to assist the FAO in the
nutritional and agricultural work it is doing
there.
He had already reached retirement age,
it seems, but still, at seventy years of age,
he answered the call of Ethiopia. In this
connection, I was tempted a while ago to
point out, after the speech of the leader of
the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), that the man
who saved France during the 1914-1918 war
was Georges Clémenceau, who was then
eighty years old.
Yesterday, our colleague from HalifaxDartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor) spoke about the
allocation of contracts, and he showed that
more than eighty per cent of the contracts let
out in December by the defence organization,
were given in Quebec and Ontario. I would
point out to my honourable colleague that in
the Province of Quebec we are complaining
of the same situation; we find that Montreal
and its surrounding districts obtain almost one
hundred per cent of the contracts for goods
which are supposed to be let and manufactured in the whole province of Quebec.
This is not intended as unkindly criticism,
but I believe that a better distribution of
these contracts could be effected by letting
susb-contracts. It is evident that jet planes
cannot be built at Levis, but in my own city
we can manufacture many of the aluminum
parts which go into the making of those
planes. Most likely the same situation would
apply to many other towns in other provinces.
By the procedure mentioned, production
would be speeded up, manufacturing decentralized, and by the same token, the congestion of larger cities which are alrea.dy overpopulated, would be relieved. This method
would also help to solve the housing shortage
in some of the larger cities. I trust that these
remarks, which are made in all good will,
will not be totally disregarded.
Several colleagues who preceded me mentioned industries and products particular to
their own province. We heard about mines,
oil, apples, potatoes and coal. So I feel
like talking about something in which I am
particularly interested, an industry which
belongs to the Province of Quebec, the industry of maple products. In another place, one
of the members inquired of the government
if an investigation had been undertaken to
ascertain whether there existed a combine to
set the price of maple products. Had I asked
this question, I would have added: "Did the

Commissioner for Combines launch an inquiry
to ascertain the existence of a possible combine for the manufacture of adulterated maple
syrup, which would ruin the maple sugar
industry in the Province of Quebec?"
The maple products industry is probably
the oldest agricultural industry in this country. Before the white men came to America,
the Indians knew that the maple trees produced a sweet water from which was made an
excellent
syrup
used particularly
for
medicinal purposes.
Twenty-five years ago our sugar manufacturers, that is those from the Province of
Quebec, formed a co-operative to rebuild this
industry which was in a bad way and even
about to disappear. After twenty-five years
of struggle this industry has got back to its
feet, and I could even say that it has aýchieved
greater importance than it ever enjoyed
before. Success in this field, as in many
others, creates envy. Today, we do not
have to cope with the inefficiency of our
farmers, but with the dishonesty of those
who own no maple trees but nevertheless
manufacture thousands upon thousands of
pounds of sugar and syrup which they sell for
maple products. In markets throughout the
country, a so-called maple syrup is being
sold which contains only a few drops of
maple sap.
This is the greatest threat to our oldest
agricultural industry.
In order to stop these adulterations, the
co-operation of the federal and provincial governments must be obtained. Last year, the
Government of the Province of Quebec took
drastic measures; and I wish to congratulate
the Minister of Agriculture of that province
in that respect. I am now asking the authorities of the federal Department of Agriculture
and of the Department of National Health
and Welfare, who enforce throughout the
country laws and regulations relating to pure
food, products, to take the necessary steps
to see that the law is observed everywhere,
in order to protect the honest producer as
well as the honest consumer.
Will my remarks bear fruit, will they gain
attention from the authorities concerned? I
hope so, in the interest of all our honest
maple sugar makers, whether they come from
Quebec, Ontario, New Brunswick or Nova
Scotia.
Let us turn now to more important
questions.
One cannot go out on the street without
being asked: "What do you think of the
present situation? When will the cost of
living stop going up? Will war break out?"

FEBRUARY 14, 1951
We will not lower the cost of living through
inflation. Each month we wait with anxiety
for the report of the Bureau of Statistics:
will the -cost of living go up one point,
half a point or two points? Every one has
his own theory to stop inflation. Some say
that production must be increased as much
as possible in order to saturate the market,
and they use an American expression "mass
production". Others say: "Let us spend less,
let us put a stop to our wastefulness." This
is sound, but it is very difficult to apply because we are induced on all sides to spend
more. According to the theory of greater production, of "mass production", greater publicity is used to increase the sales and manufacture of goods. Last Thursday, I read a
newspaper, and a good-sized one at that, which
devoted two-thirds of its space to advertising.
Radio publicity is just as heavy. We are
told: "If you -cannot afford to buy, if you
haven't got the necessary money to purchase
a certain item, we will sell it to you on
terms." People who own beautiful and comfortable furniture sell it in order to procure
more beautiful furniture, which they can pay
for on the instalment plan. They get into debt
without knowing that tomorrow they will
be in a position to pay. They say that they
will make these payments from week to
week, but they are mortgaging a salary which
they have not yet earned. If some misfortune occurs, it becomes a disaster. This
happens in many homes.
Let us reduce our expenditures. We should
be reasonable and use judgment in our purchases. I will point out but one abuse. Newspaper advertising is so considerable that the
newsprint industry is undergoing a crisis,
and timber operations cannot meet all
requests. Our forests are thinning out and
at certain times of the year we are plagued
with drought and devastating floods. Such
are some of the ill effects of inflation.
The ideal solution would be not to spend
thoughtlessly one's present savings, or to
invest beforehand the surplus which one
expects. Inflation could thus be avoided. But
the temptation is always there; from al sides
we are drawn, prompted, compelled to spend.
But the. more we buy the more the demand
increases; the acost of goods rises, and labour
asks for higher salaries and shorter working
hours. Inflation is caused by all these factors. Some say that governments should
show the way by reducing their expenditures.
Is it possible to curb expenditures?
For
instance, if a government stops building highways-in a provincial budget, road-building
is the most considerable item-automobiles
will not be able to travel as easily, the number of tourists will decrease, and the economy

will thereby suffer with all ensuing consequences. This problem cannot be solved
unless people become more reasonable and
are determined to live more moderately.
It follows, therefore, that the best remedy
against inflation is to live according to one's
means, to use judgment in one's purchases,
and to not count too much on future income.
Thus will we avoid a crisis.
Let us now examine another matter.
One often hears about communism and
marxism. How many have read even one
page of Karl Marx? How many know his
life, or what he ever did? The senator from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr Hugesson) outlined in
his speech the methods followed by Lenin
and by Stalin. It is claimed that Lenin was
not an imperialist, whereas Stalin is; both,
however, followed the theories of Karl Marx,
and Stalin still does when he thinks they
will promote his imperialist ambitions.
"Never in my life," asserts the German
American Karl Schurz, writing about Marx,
"did I meet a man with such an insolent attitude and such an intolerable arrogance".
When he was thirty-three years old, Karl
Marx, then a refugee in London, tried to
obtain employment with a railroad firm; but
his handwriting was so bad that he could
not keep this position. While he stayed in
London he was helped by a friend, Engels,
who took pity on him, his wife and his
children, and supplied him with means of
living. Karl Marx' whole lite was miserable;
he lived not only in poverty, but in dirt and
filth, and his arrogance soured his disposition.
The report of a police officer who inspected
the two rooms occupied by the Marx family
during six years, shows that nothing was
clean, that not a single piece of furniture
was in proper condition. "When you enter
into the rooms occupied by the Marx family,"
wrote this police officer, "smoke and the smell
of tobacco bring tears to your eyes, and at
first you think you are in a cave. Everything
.is filthy and .covered with dust, and it is very
difficult to find a seat, and even dangerous,
as one of the chairs has only three legs, etc."
History teaches us however that Karl Marx
was a devoted and patient father, in full
contrast with what he seemed to be in public.
When Marx died in 1883, he had written
but one book, "Das Capital". Engels, bis
devoted friend, published his other two books
based on the well-preserved notes of Marx.
Marx sets as a principle that the struggle
between capital and labour is inevitable. He
denies God. In his opinion, the fate of man
on earth hinges on materialism; he looks
upon the struggle between classes as a source
of progress. Conscience is not ruled by
honesty, in his opinion, but the notion of

SENATE

justice is determined by life. His communist
manifesto is nothing but the history of social
struggles.
Under Stalin and Molotov, Russia followed
and still follows the advice given by Marx
in a letter to the Communist League in 1850.
"The communists", be wrote, "will be the
natural allies of the good little bourgeois
rebelling against European autocracy; but at
the very first sign of victory, the communists
will turn against our allies of yesterday by
continuing against them the revolution, the
conspiracy and the agitation. Insist that they
grant you every possible concession and
promise, follow the roads that will better
compromise them, and you will dictate terms
which will sow in these bourgeois democracies the germ of destruction. Then, with
this disintegration, the proletarian classes
will take over these governments with greater
ease". The present leaders in Moscow have
not forgotten this advice.
"The communists", wrote Marx to Engels in
1848, "state openly that their objects can be
achieved only by upsetting all present social
conditions. In our case", be adds, "we can
not merely change private property, we must
destroy it; it will not suffice to promote
antagonism between classes, we must abolish
them; it is not sufficient to improve the present
society; we must create a new one". Those
few sentences were gathered at random in
Karl Marx' book, and they reveal part of
his theories and those of his successors.
How do Stalin and the members of
the Supreme Soviet hope to achieve their
objectives? By attempting to disorganize
world economy, to stir up destruction and
poverty in every country, and thus bring
about world revolution. Will they be successful? Or rather will we, the democracies
who still believe in God, succeed in subduing
this monster?
The Russians fear war; they would rather
sow anarchy and, in the ensuing confusion,
take over the governments. It is less trouble
when it can be done. They hope that extreme
inflation will eventually bring about deflation and that, as workers, labourers and
everyone else has been accustomed for many
years to a high standard of living without
being greatly affected by the war, no one will
be willing to accept the sacrifices, and then
will come a general revolution.
At that time a few iron-fisted men will
take hold of the government and reduce to
slavery all the workers of Canada and the
United States. I doubt if the workers know
that in Russia there are few if any owners;
that strikes are prohibited; that the working
day is at least ten hours and sometimes

twelve, and that the labourer must work
where he is sent and he may not earn more
than the salary set by the State. Imagine our
workers putting up with such conditions.
Our leaders are wise, they have benefitted
from the experience of the last war, they
are careful and take all possible means to
prevent a sudden deflation. A deflation is
desirable, but it must occur gradually and
not suddenly. If this process is not successful,
then the Russians are prepared to take
extreme measures. That means war. They will
provoke it, as in Korea, by creating a casus
beli. In order to save their civilization the
western powers will be compelled to act.
Then the Russians, alleging that we are the
invaders, will cross their frontiers to protect
their country, which they will claim to have
been attacked.
A few days ago in another place it was
stated that we should organize our own
defence but that we should not be concerned
with the defence of other countries. It would
be the same as if, after our enemies had
invaded our home, we attempted to run out
and cry: "Do not kill our children!" Can you
imagine Canada, with a population of 14 million, alone against approximately 200 million?
All my life I have advocated co-operation,
because I know that through co-operation I
can do things which I could never achieve
alone. With my neighbour's help there is
almost nothing that I cannot accomplish.
The Atlantic Treaty, to my mind, was a
happy inspiration of our Prime Minister, who
proposed it and was its main architect. It
is a constructive step which, we hope, will
save us.
If today our Christian culture still enables
us to overcome all dangers and emerge victoriously from the struggle, will the same
situation prevail one or two generations
hence? I fear for the future because I fear
that those spiritual and moral values which
we are presently defendling may disappear
completely from the character and way of life
of our successors. If our world is to endure,
we must give it something which does not die:
spiritual life.
Are you not frightened at what is happening? If men live like animals, that is,
if they do not believe in God or in their own
souls, then they degenerate, they become
beasts and act as beasts.
Recently Rt. Rev. Archbishop Léger, of
Montreal, stated: "At the present time there
is a breach in the depths of the human
mystery, and a breach necessarily causes a
breakdown. Man is not what he should be,
and when be is not what be should be, he is
a monster." I am wondering if we are not

FEBRUARY 14, 1951

about to become monsters. How can we
avoid becoming such monsters? We must
do better than is presently being done in somie
schools in the neighbouring country and in
some of our own schools. If in our public
school we never mention God, the Supreme
Being who created all things, including man,
I fear that we will prepare for our descendants to become monsters which will devour
one another. If there is no one above men to
guide their destiny, the law of the jungle will
prevail rather than the law of love according
to which we should love one another like
brothers born of the same Father, God
EternaL
On the occasion of his recent trip to Paris,
our Prime Minister, in a short interview
which he granted to Madame Rosemonde
Dupont, representative of a Parisian daily
newspaper called L'Aube, stated that in his
opinion, Canada must play an essentially
stabilizing role. Indeed, Canada ethnologically speaking, is formed of old European

races, the English and French of the old countries as they are called by the Canadian
people. But Canada is also influenced by the
United States. Canada was placed between
these two civilizations, and it is up to Canada
to keep to the middle of the road.
May God give us the strength to defend our
most sacred possession, our homes; may He
give us the power to preserve our Christian
civilization; and may He so fashion our hearts
that we will always love Him. May Divine
Providence so guide us that we may at all
times be prepared to defend those things
which give a meaning to life, our faith ar'
our freedoms.

RADIO BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Gordon B. Isnor moved the second
reading of Bill W, an Act to amend The
Radio Act, 1938.
He said: Honourable senators who have
been members of the committee of the other
house having to do with radio will recall the
various amendments which from time to time
have been made to the Radio Act. They will
recall that in 1932 it became necessary to
get a ruling as to who had jurisdiction over
radio broadcasting, and that on February 9
of that year, the Judicial Committee of the
Imperial Privy Council, to whom the matter
was referred, ruled that the control and
regulation of radio-communication rested
within the jurisdiction of the federal parliament.
Following that ruling the Radio
Broadcasting Act of 1932 was enacted, and
the Canadian Broadcasting Commission was
set up. In 1936 the present Canadian Broadcasting Corporation succeeded the Radio
Broadcasting Commission, and in 1938 there
was introduced and passed an Act relating
not only to radio broadcasting but to radiotelephone and certain other methods of communication, and known as an Act respecting
Radio in Canada.
Since the passing of that act radio broadcasting has become more extensive and is
now not only national but international in
scope, and at the present time Canada broadcasts by radio to other countries all over the
world, in approximately twelve languages.
The purpose of this bill is to implement a
treaty signed between Canada and the United
States which will permit citizens of either
country to operate certain classes of radio
stations in the other country as well as at

home. Reciprocity in the field of aviation
has been in force between Canada and the
United States. For many years, citizens of
either country have been permitted to qualify
for pilots' licences and to fly aircraft in the
other country. That means, for instance,
that if a United States pilot has his pilot's
licence he can operate an airplane in either
country. However, in the majority of cases the
operation of radio equipment is essential to
the safe flying of aircraft, but to date the
radio laws of each country prevent the operation of aircraft radio equipment by citizens
of the other country. The amendment of the
Act will permit citizens of Canada or of the
United States to operate radio in aircraft
registered in either country.
The installation of high-frequency radio
equipment for short-range communication in
vehicles of various types, such as trucks,
railway trains and private motor cars, has
greatly increased in the past few years. Many
of these vehicles frequently cross the border
between Canada and the United States, and
at present the radio equipment in such
vehicles is sealed at the border by the
customs authorities of the country that is
being entered. A Canadian car or truck going
to the United States will be held up at the
border and the equipment sealed; likewise,
the equipment of a vehicle coming, say from
San Francisco to Vancouver will be sealed at
the Canadian border. The amendment of the
Act will put an end to that restriction. I
recall, as no doubt you all do, that during the
war a great many Americans were stationed
in Newfoundland. When the island became
the tenth province of the dominion it was
felt necessary to so amend the Act that
American stations in Newfoundland would be
able to carry on their private operations.
The amendment also applies to amateur
operators who are known, I think, as "hamns"
and who operate extensively south of the
border.
The amendment in section 2 is simply a
matter of definition: the word "radio" is
replaced by the word "telecommunication"
The next section to which I have referred,.
and which I hope will be of real benefit to
our tourist trade is the more important one.
It is to permit the before-mentioned trucks.
and other vehicles having private radio
equipment to cross from one country to the
other and carry on radio operations without.
breaking the law.
This explanation, I think, covers the purposes of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the honourablemember if the proposed amendments will

affect from a licensing point of view motorists who have radios in their cars and who
simply want to listen to radio programs.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: The bill has really no
effect in, so far as the average automobilist
is concerned. If a motorist of one country
uses his radio to pick up news in the other,
there is no violation of the laws of either the
United States or Canada. The bill applies,
for example, to a tourist representing one of
the large American oil companies who, on
his way to Edmonton or Calgary or some
other western point, wishes to establish contact with his home office or station.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

THE SENATE AND ITS WORK
MOTION-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Roberston for the appointment of a special
committee to inquire into and report upon
how in its opinion the Senate may make its
maximum contribution to the welfare of the
Canadian people.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, one of the suggestions made by the
government leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson) in
his speech when he introduced this motion,
was that there should be an age limit, so
perhaps it will not be inappropriate for me,
in commencing my few remarks this afternoon, to point out to the house that today is
the sixtieth birthday of the honourable gentleman who moved the resolution.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I have no doubt that
his career to the present time has been as
entirely satisfactory to hirn as it has been
to us, and I join with the other members of
this house in wishing him many happy
returns of the day, and express the hope that
the future years may be as happy for him
as the past ones have been.
Hon. Mr. Duff: In the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, in the Senate.
And although my immediate neighbours will
not join with me in this, I may say that as
long as be is spared I hope he will continue
to occupy in the Senate the position that be
now holds.
I come now to the subject of my remarks.
So long as I can remember, the reform or

abolition of the Senate has furnished those
seeking intellectual exercise with an interesting topic of conversation. This subject is
an all-time hardy perennial. It flourished
before you and I were born and I think I
can safely predict that it will still be doing
business at the old stand after you and I have
departed.
Nevertheless, while this topic
may be somewhat threadbare, I wish to congratulate the government leader on the very
comprehensive and excellent address which
be delivered in support of his motion. I
wish to extend the same congratulations and
compliments to the honourable leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig). When be concluded his powerful address, a most excellent
oration and one of the finest speeches I have
ever heard in this house, I felt that perhaps
the job had been done and that we need not
say anything more about it. I for one feel
the honour that it is to be a member of the
Senate of Canada; I am grateful to those who
kindly fathered my appointment to the
Senate, and I look back with joy and satisfaction to the years during which it has been
my privilege to be here. Now a formal resolution has been placed before us, and we
should do something about it. Something
which affects the actual organization of the
Canadian nation and is vastly important to
the future of Canada is thrown into the arena
of debate, and it becomes the duty of all of
us to be heard and to show where we stand.
As I listened to the mover of this resolution, in an address which I have already
characterized as an excellent one, I was
somewhat puzzled and mystified as to the
capacity in which be claimed to speak. The
member for Shelburne (Hon. Mr. Robertson)
gave us to understand that be made his
address and moved his resolution in his
private capacity. I am wondering whether
he can do that.
Hon. Mr. Duff: No.

introduced this resolution be was not only a
member of this house, as he has been for the
last five and a half years, but government
leader, a position of great honour and respon-

sibility which was conferred upon him by the
direct action of the Government of Canada,
and which he has held during most of that
time. He moved his resolution from the desk
of the leader, and moreover his resolution was

ness of mind
to follow him

the deputy leader (Hon. Mr.
confess that I lack the nimbleand eye required to enable one
as lie jumped from one capacity

to the other in this connection.

I suppose

FEBRUARY 15, 1951
it matters very little just what capacity he
occupied in making the address and in moving
the resolution; but I positively do not understand it. I can understand him, however,
when he says that he is not speaking for the
government which he represents. That is
clear at all events. His colleagues in the
Cabinet are not bound by prior consultation
to any of the suggestions that he himself
has made. The same principle applies to his
colleagues in this house. There was no prior
consultation of which I am aware between
the government leader and those who look
upon themselves as his followers. So the
honourable gentleman was not acting in the
capacity of spokesman for the Liberal members of this house in expressing the sentiments he did. I understand that and I accept
it. I think, however, it should be understood
by members of this house and others that
this is not a matter of Cabinet responsibility,
but merely a topic of debate among ourselves,
and that we, as always, should act upon our
own judgment and in accordance with our
own views.
That brings me to the first thought raised
by the leader of the government or, as I
shall refer to him from now on, the mover
of the resolution. He pointed out the difficulties which surround the leader of the government in this house, who is also by common consent and long-established tradition
leader of the Liberal party when a Liberal
government is in office, and of the Conservative party when a Conservative government
is in office. And he made this remark:
I seriously think that if the Senate is to be what
it is supposed to be it should elect its own leader.

Well, honourable senators, I have my own
opinion that the honourable gentleman was
much too modest in his remarks. While his
position is onerous as well as honourable,
his responsibilities have been discharged by
him to the entire satisfaction of members of
this house, and-judging from remarks made
yesterday by the leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig)-I think I can say to members of both shades of political opinion in this
house. Certainly it has been discharged to my
own entire satisfaction. I believe I can go so
far as to say that if there were tomorrow a
vote by Liberal government appointees for
the election of a house leader, there would be
no contenders against the present incumbent
of the position, and that he would carry the
day with unanimous approval.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: We have always been
free ta refuse to accept the leader chosen by
the government as the leader of our party

in this house. Nothing could stop us from
assembling at any time we desired and
naming some one of our own members to
be our leader, if we wanted to do such a
thing. But I suggest to my fellow senators
that we do not want a leader of that kind in
this house. It is far better that, like King
Arthur's knights at the Round Table, we
should all be equally distant fron the salt.
In this chamber it is quite unnecessary that
we should have anybody to tell us which
way to go. We are old enough to follow our
own course; and most of us have sufficient
experience not to be desirous of a leader
of that kind-and a leader without followers
is an anomaly. We are perfectly satisfied
with the leadership and the leader that we
now have, and I hope others will join with
me in encouraging him to continue the
arduous duties which he has so well discharged in the past.
Now, honourable senators, that does not
at all mean that I am going to agree with
the recommendations that the mover of the
resolution made. I think I can best contribute
to the debate by reviewing some of those
recommendations, or all of them if I can,
and expressing my personal views on them.
The mover of the resolution called attention to the preponderance of Liberal members
in the Senate, and of course there is no
argument about that. There are now only
eleven survivors of a once much more
numerous crew on the Conservative benches.
I may say frankly, honourable senators, that
I should welcome additions to their ranks. i
should like to see the opposition strengthened
-I do not mean in the personal representation at all, but strengthened by numbers and
the diversity of experience that comes with
numbers, and the punch which comes from
a larger delegation. I go further than that.
I should welcome members of the CCF and
also of the Social Credit Party, were any of
them to become members of this house, for
they would certainly add to the liveliness
of our debates, if lively debate is what is
wanted.
But really, in my judgment, the preponderance of Liberal appointees is not
nearly so serious a situation as it might
seem to be at first glance. I say that because
we are not a political house.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: In the course of the
years that I have been here I have heard a
certain amount of good-natured badinage
between members of the opposing parties, but
in our debates I have never heard what might
be described as political warfare. It is true
that the approach of some of us to certain

SENATE
questions is from a different angle than that
of others, and our debates may reveal a slight
difference in fundamentals on the part of
different members-though I should find it
rather difficult to define clearly what the
fundamentals are. But mere party warfare
has been entirely absent from the discussions
of this house, though by no means have politics in the broadest sense of the term been
in any way excluded from our thoughts. Do
not misunderstand me for one moment. I
am a member of the Liberal party; I believe
in it, take part in its activities and hope to
continue to do so; but, without going into it
at greater length or more particularity, I
think my fellow members will understand me
when I say that mere petty political warfare has been absent from our debates.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: We are a judicial body,
and in my humble judgment we have lived
up to that role with a fair degree of continuity throughout the years, viewing measures before us in an independent and more
or less detached way, the one big thought in
our minds being the effect of the proposed
legislation upon the Canada of which we are
proud to be citizens.
The mover of the resolution himself
admitted that any troubles which he has
encountered in getting government legislation
passed through the Senate have come not so
much from the Conservative opposition or
the official leader of that opposition as frorn
members of his own party. It seems to
me that this proves, or at least indicates, the
partisan detachment of our members, the
readiness of those who occupy the benches
here to consider the interests of Canada far
above party interests, independently of any
control by the government which appointed
us.
But, honourable senators, that is not my
best answer to the mover's proposal under
this head. My best answer is that the Senate
has no responsibility for the appointment of
its own members. Who is to be appointed to
the Senate is none of our business. By the
British North America Act the power of
appointment is given to the Governor, which
means the Governor in Council, and by the
practice through the years it has become one
of the prerogatives of the Prime Minister.
Neither of the two Prime Ministers under
whom I have served has seen fit to ask my
advice in the matter, and I tender to my
fellow members the thought that it would be
wisdom on my part to wait until it is asked,
rather than proffer it gratuitously. And
what applies to me in this regard may apply
equally or perhaps more forcefully to the
Senate at large. The responsibility for the
appointment of senators rests upon the mover

of this resolution and his colleagues in the
Cabinet. It is not our responsibility.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Quite right.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It is government policy,
which I think should be discussed around the
cabinet table in the east block rather than in
this chamber.
A further suggestion offered was that onethird of the new appointments to the house
be made for periods of five years, and that
the appointees be eligible for reappointment.
In my humble view, honourable
senators, the strength of the Senate of
Canada lies in its independence. With the
steadily increasing responsibility of the government, in this and other lands where the
cabinet system of government is in vogue, the
House of Commons has become more and
more the creature of the cabinet, and the
cabinet has become more and more subject
to the influence of the civil service. This
is not true of the Senate. There is no government control over this body. Honourable
senators have nothing to fear and nothing
to hope for: none of us seek advancement
or promotion of any kind. So long as we
leave appointments to the Senate as they are
today, with only the methods of defeasance
that appear in the British North America
Act, and so long as we have nothing to fear
but the promptings of our own conscience,
and nothing to seek but the good will of our
neighbours and fellow citizens, that is as it
should be.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: In the course of the
discussion of Senate reform in years gone
by I have heard a good many methods outlined for ruining this chamber, but I do not
recall ever having heard one more effective
than that at the end of every five years onethird of our members should be dependent
upon the appointing authority to continue
their membership. A scheme of that kind
would reduce such members to mere puppets
of the administration of the day. Their positions would be analogous to that of civil
servants with a five-year contract. In my
opinion, honourable senators, it would utterly
destroy the independence of senators appointed on that basis, and in all probability
it would endanger the independence of the
Senate as a whole.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I am, therefore, strongly
opposed to any such proposal.
A further reason advanced for the proposal
was couched in these words:
... to bring fresh current opinion into this house at
regular intervals.

Well, the fresh current looks to me like a
cold, damp draft.

FEBRUARY 15, 1951

The honourable member from Shelburne
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) pointed out that he was
appointed to the bouse in 1943 and that he
is now No. 43 on the list of seniority. That is
to say, of the ninety-six members who were
living when he was appointed, fifty-three have
passed on in the short course of eight years,
and their places have been filled by new
appointments.
When one considers the
mortality which strikes the members of this
house, and which hangs over the heads of all
people, particularly citizens of our age, one
wonders whether the current of new opinion
has not in these few years been almost a
gale. I was summoned to the Senate in 1945,
and am now fifty-seventh on the list. That
is to say, forty-seven senators who occupied a
place in this chamber in 1945 have passed on
to their reward. In addition to that, the six
new members from Newfoundland, and also
those who took their seats after I took mine
and who are no longer here, should be taken
into account. The honourable senator from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) told us yesterday
that he had been in the house for fifteen
years, and is now eighteenth on the list.
Although he is still a young man, within his
time in this chamber practically the entire
membership has changed. Surely, when one
considers the mortality that carries off our
members, there are enough new appointments
to satisfy anybody.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The Angel of Death
has surely been generous enough in bringing
about new appointments, without our joining in and borrowing his scythe. Let us hear
no more about retirements of the kind suggested by the honourable senator.
I come now to the proposal that an age
limit of seventy-five years be applied, not
to the present holders of seats-for like the
honourable member for Shelburne, we all
have birthdays-but to new appointees who
come to the house after us.
There are three great principles observed
in drafting Acts of Parliament: They are,
first, What is the evil to be corrected? second,
What are the means to be adopted? and
third, What are the results to be obtained?
If we were drafting a statute for the purpose
of applying an age limit in this way, I would
ask honourable senators, What is the evil to
be corrected? Has anyone in this chamber
the hardihood to suggest that the Senate
would be improved now by dropping out
honourable members who have attained the
age of seventy-five years and replacing them
with younger men? And if not now, why
in the future? Are we not to judge the future
by the present? If honourable gentlemen over
the age of seventy-five who are now among
us are to remain, what are the arguments

that would justify a different treatment of
those who will be seventy-five in the years
to come? I know that personalities should
usually be kept out of our debates, but I
think I am justified in making an exception
in this instance. Is there anybody in this
house, is there anyone in Canada who would
deny Sir Allen Aylesworth the joy he has in
occupying a position in this chamber? Not a
soul.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Would anyone argue
for a moment that our deliberations would
be bettered, our judgment improved, or any
other worthy object accomplished by dropping him from the membership of this house?
May I express the wish that he will live to
one hundred and fifty: may he long live
to enjoy the honours and responsibilities
which, as a respected and revered member
of this house, are now his.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: My honourable friend
from Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte) points out
that the late Senator Dandurand lived to the
age of eighty-two. The leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), in his masterly address
yesterday, cited the instance of Mr. Gladstone, who carried on his Midlothian campaign when he was over eighty. His wonderful speeches, long, detailed and masterly,
were published in book form. I have read
a number of them.
Hon. Mr. Haig: He was Prime Minister for
the fourth time at the age of eighty-three.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I know that he was
over eighty when he made his Midlothian
campaign. It has been said that Supreme
Court Judges retire at seventy-five. But, I
submit, honourable senators, there is no
analogy between a member of the Supreme
Court bench and a member of the Senate.
The task of sitting day after day listening for
hours to legal arguments, or to contests on
the floor of a court, and then of writing judgments, with all the care and responsibility
they entail, is an arduous one. Many a young
man bas broken down under the strain of
this exacting work. There is no such pressure upon the senators of Canada. What is
required of us is good judgment, experience,
knowledge, understanding and integrity,
rather than quantity production. It is what
we do, and the wisdom and judgment that we
throw into it; not how much we do, not the
number of hours we devote to it, not the
amount of slugging or that kind of exertion
that we put in. The people of Canada are
not interested in how long we work, but in
what we do, how we do it, and how well we
protect their interests; and I believe that,

SENATE

judged by those standards, we and our predecessors have justified our existence over
the years.
My submission is that the true independence of this body cannot be maintained without security of tenure for those who hold
seats in this chamber, and that any monkeying
or tinkering with the constitution in this
respect will destroy or at least weaken our
strength.
An Hon. Senalor: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The honourable leader
of the opposition made some reference to an
elective Senate. I am glad that he made it
clear that he did not favour this proposal.
Neither do I. I do not think anybody will
charge me with being other than a pretty
good democrat. I believe in the rule of the
people at large; and had I been asked to vote
on the question, not at this point but ab
initio, when the Senate was being formed, I
might have had a good deal of difficulty in
making up my mind whether I favoured an
elective or an appointive Senate. But that
is not the position today.
I have just returned from a marvellous
trip around the world; and I spent some time
in the delightful islands of New Zealand.
During my stay in that country the Senate
of New Zealand, expired. It is now a thing of
the past. One reason that it passed out is
that, because of some complicated process of
appointments which I do not fully understand,
the elective system played a part in its
composition. The result was that members
of the Senate found themselves in a position
analogous to if not exactly the same as that
of the members of the lower house. Parliament had become a body of elected; men
divided into two chambers: the second
chamber was a part of the political system,
obeying the behests of the administration,
entirely under its control, playing its game
at all times.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask my honourable
friend if what he has said is not also true of
the United States, whose Senate also is
elective?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I shall refer in a moment
to the United States Senate, but from a
rather different angle. In New Zealand the
people came to the conclusion that the Senate
was a useless expense because it was a mere
appendage of the political system, and they
abolished it. While I was in that country
the senators joined hands and sang "Shall
auld acquaintance be forgot", and passed
out-in the words of the poet-"unwept
unhonoured and unsung". The same results
could be brought about in Canada by the
adoption of the same system.

My honourable friend from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler) has just mentioned the Senate of
the United States. Originally these senators
were appointed by State governments; and as
the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
said yesterday afternoon, log-rolling-and,
I will add, charges of corruption; and I will
add again, misuse of seats in the Senate to
advance political interests in particular States,
thus playing State politics in a national body
-became so intolerable that, in spite of the
difficulty of altering the constitution, the American people .changed the method of appointment. Today senatorships are on an elective
basis. I wish my voice could be heard in
another place when I say that in the United
States the Senate is now the important legislative body, and the House of Representatives
-which is tantamount to our House of Commons-has sunk into a position of inferiority.
Personally, I am not the least bit afraid of an
elective provision being introduced in this
house. I may be over-confident, but I think
that if I wished to remain here I could be
re-elected. And this applies to most of us.
There would undoubtedly be a degree of
mortality, 'but I am sure that most of us could
be re-elected if we so 'desired. I would say
to the members of the House of Commons
that if we were to return here as elected
representatives of the people we would immediately become the leading bouse; and notwithstanding the advantage they have in
the matter of initiating money bills, they
would be forced into an inferior position.
I do not want such a situation to come
about, because I think the Fathers of Confederation acted wisely when they provided
that the Senate should be a revising body of
sober second thought, and that the House of
Commons should be the place in which to
initiate most legislation, including money
bills. They intended that legislation, after
it had been dealt with by the Commons,
should be sent to this house, where it would
be reviewed, amended and improved by an
independent, judicial and patriotic body,
interested above all things in the welfare of
the Canadian people. That is a wise and
It has
excellent system; and it works.
worked in the past and it will work in the
future. Can you imagine an election that
would send some members to this house and
some to the other bouse, thus dividing the
popular representation of the country into
two chambers? What would be gained by
that? And how much would be lost? How
soon would there be a demand that all
assemble in the same room because all are
serving in the same capacity?
My general conclusion is that, short of
establishing an elective system, there is no

FEBRUARY 15, 1951

satisfactory or reasonable substitute for contînuing the administrative responsibility of
the governiment of the day in making
appointments to the Senate. Under the circumstances I arn thoroughly convinced that
we would be very much wiser to retain the
systemn we have than to adopt one that we
know not of. The Parliament of Canada
would be poorer if, by any chance, this continuai discussion about the reform of the
Senate should lead in due course-and partly
because of our own foolishness-to the abolition of the Senate. Ottawa would not; be
the same place without the sober-and I use
this word in both its senses-second thought
which the Senate gives to legisiation.
I wish also to refer to, the suggestion that
we ask the government and the House of
Commons to give us more work to do. Honourable senators, I am thoroughly sick of the
proposition that we should go wailing to the
government and the House of Commons complaining that we are sitting around doing
nothing and want more to do. To begin with,
I do not think it is wise that we initiate anything 'but routine measures in this bouse. By
doing so we would reverse tbe order of
procedure: we would become responsible for
the initiation of legislation and the House of
Commons would become responsible for the
sober second thougt-a commodity which
might be a little lacking.
I arn sick too of the talk that has been
going on for so long about getting Ministers
of the Crown to initiate legisiation in tbis
bouse. The honourable senator from Southern New Brunswick (Hon. Mr. McLean) bas
called my attention to the debate which took
place here in 1934 about the work of the
Senate. No doubt my friend frorn Lethbridge
(Hon. Mr. Buýchanan) will remember that
debate vividly. Those who took part in it
kept urging the Cabinet to give them more
work, and they wanted more cabinet members to sit in this chamber. In my opinion
the Senate should not keep Up this agitation.
For one thing îit is infra diq, and for another
thing the Cabinet members would neyer
agree to it. They would be unwise if they
did. Obviously tbe minister wbo prepares
important legislation-usually at a great deal
of labour to bimself-is going to introduce
it in the bouse of wbich be is a member, and
not where he is a stranger. If we want more
work to do we sbould create it for ourselves.
We ail know that there is plenty that could
be done.
Let me deviate for a moment to speak about
the complaint as to the ru-sh of legislation
which cornes from. the other bouse a day or so
before the date set for prorogation. We have
been cornplaining about this for a long time.
Whose f ault is it, if not our own? Who closes

the Parliament of Canada if we do not close
it right here? Why do we allow ourselves
to be pushed around? Somebody says that
parliament shall prorogue on a certain date,
and we have to close our debates to meet the
deadline. When legisiation is rushed to us
during the last days of the session we should
say: "We too have a duty to, perform with
regard to this legisiation, and we are going to
carry out this duty irrespective of how long it
takes us. We shall stay here until we are
finished our work." By adopting such a
policy it might be that we could have a longer
recess in the earlier stages of the session. We
should let the members of the other house
thoroughly unýderstand that the session does
flot conclude until we are through with the
legîsiation they have sent to us. We should
be allowed to çomplete our work with ful
satisfaction to ourselves; and 1 have no doubt
this would be of benefit to the country at
large.
I amn sure the honourable member from
Lethbridge will flot; hold it against me if I
refer to a portion of what he said during the
debate of 1934 to whieh I have referred. I
read the debate through from. end to end, and
I know that he, and only he, made a suggestion of which I entirely approve. He said:
Durlng the time I have been a member here I
have come ta feel that the Senate can render a
very great service to Canada through the carrying
on of inquiries in existing committees, or perhaps in
special committees appolnted to deal with particular
problems. Nearly ail the congressional inquirles at
Washington are conducted by the Sena-te, though
some of them are carried on in a way that might
not be possible here. I do flot know of any legislative body in this country that numbers among its
members sa many experienced legIslators as does
the Senate of Canada. There are in this chamber
honourable gentlemen who have served in municipal
life, in provincial. legislatures and cabinets, and in
the House of Commons. and even a considerable
number who have been members of the federal government. These men, with their ripe experience,
are well qualified to inquire into matters about
which the people are greatly concerned and desire
the utmost information. My honourable friend from
Sydney (Hon. Mr. McLennan> rather bemoaned the
fact that the work of our Senate committees did not;
seem ta lead anywhere-that their recommendations
were not followed by action. In many instances
that is possibly true. But I think the important
benefit gained from these inquiries is the information which the people receive, and which enabies
them to form opinions on questions that are before
the country.

He then mentioned inquiries by two committees on which he had served-the Special
Committee on the St. Lawrence Waterways
and the Standing Committee on Agriculture
and Forestry-and he remarked:
I feel that both committees justified their appoint-

ment.

FEBRUARY 15, 1951

I think everyone in this country was in
entire agreement with the announcement by
the Prime Minister of the expenditure of
$5m billion for Canada's defence program
during the next three years. It is interesting
to note what other countries have had to say
about Canada's part in the general defence
program. In this regard I wish te read a
quotation from the New York Herald Tribune,
as follows.
The New York Herald Tribune today hails
Canada's defence budget as a "promise of Canada's
destiny as one of the world's major powers."
The Herald Tribune says editorially that Canada's
role in the free world bas never been questioned,
"yet even the most optimistic champion of this
young nation must be impressed by the defence
effort" outlined Monday In Parliament.

-There has been some criticism of a recent
speech made by the former Minister of Air
in the other house, in which he proposed that
a committee be set up to review defence
expenditures. Whilst I realize the weakness
of the setting up of committees, and would
not approve of a committee having the right to
challenge higher officials on government
policy in the defence program, I believe that
there should be set up a civilian committee,
composed perhaps, of senators and members
of the House of Commons, but apart from the
government itself and defence personnel.
After all, the expenditure of about $2 billion
a year is of some importance, and there should
be some check made on it.
On the question of price controls, we all
know the difficulties which the government
encountered in setting up and enforcing price
controls during world war II. Further, we
appreciate that what can be done in wartime
cannot always be so easily accomplished in
times of peace. However, one can scarcely
say that we are now in times of peace, for,
although we are not actually at war, we are
getting ready for what might be a third
world war. I think that the Canadian
people realize this, and for the most part are
in favour of controls.
To illustrate the type of demands that are
being made today, there recently appeared
in the Vancouver Sun an article to the effect
that the plumbers in the city of Vancouver
are asking that their present rate of pay of
$1.75 per hour be increased to $2.75 per hour;
bricklayers are demanding an additional
increase up to $1.88, and other workers want
proportionate increases. Without going into
the merits or demerits of their demands, I
use this illustration to point up the fact that
we are in a period of high prices and high
costs.
The plumbers of Vancouver, for
instance, put up an argument for increases
which is somewhat hard to meet. They
point out to the employers in British Colum-

bia that plumbers in Seattle receive the wage
rate for which they are asking, and that the
cost of food and goods in that part of the
United States is in many instances lower than
in Canada.
I recently took with me across the border
a list of food items and other articles of
every-day use, and on comparing the cost in
Canada of those items with the cost of the
same goods in the United States it was
apparent that prices generally were much
higher in Canada. I think it might be well
to look into the fact that in the United States
there seems to be a great deal of competition
in the price of such articles as matches and
other household goods, but little, if any, in
Canada.
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: What about the cost of
meat?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Well, if we want to go to
the Argentine for it, we can buy beef at
fifteen cents a'pound. But it seems that even
Great Britain does not choose to go there for
her needs. And what would the Canadian
farmers say if we proposed to import Argentine beef?
On the question of defence contracts the
honourable senator from Halifax-Dartmouth
(Hon. Mr. Isnor) drew the attention ef the
house te the fact that most of the contracts
for defence needs were being given to industrial firms in the provinces of Ontario and
Quebec. I strongly support him in the stand
he took, for it is plain to see that some of
the things that happened in 1940 are happening again today. I well remember being
asked by the Vancouver Board of Trade to
wait over in Ottawa for a period to see if
that province could get a fair share of
defence contracts. I discovered that every
room in the Chateau Laurier was filled with
businessmen carrying brief-cases and interviewing the government on behalf of the
industrial companies of Ontario and Quebec
Many of them were saying: "Why, British
Columbia! All it has are tall trees and fish."
I hasten to point out, honourable senators,
that in the manufacturing of ships and munitions of war, British Columbia industry
turned out ships and equipment that were
better and superior to what was turned out
in any other part of Canada; and when the
government was in a hurry for some special
articles the industrial firms of British Columbia were called upon to perform those
services.
Let me go a step further. I realize
that the government cannot tell a firm to go
and build a plant in Halifax, on the prairies
or out in British Columbia; yet mention is
made every day about the serious threat of

SENATE
atomic warfare. Do we really believe it will
Do we agree with General Hoyt
come?
S. Vandenburg, Chief of the United States
Air Force, who says that nothing can defend
the United States from an atomic bomb attack
by Russia? He thinks that even with radar
stations every ten miles, the best that could
be hoped for would be to bring down twenty
to thirty per cent of the Russian bombers.
He cites the gallant action of the allied air
force against the Luftwaffe in the Battle
of Britain, and points to the fact that slightly
under ten per cent of the enemy aircraft
were destroyed. Then, if we believe this
country to be in immediate danger from
atomic warfare, why is it that no directions
are being given for the distribution of industrial plants throughout this country from the
Atlantic to the Pacifie? True, the question
of labour is an important one; but if the
safety of the nation is at stake, the government should consider decentralization of
industry more seriously than it has in the
past. Of course it is not practical to move
a large airplane factory from Halifax to the
prairies or to British Columbia, but there is
a great deal of work-particularly on the
secret list-which could be strategically
placed throughout the ten provinces. To my
mind it is not wise to centralize industry in
heavily populated centres such as Montreal,
Toronto or Hamilton.
The government should also be giving more
attention than it bas been giving to the
defence of the Pacifie coast. I do not know
how many of us review our geography from
time to time. I find it a wonderful education to do so. When we look at a map of the
world it is readily apparent that the northern
sea-coast of Russia is on the 70th parallel of
latitude, and that Churchill, in northern Manitoba, is around the 60th parallel. The great
Russian port of Vladivostok is situated on
the 45th parallel, which is about the latitude of Toronto, Vancouver and Seattle. It
may interest honourable senators to know
that last year ten drydocks were towed
through the Panama Canal on their way to
Vladivostok. I sometimes think that all that
some people in the East think of is the
Atlantic coast, forgetting entirely about the
Pacifie coast. Yet that is where the Russians
may attack. As a matter of fact, they once
owned Alaska. At one time Russia claimed
sovereignty over the Pacifie Ocean, and occupied military forts and ports as far south as
San Francisco. So I urge the government
to pay more heed to the Pacifie, and for the
safety of the nation to decentralize industry,
particularly our war industries.
And, what about our cities and hospitals?
The great General Hospital in Vancouver,
filled with patients, is jammed in the heart
of the city. Can anybody imagine what

would happen if atom bombs were dropped
on Vancouver? As a senator I am going to
object to the expenditure by the Department
of Health and Welfare of any more money on
the enlarging of Vancouver General Hospital.
It is almost too large now, and it is in one
of the most populous centres in the heart of
the city. We must be practical about such
matters. We talk too lightly about the
atomic bomb; in our hearts many of us do
not fully realize its possibilities. If we did,
measures of preparedness would be under
way now, before any such calamity comes
upon us.
I think the international situation today
can be fairly described by saying that the
world is afiame. Let me mention where the
fla-mes are. There is the war in Korea; there
is the upheaval in China-the Communist
victory, so-called, and there is war in IndoChina. There is a very difficult and serious
situation in Burma; and terrorism in Malaya.
India and Pakistan are at loggerheads over
Kashmir. Indonesia is ravaged by disorder.
There is of course the menace of Soviet
people
and
well-informed
imperialism;
believe that Yugoslavia may be attacked by
some of her neighbours behind the Iron
Curtain. Another danger I foresee-and it
is one of the greatest-is the threat of discord and division between the members of
the North Atlantic pact. Moreover, treaties
of peace with Germany and Japan-of which
I will speak in a few moments-have yet to be
signed.
I believe that the position taken by Hon.
Mr. Pearson, the Secretary of State, with
regard to Korea was the right one, and that
the British were justified in recognizing the
Chinese government. I do not believe anyone
can successfully controvert the statement
that Great Britain has had a long experience
in the matter of external relations and foreign
affairs, and that she knows more about
eastern and other foreign countries, diplomatically speaking, than either the United
States or many other powers.
Hon. Mr. Baird: Communist China?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Was she wrong to recognize
China?

Hon. Mr. Duff: She was wrong.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The honourable senator
from Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duff) is entitled
to his opinion, but I am inclined to the view
that she was right, and that it is unwise to
simply attach the term "Communist" to China
without giving a second thought to what is
going on in that country. Nehru, who knows
conditions well in Korea and China, has
stated that such an attitude may throw the
Chinese right into the arma of Soviet Russia.

FEBRUARY 15, 1951
No country has ever conquered China, and
J do not believe any country ever will. The
Japanese tried for many years to do so, and
failed,. China is nationalist in just the same
way as Canada or any other nation is
nationalist. Nationalism is strongly rooted
among the Chinese, and many other people
as well. I was pleased to read that Great
Britain bas sent to Peiping an envoy in the
person of Lionel Henry Lamb. Canada has
no such envoy to China, although we have
reluctantly followed. Great Britain in warning the. United States, through Mr. Pearson,
that although we voted for the resolution
denouncing China 'as an aggressor, very
serious thought will be necessary before our
consent is given to the application of
sanctions. China is not to be defeated merely
by branding ber as communistic. I believe
the warning given by General Eisenhower
should be taken to heart. He urges us not
to fall into the trap set for us by Russia, by
diverting all our manpower into a large
armed, force for the purpose of defeating the
Chinese. I can well understand the feelings
of the people of the United States. They have
100,000 troops in Korea, and because of their
heavy casualties the impact of the war has
come upon them as, probably, upon no other
nation. But this -is no time for the American
people to get hysterical. Such resolutions as
were passed by the American Legion have
no other effect than to promote dissension,
which is the aim of Soviet Russia. The
Legion, of course, wants to have Red China
condemned as criminal. But I object particularly to this clause in, their resolution:
Let us cut off
not give positive
trading with the
us through thick

all aid to every nation that does
assurance that it will refrain from
enemy and that It will stand with
and thin.

One of the dangers of the moment is that
in the United States many people are in a
mood to label as Communist and pro-Soviet
any nation that disagrees with what they do.
I suppose every honourable senator understands the reasons why Great Britain, with
some misgiving, reluctantly voted to condemn Red China as an aggressor. But when
it comes to imposing sanctions on that nation,
the British, and our Secretary of State for
External Affairs, are taking the right attitude, I believe, when they contend that this
is not the time to go that far.
I was very pleased to read that Canada has
decided to assist in the carrying out of
what is known as the Colombo Plan. The
details of the aid we intend to give have not
yet been made public. In this connection I
want to draw attention to some figures I
received the other day which emphasize the
serious conditions which exist not only in
Colombo but in India, Japan, Java, and other

Asian countries. It is pointed out that before
the term of the Colombo Plan has expired
there will be 57,000,000 more mouths to feed
in that area. This is a staggering increase.
During the past ninety years something like
100 million persons have died from starvation in India. At the present time India's
population is 350 million, and it is estimated
that within ten years this number will have
been increased by 50 million. Not so long
ago the population of Japan was 27 million,
but today it is 85 million. I mention these
figures so that honourable senators may
appreciate what I have in mind-that we
should provide the technical skill, machinery,
and knowledge that will help these people to
feed themselves. Neither Canada, the United
States nor any other country could ever begin
to feed the teeming millions who live in these
countries. It is truly alarming to contemplate
what the populations of these countries may
be in a few years to come.
I wish to refer now to the peace treaties,
one of which bas to do with the re-arming
of Western Germany. I think a great deal
can be said in favour of it. Premier Konrad
Adenauer of West Germany recently said
that if his country were not re-armed it
could very easily fall into the hands of Soviet
Russia. A stumbling block at the moment
is France, which views with some alarmand perhaps rightly so-a revival of the great
military might that the Germans had in the
days of Nazism. I think our Prime Minister
was right when he said that Canada's best
plan would be to provide arms, ammunition
and military might for ourselves as well as
for nations such as West Germany.
It is interesting to note that, although only
token troops are going to be sent to Europe
within the next two months, Russia did not
show any intimation of agreeing to meet the
delegates of the four world powers until
this decision to send troops to Western Europe
was made. Russia has done extremely well
without any actual fighting or losing a man.
It is not generally known that there is a
cold-blooded group of men in Moscow weighing every piece of information that comes to
them, and that with ber well calculated plans
Russia has so far not made many mistakes.
Whether she will actually go to war or not
is any man's guess; but if she can take Germany, China and other countries without
fighting or loss of blood by ber own people,
she will do that very thing. She is a very
practical nation. Sometimes I think we do
not realize just how practical the Asiatics
are; I do not believe we try to understand
their mentality.
Honourable senators, my main purpose in
rising today was to speak about the peace
treaty with Japan. According to a recent

SENATE
press article John Foster Dulles of the U.S.
has just returned from peace talks in Japan,
and is soon to visit the Philippines, Australia
and New Zealand for further talks. The
article did not disclose whether Canada is to
be consulted before any peace treaty is signed
with the Japanese. Now, Canada is a Pacifie
nation as well as an Atlantic nation. We have
great fisheries on the West Coast and we are
vitally interested in what the Americans are
proposing in any treaty with the Japanese
with respect to the Japanese fishing industry.
Time does some strange things, and I think
it would have been easier to have negotiated
a peace treaty with Japan last year than it
is now. If we wait much longer Japan is
going to be sitting in the driver's seat, because
of the fact that the Chinese are in Korea.
If you take a map and see just how close
Japan is to Korea, you will understand why
the American Government and military men
are anxious that Japan re-arm. They see the
menace that is rising there, and so the rearmament of Japan has become a most vital
factor indeed.
Before the last war Japan was the greatest
fishing nation of the world, and I think she
still holds that position. In 1939 Japan had
a million men employed in her fishing industry, and her fishing fleets sailed everywhere
on the Pacific Ocean. I do not believe she ever
sent her ships to the Atlantic, but she sent
large fishing vessels down the Pacifie coast
of North America. Her ships were to be
found in Bristol Bay and in the American
waters off Alaska. The Japanese fishermen,
using nets of two miles or more in length-something almost unbelievable to the Canadian fishermen-and fishing fifteen to twenty
miles off Bristol Bay, were catching salmon
which were on their way to spawn in Alaskan
rivers. Naturally the Americans were up in
arms about this-actually they did come
close to taking up arms-but the United
States Government stepped in and Japan
agreed to withdraw her fishing vessels. As
honourable senators will remember, before
the last war broke out, Japan signified her
intention of withdrawing from the sealing
treaty which she, Canada and the United
States had signed.
In 1949 the United States Government sent
a three-man delegation to Japan to talk to
the fishermen of that country and get their
views about world fisheries. This delegation
was well received by General MacArthur,
and was given every opportunity to do its
work. Following a three months' investigation the delegation returned to the United
States and reported to the President, among
other things that the Japanese were partieularly interested in utilizing world fisheries
with no restraint at all.

The Japanese have no sense of conservation
of fish. They do not take the precautions that
we do in our country to see that the fish
supplies are not destroyed. Before the war
the Australians were worried because they
found Japanese fishing fleets five miles off
their coast. Some of us are now wondering
just how far Canada has been consulted in
the proposed peace treaty with Japan, particularly as to the matter of conservation of
fish. I know that we are worried about it
in British Columbia.
The government has made no announcement about any fishery agreement in the
proposed treaty. We believe, and rightly so,
that unless the Japanese are restricted in
the treaty which is about to be made, they
will once again sail across the ocean to
deplete fisheries that we claim rightly belong
to us. I know that when the Japanese were
taking the salmon from Bristol Bay they
said: "Well, we examined the fish we caught
and we didn't find any Canadian or American
flag stamped on their backs, so we claim
them as ours because we caught them out
in the open sea". Their contention was that
these fish, having been caught in the waters
outside the three mile limit, were theirs.
They did not listen to arguments that the
fish had their home in British Columbia and
United States rivers and lakes, and that had
it not been for the careful supervision maintained by the governments of Canada and the
United States, and likewise the expenditure
of large sums of money, no fish would be
there at all. In a strict sense the Japanese
are not concerned with conservation of the
fisheries, and I fear that if their ships are
once again allowed to roam all over the
oceans they will not only endanger peace but
will deplete one of our great natural
resources, the salmon, halibut, cod, tuna and
herring fisheries.
I have before me an account of the Pacifie
Fisheries Conference which was held in San
Francisco early in November last. Mr.
Susumu Nikaido, a member of the Japanese
Diet and of its Fisheries Committee, and
Mr. Tahei Iiyama, former chief of the
Fisheries Agency of the Japanese Government, together with Mr. Kenjiro Chikaraishi,
Secretary of the Foreign Office of Japan, had
a discussion with leading American representatives of the Pacifie Coast fishing
industry. The attention of Mr. Nikaido was
called to the fact that when the MacArthur
Fisheries Mission visited Japan last year the
heads of the leading ocean fishing companies

of Japan had all admitted a desire to enter
the coastal fisheries of the United States and

MIGRATORY BIRDS CONVENTION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Norman McL. Paterson moved the
second reading of Bill V, an Act to amend
the Migratory Birds Convention Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the amendments to the Migratory Birds Convention Act
proposed in this Bill are all of a minor nature,
and are designed to bring the Act up to date.
This Act, which was adopted in 1917 with
the hearty approval of all parties in parliament, implements the Migratory Birds Treaty
between His Majesty the King and the United
States of America for the preservation and
conservation of migratory birds, which
according to their nature travel back and
forth each year across the international
boundary. As honourable senators are aware,
this Act and the corresponding legislation in
the United States provide similar and adequate protection for migratory birds in these
two great countries, and for more than thirty
years have been of outstanding value in the
accomplishment of their objective.
Through the years, experience gained in
the administration of the Act and regulations

has from

time to time revealed

the

desirability of improvements, to enable the
basic objectives to be better realized. The
amendments now proposed all fall into this
category. Thus the legal advisers of the
Crown now consider in view of other enactments that the provisions of subsection 2 of
section 5 are no longer necessary.
Subsections 5 and 6 of section 5 are being
consolidated in order to make it clear that
all the provinces of Canada are on the same
footing with respect to the appointment of
game officers. Subsection 5 was placed in the
Act because the Province of Ontario desired
that its game officers be appointed game
officers under the Act; subsection 6 was added
later when other provinces made similar
requests. The present proposed consolidation does not alter the scope or effect of subsections 5 and 6, but only provides for uniformity in the appointment of game officers
in all the provinces.
The principal amendment embodied in the
present bill is the proposed amendment to
Section 7 of the Act. In recent years it has
become clear that with the increased use of
motor vehicles and aircraft in hunting, these
instruments of transportation should be specifically included among the articles which, if
used in committing violations of the Act, can

FEBRUARY 19, 1951
be seized by game officers. This amendment was requested by the 1950 Conference
of Federal and Provincial Wild Life Officers,
in which the principal game administrators of
the Canadian provinces took part.
When this bill has received second reading
it is my intention to move that it be referred
to the Standing Committee on Natural
Resources.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
I agree generally with what has been said by
the honourable senator from Thunder Bay
(Hon. Mr. Paterson) in his explanation of the
bill on the motion for second reading.
I rise at this time for the specific purpose
of paying a brief tribute to Ducks Unlimited,
that great international sportsmen's organization created for the purpose of encouraging
the propagation of water fowl by restoring the
nesting and breeding grounds in the Prairie
provinces of Canada. All honourable senators know that 75 per cent of wild ducks, and
possibly 100 per cent of wild geese, are bred
and raised north of the northern boundary of
the United States.
During the terrible
drought which visited Canada, particularly
the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan
and Alberta, from 1930 on for almost ten
years, the duck population was reduced in
those provinces by millions. The ducks were
propagated, but because lakes and sloughs,
and in some cases rivers, dried up, these wild
fowl died by the million. Now it stands to
reason that if our wild fowl should pass out,
as the passenger pigeon did, there would be no
need for a bill of this kind.
This great organization of Ducks Unlimited
was created for the purposes I have mentioned. It was formed, not by Canadians, but
by American sportsmen who were very much
interested in the ·opportunity of shooting
some of the ducks and geese and other
migratory birds which are raised in Canada,
when they fly south in the fall. As honourable senators know there are four great flyways from Canada to the United States. One
is on the Pacific slope, where wild fowl fly
through the Yellowhead and other passes in
the northern Pacific area and down the west
coast. Another route, known as the central
fly-way, runs through Alberta, Saskatchewan
and Manitoba. In my opinion it is the biggest
of the fly-ways and is used by the largest
number of migratory birds. Another, known
as the Mississippi fly-way, is used for their
flight south by birds which are raised in
northern Ontario and the Hudson Bay and
James Bay districts. Also there is the eastern
fly-way, in the area of the east coast. The
birds which use these fly-ways winter in the
southern United States, in Mexico and in
Central America.

By 1934 the duck population had decreased
to such an extent that sportsmen were greatly
alarmed. I do considerable hunting in the
fall of each year, and I noticed that the
numbers of both ducks and geese had greatly
diminished. Then some American sportsmen
formed the organization I have mentioned.
They put up ail' the money which has been
spent to construct dams, control structures,
canals, fencing and the rest; but there is a
Canadian organization which works with the
American society; and if the honourable
senator from Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr.
Paterson) were a less modest man he would
have told us that he is one of the directors
of the Canadian organization and has had
a great deal to do with the erection of works
of this kind.
Before concluding this part of my remarks
I wish to mention that, during the fourteen
years it has been in operation, Ducks Unlimited has constructed three hundred projects, all of them in Manitoba, Saskatchewan
and Alberta. Included in these works are five
hundred dams, one thousand water control
structures, and many miles of canals and
fencing around government pastures and
other areas where dams have been built. I
can speak from experience. A dam bas
been built near Rosetown, Saskatchewan,
where I live, and where I do considerable
hunting in the fall. This dam, which did not
cost a large amount of money, created a lake
of several miles in length, and last f all it
was full of ducks of every kind, and some
geese. On Thanksgiving Day, 1949, I visited
the project known as Buffalo Lake north
of Coleville, Saskatchewan. I sat on the
bank of that lake one evening and saw some
ten thousand geese fly out to feed. This took
more than an hour. I was there with some
friends for the purpose of hunting those geese
next morning.
Hon. Mr. King: Did you get them all?
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I assure honourable
senators that we left quite a number for the
southern flight. This Buffalo Lake project
is one of the large ones. The dam has not
created a big lake but it is several miles long
and is just about the right depth. The geese
take full advantage of this lake and gather
there to breed. Incidentally, before that dam
was built thpre was not a drop of water anywhere in that part of the country. For these
reasons I want to pay tribute to Ducks
Unlimited, for the great work it is doing.
I have not much to sayabout the bill itself,
but there are some questions which I should

SENATE
like to ask when the bill is referred to committee. I have in my hand an office consolidation, dated September 1, 1950, of the
regulations issued under the Migratory Birds
Convention Act. I should like to read from
section 18:
Throughout Canada, no person, who is not otherwise permitted under these regulations to do so
shall kill, hunt, capture, injure, take or molest or
attempt to kill, hunt, capture, injure, take or molest
a migratory game bird.

And I would refer honourable senators
to paragraph (h) which reads:
by using a power-boat, aeroplane or motor
vehicle to disturb birds with the object of driving
them towards a hunter;

In my opinion these regulations do not
go nearly far enough, because I know of
several cases in which aeroplanes were flown
in from the country to the south of us and,
after the party had shot several hundred
geese, were flown back to the United States.
I think it is wise that the Act should be
amended in such a way that if this practice is
continued the offending parties can be apprehended and their automobile or aeroplane
confiscated and turned over to the Crown
by the magistrate or the justice of the peace
hearing the case. Many people, probably
because they are ignorant of the regulations,
still use automobiles to hunt and chase birds.
Two years ago a case came to my attention
of hunters in the Eston district of Saskatchewan using an automobile to herd the geese
over the heads of their fellow hunters, who
were hiding farther down the field. It so
happened that these hunters were caught and
prosecuted, and their firearms were confiscated. Under this new provision the automobile, too, could be seized if it were found
that it was being used in violation of the Act.
I suggest to all persons who are in the
habit of hunting migratory birds in the fall
that they get a copy of these regulations,
which contain a copy of the Act and the
detailed restrictions that are applicable.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: There is one question I
should like to ask the honourable gentleman
from Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr. Paterson). It
was brought to my attention by a fisherman
along the Nova Scotia coast. While everything
possible is being done to strengthen the Act so
far as protection of birds is concerned, very
little if any attention has been paid to the
damage that these birds do to fishermen's
nets and other equipment. I should therefore
like to ask the honourable gentleman whether
any study bas been made with a view to
permitting fishermen to protect their own
interests by killing birds that harm fishing
equipment?

Hon. Mr. Paterson: My understanding is
that in New Brunswick . . .
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I am speaking of Nova
Scotia.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: I am not sure of Nova
Scotia, but I understand that in New Brunswick a bounty of 25 cents a head was paid
on the mergansers, which are not fit for use
and are very destructive of salmon and
salmon eggs. I understand that the merganser can swim under water as fast as a
fish, and that one of these birds consumes
from 25 to 50 young salmon a day for food.
Mergansers do a great deal of harm, and
efforts are being made to destroy as many as
possible of these depredators. I shall try to
get the required information for the honourable senator by the time that the bill gets into
committee.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Thank you very much.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Paterson: Honourable senators, I
move that this bill be referred to the Standing
Committee on Natural Resources.
The motion was agreed to.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. Gordon Fogo moved the second
reading of Bill L-1, an Act to incorporate
Canadian-Montana Pipe Line Company.
He said: Honourable senators, I assured a
senator who spoke to me a few minutes ago
that the explanation of this bill would be
very short, because the pipe line which the
company contemplates building is very short.
The bill proposes to incorporate a company
by special legislation, as required under
the general Pipe Lines Act, for the construction of a pipe-line from a point in the southeastern area of the Province of Alberta to the
Montana border, to join with an existing pipeline there. The total length of the proposed
pipe-line is approximately 36 miles. The
incorporators of the conipany, who are named
in the bill, are the principal executive officers
of the McColl-Frontenac Oil Company and of
the Montana Power Company, of Butte,
Montana.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Is the pipe-line for gas or
oil?
Hon. Mr. Fogo: It is for gas. The proposal
is based on the fact that during the period
from 1943 to 1948 the McColl-Frontenac Oil
Company Limited and the Union Oil Company of California were instrumental in

FEBRUARY 19, 1951

having drilled 47 wells in the area to which
I have referred, at a cost of approximately
$1,365,000, and in this way they proved four
relatively small natural gas fields in what
is known as the Pakowki Lake area, near
the south-eastern corner of the Province of
Alberta. The most southerly of these fields is
within a mile and a half of the AlbertaMontana border, and the most northerly is
about 30 miles from the boundary. During the
year 1950-51 three further wells were drilled
there, at an approximate cost of $80,000.
The fields are known as the Manyberries
field, the Pendant D'Oreille field, the SmithCoulee field and the Black Butte field. The
proposed pipe-line would consist first of all
of a 104 inch pipe-line from a central point
in the Manyberries field to a suitable junction in the Pendant D'Oreille field, from
which a 16-inch pipe-line would extend 15
miles to the Canadian-United States border,
where it would connect with an existing line
in the United States.
Anticipating a question that was asked
about a former bill, I may say here that the
construction of this line would not require a
very large quantity of steel, and that the
necessary steel has already been contracted
for.
Hon. Mr. Reid: How many tons?
Hon. Mr. Fogo: The Canadian pipe-line
will require an estimated 4,895 tons.
The McColl-Frontenac Oil Company is, of
course, well known to honourable senators,
and, perhaps it would be appropriate to say
that the Montana Power Company is a public
utility company in Montana, which since
1931 has been distributing natural gas to
domestic, commercial and industrial users in
that state. Its principal industrial customer
is the Anaconda Copper Mining Company
which, as most honourable members know,
is a very important contributor of base
metals, and these have a great value at this
present time. There has been some depletion
of the gas reserves in Montana, and in due
course, as will appear in evidence whenever
it is required on the necessary applications
following the incorporation of the company,
the gas which is procurable from the Alberta
field will be a very valuable supplement to
the natural gas of Montana, and useful to the
Anaconda project.
Perhaps I am going into detail at greater
length than I need to; but I might add that
the taking of the gas from this Pakowki
field will not particularly affect the Alberta
supply, because it comprises only a small
fraction of the Alberta reserves and is not
being used for local consumption within the
80713-9

province. Neither the company which supplies
gas for the city of Edmonton and its vicinity,
nor the company which supplies Calgary and
it environs draws upon these small fields. Up
to the present time, therefore, there has been
no market in Alberta for the gas from these
fields, and it does not appear that Alberta's
gas requirements are dependent upon this
area.
The purpose of the present bill is merely
to incorporate a company for the purpose of
making an application to the Petroleum and
Gas Conservation Board of Alberta. I understand, the applications now before the Board
are more or less in a state of suspense, and
will remain so until September next, when
they will be reviewed.
Honourable senators will note that this bill
is in the same form and contains the same
provisions as other pipe-line bills which from
time to time have come before the house for
consideration.
I omitted to state earlier that the owners of
these wells have already made application
in Alberta for an export permit, and consequently when I say the application before the
Board is pending, I mean the application of
those who own the wells.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Before the honourable
senator sits down, may I ask him a question?
What is the relationship between the McCollFrontenac Oil Company Limited and the
Texaco Company? I have observed that in
the province of Manitoba gasoline stations
which were formerly operated by McCollFrontenac are now called Texaco stations.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: I regret, honourable senators, that I am not in a position to give an
authoritative answer as to the relationship
between McColl-Frontenac Oil Company
Limited and Texaco. I myself have noticed
the changeover in certain areas.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Does my friend intend to
refer this bill to the Standing Committee on
Natural Resources?
Hon. Mr. Fogo: I thought it should be considered by the Standing Committee on
Transport and Communications, as has been
done in the case of similar bills.
Some Hon. Senators: Question!
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Fogo moved that the bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Transport
and Communications.
The motion was agreed to.

THE SENATE AND ITS WORK
MOTION-DEBATE

CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, February 15, the adjourned debate of the motion
of Hon. Mr. Robertson for the appointment of
a special committee to inquire into and report
upon how in its opinion the Senate may make
its maximum contribution to the welfare of
the Canadian people.
Hon. J. W. de B. Farris: Honourable senators, in considering this resolution I think we
should first discuss whether it is opportune
at this time, for while that particular phase
of the question has not yet been definitely
criticized here in the Senate, I have heard
more than one honourable senator discuss it
outside the chamber. It has been suggested
to me that in view of the pending-or perhaps
it is more proper to say, the continuing
-Dominion-Provincial
Conferences, which
among other things involve a consideration of
further amendments to the constitution, the
question now before us may be regarded as
more or less sub judice and should not be
considered here at this time.
With that view, honourable senators, I am
in complete disagreement. Such questions
may be discussed by the members of the
federal cabinet and the representatives from
the various provinces; but after all they will
require, more than anything else, information
about the whole matter; and on a subject of
this kind, or on any amendments of a
constitutional nature, I know of no better
source of authoritative information based on
experience, than senators, who for varying
lengths of time have served in this bouse.
Further, I point out to my honourable friends
who made the suggestion that there can be
no amendments to the Canadian constitution
affecting the Senate of Canada unless they are
concurred in by this body, that it would be
more or less a foolish errand on the part of

FEBRUARY 19, 1951
Dominion-Provincial Conferences to solemnly
discuss the question and decide on a policy
before having an assurance that the policy
would be concurred in by the Senate. The
time to find out whether or not amendments
would be concurred in is now, not after the
event.
I regret that my honourable friend from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) is not
at present in his seat. There was not a member
in this house who was not impressed with
the great speech he made last Thursday.
Although there may not have been complete
unanimity as to his views-and amongst
lawyers one cannot expect itSome Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris:-I think it can be said that
there was unanimity of approval. My honourable friend the leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig), for whom I also have high regard,
recently spoke most ably on this subject.
Either one or both of these gentlemen said
that after all we were here to carry out our
duties, and that the question of constitutional
amendment was no concern of ours. Perhaps
it was the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity who made that statement.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I did not go that far.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I entirely disagree with
that statement. In the interests of the public,
the question of constitutional amendments is
our concern, for sooner or later, as I have
already pointed out, we will have to make a
decision on whether or not we concur in
amendments proposed to the Canadian constitution and affecting the Senate of Canada.
I repeat: Without the concurrence of this
house there can be no amendments.
I would point out to my honourable friends
who support the view of the honourable
gentleman from Toronto-Trinity that within
the ambit of the proposed amendments there
are many possible changes that do not involve
constitutional questions at all, but are of a
purely domestic nature. I would point out
that by this resolution it is proposed to inquire
into and report upon whatever action, in the
opinion of the Senate, may be necessary or
expedient to enable the Senate to make its
maximum contribution to the welfare of the
Canadian people. Nobody has the right to
presuppose that that inquiry will involve
constitutional amendments, any more than
were some member of the House of Commons
to move a similar resolution there. This
motion may, and probably will, involve more
consideration of purely domestic problems
than of constitutional ones.
For these reasons, honourable senators, I
would respectfully refute the suggestion that
this matter is in the remotest way sub judice.

Another suggestion, the force of which is
overcome by conditions which disprove it, is
that the very fact of the introduction of this
resolution indicates some consciousness of
weakness.
An Hon. Senator: Oh!
Hon. Mr. Farris: My friend need not "look
at me in that tone of voice", because I am
not saying that it does. I am going to assert
the contrary. I am merely mentioning a
suggestion which is made, and will be
repeated, outside this chamber. It is very
likely that some newspapers will say, "Ah, the
senators are waking up to the fact that they
are not quite as efficient as they ought to be."
Well, why not?
Do honourable senators
know of any institution of a political nature
that has ever been perfect? Is there any
reason in the world why honourable senators
-not with a consciousness of weakness, but
in the full strength of the appreciation of
their duties-should not from time to time
ask themselves, "Is there any way that we
can do a better job than we are doing?" To
my mind, such a reflection is no admission of
consciousness of guilt; it is simply a declaration that we are not smug and self-satisfied,
that we recognize that progress goes on as
the years go by, and that it is well to examine
conditions from time to time and consider
what may happen.
I say again, compare our situation with that
of the House of Commons. Does anybody
suggest that the House of Commons as at
present organized, and as it carries on from
day to day, is so near perfection that any
honourable member would not be within his
full rights if he introduced a resolution for
the consideration of possible improvements.
I have in mind what we see at times when
sitting in the gallery over there-an almost
empty house, with members droning on,
speaking not for the benefit of those who are
present but for "the boys back home". I am
not attacking the House of Commons. I am
inclined to think these practices can be
justified. But I also believe that many people
would see the possibility of desirable changes.
So, if some member of the House of Commons
saw fit to offer a resolution of this kind would
it be broadcast over Canada, "That proves
what a useless bunch they are in the House
of Commons". It would prove the exact
contrary. So in so far as the resolution before
us is directed to the end I have mentioned, it
demonstrates the courage and earnestness of
purpose of our honourable leader; and everybody who knows him is fully satisfied that he
possesses those qualities, together with a keen
sense of responsibility. In the absence of my
honourable friend, I say-and I would have

SENATE

said it had he been here-that I congratulate
him on his courage in bringing forward this
resolution, knowing, as he must know full
well, the imputations and insinuations which
would follow. Often the proof of the pudding
is in the eating. So far the debate on this
resolution has completely justified the leader
in having introduced it and given senators
an opportunity to discuss it. I sincerely hope
that nothing I say will diminish the effect
which that discussion must produce. I shall
do my best not to detract from it.
Some question has come up-it does not
bother me much because I have not given it
much concern-as to whether a leader in this
house can so divorce himself from his association with the Cabinet as to speak in an
individual capacity. Well, what about it?
He has said that that is the capacity in which
he is speaking, and I suppose he and my
honourable friend who sits next to him had
their heads together when the leader of the
government sent that memorandum which
was read by the whip tonight.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: No.
Hon. Mr. Farris: In any event, it is clear
that there has been no governmental conspiracy to inflict this upon us; and I do not
think we need worry very much about the
technical obligations of a leader of this house
who is also a member of the government.
The only matter in this debate with which
it is essential that we concern ourselves is
the subject of the debate itself.
Having said that, honourable senators, my
next statement is that I do not intend to vote
for this resolution. I think that it has
created the opportunity for a useful discussion,
but once that purpose is achieved, once honourable senators have discussed the resolution, I see no reason in the world why the
matter should be remitted to a committee.
Would the committee call for testimony from
the outside? If that were done I would not
want to be on the committee. Every crank
in Canada, every demagogue who wants to
attack our institutions, would glory in the
opportunity to come before this committee
and tell these "old boys", these "old plutocrats and senators", just what he thinks of
them. I do not see why we should subject
ourselves to that kind of treatment. For the
life of me I cannot think of any good it
would do. There is not a member of this
bouse who does not know a great deal more
about the subjects with which we are concerned than all these cranks, high-brow professors, and others who might want to come
before us, ever knew or ever will know. All
we need to do about this resolution is to have
an intelligent discussion of it on the basis of
facts which we know better than anybody

else, and to dispose of it as we see fit. For
my part, I shall vote against it.
My honourable friend the government
leader bas said something about leadership
in a dual capacity. While there is no man
in this house for whom I have a higher regard,
I think in this respect he is on the wrong
track. I doubt if he gave really serious
consideration to what he said on that connection, although I am sure he had thoroughly
pondered the main issue. The history of the
House of Lords over many long years has
vindicated the principle that the leader should
be selected other than by the house itself.
I · m not sure that the Lord Chancellor is the
a
leader of the house, but he is the presiding
officer, he is a member of the Cabinet, and he
is selected by His Majesty the King. I do not
believe anybody has ever suggested that
such a system of appointment has given rise
to any conflict in the British Upper House.
Hon. Mr. King: The government advise His
Majesty the King in regard to the selection.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: The King in Council.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Is the Lord Chancellor's
main function not to preside over the Law

Lords?
Hon. Mr. Farris: Yes, his main function is
to preside over the Law Lords. His position,
though not quite the same as that of the
leader here, is in some respects comparable.
Or take the Prime Minister of Canada. He
sits in the House of Commons and is the
leader of that house, but he is not elected
by it. It is true that he can command a
majority of the house, and it so happens
that the honourable leader here has a majority
in this chamber. But the Prime Minister is
selected not by the House of Commons but
by His Maj esty the King through the GovernorGeneral; and usually, when a new Prime
Minister is selected, it is on the recommendation of his predecessor. The present Prime
Minister was designated leader of the Liberal
party, not by a vote of the members of the
House of Commons but by a vote of a federal

convention of supporters of the Liberal party.
I cannot see that my honourable friend is any
more embarrassed in his position here than
is the Prime Minister sitting in the position of
leadership in the House of Commons.
I wish to conclude this part of the discussion by observing that if those of us on
this side of the bouse feel dissatisfied with the
leadership given by the leader of the government, it might be appropriate for us to put
our heads together and say that we are going
to repudiate our present leader and have
somebody else express our views. There is
not the remotest suggestion of that, however,
and I venture to say that there is not a single

FEBRUARY

member of the Liberal caucus who has
the faintest idea of anything of the sort.
My honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig)
has made this verdict unanimous by suggesting that the honourable leader (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) has the approval of his side of
the bouse too. Let me give a little bit of
friendly advice to my honourable friend from
Shelburne (Hon. Mr. Robertson): the sooner
he forgets about that sort of foolishness and
gets on with his duties, knowing that he has
the unanimous and hearty approval of everybody here, the better it will be for the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Having concluded these
preliminary observations, let me come to the
meat of this resolution. If we are to intelligently consider it in its widest aspects, the
first thing we should do, in a rather scientific
approach to the question, is to determine what
are the reasons or purposes for the existence
of a second chamber. You cannot have an
intelligent discussion about this question
unless you have analysed and formed your
own conclusions. Honourable senators, as
you know, the bicameral system was not discovered by the Fathers of Confederation.
There is nothing new about this principle. It
has existed in many countries for many years,
and as far as I know it has always existed in
really democratic countries.
The first point I wish to make in this
analytical discussion-and it is not intended
to be a speech in any persuasive or oratorical
sense-is that the second chamber is an
essential of democracy. You hear a lot of
irresponsible people saying, "Oh, the Senate is
contrary to democracy". Honourable senators, I have the idea that the word democracy
is about the most misused word in the English
language. It issues from the mouth of every
demagogue and agitator in the country. Even
the communists have the audacity to talk
about democracy-as though they have the
remotest conception of what it means, or the
slightest desire to carry out its meaning, if
they do know.
In the first place, let me state what democracy is not. It is not unrestrained majority
rule, and that is where the basic fallacy comes
in. Majority rule unrestrained and given
free liberty may degenerate into mob rule.
Shakespeare said "O, it is excellent to have
a giant's strength; but it is tyrannous to use
it like a giant". Keeping that in mind, what
I hve read and thought
is democracy?
about this a good deal, and I think the best
definition of democracy is that given by
Lincoln: it is government of the people by
the people and for the people.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

19, 1951

Hon. Mr. Farris: That is not meant in the
spirit of government by the majority, of the
majority and for the majority. Theoretically
it means government by all the people for
all the people. Let us keep that fact clearly
in mind. But when we come to the practical
application of this theory we find, that it
does not work out. A compromise has to be
made somewhere. In order to have government you have got to have common ideals,
unity of purpose and co-operation in the
execution of the business affairs of the
government. That is why union or coalition
governments will only work in times of
crisis. In normal times they just will not
work, because there is no common ideal or
unity of purpose, and no co-operation, a
result is that the system just becomes
impractical and impossible. Therefore, because the British people are practical, they
do not let theory interfere with effective
government, and majority rule is a compromise between theory and necessity. The
giant is a good workman until he begins to
act like a giant; then the danger creeps in.
Honourable senators, in discussing the general
principles in connection with a bicameral
system, I want to point out that the Senate
as a second chamber under British institutions is the complement to majority rule, in
order to give effective democracy. It does
not impede the executive efficiency of the
majority, because we proceed under constitutional rules and the conventions of the
constitution; but it does provide a check or
balance against the unrestrained power of
the majority. I want to ask the minorities
of this country, and those Canadians who
sneer at the Senate, whether they would feel
safe if the Senate were abolished and legislation became subject from time to time only
to the dictates and caprices of the majority
rule in the House of Commons? They might
feel safe with the present membership of the
other place; but with the changing sentiments
in this world who knows when the time
would come that people would wish they had
the Senate back?

SENATE
are directed against the Senate. Some of
the criticisms I shall put in my own words,
rather by inference from what has been said.
Before proceeding to this phase of the
subject may I make the general preliminary
observation, that there is no institution that
has even been so persistently attacked as
the Senate of Canada-I was about to say
so maliciously attacked, and perhaps in some
cases that might be true.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Gentlemen, there must
be something mighty virile and basically
sound in an institution which for all these
years has withstood the attacks made upon it
by political parties, by professors in colleges
and by individuals, and yet has survived and
retained the confidence of the Canadian
people.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Now let us go through
the criticisms, one, two, three. The Senate
has been criticized on the basis of the purpose
for which it exists. Indeed, some of the
professorial attacks even outlined the purposes of this chamber and offered criticisms
in which they entirely overlooked and
smothered those purposes which they enumerated. One criticism made is based upon
whether or not the Senate has failed in its
special purpose as indicated at confederation.
Has it usurped its position as a minor legislative partner? Honourable senators, since
this resolution has come before the bouse I
have spent considerable time browsing
through the various books on the subject, and
I have been unable to find one allegation that
the Senate of Canada has wrongly usurped
its power in defiance of the majority in
Canada. I know of no single instance.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris. The conventions of the
constitution have been carefully observed by
the great men who have led the Senate from
confederation and to the present time.
Next, has the Senate failed to protect the
rights of property from unjust legislation, or
has it betrayed the rights of citizens as to
property or person? Those are all included
in one of the general purposes for which this
chamber was set up. I say to my honourable friend from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert)
that I do not need to come forward here and
point to what this house has done at any
certain time. In this regard an illustration
comes to my mind of a new manager of a
company who proposed to make a good many
changes in its set-up. He interviewed the
night watchmian and inquired how long he
had been with the firm. The watchman
replied that he had been with it for ten

years.
The manager asked, "How many
burglaries have you had in that time?" The
watchman replied, "I have not had a single
one". "Well, then", said the manager, "you
are fired; you are no good."
The story
comes to my mind of an undersized Irishman
who applied to be a policeman. The chief
looked him over and said "I would not have
You are not big

enough." The applicant said, "I can lick any
man on your force". "That may be so", said
the .chief, "but you have to prove it. I want
on this force men so big that they won't have
to prove it". You get the idea of the
illustration.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: The essential fact to be
realized is, not that occasions have arisen
time after time on which the Senate, exercising its function as a guardian of the public interest, has repudiated something which
has been done, but that, from confederation
to the present time, under this joint system
of a House of Commons and a Senate, federalism has worked, and the provinces and the
dominion have progressed on the basis, in the
main, of friendly feeling and co-operation, so

that the policeman has not had to come out
and prove that he was big enough to look
after his job.
In this connection I am not limited solely to
generalities. I want to read from a book
written by Professor Mackay, who was born
and educated in Canada. When he wrote this
study he was a professor in an American
institution, but it is evident that his heart
is in Canada. The book is a good one, well
worth reading. There is much criticism of
the Senate, but my submission is that,
although one may not agree with it, the
criticism is intelligent, fair, and based
thoroughly on factual information. Before
I am through I shall leave you to judge
whether another book, of more recent date,
can stand the same test. Professor Mackay
says, at pages 155 and 156:
Since the whole duty of protecting individual
and minority rights from invasion by legislation
devolves upon parliament, it is of supreme importance that parliament should perform this duty
disinterestedly and thoroughly. Unfortunately the
House of Commons affords no adequate protection.
The business of parliament, particularly of the
House of Commons, grows yearly. The rights and
interests of individuals are continually being overshadowed by the major issues of policy and party
tactics. Private and minority rights are in danger
of invasion through negligence and oversight perhaps more than through deliberate intention.
are
and the public welfare
Private rights
endangered moreover by aggressive organized
groups who represent only minorities.

May I pause here to point out, as I should
have done earlier, that the problems and
necessities which existed at the time of confederation were small by comparison with

FEB1FUARY 19, 1951
those of today. Consider the present population of this country, distributed over a vast
area from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and contrast it with the handful of people who
occupied Upper and Lower Canada and the
two Maritime Provinces in 1867. Reflect
upon the hosts of people of different races,
religions and viewpoints who are in Canada
at this time, contrasted with the two groups
which were parties to the complicated provisions for confederation.
I continue the quotation:
Canada is undergoing changes in her social
organization, as are all industrialized states.

If this was true twenty-five years ago,
when it was written, how much more is it
true today? Referring to the Senate, the
writer states:
In the past it has canvassed dispassionately much
legislation passed in silence by the House of Commons for political reasons. More independent of
group pressure than the House of Commons, it
can deal more satisfactorily with legislation in
the interests of selfish groups or minorities.

Hon. Mr. Farris: His praise of the Senate
is not unqualified. It is a peculiar circumstance that Professor Dawson who wrote
twenty-five years later, while he quotes
copiously from Mackay's book, selects, so far
as I can find, every one of his quotations
from statements which are critical of the
Senate, and makes no reference to passages
which are frankly favourable to it. Professor
Mackay states:
Even aside from the possibility of reform, there
is every indication that in the future the Senate
will be of equal if not of greater use as a protector
of rights.

Those, gentlemen, are the conclusions on
this question of a really competent student.
My next point will be put in the form of
a question, in reply to a criticism: Has the
Senate failed in its duties-to use the words
of Sir John A. Macdonald-as a reviser and
corrector of legislation? First, as tested by
results. Search the records to discover one
complaint that it bas failed. Then let the
Senate claim the credit that is its due. I go
to the most partial critic I can find. Professor
Dawson, at page 346, admits this-and his
pen must have hurt his hand as he wrote it:

By way of example, let us contrast the
discussions which took place last session in
this chamber with those on the same issue

SENATE
You may have a note that you hope the bank
will take. As soon as you step inside the
bank you see the staff in the outer office,
apparently working their heads off. Then
you go into the private office of the manager,
and you find. him sitting on a comfortable
chair, smoking a cigar. He does not appear
to be busy at all. I once heard a banker
described as a man who sits in his office with
his feet on the table, smoking a cigar, and
saying "No" once in a while. The point is
that the primary test of the efficiency of the
manager is whether he is doing a good job
and not how many hours he works as compared with the employees in the outer office.
A real complaint which has been made is
that we are unable to investigate all legislation as fully as we should because some of it
comes to us in the closing days of the session.
My honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) said in his speech the
other night that this is our own fault. I say
yes and no to that statement. In one sense
I suppose it is our own fault. If we wanted
to, we could "gang up" and serve notice on
the members of the House of Commons that
we will hold them up if they again present
legislation to us at the last minute and expect
us to deal with it in time for prorogation. I
doubt whether this would be wise and I know
that the great leaders in this house have
doubted the wisdom of so doing, and they
have never done it. But let us get down to
realities. The criticism of this practice does
not fall on the Senate but on the House of
Commons, and more particularly on the
Cabinet.
As many of you know, I was pretty active,
with my honourable leader, in getting our
rules amended so as to allow Cabinet
Ministers to introduce bills in the Senate. In
my opinion that amendment could have been
of the greatest value to the Senate, and I
exceedingly regret that it has not been put to
greater use. Notwithstanding my advancing
years-to which I shall refer later-I am still
a very busy practising lawyer, and my clients
have not yet discovered that I am too old to
do their work. I hope to conceal that from
them for some years.
.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: We have been here now
some three weeks, and I am sure honourable
senators will agree that if legislation had been
sent to us we would have put our teeth into
it and applied ourselves, just as diligently
as any professor, to accomplish our uob. If
we have not received this legislation, then
it is not reform of the Senate that is needed,
but reform of another place. I quite appreciate that members of the Cabinet are

crowded with work, but they are no busier
a month after the session starts than they are
a month before it ends.
My honourable friend from TorontoTrinity has said that the Senate would not
be a restraining body if it were to deal with
legislation first. I do not agree with that
observation. Without casting any reflection
on the members of the other house, I would
point out that when daling with a lengthy
bill they sometimes spend weeks discussing
one paragraph, because of its political aspect.
That is both proper and necessary, but very
often the lengthy discussion that takes place
on that one paragraph means that the rest
of the measure is put through with a whoop,
in half an hour. Then the legislation is sent
over here, and because the Governor General
is waiting at the door, it is hurriedly put
through by the Senate. I do not think the
Senate should be put in a position where it
has to hold up the House of Commons for a
week or two while it deals with various
pieces of legislation. I think we should take
advantage of the amendments which have
been made to our rules.
There is another basic condition which is
bound to exist, and which you cannot cure.
I refer to the matter of dealing with legislation in this chamber. The Senate could do a
complete job of checking, investigating and
studying legislation in two to three months,
if it were given that legislation to deal with.
We could sit here day and night, as is the
practice in the House of Commons, and
pitch right into our work-but we are not
able to do this for several reasons. First of
all, we have to go along contemporaneously
with the other house. We cannot postpone
dealing with certain legislation bcause many
bills have to be passed in the early stage of
a session. The result is that we have to put
in six months to do what we could do in
two or three months. Then they make fun
of us, saying that we do not do our job; and
the papers report "The Senate did not sit
today". This whole condition is aggravated
by the great distances that many senators
have to travel to get to Ottawa. They must
choose between sitting around here twiddling
their thumbs while lengthy discussions of
a political nature take place in the other
house, or they must go back home to return
here at a later date. If anybody were to
take the trip from Vancouver to Ottawa, as
I did -a few weeks ago, when the snowslides
were taking place, he would not be anxious
to do it very often. It is argued that there
are investigations that the Senate could
make. Well, any time an honourable senator
finds a subject, the merits and necessity of

FEBRUARY 19, 1951
which should be investigated, that is all
right; but I have not the least interest in
commencing investigations here just to keep
us busy and to show the public that we are
doing something. That does not appeal to me
at all. I want to do the work I am assigned
to do, and then go home and attend to other
affairs. The House of Lords has a great
advantage over us in this respect. Its
membership is concentrated, and when the
house adjourns the members just have a
short trip home, whereas we have great
distances to travel.
I should like to point out that the activities
of a senator should not be confined to the
time he is in Ottawa. I think you will agree
with me that there are many useful duties
a senator can perform when he is at home
or among his constituents. I have the honour,
from time to time, of speaking to Canadian
Clubs, service clubs, and other organizations,
and I find that, with the prestige a senator
has, there is a lot one can do in that field.
I never refuse an invitation to speak on
public affairs before any organization, if it
is possible for me to fulfil the obligationfor 1 feel that is an obligation, and part of
my duties. And I do not consider that my
duties outside the Senate are confined to
public speaking. There are all kinds of
organizations in which senators can do
effective work. My honourable friend from
Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr. Paterson) is a very
prominent member of an organization that
performs important public duties, and, he
serves there more efficiently and with more
authority and prestige beause of the fact
that he is a senator. Do not overlook this
branch of activities in which senators can
and do very valuable work.
Another of the strong attacks that has been
made on the Senate is to the effect that we
are not independent. I am afraid that I am
speaking too long.
Some Hon. Senators: No, no.
Hon. Mr. Farris: It is said that we are not
independent and are too partisan. Well,
honourable senators, right here there ought
to be a definition of terms. There is a great
difference between independence and partisanship. There is a great difference between
applying partisanship to a man as a term of
opprobrium and saying that he is a party
supporter. Any of us here can say, "I am a
party supporter." I am a Liberal, I say, but
I think it is now about 30 years since I was
an elected member of a legislature, and I
should hate to think that I am a partisan in
the sense that one of these professors uses
that accusing term. The charge of lack of
80713-101

independence is entirely unfounded, for
there is all the difference in the world
between possession of party convictions and
The Fathers of
lack of independence.
Confederation never intended the Senate to
be a spineless assembly, without convictions.
I defy any man to sit in this Senate and have
convictions with regard to public affairs unless he has some party affiliations. Did you
ever see one of these fellows that claim to
be superior to party, in a country where the
party system is the basis of our whole government? I have seen them, and nearly every
one of them has been a hound for publicity.
There is no easier way by which a man can
get publicity than by becoming a member
of a party and later attacking it. Is that the
kind of men you want in the Senate? Do you
want spineless individuals who will not stand
up for anything, who will wobble over night
and be on the other side next day? The
party system is the basis of democracy, and
no party is useful without strong men in it.
And you cannot have any strong men in the
public life of a country unless you have men
of political convictions who are prepared to
express them and to fight for them.
Does anyone seriously suggest that a man
of strong political convictions is not independent? Why, strong political convictions
and independence go hand in hand. Gladstone
was a party man, the strongest kind of party
man, but would anyone say that he was not
independent? Churchill is today an outstanding party man, leader of the Conservative
party in Britain. Does anyone say that he
is not independent? He has belonged to
more than one party, and he has changed not
because of partisanship, but from conviction.
And besides Sir John A. Macdonald, some
others of our own public men who might be
mentioned are Alexander Mackenize, Laurier,
Borden, Bennett, Meighen, King, St. Laurent
and George Drew-all partisans, in the proper
sense of the word, but all independent. Those
men would not stultif y themselves to sacrifice
their country for any influence that they did
not consider was just and legitimate. Would
their partisan convictions disqualify or have
disqualified any one of these men from serving as a senator? Meighen was a senatorone of the great members of this house. I do
not know of any senator who had stronger
convictions and was freer to express them.
It is true that, having strong convictions as
a Conservative, he did not always or generally see that the other side was right.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Farris: But does anyone say that
he was not independent? A man like Meighen

SENATE
would stand up and proclaim his convictions
regardless of consequences, and that is the
highest type of independence.
I am going to read a little from Professor
Robert MacGregor Dawson's book to show
what confusion of thought results from failure
to distinguish between strong convictions and
independence. I do not want to be misunderstood in my comments on Professor
Dawson. I do not know the gentleman, and
indeed never knew anything about him until
I read his book in preparation for this speech.
I am not a bit disturbed by what he says
about the Senate, although I think it does
barm, for he is a professor at the largest
university in Canada and I have no doubt
that anything he says will be accepted as
gospel by a good many students. I was really
more concerned the other day when in a
couple of newspapers I saw his picture and
read that he had been selected to write the
memoirs of Mackenzie King.
Mackenzie
King lived in one of the great ages of Canada,
and memoirs derived frorm his documents
ought to be one of the great basic historical
documents of our generation. I hope-and I
do so devoutly, without prejudice-that
Professor Dawson can show more capacity
for fair conclusions, based on facts rather
than on the smart-aleck statements of some
newspaper columnists, than is indicated in
this allegedly scientific article in his book,
The Government of Canada.
May I read to you what Professor Dawson
bas written on this question? After pointing
out that many distinguished senators were
appointed to this body from the House of
Commons, he says:
Their whole lives rise up to make it difficult to
adopt an attitude of political neutrality-

On the title-page of his book Professor
Dawson is described as a professor of political
economy, and I imagine he would be greatly
insulted if it were suggested that he was a
neutral political professor.
His idea of
neutrality so far as the Senate is concerned
may be something like the notion that an
American expressed about national neutrality
before the United States participated in World
War I, when lie said he was perfectly neutral,
for he did net care who licked the Germans
-whether
it was the British or the French.
I conceive that a man of political neutrality
has no convictions. When a man bas convictions be ceases to be neutral. But let us
see what Professor Dawson goes on to say
about political neutrality as a qualification
for senators. Referring to those who came
here from the House of Commons, he says:
-the fact that they are still associating with their
old colleagues only a few feet away from the
thickest of the fight makes party detachment and
independence little more than a fanciful aspiration
which bas lost contact with the facts of life.

I see my honourable friend from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) a little to the right in
front of me. His deskmate, who is absent this
evening, is the senator from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler). Both are former members of the
federal cabinet and are now distinguished
members of this bouse. I wonder what they
would think of the statement that the
closeness of their old associates is contaminating, and preventive of independent thought
in this chamber. I should like to know what
kind of isolation there would have to be in
the Senate in order to remove them from any
possible contamination of that kind.
Professor Dawson continues:
...
the system tends to crack the very foundation
of the Senate's efficiency. There is no doubt that
many of these appointments are well made and
that many of those appointed are a credit to the
Senate; there is no doubt that the system is useful
as an instrument of party discipline and service; ...

I would point out that no other prime
minister appointed more members to this
bouse than did the late Mackenzie King, and
yet this is the author who is proposed to
write his memoirs. He continues:
. . . but there is equally no doubt that the chief
purpose underlying these appointments-

He might as well have said "by Mackenzie
King".
-is not the public good, but party patronage and
advantage, and that this is reflected in the general
low regard in which the Senate is popularly held.

In order to convince his students, the
author attempts to back up this scientific
approach with a quotation by a columnist
containing a lot of smart-aleck observations
which would be most appropriate for the
Sunday supplement of a newspaper, but
inappropriate for a legitimate scientific discussion in a book on political economy
written for the benefit of college students.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Honourable senators, did
you ever stop to consider who in the conmunity would come under the classification
of political neutrals?
In my opinion, the
first group would be government contractors.
Without any reflection on them, I think we
can assume that they are political neutrals.
The next group would be businessmen who
are so selfishly engrossed in their own affairs
as to be unmindful of public duty-and there
are a great number of them. True, they have
acquired considerable wealth and prestige,
but they are ignorant of public affairs. Would
you want to bring that kind of man into the
Senate? As a third group, I would point to
a certain type of high-brow professors who,
I have no doubt, are political neutrals, and
suffering from delusions of their own wisdom.
Some Hon. Senalors: Oh, oh.

FEBRUARY 19, 1951
Hon. Mr. Farris: Then there is the general
group of ignoramuses who know and care
nothing about the affairs of the nation.
Now honourable senators, from those
groups of strictly political neutrals how are
you going to select the proper persons who
are for appointment to the Senate? I say we
want no such men in this branch of the public
life of Canada. True, we want men who are
independent and free from party expediency
and the fear of political consequences which
may flow from a stand they take against
the majority in their own constituencies.
We want the kind of partisanship which is
based on a strong and courageous outlook,
backed up by principles and experience.
Whether rightly or wrongly, I say, honourable senators, that I would pit this body,
regardless of the parties to which the members previously belonged, and, so long as
they have retained their faculties and
abilities, regardless of their age, against any
other body of a similar nature.
Honourable senators, I speak feelingly on
this subject, for I was a very young man when
I was elected to the provincial legislature.
Within a year after my entry into that house
and while I was still in my thirties, I became
Attorney General of the province. I remained
in that office for five years, and though the
government by which I was appointed was
still in power, I resigned of my own free will
because I wanted to get back into private
practice. When I was called upon to give an
opinion or to discuss a question on its merits
in my own office in Vancouver, I was struck
most forcibly by the independence and freedom which I enjoyed. Some men in parliament may rise above all the influences to
which they are subject; indeed, there may
be the occasional man who is big enough and
strong enough to say: "In no case will I be
influencedi by the possibility of what may
happen at the next election". But, honourable senators, a great many men in public
life would never be elected to office for a
second term if they took that stand. Make
no mistake about it and let us have no false
impressions-and I say this without reflecting
in any way on men in public life-these men
must adjust themselves to the greatest
ultimate good. They must consider the wide
and general policies of their party. In that
regard, the honourable leader of this bouse
well knows that the question of cabinet unity
arises, and that in these times the ultimate
general good must be considered. The Senate
of Canada is freed from all such obligations.
From my long experience in this house I
repudiate the suggestion that the rank and
file of senators are contaminated by their
close association with the chamber next door,
and that they are dominated by the Prime

Minister, or are influenced by the possibilities
of an election. It is just not so, and any
person who chooses to put such an attack in
writing is going contrary to the facts.
What are the remedies which offer a cure
for the ills of this unfortunate body? One
suggested remedy is that the Senate should
be an elected body. My answer is that of
all the proposals that have ever been made
for the reform of the Senate, that is the most
unsound and farthest from the constitutional
principles involved.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: In the first place, it would
defeat the purpose of a second chamber. Of
course we have a partisan House of Commons; but the setting up of a partisan Senate,
which would be equally subject to the voice
of the people from day to day and year to
year, offers no remedy for our ills. On the
one hand we hear criticism of the Senate
because it is too partisan, and on the other
we hear the suggestion that it should be
made an elected body, and thereby become
more partisan. I am not a Latin scholar,
but I am reminded of a school of medicine
which subscribes to the principle of similia
similibus carantur. The honourable deputy
leader (Hon Mr. Hugessen) no doubt can
translate this phrase, or perhaps my deskmate (Hon. Mr. Howard) could help me if he
were here tonight. I am told that it means
"like cures like". If we are going to cure
too much partisanship by more partisanship,
then we should apply that principle.
Seriously, honourable senators, an elected
Senate would be contrary to the principles of
responsible government. It was my privilege
to speak at a joint meeting of the American
Bar and the Canadian Bar held in Washington
last September, and there to undertake to
explain the meaning of responsible government. I was told that I did make clear the
difference between the system of government
in Canada and that in the United States.
Our American friends have representative
government, but they do not have responsible
government. In my remarks I was of course
careful to explain that I did not mean that
their government was not responsible in the
sense of being irresponsible, but that they
did not have responsible government in the
technical sense in which we use the term.
Briefly, this is the difference: When in the
United States a President is elected for four
years, his cabinet stays with him as long as
he holds office, quite regardless of the vote
of the people as reflected in the elected
chamber. Theirs is a representative government-it is elected by the people-but it is
not a responsible government. The basis of

SENATE
responsible government under the British
parliamentary system is that a government
stays in office only so long as it has the
support of the elected chamber.
If the Senate were to become an elected
chamber, what would happen to responsible
government? Which chamber could defeat
the government and throw it out of office?
Would it be necessary to have a majority in
both houses against the government in order
to defeat it? The theory must be that the
viewpoints of the houses are going to differ;
otherwise what is the use of having two
elected houses, except to elect more members
of parliament? If we stop to think of it,
honourable senators, such a proposal would
be inconsistent with the principles of responsible government.
In the second place there should be full
acknowledgment of the strength and stature
of the House of Commons. My honourable
friend the leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig)
was very clear about that the other day;
and the honourable member from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) said that he
wished that the House of Commons would
appreciate it. But that is a fact. If the
members of the Senate, a smaller group, are
elected from larger areas, and the views of
this house are different from those of the
House of Commons, the Senate will come to
transcend the other bouse; more than that,
it will start a row between the two houses.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: If I come to this house
conscious of the constitutional limitations
which concern me, and fully appreciating the
conventions that are involved, I am going to
be careful-as it is intended I shall be-as
to how far I oppose the will of the people as
expressed in the House of Commons. But
supposing I were elected from a constituency
as large, perhaps, as the city of Vancouver,
which now has four or five members of the
House of Commons, I would be disposed to
say, "I speak for British Columbia more than
you do; my opinion must prevail"-and
trouble would arise at the very start. It would
be an impossible situation. The proposal for an
elective Senate is not well thought out, and
would do no good to this country. Furthermore, it would mean more elections. As it is,
we have too many elections in this country.
There are federal, provincial and municipal
elections; and every now and then one hears
whispers about extravagance in campaign
funds and nefarious acts are imputed to the
government and various other people. With
an elected Senate, such complaints would be
doubled.

My next suggestion, honourable senators, is
that more parties should be represented in
this house. We need wider representation. So
far I have been getting pretty nearly unanimous support; I am not so sure that it will
be accorded me from now on. In my opinion
it would be better, very much better in the
interests of the country and of the Senate,
if this chamber were to contain representatives of different parties and types of thinking. I do not believe it is either beneficial or
fair to have too one-sided a chamber. We
know what the conditions are today. My
honourable friend the leader of the opposition has, I believe, eleven supporters. I do
not want to seem facetious: I am serious in
saying that so far as I can see there is a
pretty good chance that the Liberals will
be returned for another term at the next
election.
Hon. Mr. Horner: We hope not.
Hon. Mr. Farris: That may not be so:
strange things happen. But Canada now has
one of the greatest Prime Ministers of its
history. It may be that the people who gave
him their unqualified support in the last
election will do so again. If that should be
so, and the conditions governing appointment
remain as they have been, the entire membership of this house may consist of Liberals.
Now I think it possible to have too much
even of a good thing. It is all very well to
say, "If your argument that senators are
non-partisan is correct, these men would do
their job as well as if the bouse were composed of members of different parties." But
more than independence is needed. We
want different viewpoints in the Senate.
Independence applies to freedom of action;
difference of viewpoint applies to the
expression of convictions which are held by
individuals. The two things are very different. A clash of ideas is of the very essence
of vitality of any organization. For my part
I would like to see a greater conflict of ideas
in the Senate, and I would enjoy the opportunity of mixing up in it. I think there should
be representation of other parties. In Alberta
there is a Social Credit party in power; in
Saskatchewan the government is CCF. In
Quebec there is a party calledHon. Mr. Hugessen: -the

Union Nationale.

Hon. Mr. Farris: One of my Senate friends
said, "Do you want to bring one of those
fellows here?" I said, "Yes. I do. I want to
have a look at him. I have been in the Senate
about fifteen years and I never saw nor heard
one of the members of that party. I think my
education would be more complete and my

FEBRUARY 19, 1951
usefulness greater if I saw this man stand
up here and assert himself and declare the
faith that is in him. Then," I said, "I would
like to hear you get up and reply to him.
That would give me an education which I
have not been privileged to have during all
the years I have been in this house."
Public opinion is not to be ignored. I have
spoken somewhat boastfully of the virility
which this organization has shown since confederation in face of the attacks made upon
it. But I predict with great seriousness that
if the Liberal party continues in office, and
the policy in respect of ýappointments that
has prevailed since confederation is maintained, so that the house consists of *a solid
body of Liberals, nobody on earth will ever
convince the public that the best interests of
the people are being served.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: This is a question which
should be faced, if on no higher ground than
that of pure expediency. After my honourable
friend the leader of the opposition had made
what I thought was a wonderful speech, I
read in the Ottawa Citizen an article written
from a somewhat critical viewpoint. The
writer ended by saying:
One thing that can hardly be questioned is that
to do nothing about the Senate is to court disaster
for it. In instituting a special inquiry the government evidently has decided against letting it die on
the vine, sapless, unsavoury and unloved.

I do not agree with those words, nor do I
understand that the government's policy is
as the writer depicts it, but I do say that it
is not enough for Caesar's wife to be virtuous;
Caesar's wife must be above suspicion. It is
not enough for the judges of this country to be
absolutely fair and honest in their dealings on
the bench; equally essential to the administration of justice is a conviction on the part
of the general public that the judges are
fair and impartial. I say that it is desirable,
even for no higher reason, that a condition
which would create the sort of criticism I
have mentioned shall be avoided if it is
practicable to do so. I think in that way we
would create more confidence in the public
and more interest in the Senate. Also I would
expect when I came down here to have a lot
more fun in being a senator! Amongst other
good results, it would head off that utterly
foolish suggestion that we ought to have an
elected Senate.
Now what remedies should be carried out?
I think an obvious remedy would be for the
Prime Minister for the time being to declare
that from now on there shall be an entirely
different policy, and that he will make his
appointments regardless of party affiliations.

I read the other day, as I am sure you have
done, Laurier's answer to a similar suggestion.
The fact is that Canada has had many strong
and able Prime Ministers, and every one of
them has either resisted or failed to give effect
to that policy. I see no indication that, whatever party may be in power in the future,
there will be a substantial change from the
system which has existed hitherto. If what
it is desirable to do cannot be accomplished
in that way, one must look for some other
remedy. I advance this as a suggestion: it is
the best conclusion I have formed over the
years. I did not come to it hastily, but after
having discussed it with people at home, in
the trains, with my colleagues in the Senate
and in the House of Commons, it is now my
view that the best change which could be
made in this respect would be to allow the
provincial governments to appoint one-third
of the members of this house.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I think that plan would
at once cure the evils I have enumerated.
If, for example, the next vacancy should
occur in Alberta, the new senator from that
province would represent a fresh viewpoint.
I have no doubt he would be just as good
as any of us. When Mr. Douglas had his
chance he would send somebody here from the
C.C.F. party, and I am sure that Mr. Douglas
would go out of his way to send a man who
could hold his own against any of us. Such
a policy would give more affect to the theory
of the Fathers of Confederation that the
Senate be the protector of provincial rights.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: Do you not think
it would create political blocs in the Senate,
such as are found in the parliament of
France.
Hon. Mr. Farris: No, I do not think so. I
am glad my honourable friend from Margaree
Forks (Hon. Mr. MacLennan) has brought up
this point. If you had blocs in an elected
body and the government failed to get a
majority, then you would have the evil about
which my friend is thinking.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Would my honourable
friend permit me to ask a question at this
point? Assuming that the suggestion he makes
about representation from the provinces is
a sound one, has he given any thought as
to how that would be put into effect? Who
would decide it?
Hon. Mr. Farris: Who would decide what?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: That measure of reform.
Hon. Mr. Farris: It would have to be by
an amendment to the constitution.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Yes, but who is going
to take the necessary action to do that?
Hon. Mr. Farris: The Parliament of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: What about the provinces?
Hon. Mr. Farris: As I understand the situation, at the last session we amended our
constitution on the theory that the Senate
was part of the government of Canada, and
that we did not require to have the consent
of the provinces when we asked the Imperial
Parliament to make the amendments. Now
then, if we, as a part of the Government of
Canada, decide to amend the constitution,
we have the complete constitutional power
and right to do so, and if any one province
were to say: "We refuse to appoint the
senators for our province"-if my honourable
friend really thinks there would be .any
danger of thatSome Hon. Senalors: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Farris:-I would suggest that in
amending the constitution we should provide
that if any province did not make its appointments within, say, six months, the Dominion
Goverrnent would be authorized to make
them. I would not worry very much, though,
about the provinces not making these
appointments.
Honourable senators, again I am in a controversial field in which I am giving my
arguments as I see them, and while I would
under no circumstances change the time of
service of the senators who are appointed by
the federal house, I would not want to see
the provincial governments appoint senators
for life terms. My argument here is that
when you are dealing with appointments
made by the federal house you are dealing
with national parties which have a continuity
of existence. The chances are ninety-nine
out of one hundred that the senators
appointed by a certain federal party will
represent the continued national existence of
that party whether or not that party remains
in power. This does not apply to provincial
politics. I remember, when I was AttorneyGeneral in British Columbia, coming down to
Ontario at the time of the United Farmers'
party and the Drury government. I recall
having lunch in the parliament buildings,
where the members of that government ail
ate their meals, and where some of them
even slept. That party has since disappeared
from the face of the earth. I would not want
to see any provincial government, which
might be here today and gone tomorrow,
have the power of making life appointments
to this chamber. I should like to have the

appointees come here as a purely supplementary body to give the Senate, for the time
being, a different viewpoint.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: For what tern would
you suggest the provincial appointees should
serve? Would it be for such length of time
as the provincial government in question
remained in power?
Hon. Mr. Farris: I think I would make it
a term of five or six years, and if the provincial governrment remained in power longer
that that period it could re-appoint. However, that is a detail.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Does my honourable
friend seriously argue that the federal parliament would attempt to amend the British
North America Act without consulting the
provinces in this particular matter?
Hon. Mr. Farris: I said that parliament had
the fullest power to do so; but what it would
do I do not know.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Has it the fullest power?
Hon. Mr. Farris: Of course it has. That
was declared by the Prime Minister of
Canada, the Attorney-General, and every
lawyer of high authority, when at the last
session an Act was passed on the basis that
we had full power to amend our constitution
in regard to the Senate. There is no question
about that. The Parliament of Canada has
that power. It may well be that in considering the exigency of such legislation a man
like the present Prime Minister-and I am
sure the same would be true of Mr. Drewwould call in the provincial premiers for
consultation, and I am sure that there would
be unanimity in the endorsation of this
proposal.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: That is the answer to my
honourable friend from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert). I would be opposed to this idea
and drop the whole thing, however, if I
thought that we were going to let a fly-bynight government-perhaps that is not a fair
expression-make appointments to the Senate.
Take the Social Credit government in Alberta.
I believe it is a good government, but it is
only that because every one of its proposed
Social Credit measures has been disallowed by
the federal parliament or by the courts, and
of necessity the Social Credit government
has been forced to operate along other lines.
The prosperity which that government has
enjoyed proves that it is a first-class government; but if it operated on the basis of
Social Credit policy, which has never prevailed in this country, I would predict that
sooner or later it would disappear just as the
Farmers' Government in Ontario disappeared.

FEBRUARY 19, 1951
Hon. Mr. Horner: I am afraid it would take
a long time to disappear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: That may be so; but if it
did not disappear no harm would be done and
it could make its appointments. I suggest
that this would be a supplemental remedy
which would not destroy the principle of life
appointments to the Senate, but would bring
in a certain group from time to time to give
a little more colour to our views. IL would
create wider current representation of the
sentiments of the country without disturbing
the basis of permanency which I think is so
essential to this house.
I come now to my last point, the question
of whether there should be an age limit in
the Senate and whether we should abolish
life appointments. I am entirely in favour of
,the present system and entirely opposed to
any suggestion of establishing an age limit
of sixty-five, seventy-five, or eighty-five. In
all that I have listened to or read I have
never heard any sound, basic argument
against the present system. In his book
Professor Dawson quotes a newspaper clipping about one old gentleman, who died in
1903, and pokes fun at him as if he were
characteristic of the Senate. I cannot see
it that way.
If you can put up with my speaking a
little longerSome Hon. Senators: Yes, go on.
Hon. Mr. Farris: -I will read what Professor Dawson says, at page 357:
But the most needed reform of ail must be concerned with removing the deadening effects of the
life term.

Well, I can understand a columnist making a
crack like that in a smart article for a
newspaper, but this is the statement of a
solemn professor in a textbook.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: So-called.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Well, it is a book that is
used by university students.
At page 340 he said. this:
The great bulk of the over-age senators cannot
perform their duties with the same effectiveness as
younger men.

Well, there is another group of Senators
here in Ottawa, who are very good athletes.
They play-what is it, hockey?-and I have
no doubt that if we were to compete with
them in that we should probably get the
worst of it. But in any contest involving the
service of the state by intellectual capacity,
mental alertness, wide experience, wellbalanced judgment, fair and dispassionate
conclusions, I have an idea that the members
of this Senate would compare favourably
with the members of any other organization
in this country. I do not say that boastfully.

However, during the fifteen years that I have
been a senator I have not been in the oldage and fully incompetent class. I may be
getting a little close to that class now, but I
am still putting up a bluff to my clients, and
I have better ones and more of them now
than I ever had bef ore. I am not saying that
to advertise myself, but merely by way of
illustrating my point, that with our ripened
experience we are better qualified to perform
our duties to the state than we ever were
before.
Let me quote one other remark from Professor Dawson's book, this time at page 336:
The most important group, however, will be a
large number of senators with distinguished records;
but the great bulk of these enter the chamber only
when their active political life is over.

Well, my honourable friends from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) and Kootenay East (Hon.
Mr. King) certainly are among those who
entered this chamber with distinguished
records, but their active political life was by
no means over. The senator from Churchill,
who was long a member of the cabinet, has
given serious study to and expressed frank
criticism of much legislation that has come
here in recent years. The senator from
Kootenay East, also a former cabinet minister, has since his appointment to the Senate
served as leader of this house and, more
recently, as our Speaker.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: And only last year he was
Joint Chairman of the Joint Committee of
both houses on a very important subject, old
age security. No one who knows anything
about the outstanding work done by that
committee will suggest that he did not play
as active and valuable a part in it as any
of the younger men from the other house.
Sone Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: "Knowledge comes, but
wisdom lingers." I submit that these men
are performing as fine a duty to the state as
they ever did when members of the other
house, and that they are still as capable of
rendering as good public service as are any
younger men in that house today.
Sone Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I could go down the list
of our members and point out many other
eminent men who have given and still are
giving very valuable service to the country.
Can anyone suggest to me what public duties
such men as these are incapable of performing? True, perhaps, they could not play
hockey. But the functions of the Senate are
to protect minorities, to scrutinize and give
effective consideration to legislation, and to
make up for shortcomings caused by the

SENATE

hurry and rush in the other house. I say
that, on its record, this house has shown that
it does fulfil those functions with credit.
Reference to elderly men reminds me of
the late Senator Dandurand, who was for
many years leader of this house. He was a
very alert and distinguished man in parliament, to the very end of his life.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I was with him in committee the night before he died. Another
elderly senator was the late Sir Thomas
Chapais. Who made a greater contribution
to our public life, to Canadian education and
thought, than Sir Thomas Chapais made for
so may years, right up to his death?
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Then there was the late
Senator Ballantyne, who sat where my
honourable friend from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Haig) now sits, as leader of the opposition
in this house. A man of wide business
experience, he retained his connection with
a great many industrial ýconcerns, and during
his tenure here applied his very valuable
and practical knowledge to the consideration
of legislation and other public questions.
Was he a time-server of the type that Professor Dawson talks about? A little further
along to the left on the front opposition
benches sat the late Senator C. P. Beaubien,
who died at eighty-one. It was an inspiration to hear him speak in this house.
Now by way of further illustrating my
point that ripe experience is a valuable asset
in the Senate, I will mention a few representatives of my native province of New Brunswick who were members of this house when
I first came here. There was Clifford Robinson and Walter Foster, each a former premier
of the province; and Arthur Copp, who carried on efficiently as Deputy Leader until
his death.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: There was Frank Black,
and George Jones, and the father of my
honourable .colleague from Cariboo (Hon. Mr.

Turgeon). Would anyone claim that they
were time-servers here? Has any professor
the right to make an allegation like that
against those great men who dominated the
thinking of this house? Age did not wither
them, nor the years decay. It may be that
among our membership there was here and
there someone unable any longer to bear his
full share of the Senate's work; but better
one or two like that and a majority of outstanding men of ripe experience, strong convictions and steady courage, than a whole
house of young persons without any special
contribution to make to the carrying on of
the public affairs and the government of this
country. And what I have said about the
men who were in the Senate when I first
came here can be said of former and present
members. I challenge flippant critics to disprove my contention that ripe and wide
experience is the most valuable quality
that a second chamber can bring to bear upon
the study of legislation. That principle does
not apply to judges. Once in a while we
may find in this country a judge who by
reason of over-age may do some harm; but
if there is associated with him a host of
great intellects, men of wide experience and
ability in their patriotic service, no great
harm can result.
My honourable friend the leader of the
government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) is not in
his place tonight, but I would answer him,
a younger man than myself, with these few
lines of poetry:
Grow old along with me!
The best is yet to be,
The last of life, for which the first was made;
Our times are in his hand
Who saith, "A whole I planned,
Youth shows but half; trust God; see all,
nor be afraid!"

EXPORT AND IMPORT PERMITS BILL
FIRST READING

Hon. Mr. Hugessen presented Bill W-2, an
Act to amend the Export and Import Permits
Act.
The bill was read the first time.

That the Standing Committee on Immigration and
Labour be authorized and directed to examine into
Immigration Act (R.S.C. Chapter 93 and Amendments) its operation and administration and the
circumstances
and conditions
relating thereto
including:(a) the desirability of admitting immigrants to
Canada,
(b) the type of immigrant which should be preferred, including origin, training and other characteristics,
(c) the availability of such immigrants for admission,
(d) the facilities, resources and capacity of
Canada to absorb, employ and maintain such immigrants, and
(e) the appropriate terms and conditions of such
admission;
And that the said committee report its findings
to this House;
And that the said committee have power to send
for persons, papers and records.

She said: I regret that this motion, through
an error, and because it was in the form of
one drafted by the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), was
originally put on our order paper in his name.
In a very fine speech, devoted chiefly to
the proceedings of the last General Assembly
of the United Nations, the honourable senator
from Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon) referred
particularly to the International Refugee
Organization and its activities. It was
originally intended that this organization
should terminate its work on June 30, 1950,
but because of the great number of refugees
who then remained under its care, the term
was prolonged until March 31, 1951; and I
believe every honourable senator must have
been gratified to learn that there are sufficient
funds to carry on the IRO until the end of
next September.
Unfortunately there are still a great many
refugees and displaced persons remaining to
be cleared by the IRO. According to the
first constitution of the IRO, refugees who
could be registered for protection under it
were limited to those who came under its
care before the end of December, 1945. While
I was at the General Assembly in 1949 I was
very much distressed to learn that there was
no recognition of the large number who were
fleeing from Soviet-controlled territory, but
although the IRO had not formal authority
to deal with these cases, it nevertheless gave
these people protection.
In September next the High Commissioner
of Refugees, appointed by the General
Assembly, will take over this responsibility;
but apart from regulating the legal status of
refugees and displaced persons he will have
no authority. There will be no funds for

SENATE

material assistance. It is therefore very
important that we give consideration to this
problem and see whether Canada can offer
any solution towards the protection or
re-settlement of displaced persons when the
IRO passes out of existence. For this reason,
and because immigration is now a topic of
absorbing interest in Canada. I would think
it important that our committee should be set
up as soon as possible, and I trust that this
committee may make a valuable contribution
to the work of parliament. This country now
has the responsibility of providing manpower
for stepped-up defence industry and agricultural production, and it is felt that all Canada
will benefit from an increased population.
I hope therefore that honourable senators
will adopt this motion.
The motion was agreed to.

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Stanley S. McKeen moved the second

reading of Bill M-1, an Act to incorporate
Trans Mountain Oil Pipe Line Company.
He said: Honourable senators, the object of
the petition for a charter for the Trans
Mountain Oil Pipe Line Company is the
construction of an oil pipe-line from Edmonton, Alberta, to Vancouver, British Columbia,
through the Yellowhead Pass.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: I may say that this is
an all-Canadian route, and the pipe-line will
end in Canada.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: The pipe-line will be
24 inches in diameter and approximately 715
miles long. Initially it will carry 75,000
barrels a day, but it will have an ultimate
daily capacity of 200,000 barrels. A marine
terminal and storage tank will ba built in the
port of Vancouver, to ship out any of the
oil that is not required in British Columbia.

available for use in large plants at the coast,
and the surplus will be shipped to the northwest by means of water transport out of
Vancouver.
Hon. Mr. Euler: My friend said a moment
ago that this line would in the first year save
$50 million. Did he mean a saving of $50
million in Arñerican exchange, or a saving of
that amount to the consumers?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: It would save $50
million to Canada.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That is exchange.
Hon. Mr. McKeen:
It may be called
exchange. It will both save and create
exchange.
Hon. Mr. Euler: But will it effect a saving
to the consumer?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: I think it will, by
reason of the lower transportation costs.
British Columbia now has use for approximately 44,000 barrels of oil a day, and this
pipe-line equipment will have a capacity of
75,000 barrels. The balance will be shipped
to Oregon and Washington, and perhaps to
parts of Idaho. British Columbia will not
only save the exchange on the cost of 44,000
barrels per day, but will collect in American
funds for the balance of 30 odd thousand
barrels.
This company will offer its debenture for
sale in Canada, and sufficient bonds will be
sold in the United States to pay for the
materials and supplies coming from that
country.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: What is the capitalization of the company?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: To start with the company will be capitalized at about $87 million.
The estimated cost of the pipe-line is about
$82,400,000 in American funds, which is
roughly $87 million in Canadian funds.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: And there will be an
issue of shares?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: There will be an issue
of shares to those participating in the line,
and there will be debentures with warrants
available to the general public in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: That means bonds.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: That means bonds. The
debentures will carry warrants, but will not
oe convertible into common shares. When
the warrants are taken up the money made
available will be used to pay off the debentures.
I do not propose to go into the bill in detail,
honourable senators, but I will be glad to
answer such questions as may be asked. My

intention is, when the bill has received second
reading, to move that it be referred to the
Standing Committee on Transport and
Communications.
Hon. Felix P. Quinn: Honourable senators,
I have listened attentively to everything the
honourable senator from Vancouver bas said
in explanation of this bill; but as an old
friend of mine in Halifax used to say, "to
keep the record straight", I must take exception to the statement that the Atlantic ports
of Canada are closed five months in the year.
My friend from Vancouver may not be
acquainted with the fact that the two great
ports of Halifax and St. John are open to
shipping 365 days in the year.
Some Hon. Senalors:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. McKeen: I am pleased that I
gave the honourable member from BedfordHalifax (Hon. Mr. Quinn) an opportunity to
say a word for Halifax. What I meant to say
was that because of ice in the Great Lakes,
transportation from the eastern end of the
pipe line is closed for five months of the
year.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I should like to ask a question of my honourable friend from Vancouver.
I was m.uch interested in his explanations of
the advantages to be gained by a certain distribution of oil in the event of war. I wonder
if the promotors of this bill are aware of the
possibilities of the use of the port of New
Westminster, which would save a distance of
fourteen miles in the event of war, and in
my opinion is better protected than the port
of Vancouver.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Run a branch line across.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: I would remind my
friend from New Westminster that only last
winter the river at New Westminster was
blocked with ice.
Some Hon. Senators:
Hon. Mr. Reid:

Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. McKeen: I was speaking of the
port of Vancouver. I was born at New
Westminster, so I can scarcely take offence
at my honourable friend's suggestion.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. McKeen moved that the bill be

referred to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications.
The motion was agreed to.

FEBRUARY 20, 1951
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. T. A. Crerar moved the second reading of Bill N-1, an Act to incorporate Border
Pipe Line Corporation.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
similar to other pipe-line measures which
have been considered by this house. The
original incorporation takes place under the
provisions of the general pipe-lines Act which
parliament passed a few years ago.
The applicants for this charter represent
business interests in Vancouver, Calgary,
Winnipeg and Toronto. They are asking for
powers to build a pipe-line from the main
oil-bearing region of Alberta, southerly, and
westerly through the Crowsnest Pass to
Cranbrook, from Cranbrook across the international boundary at Kingsgate, to Spokane,
west to Portland, and north to VancouverHon. Mr. Euler: How about New Westminster?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: -regions where, I understand, the roses bloom twelve months in the
year.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Sometimes.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The line would, of course,
serve adjacent territory, including the district
of New Westminster, so ably represented in
this honourable house by the senator from
that city (Hon. Mr. Reid). I am advised that
the reason this route was selected is that it
affords the easiest route for the construction
of a pipe-line to the west coast; and of
course, the corporation will be in a position
to supply the cities of Spokane and Portland,
whose oil, I am informed, is now brought
from California to Seattle by tanker, and
thence to the interior by other means of
transportation.
The capacity of the line will be approximately 150,000 barrels per day.
The financial provisions of the bill resemble
those which are ordinarily found in these
charters. The initial capital consists of five
million shares of no par value, and the company will have the power to finance through
bond or debenture or preferred stock issues.
The bill is a simple one. As I have stated,
it must conform to the provisions of the
general pipe-lines Act, and certain aspects
of the charter, as in other charters which we
have approved, are subject to the provisions
of the Joint Stock Companies Act.
If the bill receives second reading, I shall
move that it be referred to the Committee
on Transport and Communications.
Hon. John T. Haig: I never like to rise in
opposition to an honourable member who has
presented a private bill, and I am not going to

do so now, other than to say this. In another
place last year there was a long fight over
a pipe-line bill, and, to be quite candid about
it, my sympathies were with those who
opposed that measure. I am in full agreement with the proposal that a pipe-line
should be built in Canada and that the line
shall run to Vancouver, and from there go
south, if that is what the promoters want;
and if today's bills go to a committee of which
I am a member, I will vote for the bill to
construct a line direct to Vancouver and
vote against the bill whereby priority is
given to American cities.
Let there be no misunderstanding about
this. I do not believe that this country can
prosper unless our industrial resources are
available first to our own people. It may be
that our oil resources are greater than Canada
can use. Possibly the surplus should be sold
to the United States. But if the proposed
pipe-line is to supply oil first to Portland
and other United States cities, it is my view,
after listening to the honourable member
for Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McKeen), that very
little oil will reach Vancouver. The same
point of view was taken in the debate on the
pipe-line bill promoted last year by the
Imperial Oil Company, whose line was routed
through Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba
to Gretna. The result was that the company
built a branch line into Winnipeg, and one of
the finest refineries in the world is being
constructed nearby: from there the line will
continue into Ontario. I am in entire agreement with that kind of policy.
I dislike having to object to the bill of the
honourable member from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar). He is a gentleman, and I like
him. But I cannot support it against another
bill providing for a line from the same basic
field direct to Vancouver. May be New Westminster needs consideration, and perhaps if
Vancouver has to send to New Westminster
for its mayors, it could get its oil from the
same source.
An Hon. Senalor.: They are one town now.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am not going to divide
the house, nor ask anybody to vote against
this bill. But if it is sent to committee I shall
vote against it. I have no doubt that when
it reaches the other place there will be a
bitter fight; and I think we should yield to
no one in the other house in our determination that the resources of Canada shall be
developed, if possible, in Canada. It is for
that reason that I am opposed to this bill.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: May I point out ta my
honourable friend that the point of view he
has expressed was pretty fully dealt with in
our committee, and there was not much of a

SENATE

fight there. All the fighting was done in the
other bouse. I thought we took the absolutely
correct point of view when we said that, provided the bona fides of the incorporators
were established, we had no alternative but
to assent to incorporation. Under the Pipe
Lines Act jurisdiction to deal with the
matters which my honourable friend has
ralised belongs to the Board of Transport
Commissioners. Theirs, not ours, is the duty
and the responsibility.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I have one question to ask
the honourable senator who introduced this
bill. As respects almost every bill of this
kind, that has been before us this year, we
have been told that a supply of steel pipe is
assured. I should like to know whether this
company also is assured of the steel pipe it
needs.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I cannot answer that
question. I presume there may be some
difficulty at times about getting sufficient
steel. But it is certain that the incorporators
have no hope of making arrangements for
getting it until they know whether they will
have the power to build a pipe-line.
Perhaps, before I close the debate, other
senators should have the opportunity of
speaking. I want to comment on what was
said by my honourable friend the leader of
the opposition.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Say it.
Some Hon. Senators: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The point raised by the
leader of the opposition is fairly clear, but
I submit that under the circumstances it is
a rather strange one, and I do not think it
has much validity. Briefly, his argument is
that we should not export a natural product
-oil-from Alberta to certain areas in the
United States until we are sure that we shall
have enough oil to support all the industries
that may be established in Canada. In discussing the bill which immediately preceded
this one, the honourable senator from
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McKeen) gave some
information as to how far Canada is deiendent for oil upon outside sources. There is no
doubt much of the oil now being used in
Eastern Canada-and in Western Canada,
too, before the oil development took place in
Alberta-originates in areas outside of
Canada. Some of it is imported from South
American countries, and a large portion of
it comes from the United States. Is it
therefore, not the part of common sense and
wisdom for us to place ourselves in a position where we can export Alberta oil to
These
cities like Spokane and Portlandi?
centres would find the Alberta oil fields a
much cheaper source of supply than those

from which they draw now. This is a sort of
reciprocal arrangement, and if we are going
to take the position, on the rather narrow
ground put forward by the leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), that we should
not export our oil to the United States, what
then can we say if in the future the United
States refuses to allow the export of their oil
to us for the same reason? I cannot see the
logic or merit of my honourable friendý's
stand; but we shall be able to discuss this
more fully if the bill is referred to committee.
At that time the honourable senators from.
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) and Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert) may resume this discussion
with me under somewhat freer auspices.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Crerar: Honourable senators, I
move that this bill be referredi to the Standing
Committee on Transport and Communications.
The motion was agreed to.
THE SENATE AND ITS WORK
MOTION-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed, from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Robertson for the appointment of a special
committee to inquire into and report upon
how in its opinion the Senate may make its
maximum contribution to the welfare of the
Canadian people.
Hon. A. N. McLean: Honourable senators,
in rising to make a few remarks about the
resolution before the house, I wish to sincerely congratulate the honourable member
from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) on
the very excellent speech he made last night.
It takes a great deal of work to prepare such
a speech, and I think it was one of the finest
I have heard in this chamber. I think his
address made new history; but I shall confine
my remarks to past history. I also want to
congratulate the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) and the
honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig),
who both made excellent speeches on this
subject.
In looking over the Senate Debates for
many years back it seems that the problem
of creating more legislative work for the
Senate, especially in the early part of the
sessions, has been a worry to a substantial
number of leading statesmen of Canada, and
others, who graced this house as well as those
in the other place. Committees have been
set up from time to time to deal with the
situation, but the problem has never been

FEBRUARY 20, 1951
solved. In 1934 there was an extended debate
in the Senate on this question, and some of
the most outstanding parliamentarians of
that period-Hon. Charles Murphy, Hon.
Raoul Dandurand, Hon. Rodolphe Lemieux
and others took part in that debate. Their
conclusions were that when ministers with
portfolios ceased to sit in the Senate, this
house did not get a fair share of the legislation presented to parliament until very late
in the session. In fact, this difficulty arose
in a small way, right after confederation.
In 1934 the Honourable Charles Murphy
gave notice of inquiry in this chamber as
follows:
That he will call the attention of the government
to the work of the Senate and to the efforts made
by the Senate to secure the initiation in this bouse
of government measures, and will inquire if it is
the intention of the government to introduce in the
Senate at an early date any of the legislation
indicated in the Speech from the Throne.

This inquiry was introduced after the then
Honourable Senator McRae from Vancouver
made the following statement in the house:
I make bold to suggest that some honourable
member, with long experience both in this and in
the other house, as well as in the government,
should make a very clear statement on the responsibility of the Senate and the scope of its authority.
In this way, I am sure, we should hear much less
criticism of this honourable body by reason of the
long adjournments which are necessary from time
to time for lack of business.

In his speech the Honourable Mr. Murphy
made some very illuminating remarks about
the work of this honourable body. He
described it as a narrative of recorded facts,
and then he took his fellow senators on a
short excursion into parliamentary history.
If any honourable senator bas not read that
speech by Mr. Murphy it would be worth his
while to do so. I shal just record here a
few of the points brought out by that
He prefaced his
honourable gentleman.
remarks by repeating the following statement which was made by Sir John A. Macdonald during confederation debates:
In order to protect local interests, and to prevent
sectional jealousies, it was found requisite that the
three great divisions into which British North
America is separated should be represented in the
upper house on the principle of equality . . .
Accordingly, in the upper bouse .. . which has the
sober second-thought in legislation, it is provided
that each of those great sections shall be represented equally by twenty-four members.
There would be no use of an upper bouse if it did
not exercise, when it thought proper, the right of
opposing, or amending, or postponing, the legislation of the lower bouse. It would be of no value
whatever were it a mere chamber for registering
the decrees of the lower house. It must be an
independent bouse, having a free action of its own,
for it is only valuable as being a regulating body,
calmly considering the legislation initiated by the
popular branch, and preventing any hasty or illconsidered legislation which may come from that
body.

Honourable Mr. Murphy recorded that in
1868 a select committee had been appointed
to "consider and report whether by any
alterations in the forms and proceedings of
this house the dispatch of public business
Sir
can be more effectively performed."
Alexander Campbell was made chairman of
that committee, and the substance of the
committee's report, which was presented in
May, 1868, would seem to indicate that we
have somewhat similar conditions today.
The committee was of the opinion that it
would be possible to originate a much larger
number of bills in the Senate, and it appeared
to the committee that it must rest chiefly
wîth the government of the day to accomplish this. The committee thought that the
public interest in the more thorough consideration of legislative measures as well as
in the dispatch of business would be much
better served by a persistent effort on the
part of the government of the day to originate
in the Senate as many measures as the law
and usage of parliament would permit. The
report was unanimously adopted.
In 1874 a special committee, made up of
members both of the House of Commons and
the Senate, was set up to deal with the subject, but little was accomplished.
In 1879 protests were made in this body
over the delays in legislation coming from
the other place, but in the session of 1881
there was an improvement, which was
described by the Honourable Senator Miller
on the floor of this chamber as follows:
I think it is only fair, under the altered circumstances this year, to compliment the government on
the decided improvement which has taken place in
that respect during the present session of parliaWe have had very important measures

initiated here, and had full time to discuss them.
We have not, on any one single day up to the close
of the session, been behind with our work . . .
We have been able to keep up with it, and give it
all the time that we thought it deserved . . . I only
hope the good departure the government have made
this year will be followed up in subsequent sessions.

However, in 1882 things got back into the
old rut again, and the Honourable Senator
Alexander, who had been a member of the
House of Commons in Sir John A. Macdonald's
time, voiced loud criticism of the receipt
of important bills in this chamber 36 hours
before the closing of the session.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McLean: In 1908 several motions
were introduced into this chamber by honourable senators-one by the Honourable
Senator David and one by the Honourable
Senator Beique-stating that it was desirable
that legislation come through from the House
of Commons more efficiently and that more
work be given to the Senate.

SENATE
During the session of 1923 the Honourable
Senator Dandurand presented this motion:
That a message be sent to the House of Commons
requesting that bouse to unite in the appointment
of a joint committee to be composed of an equal
number of members, not exceeding five, of each
bouse, to consider the following matters:
1. The forms of bills and the best means of affording the information and assistance in the consideration thereof at all stages of legislation in both
bouses of parliament.
2. The better distribution of the work of legislation between the two bouses.

The joint -committee was duly appointed
and made the following recommendations,

which were presented to the Senate in 1923
and adopted:
Your committee further recommend that the
distribution of all private bills, exclusive of divorce
bills, be regulated by the Speakers of both bouses
jointly, with the understanding that they will see
as far as practicable that private bills, exclusive of
divorce bills, be introduced one-half in each bouse.

In his summary of the Senate's work the
Honourable Mr. Murphy put on record a
statement of the large amounts of money the
Senate had saved for the public treasury by
amending financial bills or refusing to pass
them. In this connection he quoted Sir
Richard Cartwright as having said in the
Senate in 1906:
It is not by any manner of means a trifling thing
when I say that the nature of a Senate is not only
what the Senate does but what the Senate prevents
other people from doing.

Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. McLean: The total saving to the
public treasury by the Senate over the years
1875 to 1934 amounted to more than $100
million, and besides the Senate prevented
the making of proposed land grants running
into millions of acres. And in his speech here
a few days ago the honourable leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) told us of the
hundreds of millions of dollars that have been
saved to the prairie provinces through preservation of the Crowsnest Pass freight rates.
The outstanding men who have graced
this body over the years have had difficulties
similar to ours with regard to the proper
distribution of legislation between the two
houses of parliament. Different methods to
improve the situation have been tried, but no
permanent solution has been found, and that
is the crux of our trouble today. Men like
the honourable Sir John Abbott, Sir
Mackenzie Bowell, Sir Oliver Mowat, Sir
George Ross, Sir George Drummond, Sir
Frank Smith, Sir John Macdonald-it was
truly said of those men by the Honourable
Senator Murphy that they did their utmost to
preserve the great character with which the
Senate was invested by the Fathers of Confederation, and at the same time strove earnestly ever to increase its usefulness. In

later years our outstanding predecessors, such
as Senators Meighen, Lemieux, Dandurand
and McRae, puzzled their great brains as to
how to overcome the same difficulties with
which we now seem to be faced. The eminent
former members whom I have mentioned
seemed to have been really well satisfied
with the set-up of this honourable body, but
they did have the same difficulties that we
have in getting legislation before this house
in the early part of the session.
Now in the light of what has happened in
the past, the proposal for a fundamental
change in the complexion of this honourable
body is something that we all should be
extremely careful about.. Such a proposal
would involve our entering upon new ground
where almost angels fear to tread, for few
subjects have been discussed so much and so
thoroughly in this chamber in the past as
this one has, and that by some of the ablest
and brainiest men of the country. So we
should realize our great responsibility if we
undertake to make any major changes, and
be prepared for what may be the consequences. One thing I do know: we all can
do a great deal as individuals, and individual
effort counts. We can see to it that this fine
body continues to be as useful to the country
in the future as it has been in the days that
are gone.
In passing, may I say that I think that
Prime Minister St. Laurent is to be sincerely
congratulated upon his choice of men of such
high character and outstanding ability as
are those who represent the great province
of Newfoundland in this honourable chamber.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McLean: Personally, I like the
work here and do not have many idle
moments. A growing country like Canada
needs the services of this honourable body
now more than ever before, and if each of us
keeps his shoulder to the wheel, mighty useful work will be accomplished in the future,
as in the past, not only while we are in this
chamber but when we are in our respective
constituencies. Just like our great predecessors, we need to receive legislation from the
other place more promptly, and we should
all try to unite in a plan, if one can be found,
to bring about this result.
Honourable senators, in my humble opinion a change in the age limit of senators or
in the manner of appointment to this honourable body would not solve our problems at
all.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Quite right.
Hon. Mr. McLean: Those things have
nothing to do with the real problems that

FEBRUARY 20, 1951
confront us, and that confronted our predecessors. To anyone who doubts my statement I would say without hesitation that I
base my claim on the past history of this
great institution. And the wisdom of the
ages is at all times to be found in history.
I trust that the resolution will be withdrawn. If it is not, I shall have te vote
against it.
Hon. James P. McIntyre: Honourable
senators, in rising to make a few remarks on
the motion moved by the honourable leader
of this house (Hon. Mr. Robertson), I first
wish to congratulate him upon his very able
speech in support of the resolution. I also
wish to congratulate the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) upon the excellent
speech that he delivered so well without a
note or paper to guide him. The honourable
senators from Toronto Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) and Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris)-two eminent lawyers, each an
ex-Attorney General of his province and real
statesman-also made excellent speeches,
outstanding speeches, in this debate.
It is a very strange coincidence that the
honourable senator from Vancouver South
and the honourable senator who has just
finished speaking made use of some of the
very material that I dug up from the library
for use in my own speech. Yet neither of
us knew what the other was going to say.
I am prepared to go inte some phases of the
question a little more deeply than did my
honourable friend.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McIntyre: Before dealing with the
motion I desire to place on the record certain
quotations from the speeches of Sir John A.
Macdonald and the Honourable George
Brown, two outstanding statemen who had
most to do with bringing the provinces of
Canada into confederation in the year 1865.
Sir John A. Macdonald gave a clear outline of
what he thought was the purpose of the
Senate in a speech delivered on February 6,
1865, and which appears in the Parliamentary
Debates, at pages 26 and 27. This extract is
rather lengthy, but because of its importance
I would ask the indulgence of the house while
I read it. It is as follows:
There would be no use of an upper house, if it
did not exercise, when it thought proper, the right
of opposing or amending or postponing the legislation of the lower bouse. It would be of no value
whatever were it a mere chamber for registering
the decrees of the lower house. It must be an
independent house, having free action of its own,
for it is only valuable as being a regulating body,
calmly considering the legislation initiated by the
popular branch, and preventing any hasty or illconsidered legislation which may come from that

body; but it will never set itself in opposition
against the deliberate and understood wishes of the
people.
The members of our upper bouse will be like
those of the lower, men of the people, and from the
people. The man put into the upper bouse is as
much a man of the people the day after, as the
day before his elevation. Springing from the people
and one of them, he takes his seat in the Council
with all the sympathies and feelings of a man of
the people, and when he returns home at the end
of the session, he mingles with them on equal terms,
and is influenced by the same feelings and associations, and events, as those which affect the mass
around him. And is it, then, to be supposed that the
members of the upper branch of the legislature
will set themselves deliberately at work to oppose
what they know to be the settled opinions and
wishes of the people of the country? They will not
do it. There is no fear of a deadlock between the
two houses. There is an infinitely greater chance
of a deadlock between the two branches of the
legislature, should the elective principle be adopted,
than with a nominated chamber-chosen by the
Crown, and having no mission from the people.
The members of the upper chamber would then
come from the people as well as those of the lower
house, and should any difference ever arise between
both branches, the former could say to the members
of the popular branch-"We as much represent
the feelings of the people as you do, and even
more so; we are not elected from small localities
and for a short period; you as a body were elected
at a particular time, when the public mind was
running in a particular channel; you were returned
to parliament, not so much representing the general
views of the country on general questions as upon
the particular subjects which happened to engage
the minds of the people when they went to the
polls. We have as much right, or a better right,
than you to be considered as representing the
deliberate will of the people on general questions,
and therefore we will not give way." There is, I
repeat, a greater danger of an irreconcilable difference of opinion between the two branches of the
legislature, if the upper be elective, than if it holds
its commission from the Crown.

I am sure that all honourable senators
agree that Sir John A. Macdonald was one
of the ablest statesman that Canada has
produced in the past hundred years.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McIniyre: I corne next to the
sayings of the Honourable George Brown
who, though an able man, did not come to the
forefront as did Sir John A. Macdonald.
There is no doubt, however, that these two
men were instrumental in bringing the provinces of Canada into confederation. The
quotation from Mr. Brown is not very longHon. Mr. Hugessen: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. McIn.tyre: It reads:
I have always been opposed to a second elective
chamber, and I am so still, from the conviction that
twe elective houses are inconsistent with the right
working of the British parliamentary system. I
voted almost alone against the change when the
Council was made elective, but I have lived to see
a vast majority of those who did the deed wish it
had not been done.

Honourable senators will recall that the Honourable George Brown was then speaking of

SENATE

the Legislative Council of Ontario, which was
an elective body, and which was later
abolished. It is notable that all the elective
legislative councils in Canada, except in
Quebec, have been abolished. In this regard
I venture to say that should the Senate
become an elective chamber I would not be
surprised to see it suffer the same fate in the
not-too-distant future.
Honourable Mr. Brown continued:
I thought it would be well to provide for a more
frequent change in the composition of the upper
bouse, and lessen the danger of the chamber being
largely composed of gentlemen whose advanced
years might forbid the punctual and vigorous discharge of their public duties. Still, the objection
made to this was very strong. It was said:
"Suppose you appoint them for nine years, what
will be the effect? For the last three or four years
of their term they would be anticipating its expiry,
and anxiously looking to the administration of the
day for re-appointment; and the consequence would
be that a third of the members would be under
the influence of the executive." The desire was to
render the upper bouse a thoroughly independent
body-one that would be in the best position to
canvass dispassionately the measures of this bouse,
and stand up for the public interests in opposition
to hasty or partisan legislation.

Hon. Mr. Haig: May I interrupt the honour-

able senator?
Hon. Mr. McIntyre: Yes, of course.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I thought I heard him make
a statement which may not be historically
correct. He said that the Honourable George
Brown was dealing with the Legislative
Council of Ontario. I would point out that
Upper Canada and Lower Canada at that time
had one parliament, and the Executive Council was called the Executive Council of Upper
and Lower Canada.
Hon. Mr. McIntyre: I meant to say the
Executive Council of Upper and Lower
Canada.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: It was the Province
of Canada.

and 1896, but nothing was done. A new government came into office in 1896, and in
1898 the company approached that government for financial assistance in building the
line. Assistance amounting to $3,400,000 was
granted. In consideration of this assistance
the Calnadian Pacific Railway and the government entered into an agreement known
as the Crowsnest Pass Agreement, by which
the railway undertook to establish maximum
rates on wheat and wheat products eastbound and on farm implements, machinery,
fruit and other commodities westbound. At
that time British Columbia had not gone to
any extent into the production of fruit.
From the date of the agreement until 1906
the farmers of the prairie provinces had the
benefit of those reduced rates.
In 1906 the government ' of Manitoba
entered into a similar agreement with the
Mackenzie and Mann interests. The rates
under this agreement were somewhat lower
than those under the Crowsnest agreement.
The Canadian Pacific Railway reduced their
rates to meet those under the Manitoba
agreement, and consequently, from 1906 to
1918 Western Canada enjoyed the benefits of
the rates prescribed under the Manitoba
agreement with Mackenzie and Mann.
In the year 1918 the cost of operating railroads increased very materially. The late
Senator Gideon Robertson. Minister of
Labour, stated that the cost of living had
increased 100 per cent. At this point I
wish to pay a tribute to the late Honourable
Gideon Robertson, who was Minister of
Labour in 1930. Perhaps one may be pardoned a personal reference. I had something
to do with the late senator back in 1930,
when, if my memory serves me right, the
Bennett government provided $20 million for
unemployment purposes throughout Canada.
I came to Ottawa to sign an agreement for
Prince Edward Island's share of the grant,
which was $90,000. At that time I happened
to be Minister of Public Works. When I
entered the office of Mr. Robertson, whom I
had never seen before, he rose from his chair,
met me half way across the room, and extending his hand, said, "How is Prince Edward
Island?" He then asked me about a gentleman, a railway man like himself, whom I
knew very well, and he made me feel so
much at home that I was not a bit embarrassed. The $90,000 was used for unemployment projects in different parts of our
province.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Not very much.

Hon. Mr. Haig: The Province of Canada,
yes; but the Council was elected.
Hon. Mr. McIntyre: To prove the worth
of this chamber since confederation, I should
like to emphasize two or three points. The
functions and the work of this chamber are
very much less known to the people at large
than what goes on in the other place.
Away back in 1898 the Canadian Pacific
Railway Company was desirous of building
a branch line from Lethbridge to the Crowsnest Pass in British Columbia. Probably the
honourable member from Lethbridge (Hon.
Hon. Mr. McIntyre: Not very much, but
Mr. Buchanan) knows much more about the it was something. One particular project was

still in effect. Now, if you multiply $20 million Honourable senators, I have just tried to

SENATE
give you some idea of what the Senate has
saved the taxpayers of this country since
confederation.
The Senate is an independent body, and its
members do not have to speak to the galleries
or go to the people and be elected. I am
proud to say that the independent spirit of
the Senate still prevails. The honourable
gentleman from Vancouver South said that
the Liberals will probably remain in power
after the next election. That may be so, but
what of it? I recall that in 1935, when we
returned to power in the Legislature of
Prince Edward Island, there was no opposition at all. We had plenty of opponents in
our own party, though, and I think some of
our own party members gave us more
trouble than we would have had if there had
been a half dozen Conservatives in the house.
I hope the same situation does not come
about here; but if it should, and if the
membership of the Senate should be made up
of one political stripe, either Conservative or
Liberal, I think the house would still exercise
its independence just as it does now.
Honourable senators, we are living in a
dangerous period, when we do not know from
day to day what is going to happen. We do
not know at what hour war might be brought
upon us. It seems to me that the United
States, China, Russia, and other countries are
unable to get together. When the United
Nations puts a proposition to the People's
Government of China, that government calls
it propaganda, slander and everything else.
When the Russian Government puts a proposition to the British Government, the
United States Government, or the United
Nations, it is called propaganda and slander
too. Before we can have peace in the world
somebody must give way. If all countries
would just give in a little in an attempt to
come together it would end all the slander
that is being thrown around by the Chinese,
and the Russians and their satellites. Nobody
wants this sort of thing.
I close by quoting the following st 0 tement, which I came across somewhere:

Hon. Mr. Duff: No, let us have a vote.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS

IN REPLY ADOPTED

The Senate resumed from Thursday,
February 15, consideration of His Excellency
the Governor General's Speech at the opening
of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr.
Stambaugh for an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
my rising to speak on the Address in reply to
the Speech from the Throne is getting to be
an annual occurrence, but I assure the house
that but for the fact that I wish to say some-

thing which perhaps no one else will say here,
I would have refrained at this time.
At the outset I wish to congratulate sincerely the mover (Hon. Mr. Stambaugh) and
the seconder (Hon Mr. Dessureault) of the
Address. The mover painted a very fine
picture of his province of Alberta, but he
omitted any reference to the feature which I
appreciate most, that it is Canada's banner
grazing or ranching province. That section
which has been kept open for ranching, down
in the foothills country, is, I think, still the
most beautiful spot in Canada.
I was encouraged to say something in this

debate by an article that I saw the other day
in the Ottawa Citizen. It is headed "A
sermon against sermonizing," and reads in
part as follows:
So swift is the sequence of events in the modern
world, so vast the stage on which history is being
unfolded, that the plain citizen often feels bewildered. It may seem to him that his influence counts
for little, that his fate will be determined by forces
beyond his control. Perhaps he feels that he can
only hope, like Naaman of old, for some great thing
to resolve all difficulties, for the achievement of
peace and security by some dramatic means. But in
CBC's National Sunday Evening Hour last Sunday,
Dr. Cyril James, Principal and Vice-Chancellor of
McGill University, made eloquent use of Naaman's
story to dispel this attitude. The fact is that each
person bas a part to play, no matter how modest,
in shaping the future. And each must bear the
responsibility for what he does or neglects to do.

That, I repeat encouraged me to perform
what I deem to be my duty on this occasion.

FEBRUARY 20, 1951
that the government of this country is doing
things to the entire satisfaction of the people,
and I am thereby reminded of a remark made
by someone in the British House of Commons
-I believe it was Joseph Chamberlain-that
he wished he could be as sure of any one
thing as a certain honourable member was of
everything.
Honourable senators, I think that the very
serious situatioii in the world today imposes
a real duty upon every individual in this
country. I may say that I have no faith in
might, in the expenditure of $5 billion for
defence. That will not be enough, it seems
to me, unless the people of the world experience a genuine change of heart and discontinue the mad race in armaments. I should
like to see more money spent on purposes of
peace than we are now spending on them,
but I wonder if we shall ever get around to
trying that. The honourable gentleman from
Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon) made a fine
statement about faith. Well, we all believe in
a Supreme Being, but there are many different religious denominations and churches and
diverse ways of worshipping. I often wish
we could come to common agreement that a
person could worship equally well in any
church. What a fine example we might set
ta the rest of the world! I personally would
be willing ta do my worshipping in any
church, if that were agreeable ta other people.
To my mind, one of the things that should
concern us most at this time is the outlook
that our people-especialy our young people
-have on life. I cannot speak about Canada
in general, but I very much regret that the
part of the country that I am familiar with
is immensely unconcerned as ta what happens.
Formerly a threat of war gave rise ta a vital
spirit of willingness ta fight in defence of the
country. I was just discussing with my deskmate (Hon. Mr. Quinn) the fact that some of
our finest soldiers, those who made the
very greatest contribution, had what the
ordinary person would regard as scarcely
anything ta fight for. The country had
afforded them a very meagre existence. Yet,
in these days of abund-ance, with our social
security and bonuses, that vital spirit is
entirely lacking-at least, in the part of the
country that I am acquainted with. Every
day of the week men well able ta work, many
of them young men, are playing cards, or
crowding the pool rooms, skating rinks and
other places of sport, while the churches
stand empty, and even on Sunday are only
partly filled. That strikes me as a very
serious thing.
In looking over the Rosetown Eagle, the
little paper published in the home town of

my room-mate (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), I noticed
an interesting story. A man, ta give his
young son something ta keep him occupied,
cut a map of the world into a great many
pieces and told the boy ta put it back together
properly. Very shortly afterwards the task
was accomplished, and the father inquired
how it had been done so quickly. "Oh," was
the reply, "on the back of the paper there
was a picture of a boy, and I knew that if I
built the boy up rightly the world would
come out all right".
I am afraid, honourable senators, that we
are not spending enough on the building up
of our young people.
It is perhaps nobody's fault in particular
that we do not seem ta have an outstanding
leader today who can inspire in the people
a true appreciation of our democratic freedom. I have maintained a strong opposition
ta the government's practice of handing out
baby bonuses and other forms of social
security. In my opinion such grants nat only
fail ta improve conditions, but reduce the
number of volunteers for military service and
cut down our volume of production.
In the past I have complained rather
bitterly about our lack of leadership when
Stalin interfered with and prevented a peace
treaty between Austria and the western
powers. When I pointed out that there were
available ta us 2,000,000 Germans who were
badly needed in this country, the answer
was that we were still at war. I am strongly
of the opinion that had we in 1945 opened
our doors ta the displaced persons of that
country, we would today have a strong body
of new Canadians who by now would have
learned the democraitic ways -and the advantages of this country, and would be prepared
ta fight for them.
For my part I am not particularly alarmed
about the possibilities of an invasion of
Canada from the north. I am, however,
fearful that Europe is today in real danger.
The honourable deputy leader (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) went what I thought was a long
way when he stated that we should perhaps
come ta the defence of Yugoslavia. I would
ask him: What about Western Germany? Why
have we allowed Russia ta do what she has
done ta Eastern Germany? Displaced persons
who succeed in fleeing the eastern sector
find great difficulty in gaining entry ta this
country, where we have not only abundant
natural resources but a crying need for people
ta do the work.
The member of the other house who calls
himself an "Independent", but who persistently supports the government, recently

SENATE

said that he would be quite happy to see
the Minister of Finance block out the gold
that is still in the ground and issue money
against that wealth for defence purposes.
How much better it would be to block out
the areas of this country containing gold and
issue money against it to build, for instance,
an irrigation dam in Saskatchewan? Certainly
we could issue money in this way more
cheaply than we do now and develop our
natural resources to provide food for a hungry
world.
Some mention was made in this house
last evening about the Social Credit Party to
which I take exception. I believe that had it
not been for Mr. Aberhart, the former
Premier of Alberta, we would not today have
a central bank in Canada. During the recent
war enormous sums of money became necessary to finance the defence efforts of the
country, and although the chartered banks
did a good job in their own way, the Bank
of Canada proved of great value to us.
The honourable senator from Bruce (Hon.
Mr. Stambaugh) boasted of what the province
of Alberta produces. What chance have we
in western Canada got to produce and sell
our grain at a profit with the rising freight
rates? Not only have we within the past
year suffered loss by frost, but the wheat
agreement with Great Britain has been a
source of trouble. I understand the Minister
of Agriculture is now in England trying to
secure an additional payment on that agreement from the British Government. Now we
have a new wheat agreement-almost a
world agreement-signed by many countries,
and we are selling our wheat for about
fifteen cents a bushel less than we formerly
received for il.
I did not complain when Canada made a
straight cash donation to Great Britain, but
I was never satisfied with the British Wheat
Agreement. Although the president of the
wheat pool was in favour of the agreement
no effort was made to allow a vote on the
question by the supporters of the pool, of
whom I was one. Action to implement the
agreement was taken by the men in charge
of the pool, without consulting the producers.
Our experience with the wheat agreement
and discussion about the "have regard"
clause remind me of the days when I used
to trade horses. It was a poor policy, I found,
to allow the other fellow to make too good
a deal; he never came back because he was
afraid you would try to get even with him.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: That is good logic.
Hon. Mr. Horner: And today Great Britain
refuses to buy our bacon, perhaps for that
very reason.

I havé before me an article written from
entitled "Anglo-Aussie Meat
Melbourne,
Deal".
It reads this way:
A 15-year meat agreement-

Not a five-year agreement.
-between Australia and Britain, to make Australia
one of the biggest meat-producing areas in the
world, will be signed shortly, Commerce Minister
John McEwen, announced today.
McEwen said the main point would be a guarantee by Britain to buy Australia's entire surplus of
beef, lamb and mutton.
On this basis, Australian cattle and sheep raising
is to be expanded considerably, and vast tracts of
virgin land are to be opened up for cattle farming
with the help of British capital.
McEwen said the agreement will provide a fixed
floor price. Selling prices would be reviewed every
year.

That is a better deal than we got.

Great

Britain, I think, feels that she got the best

of us in the wheat deal, and she is not going
to buy our bacon for fear we will attempt
to recover what we lost on the wheat.

Today farmers by the thousands are signing petitions with a view to getting greater
returns for their wheat. As a matter of fact,
oats are bringing fifteen cents a hundredweight more than wheat. A rather strong
letter ,appeared recently in the Ottawa
Citizen, written by a man in the province
of Alberta, claiming that because he got
$1.40 a bushel for his wheat he was robbed.
The Citizen seems to have gone astray, as
a lot of eastern people do, in telling the
story. The fact is that this wheat may
have been graded No. 3 or No. 4, and if
that was the case he would not receive more
than $1.40. The Citizen rather assumes that
the wheat was No. 1 delivered at the head of
the lakes. Then too, it is likely this man
would have to pay freight of about 30 cents
a bushel.
I come now to a criticism of the government, for which I make no apology. I refer
to the lack of action, or the ineffective action
to prevent further increases in the high cost
of living. I have referred before to the
present practice of observing an eight-hour
day and a five-day week in the cities. With
this plan in vogue farm help could not be
had. How can we expect our young people
to stay on the farm and milk cows seven
days a week, when their friends who go to
the city have two days a week off? We must
expect to pay for all the extra services we get.
Canada today is importing butter and oils,
and I claim that the policy of the government during the war was to keep the price
of farm products down below cost. The effect
of the butter subsidy was to provide the
consumer with No. 1 creamery butter at as

FEBRUARY 20, 1951

low as thirty-two cents a pound, a price
which rose gradually to about forty cents. I
stated in this chamber that butter could not
be produced for less than sixty to seventy
cents a pound. What was the result of this
policy? The farmers lost all hope. Further
before the Western producers were able to
ship beef, one hundred thousand cattle were
sold across the line under conditions which
probably meant the loss of another hundred
thousand young cattle the following year.
Through the indifference of the western
world, Russia has practically cornered the
supply of Australian and other wool. A year
ago last fall when I was in Victoria I was
told that a plant had been set up to manufacture rugs from pure Australian wool. The
necessary machinery was imported, but the
great difficulty was the high price of wool.
At every wool sale Russian representatives
were present, prepared to bid five cents more
than anyone else. The same sort of thing has
been going on in the rubber mark'et: supplies
are short and prices high. The available
supply of wool is smaller than ever.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: And $3 a pound.
Were I Minister of
Hon. Mr. Horner:
Agriculture there is nothing I would find
it easier to do than to increase the production of wool and mutton. Last fall I would
have made an order prohibiting the sale of
staple breeding stock, ewe lambs, to encourage farmers to go into the production of
sheep. It is no more trouble to raise sheep
than to raise chickens, and there is always a
demand for wool and meat. But no; nothing
was done. It was sickening to see young
ewe lambs going to slaughter. There is no
encouragement to produce meat, yet we continually hear the argument that prices are
too high. I am sure that if the present trend
towards shorter hours and greater security
continues we shall have 'to pay yet more for
our meat and our milk.
Here is the report of an address by J. S.
Turnbull, of Regina, President of the National
Dairy Council of Canada. It is headed:
"Dairy Prices Must Increase to Spur Output."
The report states that Mr. Turnbull said:
Prices for dairy products must go higher this
year if there was to be enough produced to meet
demands. Mr. Turnbull addressed the Saskatchewan
Dairy Association's convention in Regina. He said
that during the last two years the price of dairy
products in relation to other commodities had been
depressed and this had had an adverse effect on
milk production.
OUTPUT DOWN
Milk production in Canada in the last five years
had dropped by 1,250,000,000 pounds although the
human population had increased by nearly 2,000,000.
80713-11

This is a very serious situation; and I
wish my friend from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) were present to hear about it.
The report continues:
"Unless we can increase the over-all production
of milk in this country it is inevitable that as the
population continues to expand, a larger precentage
of milk will be required for the fluid trade and
concentrating purposes," Mr. Turnbull said.
Speaking of the competition of vegetable oils, he
said consumers were buying certain types of bakery
goods under the false impression that they contained pure cream fillings.
"These cheap vegetable oils, which can be brought
into this country . . . without payment of tariffs
of any kind, are threatening not only the butter
industry in the form of margarine but also the
operations of every dairyman in the form of
imitations and substitutes for every dairy product
produced," Mr. Turnbull said.

Health experts have discovered that pure
powdered skim milk-note this, not whole
milk, but powdered skim milk-is a wonderful health-producing food. I cannot quote
the exact figure, but a small amount of it
contains as much protein as a large beefsteak; and this is a matter of some importance
to a person whose intake of facts is restricted.
We heard the other day from the honourable
senator from Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt) that maple sugar products, one of
Quebec's earliest industries, were being
adulterated. If this condition needs remedying, surely the dairy interests are entitled
to protection from the competition of
imported oils. Much has been said about
the world-wide scarcity of fats and oils and
the share of these products to which Canada
might be entitled. But what of the hungry
world today?. We are depriving our farmers
of the full measure of milk production which,
were we logical, we would enable them to
engage in, and we are robbing the rest of the
world of fats that are sorely needed. That
was the situation years ago; it is worse today.
In speaking of the world situation, several
speakers have given high praise to the
Secretary of State for External Affairs, but
not one honourable senator has mentioned
any particular thing he bas done or left
undone which has accomplished anything for
world peace or for Canada. I should like to
be told at some time just what it is that
makes him a wonderful man. Canada spent
about a quarter of a million dollars on an
embassy building in China. Last fall our
ambassador returned, and I had a visit with
him. I am sure he recommended to the government that the new Chinese government
should be recognized. At the time he left
China the Communists were in possession of
the country, and it was hoped that the
country would not become dominated by the
Kremlin. But the government delayed its

SENATE
decision; nothing was done; and now that
we are fighting these people in Korea it is
too late. I wonder whether, on the advice of
our Ambassador, acceptance of the Communist government would have had some
effect.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: My honourable friend
remembers, of course, that Great Britain
recognized Communist China, and the result
of that was not very impressive.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I admit that. At the
same time, had Canada and the United States
taken similar action, it is possible that the
invasion of Korea by Chinese troops would
not have taken place. Great Britain's recognition did give some hope to the world, and I
have read that the British Government has
sent a representative to China.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I think the Chinese
have refused to receive any representative

of Britain.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I cannot say. However
a greater effort should have been made in
this direction by Canada.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: May I say just one word?
Our Secretary of State for External Affairs,
Df whom the honourable senator has spoken,
made the only approach in the United Nations
towards the recognition of the claim of Communist China to receive a hearing. Mr.
Pearson's resolution was adopted, and a committee was set up for the purpose of studying
the true representation of China in the United
Nations. This committee is to report to the
General Assembly of the United Nations, and
in the meantime the Nationalist Government
of China is to be seated provisionally. This
action was taken at the instance of the
Canadian Secretary of State for External
Affairs.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Thank you, but what success did it have?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: The committee has been
set up, and it has yet to make its report. This
whole action did not bring about a meeting
between the representatives of Communist
China and the Cease-Fire Committee of three
members, of which Mr. Pearson was one.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Well, I am sorry it did
not meet with any greater success. The
honourable senator from Medicine Hat (Hon.
Mr. Gershaw) mentioned a complaint that has
been voiced by medical men in this country.
He said that he did not know how carefully
immigrants who leave distant shores are
screened before coming to Canada, and he
referred to the complaint that quite a few
displaced persons and other immigrants
afflicted with diseases like tuberculosis are

finding their way into our hospitals soon after
arriving here. I am not so much concerned
about them going to the hospital for a time;
I am more concerned about them going to
jail. I am sure that if the good doctor himself was examining one of these immigrants
and thought that he would make a good democratic citizen, he would not hesitate to send
him to a hospital to be medically cured. I
have no complaint about that, but I do know
that some communists are getting into
Canada. I am disturbed about the Communists already in Canada, and the number
who are continually arriving here. Recently
we read about a professor who left this country after teaching at Toronto University for
some ten years. As he disappeared behind
the Iron Curtain he blasted Canada as being
a nation of haters, or something like that.
Hon. Mr. Reid: And we shall likely be
foolish enough to let people like him return
to our couptry.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Maybe so. I think we
shall have to start screening our teachers and
professors like they are doing in the United
States now. Elections were held in the University of Saskatchewan and several communist members took seats in the university
parliament. I understand also that there are
several professors of Communist leanings who
are teaching at the University of British
Columbia. This is a serious situation, and
because we have not been able to convert men
like these professors to our way of thinking,
I think we should study ourselves to see
whether we have done something or have left
something undone.
Honourable senators, Canada is concerned,
and rightly so, about the people of India, who
are facing starvation. In this connection I
should like to refer to a letter which recently
appeared on the editorial page of the Ottawa
Citizen. It was submitted from the office of
the High Commissioner for Pakistan at
Ottawa. I shall not read the whole letter, but
in one place the writer says:
For political reasons, India has been deliberately
cutting down on ber grain production since 1949.
She is turning over hundreds of thousands of acres
of good-growing land to jute and cotton. She does
so because she wishes to cripple Pakistan's economy,
who could easily supply her with these two fibres.

The writer goes on to say:
In addition to her attempted economic strangulation of Pakistan, India is bringing political pressure
to bear on that country by maintaining large numbers of troops in Kashmir and on other parts of her
borders with Pakistan.

This problem is presently being debated in
the United Nations. It is purely a religious
question; but because there are so many
different religious denominations in this

FEBRUARY 20, 1951

country we would only be throwing stones
if we were to criticize these people.
Honourable senators, the Speech from the
Throne says, among other things:
You will also be asked to consider a complete
revision of the Indian Act and the Consolidated
Revenue and Audit Act.

lived near us. The children started to school
with us but they were sent away to attend a
Separate School. I may be wrong, but I
believe that this has been one of the reasons
why the United States has gone ahead of us
by leaps and bounds in the matter of attracting people; and it probably explains why some
people have gone there from Canada. I have
known Catholics who did not want to live
in a district where they had to support
Separate Schools; and some of our excellent
Catholic immigrants left Western Canada and
went across to the United States because
there was only one kind of school-a Public
School which was recognized and supported
by the state.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: What has this to do with
the Speech from the Throne?
Hon. Mr. Horner: It has a lot to do with it.
The Indian Act should be rewritten, and I am
going to support the Indians in their request.
I am also saying that I believe international
unity would be strengthened if we in this
country set an example of close agreement
on religious matters.
To help towards
that end I would be willing to attend any
church for the rest of my days. After all,
every one of us believes in a Supreme Being.
Then why can we not get together on some
form of worship? We should at least be able
to do that in our public schools, for surely
the clergymen of the different denominations
could agree on an opening prayer acceptable
to all concerned. And if the home life of
our children is what it should be, they can be
taught there how to carry on in everyday
life, as good neighbours and citizens. I feel
that the maintenance of religious differences
and of different schools has done more than
anything else to divide this country, and I
say again that to help break down these
differences I personally would willingly
worship at any church for the rest of my
days.
The Address was adopted.

A number of us here served on the Joint
Committee of the Senate and House of
Commons which was appointed to inquire into
the Indian Act. While attending the meetings
of this committee I sometimes felt as though
we were getting lost. It reminded me of a
lady who got lost in a building. She said
that if she could only get back to where she
started from she would be able to find her
way. I recall some of the chief recommendations made by the Indians to that Joint
Committee. I remember hearing about a
band of some 3,000 Indians in Northern
Quebec. Some Jesuit Fathers were running
the place, and the Indians were complaining
about the bingo games that were going on.
They claimed that bingo playing was teaching
their children to gamble. The clerical gentleman in charge of this group was very embarrassed when he appeared before our
committee to reply to this charge. Honourable
senators will have noticed that just recently
Archbishop Leger of Montreal banned bingo
and other games of chance in church halls
and basements in his archdiocese. An article,
which later appeared in the editorial pages
of the Ottawa Journal, highly commended
him for his action. I certainly do myself.
The Archbishop explained, just as I would
have done, that people *ere not thinking of
piety or charity but of gain and gambling.
One recommendation that the Indians made
-and I am in favour of it as far as the whole
of Canada is concerned-was that schools on
Indian reservations be government-supported
and free from any religious interference. They
claimed that the children should receive their
religious training on Saturdays and Sundays.
All my life I have thought that this has been
one of the things which has caused disunity
in Canada. I recall that when I lived in

THE SENATE AND ITS WORK
MOTION-DEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Robertson for the appointment of a special
committee to inquire into and report upon
how in its opinion the Senate may make its
maximum contribution to the welfare of the
Canadian people.
Hon. Norman P. Lamberi: Honourable
senators, I am rising to speak in this debate
partly in response to the appeal of the leader
of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) who,
in introducing the resolution, said that participation in the discussion would be preferable to silence or indifference.
Also I feel in duty bound to take part in
this discussion because I am opposed to the
proposal contained in the resolution. That
is not because I am opposed to certain
changes in the character and structure of the
Senate, but because I am not prepared to

deal with the problems involved in the way
suggested by the resolution. I shall have
something more to say about that later.
Some reference has been made to the position of the leader on this side in presenting
this resolution as a senator and not as a
minister of the government. I am quite sure
that he consulted the Prime Minister before
presenting the resolution here and, so to
speak, received the "green light" to go ahead
and do what he wished to do in the matter.
Hon. Mr. Reid: He said he did not.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I think he made it quite
clear here that he was acting as an individual
and not as a minister of the government, but
I am venturing the opinion that before
presenting the resolution he approached the
Prime Minister, told him what he had in
mind, and received tacit permission to proceed with what he was about to do. In any
event, the spectacle of a minister of the
government stepping out of his double role,
if one may so describe it, and speaking
honestly and conscientiously as an individual,
does not disturb my equilibrium very much.
As a matter of fact, I am inclined to like it,
and should be glad to see more pronounced
examples of the same kind in other places.
I say this with all due regard for the theory
of responsible government. But I am sure
that my two more experienced colleagues on
my right (Hon. Mr. Euler and Hon. Mr.
Crerar) can testify that the desire of members
of the government to enjoy the privilege
enjoyed by ordinary folk, of expressing an
unbiased and untrammeled view on a problem
of the day, is not always resisted, and has
not always been resisted by my honourable
friends themselves.
One other aspect of the leader's position
may or may not have been noted by his
colleagues, on this side of the house particularly. I am going to mention it. It involves
a certain amount of secrecy, if you like to
call it that, or semi-secrecy, which is no longer
a matter of secrecy. The conversation of some
three years ago with the late Prime Minister
Mr. Mackenzie King, to which the leader of
the house referred, was related to a number
of us here at that time and it was discussed
privately outside of this house on one or two
occasions. Some of us, in fact a considerable
number of us, including myself, who are
possibly more hard boiled than the leader is,
thought that the Prime Minister's proposal
was one of his characteristic, diplomatic and
accomplished gestures toward shifting a hot
potato to other quarters. To make a long
story short, the result of that discussion was
to persuade the leader on this side of the
house not to press the inatter further than
to present in this house a resolution which

SENATE

would propose that the rules of the Senate
be ýamended so as to permit a minister from
the other house to come here and explain his
legislation. If I am guilty of revealing any
undesirable details in telling this story I
apologize for doing so. At any rate, it has
a bearing on the matter to this extent, that
as a sequel to it the honourable leader a week
ago Monday night presented to this house a
resolution which was entirely his own. As I
listened to his narration of his intimate conversation with the late Prime Minister
Mackenzie King, I could not help feeling,
having some appreciation of the temperamental and rather mystical background of
Scottish minds, that there was some suggestion of the fulfilment of an obligation. If
my impressions were correct and it was done
in an honest and conscientious way, ýall I can
say is: More respect to him for doing so.
My position in relation to this resolution
is exactly the same as it was when we discussed its subject matter outside this chamber
three years ago. The basis of my thinking
is that the Senate is an integral part of parliament, and that any reform or change in the
constitution of this country affecting either
branch of parliament is the concern of the
whole of parliament. Further, it is the concern
of the federal government which, in general
terms, is spokesman of parliament; and, as
partners to the constitution of Canada, the
provinces are also concerned. Holding that
view as I do, I do not think that it is the
responsibility of the members of this house
to discuss in detail measures of reform
regarding their own positions as members of
parliament, or to suggest that there should
be set up a special committee to inquire
into and make recommendations for the
reform of this particular branch of parliament. For one thing, I feel it would in many
ways be invidious to assume the responsibility for seeking publicly to deal with our
own positions in this way. This is particularly
true at this time in the light of constitutional
amendments being considered in the series
of conferences between the dominion and the
provincial authorities. Therefore, apart from
the question of incidental enlightenment and
information available for public consumption
as a result of this debate, I cannot see that
any useful purpose is to be served by the
resolution.
The leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) referred in his speech to the need for
public enlightenment owing to a wide misunderstanding of the Senate's place and work.
I am inclined to agree with him in what he
said in that connection, but I think it is
possible to exaggerate this impression. If it
does exist, it is in the form of a flippant
attitude of mind, and tends to envelop the

whole of parliament and all it stands for.
This is not unrelated to the efforts of, may I
say, certain cheap-skate commentators who
read prepared manuscripts from time to time
over the air.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I am sure that the
point of that remark will be appreciated by
my honourable friends from Rosetown (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) and from Huron-Perth (Hon.
Mr. Golding). I think there is this to be said
about commentators over the air as contrasted with columnists, to whom my honourable friend from Vancouver South (Hon.
Mr. Farris) paid some copious compliments
the other night, that the columnist at least
leaves, in the form of the printed word, his
mark in the newspaper for which he writes,
but an air commentator leaves nothing but
the sound of a voice which is supposed to
have certain tonal qualities that enable him
to speak on the air, and he disappears-an
unknown quantity-into the night. I think
that these rather superficial and irresponsible comments which are made off the reel
in order to fill in two or three minutes on
the airHon. Mr. Aseltine: Fifteen minutes.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: -should
be subject to
a good deal more discipline than seems to
prevail at present.
Some Hon. Senators:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Before I conclude I
intend to refer further to the relations
between parliament and the public at large,
as suggested by this particular reference to
the need for wider understanding of our
institutions.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask the honourable
gentleman a question? Has be not had
inquiries, particularly from university students, about the work and functions of the
Senate? Only the other night I had a letter
from a student at McMaster University, and
I was able to send him a copy of the speeches
on this resolution by the leader of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson), the honourable member for Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) and myself. A friend told me that
that was the first information he had been
able to get about the Senate from any place.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I think this incident is
typical of the extent of public knowledge of
the Senate.
My next reference is to a discussion which
took place about a year ago, following the
very welcome presentation to this bouse of
a statement in which the honourable senator
from Halifax (Hon. Mr. Dennis) offered the

FEBRUARY 21. 1951

facilities of his organization to make more
widely known the work and functions of the
Senate. In his reply, the honourable leader on
this side did not at that time distinguish
between his position as a minister and as a
private member. He made certain references
to a desire on the part of the Senate for
increased efficiency, and remarked by way
of illustration that he thought legislation
might be expected in the near future which
would have the effect of defining an age
limit for senators. The effect of that statement was to arouse a great deal of public
interest. One of the results of it was that I
was asked in the Easter recess to write something about the background, the historical
justification and the purposes and functions
of the Senate; not particularly to engage in
a discussion of proposals whereby the Senate
might be reformed, but to supply material
which would give a better understanding
on the part of the public of this institution.
That I proceeded to do, and the result of it,
as honourable senators know, was bound in
a pamphlet and circulated later, and gave
rise to the debate in this house in which the
honourable member from Ponteix (Hon. Mr.
Marcotte) and myself participated. I have
found the result of that action reflected in
public interest from all over this country. I
still get letters asking me if I will send the
writers a copy of these articles. I believe
there is a far greater measure of interest
in the functions of our parliamentary institutions than is suggested by some popular
commentators in their rather superficial and
flippant contributions to the entertainment
of the Canadian people.
In dealing with these questions and trying
humbly to fulfil a certain measure of responsibility as a member of parliament, I have
confined myself pretty largely to supplying
historical information and describing the
present functions and operations of the
Senate. I have conscientiously tried to avoid
the discussion of the problem of possible
changes. One has ideas about these things
but, as I said at the beginning, I maintain
strongly that there is a proper place and
time and proper circumstances in which these
matters should be discussed and decided. I
might add, that from the pre-confederation
discussions until the present, no considerable
constitutional discussion bas taken place
publicly; it has been held in camera; and
those who have participated have been well
qualified to do so. As a result of their discussions and findings, positive resolutions
have emerged. These concrete proposals then
become subject to the approval or disapproval of parliament as a whole. That is
the proceeding which I think should

characterize the response to any suggestion
at this time about a reform of the Senate.
I wish now to refer for a few minutes to
some observations made the other evening
by the honourable senator for Vancouver
(Hon. Mr. Farris) regarding the relationship
of the federal constitution or the amended
constitution, the British North America Act,
(No. 2) 1949, to the powers of the provinces,
particularly as respects proposed changes in
the Senate. I do not propose to argue with
the honourable gentleman, of all people, on
the theoretical implications of the recently
amended B.N.A. Act. The practical fact of the
matter, however, as reported in the proceedings of the conference of January, 1950,
between provinces and the dominion, is that
strong objections were expressed by the provinces to the amendment of the B.N.A. Act
as represented under the B.N.A. Act (1949)
No. 2. It was strongly represented at that
time that the provinces should have been
consulted before such action was taken, and
this representation was made so forcibly that
the Prime Minister gave definite undertakings
that the application of the B.N.A. Act (1949)
No. 2 would be held in abeyance pending the
production by the provinces of a better
method of amending the constitution. If
honourable senators are interested in reading
the statements, I would refer them to pages
46, 49 and 69 of the report of the proceedings
of the conference between the provinces and
the dominion of January last.
Representatives of the federal and provincial governments are now engaged in continuous conference, trying to devise such a
method. In so far as the B.N.A. Act clauses
affecting the Senate are concerned, the subsequent reports of the proceedings of the
conferences which have taken place amongst
the Attorneys-General of the different provinces, as a committee appointed by the main
conference last January to follow up these
discussions in detail, have shown that all of
the provinces except one insisted that no
change be made in any clause affecting the
Senate without unanimous consent of the
provinces in certain cases, and majority consent in others.
Hon. Mr. Davis: Will the honourable senator
permit me to ask a question on that very
point? Do you think the complexities of
amending our constitution would not be better
handled by a constitutional conference
between the provinces and the dominion? The
United States has held these conferences on a
federal and state basis on numerous occasions,
handling the question federally for the first
time in 1786.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I shal answer my honourable friend from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.

SENATE
Davis) in a moment when I corne to that stage
of my address. Right now I want again to
refer to the proceedings of the conference of
Attorneys-General, which was held in Quebec
last September. I would like to emphasize
that at this moment exemption from the application of the B.N.A. Act (1949) No. 2, in so far
as the Senate is concerned, has already been
claimed by all provinces except Saskatchewan.
It is fair ground to assume, therefore, that
exemption from the application of the
amended B.N.A. Act would be insisted upon
by the provinces, and it is impossible to think
that the federal government would contemplate action in this matter without the consent
of the provinces. I make that reference, not
in reply to the question raised by the honour.able senator from Vancouver South (Hon.
Mr. Farris) when I asked him a question the
other night, but rather as a practical commentary upon constitutional theory involved
in the B.N.A. Act.
The situation now, therefore, is that the
federal government, in conference with the
provinces, is trying to work out ways and
means of amending the B.N.A. Act. in so far
as possible to the satisfaction of all parties
concerned, rather than make any positive
recommendations as to amendments or the
substance of reforms or anything of that
kind. They are now exploring every possibility of finding ways and means of amending the constitution of Canada, in Canada,
without referring to the Imperial Parliament.
When these ways and means are agreed upon
it will be time enough to give consideration
to the detailed measures which might be
directed to Senate reform or changes of any
kind affecting the parliament of this country.
In the meantime I submit that it is neither
timely nor desirable for members of this house
to engage publicly in an inquiry upon the
subject of their positions or status as members
of the parliament of Canada. When the time
comes for dealing definitely with proposed
changes in the Senate or any part of the
constitution, it seems to me that it would be
appropriate for this chamber, if invited to do
so by those in charge of the conference, to
contribute its views through a special cornmittee of some kind, sitting in camera with
the members of that conference.
I refer now to the question raised by the
honourable senator from Winnipeg (Hon.
Mr. Davis), I would say that, when the time
came that a constitutional conference would
be advisable, consideration would have to be
given to what members would take part in
such a conference; but I think it would be
logical if both branches of parliament were
represented through special committees of

their own in dealing with any recommendations for constitutional amendments affecting
their status or functions.
I should like now to refer to something
else said by the honourable senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) in the
course of his very powerful, comprehensive
and spirited speech. I am sorry that he is
absent from the chamber by reason of an
attack of the flu, because I should like him
to be here to correct me if I misrepresent
anything be said. I refer to his statement on
page 119 of Hansard, where he was dealing
with partisanship, indepencence and convictions. At that juncture in his speech he was
swinging his claymore pretty freely, having
emerged from an imaginary contest with a
certain author named MacGregor Dawson,
and I think that possibly some of the feeling
that had been engendered during that experience was carried over into a sort of obiter
dictum on the question of partisanship, independence and convictions. I do not agree at
all with what he had to say in that connection. He was introducing as a guiding principle into this body a point of view in which
I shared very genuinely and extensively in
my time outside this chamber, that of viewing my party, right or wrong, as the only one
for me. Now, if I may say so, I believe that
such partisanship, as I have experienced it,
means an unreasoning partisanship and tends
to dwarf both convictions and independence.
I do not reflect for a moment upon the
sincerity of those who take that view, but
I do say that it does not coincide at all with
the judicial attitude of mind which should
be cultivated by members of this chamber
with respect to legislation, and which is
generally adopted by a member of the bench
in dealing with the law. I think that the
comparison of this body as a political court
of appeal with the appellate courts which
deal with cases before them without any suggestion of partisanship or prejudice is a good
one, and I think it is that point of view which
should prevail here. In saying that I recall
very definitely that when I was introduced
into this house and was honoured by being
asked by my revered and venerable late
leader, Senator Dandurand, to move the
Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne, he emphasized very strongly that I
should take as a cue to my remarks on that
occasion, and to my actions here later, the
fact that the rule in the Senate was one of
collaboration and co-operation rather than of
competition. That will, I am sure, recall to
the minds of many honourable members here
the incident that Senator Dandurand liked
to relate of his meeting, in the hall upstairs,
Senator Meighen, who had recently been

FEBRUARY 21, 1951
appointed to this house and named government leader here. Mr. Meighen greeted
him jubilantly and said: "Here is my opponent. I hope I am worthy of his steel."
Senator Dandurand's reply was: "My friend,
you are wrong on two counts. I am not your
opponent, and I am not worthy of your steel."
At that time, needless to say, Mr. Meighen
commanded a majority in this house. I have
always thought that Senator Dandurand, who
certainly did not lack the courage of his convictions, and who in his day had been quite
a partisan, was right in his point of view.
I also want to associate with that idea the
viewpoint of Sir Allen Aylesworth, our
venerated and venerable colleague, who is no
longer able to sit in his place here but whose
mind is still as strong as it was when he
addressed the Senate ôn this subject in 1932.
He said he would be willing to support legislation disfranchising members of the Senate
in general elections in order that the judicial
character of their position as members of this
chamber might be established beyond doubt.
Now, that may have been an extreme suggestion, and it certainly was never acted
upon, but it emphasizes the view which, it
seems to me, members of the Senate should
always carry with them. And I would humbly
suggest that the statements expressed here on
Monday night by my honourable friend from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) should be
placed alongside the judgment of men like
Sir Allen Aylesworth.
In concluding these remarks I should like
to mention one other function of the Senate.
I have referred to the observations of the
honourable leader of the opposition on trying
*to meet misunderstanding of the function of
the Senate as a branch of parliament. My
point here relates to the importance of unity
in this country, and the preservation of the
liberties which our people have enjoyed under
our system of government. In many ways
this Senate, whether it be reformed or not, is
a symbol of national unity in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: The very circumstances
in which the dominion was formed, in which
the Act of Confederation was framed, make
the Senate a symbol of national unity. The
great vision which the Founding Fathers had
in their minds was the development on the
northern half of this continent of a nation
which would be united regardless of race,
religion or other differences. Actuated though
they were by the pressure-what they thought
was the dangerous pressure-of enmity and
demoralizing factors across the border, the
agency that really more than any other
brought about confederation was the desire
80713-12

to preserve on the northern half of this
continent a country under the British crown,
As a device to .help bring that about, the
Senate was made the foundation stone, and
it symbolized the great ambition and aspiration of the Fathers of Confederation for a
united country under the name of the
Dominion of Canada.
Under the pressure of the economically
depressed thirties and the harrowing experiences of the war years, the strong trend
towards an increasing measure of bureaucratic influence in the federal administration
must have been observed by all of us during
the past ten years. We are all familiar with
the influences and indications of that development. Its chief characteristic is the expediting of legislative measures with a view to
planning and controlling our economy. Its
influence upon the executive branch of government is unmistakable; and in saying this
I do not for a moment suggest lack of ability
or industry on the part of the bureaucratic
members of our service. On the contrary,
they compare favourably with the outstanding
figures in the high ranks of civil service in
any country.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: But I have felt for
some time, and I am sure others share the
feeling, that their ways are not the ways of
parliaiinent. Their urge is sincerely enough
one of public service, to get things done which
they think are good for the people. But this
desire is too often accompanied by a certain
intolerance towards what seem to be the
delays involved in parliamentary procedure.
From my own experience and observation I
know that that attitude of intolerance is
greatly magnified in relation to the Senate.
We in the Senate have no apologies to make
for emphasizing our opposition to that trend
or for identifying ourselves as far as possible
in our committees and in this chamber, and
we are justified in resisting that trend at
every turn.
All the factions that fight outside the walls
of parliament, and that may seem to have
been influenced either by the Nazi or Communist urge to get things for themselves, care
nothing for parliament, liberty or democracy.
They know that the things they want to do
cannot be done in the parliamentary way.
Therefore, when all our talk about -constitutional theory is finished,, the test will be
simply this: Is the policy proposed in government action susceptible to the parliamentary
method? If it is not, the presumption is
overwhelmingly against it, unless we are
willing to sacrifice free institutions in order
to adopt it.

SENATE
My final words will be a quotation from a
little book entitled These Times, written by
Mr. J. A. Spender, one of the greatest political
writers and thinkers of the past hundred
years. Some years ago, at the suggestion of
the late Mackenzie King, and at his expense,
I had the privilege of circulating some 300
copies of this book among a number of his
political friends, including his following in
parliament at that time. This is what Mr.
Spender wrote:
So long as parliament exists it must do its business in its own way; and that way is inevitably the
way of gradualness. It is the instrument of argument and reason, which means that it must respect
minorities, give them opportunities for being heard,
and, so far as it can, adjust legislation to their
objections and even to their prejudices. This is a

very delicate art and undoubtedly requires the dull
virtues of patience and forbearance, and it is for
lack of these that so many parlianfents have made
shipwreck.

Whatever constitutional changes the future
may bring to the Senate of Canada, it can
have no higher destiny than to help preserve
that "delicate art" of democratic government.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators, I
move the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

Prayers and routine proceedings.
IMMIGRATION
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Turgeon, for Hon. Mrs. Wilson,
presented the second report of the Standing
Committee on Immigration and Labour.
The report was read by the Assistant Clerk
as follows:
In connection with the order of reference of February 20, 1951, directing the committee to examine
into the operation and administration of the Immigration Act, etc., the committee recommend that it
be authorized to print 1000 copies in English and
200 copies in French of its day to day proceedings,
and that Rule 100 be suspended in relation to the
said printing.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I
have no objection to the report, but I would
say that a very clear understanding was
reached with the leader of the government
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) that until the Easter
adjournment reporting services would not be
required, except to report the proceedings
of this house and those of the Divorce
Committee. That was a clear understanding,
arrived at after -consultation.
If this motion means that that committee
can start in now to call witnesses and have
their evidence reported, I am opposed to it.
Otherwise, all right. The Government Whip
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) was present when the
arrangement was made to report no other
committee than the Divorce Committee
between the opening of the session and the
Easter recess. The reason for the arrangement was that we have not enough reporters
to take care of other committees sitting at
the same time, and the cost of getting additional reporters is very heavy indeed.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: And also it is very
difficult to get them.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is practically impossible.
It is necessary that the evidence taken before
the Divorce Committee be transcribed as
promptly as possible, in order that bills
based on the evidence may be put through
the Senate and be sent over to the House of
Commons in time to give that house an
opportunity to consider them. The trouble
in the past has been that divorce bills have
been going in large numbers to the House of
80713-121

Commons in the last week or two of the
session, and that practice is unfair to honourable members over there.
At the beginning of the present session the
leader of the government here (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) proposed-and I must admit that
he did so at my suggestion-that we arrange
to finish our Divorce Committee work before
the Easter adjournment. There were two
reasons for that. In the first place, under
the system that has existed in the past, the
Chairman, Deputy Chairman and other members of the Divorce Committee have found
it impossible to attend important meetings of
certain standing committees. That is obviously unfair. It was thought that very little
legislation would be sent over here until
after Easter, and that if the divorce work
was through then the members of that committee would for the remainder of the session
be able to participate in the work of other
committees dealing with various important
measures. And the second reason for the
arrangement was the one I have already
mentioned, the shortage of reporters. The
Chief of our Reporting Branch has told us
that even if additional reporters were available the cost of obtaining them would be
prohibitive. I repeat that if this motion
implies that the Standing Committee on
Immigration and Labour intends to hold
sittings at which evidence is to be given
between now and Easter, I shall have to
vote against it.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I agree with my honourable friend opposite.
I think that the understanding was as he has
stated, and that our Divorce Committee's
sittings began much earlier this session than
in the past, in the hope that all the cases
would be dealt with before the Easter
adjournment. I should perhaps incidentally
make a brief comment now on the work that
the Divorce Committee has been doing. The
committee has been working extremely hard,
and I understand it has already got through
more than half the cases that are so far
ready for hearing. That strikes me as an
unusually good record of accomplishment for
three weeks.
I should think it could be easily arranged
with the Chairman of the Standing Committee
on Immigration and Labour (Hon. Mrs.
Wilson) to postpone meetings for the hearing
of witnesses until after the bulk of the
Divorce Committee's work has been completed. I do not know that there is any
urgency about the hearing of evidence which
it is desired to have brought before that
committee.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
it is quite possible that within a week or two
there may be occasional days when no cases

SENATE
are ready for hearing by the Divorce Committee. If so, the information can be obtained
ahead of time, for cases are set down two
weeks before they are heard, and should the
reporters have a few free days by reason of
lack of cases to be heard, they could perhaps
serve the Committee on Immigration and
Labour at that time.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Quite.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Honourable senators, I
presented the report on behalf of the chairman of the committee (Hon. Mrs. Wilson),
but I have not discussed the matter with her.
I would assume, however, that the committee will respect the understanding which has
just been outlined in this chamber. In that
event, I think no harm would be done by the
adoption of the report today.
I would point out that the Committee on
Immigration and Labour will have some very
important work to do during the current
session of parliament, and that arrangements
should be made at the earliest moment for
adequate reporting services to take care of
the needs of that committee. I repeat that
I am sure the chairman of the committee will
regard as sacred the arrangement agreed to
by the leader of the government.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Very well.
The motion was agreed to, and the report
was adopted.

PEACE TREATY WITH JAPAN
RETURN TO ORDER

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators, I
desire to file a return in answer to the inquiry
by the honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) with regard to Mr.
John Foster Dulles and a contemplated peace
treaty with Japan.

reports what is contrary to the fact, because
he no doubt did it in good faith, and only did
what many others have done. But after all,
it is an illustration of the reason why the
people of this country know very little about
the Senate of Canada. I do not complain for
myself, because I do not speak very often;
but except for speeches made by the two
leaders in the house very little publicity is
given to what goes on here. I regret that
such a situation bas come about, particularly
in view of the fact that so many good speeches
have been delivered recently on the motion
now before the bouse in relation to what we
might call the reform of the Senate. I have
noted that some newspapers which claim to
be national in scope have carried nothing in
their news columns about these very able
addresses.

Hon. Mr. Quinn: They apparently do not
like the subject.
Hon. Mr. Euler: As to the matter of general
publicity, the proceedings in the Senate are
either ignored entirely or receive very little
attention in the press. We are not perfect,
and may deserve criticism-even unfair
criticism may at times be all right, for it is
better to be criticized than to go unnoticedbut I do not like to read what is contrary to
the fact.
I have in mind one other point, which
perhaps the honourable leader opposite (Hon.
Mr. Haig) should bring up, as he mentioned
it in committee yesterday. I understand that

RADIO BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. Huggessen moved the third reading of Bill W, an Act to amend The Radio
Act, 1938.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
EXPORT AND IMPORT PERMITS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. S. S. McKeen moved the second reading of Bill W-2, an Act to amend The Export
and Import Permits Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the main
purpose of this bill is to extend the life of
the The Export and Import Permits Act for
a further five years, until 1956. The bill also
contains several minor amendments which
have been made necessary by changes in other
Acts. By one amendment the provision as to
the length of time within which Orders in
Council shall be published is deleted from the
Act, because The Regulations Act, 1950 covers
the matter of publication of all government
orders.
Under the Export and Import Permits Act
there was a list of goods which could not be
imported without a permit. By this method
importation from certain countries was
restricted in a roundabout way. There was
also a list of countries to which goods could
not be exported, without a permit. When
a manufacturer applied for a permit to export
a commodity to a particular country, the
officials would check to see whether that
country was on the restricted list for that
commodity. For instance, a permit would
not be granted for a steel product destined to
a country behind the Iron Curtain, but it
would be granted if the product was going to
the United States. The bill now makes provision for the establishment of a list of countries from which goods may not be imported
without a permit.
A new provision in the Act would authorize
the refusal of a licence to export or import
goods where the production, supply, distribution or use is restricted or otherwise regulated
under the authority of an Act of Parliament.
For instance, if the manufacturers of brushes

SENATE
in Canada could only use 50 per cent bristle
and 50 per cent hair, the provision I have
mentioned is to prevent an importer from
bringing in brushes made of pure bristle. It
is to make sure that Canadian manufacturers,
when restricted, will not be subject to unfair
competition by reason of the importation of
superior products. Super-de-luxe refrigerators may be manufactured in the United
States, and if our refrigeration people were
precluded from manufacturing that type of
merchandise, it would be unfair to allow the
American product to enter the country.
The bill would extend the life of the Export
and Import Permits Act for another five years.
There is nothing complicated about the bill,
and I would suggest that we might give it
third reading at the next sitting of the house.
If there is any objection, however, we could
send the bill to committee. I think the bill
is a simple one, and honourable senators can
read it over for themselves before the next
sitting.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Can the honourable
senator give the house some information about
the reason for extending the operation of this
Act until July 31, 1956, which is more than
five years away?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: I do not know whether
it was done arbitrarily, but I understand that
the five year extension was asked for because
the government did not think the present
emergency would be over before 1956. The
honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) is quite aware that parliament can
review any Act whenever it pleases, and if
anyone wants to bring in an amendment
before that periodHon. Mr. Euler: We cannot change this bill
but we can prevent it from going through.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: I think the good faith
of the government bas been shown in the past.
Up to the time of the Korean emergency practically all controls on imports were taken off,
even though the Act was in effect, and I do
not think we need worry about any abuse of
this measure once the emergency has passed.
Sorne Hon. Senators: Carried.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Honourable senators, I
think this is one of those bills which should
be closely scrutinized. I do not say that I
object to the provisions of the measure before
us, but I think it should be sent to committee,
where points which at first glance appear
rather obscure could be cleared up. It is
quite obvious that under the original Export
and Import Permits Act very wide powers
were given to the administration to control
the trade of this country. I am not saying

that that control may not have been necessary, but I feel that this is something which
parliament should scrutinize very closely.
If parliament, which includes this chamber as well as the House of Commons, tends
to give the executive large powers too lightly,
it may easily drift into the habit of doing
so. This would mean that the executive
would become more powerful and parliament
less influential. That is the principle upon
which I base my criticism of some of these
measures. It is all very well to say that
this measure will be a convenience to the
government. I sat in the government long
enough to know that it is a very nice thing
for the government to be able to do things
without reference to the elected representatives of the people; but after all, the members
of parliament are here as representatives of
the people, and I have no hesitation in stating that one of the primary functions of
parliament is to prevent any unnecessary
power passing from itself to the executive.
That is a principle to which I hold very
strongly.
It seems to me rather extraordinary to provide that this Act shall not
terminate for five years. When I raised
objection to this provision, the honourable
senator from Vancouver, who so lucidly
explained the bill, replied that at any time
within the next five years it was open to any
member of parliament to bring in a bill to
throw this one into the ash can. As a matter
of fact, legislation is not changed in that
way; and I for one think it would be better
to put a shorter period of time in this Act.
Then, if in two years' time the administration can make a case for the continuation of
the power, parliament can grant it.
I do not think our hands should be tied in
this way for five years, and I certainly do
not agreee with the suggestion that we might
dispose of this bill now. That is rather too
airy a fashion in which to adopt a very
important piece of legislation. I hope, therefore, that the bill will be referred to the
appropriate ýcommittee-I presume the Banking and Commerce Committee-where it can
be examined, and where those asking for
the passage of this legislation can appear to
justify the request they are making of
parliament.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Honourable senators,
I did not suggest in any airy fashion that this
bill be passed today. My proposal was that if
the bill were given second reading today
the house might see fit to give it third reading at the next sitting. The objection which
has been raised by the honourable senator
from Churchill is a serious one; and if the

FEBRUARY 22, 1951
bill is given second reading I shall certainly
move that it be referred to the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I be permitted one
further observation which I overlooked
before? The explanatory notes accompanying a bill sometimes state that the purpose
of a proposed change is to correct a grammatical error in existing legislation. When
legislation of this kind was brought to parliament in the first instance grammatical errors
surely could have been guarded against.
Grammatical errors may lead to interpretations which are different from what was
intended. I will repeat what I have sail on
one or two previous occasions, that some
measures are brought before parliament in
a pretty sloppy form.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Honourable senators,
in this case the object of the grammatical
corrections is simplification, and that would
tend to prevent misinterpretation of the law.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: In view of the provisions of clause 2 of the bill, which
substitutes a new section 6 for the present
section 6 and provides that no goods included
in a list established pursuant to subsection 1
of section 4, or no goods from a country
named in a list established pursuant to subsection 2 of that section, may be imported
except in accordance with a permit, I would
suggest to the sponsor of the bill (Hon. Mr.
McKeen) that the lists should be made available for examination in committee.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: The present Act provides that goods included in a certain list
cannot be imported without a permit. The
only new provision in this section is that no
goods may be imported from any country
named in a certain list, without a permit.
However, I shall see that the lists of goods
and countries, together with the regulations,
are available when the bill is before the
committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

how in its opinion the Senate may make its
maximum contribution to the welfare of the
Canadian people.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators, I think the first thing I should say in
discussing this resolution is a word to confirm
the statement that was read on Monday
evening by the honourable senator from St.
Jean Baptiste (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) on behalf
of the honourable leader of the house (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) with reference to my position
as seconder of the resolution. I did not
know that I was going to be called upon to
second the resolution until the leader had
spoken upon it, and I had no knowledge of
what he was going to say until he had made
his speech. Therefore I feel that, as the
leader himself said in his statement, I should
be at perfect liberty to make any suggestions
that may occur to me with regard to the
resolution. In other words, there has been no
plot between the leader and me with respect
to this particular resolution.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That sounds something
like what is often said in the Divorce
Committee.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Having made that
clear, I will go on to say that I have no
apologies whatever to make for seconding
this resolution. Let me read it:
That a Special Committee of the Senate be
appointed to inquire into, and report upon, whatever action in its opinion may be necessary or
expedient to enable the Senate to make its maximum contribution to the welfare of the Canadian
people.

It seems to me, honourable senators, that
that is a most innocuous resolution. After
all, the Senate of this country, like every
other institution, is a human institution.
Human institutions are always fallible; they
strive for, but never reach perfection. And
surely it is not only right, but from time
to time necessary, that we should take a
look at ourselves to see whether we are
performing properly the functions with which
we have been entrusted by the constitution

SENATE
another for this resolution, it seems to me that
it has been found in the excellent debate
to which we have listened. I do not like to
pick out a speech here and there, when all
have been so good, but I do think we had
exceptionally interesting contributions in the
speeches of the leader on the other side (Hon.
Mr. Haig), the senator from Toronto Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck), and the senator from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert), and in the really
magisterial address on Monday evening by
the senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris).
There was one thing said by my honourable friend from Ottawa with which I feel
bound to disagree. As I recall it-and he will
correct me if I am wrong-he said he felt
that it was inappropriate for this chamber
to consider questions relating to its own
reform during a period when the DominionProvincial Conference was continuing and
would have to deal with tht
matter. Now,
surely if Senate reform is to be one of the
constitutional changes considered by the
Dominion-Provincial Conference, it will be
very helpful to the conference to have the
views of this body, which, as was pointed out
so clearly by my honourable friend from
Vancouver South, can only be reformed with
its own approval. If we fail to state our
views the Dominion-Provincial Conference
might take an attitude sinilar to that which
my honourable friend from Ottawa has suggested we should take, and say that it will
do nothing about Senate reform until the
Senate itself has made a pronouncement upon
the matter. That possibility reminds one of
an old story about a terrible railway accident
in one of the Western states. It seems that
two trains crashed together at a railway
intersection, resulting in great loss of life and
damage to property, and that the state legislature, which was sitting at the time, immediately passed a law to prevent that sort of
thing from happening in the future. The law
read to this effect: When two trains are
approaching one another at an intersection,
each shall come to a dead stop, and neither
is to start again until the other has safely
crossed.

Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The question would
arise, who is to start?
So far as the debate on this resolution has
gone, I think it can be said that it has displayed a wide variety of views on a great
number of topics. There are some matters
upon which all who have so far spoken are,
I think, substantially in agreement, and I
shall deal briefly with those points of
general agreement first and consider the
disputed questions later.

The first, and I suppose really basic question when we come to consider constitutional
matters, is as to the need for a second
chamber. The general consensus of opinion
in this debate has been, I think, that a second
chamber is in a general way necessary for
the proper working of any national parliamentary system, and that it is particularly
necessary under the special circumstances
and conditions with which we in Canada
are faced.
Dealing first with the general question of
the necessity of a second chamber, I think we
can say that the work of every parliamentthat- is, the physical volume of what every
parliament is called upon to do, and the
broad diversity of the functions which the
people expect parliament to perform-is such
that it is physically impossible for one
chamber alone to deal with it all. That,
I think, is increasingly the case. The function of government in our national life has
had a tendency to increase in the past and
is continuing to increase today.
We have a rather striking visual illustration of that right here in Ottawa. Honourable
senators know that when confederation came
about in 1867 the whole of the public
business of this country, both legislative and
administrative, was carried on in three buildings-the East Block and the West Block,
which still exist, and the old Centre Block,

which housed the Senate and the House of
Commons chambers, and which bas been
replaced by the building in which we are
now sitting. As I say, in 1867 and for some
years after, the whole of Canada's public

business was carried on in these three buildings. Today, no matter in which direction
one goes through Ottawa and Hull, government buildings are mushrooming up everywhere. That gives some visual indication
of the extent to which government service
increases as years go by.
The only democratic country which I know
of that has a one-chamber system of parliament is the one referred to by the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck), namely, New Zealand, which bas
abolished its second chamber. But that abolition bas taken place so very recently that
I think it is impossible to tell what the results
will be, or to derive any benefit from the
experience of that country. So much for
the general question.
With regard to Canada, there are special
reasons-geographic and economic reasonswhy a second chamber is needed. Perhaps I
could put it this way: One house popularly
elected on the basis of population only is not
enough, by itself, to reflect the whole of the
national mind and national make-up of
Canada. As my honourable friend the leader

Hon. Mr. Haig: Just a minute. Is there a
much greater disproportion of the representation in this house than there is in the House
of Commons, where there are 193 Liberals, 40
Conservatives, 13 CCFers, and 10 Social
Crediters?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I believe that on any
basis my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Haig)
chooses to take the disproportion between the
members of the different parties in this house
is greater than that shown in the popular
vote, let us say, in the various provinces.
Hon. Mr. Howden: Does the honourable
senator think that the great disproportion of
political representation in this house has any
real effect on the decisions it renders?
Hon. Mr. Duff: No.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Whether it does or not,
I think the important thing is that in the
opinion of the public we are a partisan body,
and our reputation in this country is bound
to suffer because the public will not believe
that a legislative body which has a huge preponderence of one party will treat fairly the
views of those others who either are represented inadequately here, or who are not
represented at all.
Hon. Mr. Howden: But the country does
not necessarily suffer.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: Would you kill a
few off to get rid of them?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I should like to discuss
for a few minutes the reasons why this disproportion has arisen. I should like honourable senators to put themselves in the place
of the Fathers of Confederation, and consider
what their views were and what their experience was when they wrote the constitution.
There were two factors which faced them.
The first was that they were accustomed to
quick changes of government, and the second
was that they were accustomed to the twoparty system.
Hon. Mr. Davis: There was only Upper
Canada and Lower Canada, then, so that did
not affect the Maritimes.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Perhaps my honourable friend from Winnipeg is right in that
respect, but the political history of the
Province of Canada, as it was then called,
was one of very quick changes of government. The same was true of England, the
country to which the Fathers of Confederation
looked as an example. During the last century in England parties remained in power
for only a few years before being replaced
by parties of the opposite political persuasion. With that experience before them, I
am sure that when the Fathers of Confederation provided that senators should be nomin-

ated by the federal authority, they had in
mind that there would always be a twoparty system and a fairly quick turn-over of
government, with the result that at all times
there would be a fairly equitable representation here of the two great trends of politi-cal thought which existed at that time.
Their -anticipation was not realized, however, because the pattern of our political
history after Confederation worked out in a
different way, there were long periods during which one party remained in power.
The Conservative .party under Sir John A.
Macdonald and his successors-except for
one period when the Mackenzie administration was in office-was in power from 1867
to 1896. The Liberal party, under Sir
Wilfrid Laurier, held office from 1896 until
1911; and from 1911 until 1921 there was
the Conservative government of Sir Robert
Borden, followed by the Unionist administration.
The result was, I venture to
suggest, that towards the end of those
prolonged terms during which one political
party held office, a greater disproportion in
this chamber than the Fathers of Confederation ever anticipated.
Still less -could the Fathers of Confederation
have anticipated what has taken place today.
Not only has the two-party system broken
down in part, but we now have in this country
quite important bodies of public opinion
which of themselves can never form a government, and which, therefore under our
present system can never be represented in
this chamber.
Then, again, the Fathers of Confederation
could not have anticipated a condition of
affairs whereby the Liberal party would be in
office for sixteen years, during which-and
of course I am speaking in an entirely nonpartisan manner-that party would so gather
unto itself the entire political brains and
talent of the country as to make it seem
very unlikely that it will be divorced from
power before the next generation.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I do not think that
the Fathers of Confederation could have foreseen what has happened to this -chamber as
a result of the events which have occurrpd
in the political life of Canada.
It is rather interesting to ask oneself
whether the Fathers of Confederation would
have changed the method of appointing senators had they been able to foresee what has
happened in actual practice, and the question
arises whether we, the present generation,
should make changes in the composition of
this house to conform with these altered
conditions.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. King: Is it not within the power
of the executive to do just what you are
suggesting?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen:
Absolutely, and on
Monday night the honourable senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) pointed
out that it could be done, but that it never
has been done.
Hon. Mr. King: Yes, but it could be done,
and I think this should be brought out.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen:
Yes, certainly.
I have given a good deal of .consideration to
this question, and I support the honourable
senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) when he suggests that in the future
one-third of the members of this bouse should
be appointed by the provincial governments.
Hon. Mr. Duff:

Nonsense!

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I think a provision of
that kind would perforrn two useful functions.
In the first place, it would fulfil one of the
original purposes of confederation, which
was to give the provinces some sort of
representation in the central government. In
the second place-and I think this is more
important-it would provide representation
in this chamber for currents of public opinion,
which at the present time have no chance
of expressing their views in this chamber.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Would you recommend
that the provinces make life appointments to
the Senate?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen:
I shall discuss that
point in a few minutes.
I foresee another advantage in this proposal.
In my opinion no harrn whatever would be
done by having a little competition in the
making of appointments to this chamber.
Hon. Mr. Baird:

I think you have it now.

Hon. Mr. Bouffard: There is quite a bit
of competition at the present time.
Some Hon. Senators:

Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. Hugessen:
I think that if the
provincial governments were appointing a proportion of the members of the Senate they
would exercise their utmost discretion in
order to appoint the best men possible to
represent their views in this house. To a
certain extent also I think it would have the
effect of spurring the federal government to
maintain-I shall not say improve-the high
calibre of appointments which it has already
made.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I interrupt the
honourable senator? I had intended to cover
one aspect of that question yesterday, and
I am sorry that I omitted to do so. In view
of the obviously careful consideration that

my honourable friend has given to this question, I should like to ask him if he has considered the problem of denominational and
geographical factors in relation to direct
provincial representation. There is a basic
assumption that the Senate membership
represents the regional and sectional interests
of the country. Over the past eighty years
the denominational and geographical factors
entering into the selection of appointees from
the various provinces have constituted a real
problem, and I think it bears directly on this
proposal.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I quite agree that it
does. There would be some difficulty, but I
think that with a little good will between the
dominion and the provinces the balance would
be retained.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: May I ask a question?
Hon Mr.
questions.

Hugessen:

Yes.

I

welcome

Hon. Mr. McKeen: Is it your idea that persons appointed here by the provincial governments should represent their own provinces,
or should they be expected to act always in the
light of what they consider the best interests
of Canada as a whole?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I think they would
represent Canada as a whole.
While making his proposal, which I am now
supporting, the honourable senator from Vancouver South was interrupted by what I
regarded as a very interesting and pertinent
question put by the honourable gentleman
from Margaree Forks (Hon. Mr. MacLennan).
The question was wh ther the system of
partial provincial nomination would not result
in provincial pressure groups. That caused
me to ask myself what would actually have
happened if that systern had been in existence
during the last few years, and I attempted to
work out an answer. I took the list of senators from the various provinces as at the 31st
of January, 1945, and I assumed that all the
vacancies which existed at that time and
which have occurred since had been filled,
and that one-third of the senators appoinited
to fill those vacancies had been named by the
governments of the provinces concerned. I
also made the assumption, which I think is a
fairly safe one, that these governments would
have nominated to this house persons of the
same political stripe as themselves.
The result, over the last six years, would
have been as follows: four new Conservative
senators frorn the province of Ontario; two,
or at most three Union Nationale senators
from the province of Quebec; two Social
Credit senators from the province of Alberta,
and one C.C.F. senator frorn the province of

FEBRUARY 22, 1951
Saskatchewan. That is, provincial governments, not of Liberal complexion, would have
nominated a total of ten appointees over the
last six years.
Now, honourable senators, I cannot think
that that is a very revolutionary sort of
thing. I cannot conceive that ten senators
would be sufficient to constitute provincial
pressure groups. In practice what would have
happened? The four senators named from
Ontario would obviously have joined the
party led so ably by my honourable friend
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) and, I am sure,
would have been accepted by him as a very
valuable addition to and reinforcement of his
ranks. The one C.C.F. senator from Saskatchewan and the two Social Credit senators
from Alberta could not by any stretch of the
imagination have been expected to form
provincial pressure groups by themselves.
Hon. Mr. Wood: There are four Conservatives from Saskatchewan, so there would have
only been one Liberal from that province.
Hon Mr. Hugessen: I am afraid I do not
follow my honourable friend's point.
Hon. Mr. Haig: He says that if your proposal
had been carried out there would have been
now only one Liberal from Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Seeing that the CCF
has been in power in Saskatchewan for six
or seven years, I think it is entitled to
representation in this house, even though
that might temporarily mean only one Liberal
representative of the province here.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: But four of the present
senators from Saskatchewan are Conservatives.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: My point is that if
one-third of the vacancies that have occurred
in the last six years had been filled by provincial nomination, Saskatchewan would now
have one CCF representative here and one or
two Liberals.
Hon. Mr. Haig:

One Liberal.

Hon. Mr. McKeen: So Saskatchewan would
have had only one Liberal senator, but four
Conservatives.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Well, would there not
have been a more equitable representation
from the province of Saskatchewan?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: It might not have been
more equitable.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Judging by the conversations that are going on around the
house, I seem to have given my honourable
friends a good deal of food for reflection.
I want to refer to what was said a few
minutes ago by my honourable friend from

Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner). The honourable senator from Vancouver South (Hon.
Mr. Farris) suggested on Monday evening
that the provincial nominees should be
appointed for a fairly short term. I do not
know that I entirely agree with that. I
think that their appointment should be for a
time at least long enough to enable them to
be entirely independent. Their term should
not be so short'that they would be constantly
looking to the provincial government which
appointed them for reappointment at the end
of it.
Hon. Mr. Horner:
If the provincial
nomination system is tried at all, why should
not the term of the appointees be the same
as that of all other senators? I should think
any other system would be impossible.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I should think a ten
year term would be sufficient.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: How would appointment for the life of the parliament be?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I am willing to consider any method by which this Senate can
be made more representative of the public
opinion of the country. And I suggest to
honourable senators that it ,is no use to
pretend that there is not a vast deal of
criticism of this house precisely on the basis
that it is not as representative as it should be.
Hon. Mr. Baird: There would be criticism,
anyway. The public is always criticizing.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: And I think that in
this case the criticism is justified. I have
tried to give my reasons for feeling as I do,
but of course honourable senators may
disagree with me.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: May I ask the honourable senator a question?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. ,Beaubien: Suppose that the
Liberal party, which has been in power for
a long time, were re-elected at the next
election and continued to appoint senators,
would those appointees not represent public
opinion in Canada?
Hon. Mr. Burke: Right.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Seeing that the government could continue in office only if
re-elected by the people, would its appointees
to the Senate not represent public opinion?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: They would represent
a majority of public opinion. But does my
honourable friend seriously suggest that if
this house were to become entirely Liberal,
as it is likely to do within a few years, it
would really represent the people of Canada?
I do not believe it would. That is precisely
the criticism which I think a great many

SENATE
people are justifiably making against this
house, and will continue to make.

I think

we should realize that and do what we can
to learn how that condition can be changed.

Hon. Mr. Quinn: Will my honourable friend
pardon an interjection? That would also be
the case if there were a general election and
it resulted in a reversal of the party arrangement as it is today.

Hon. Mr. Duff: Quite right.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I did not quite follow
my honourable friend's remark.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: If after a general election
there was an overwhelming Conservative
majority in the other house, and that continued for a period of time, this body as it

would then become would not reflect public
opinion.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: My honourable friend
is quite right.
Now I come to perhaps the most contro-

versial question of all.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Before my friend leaves the
point under discussion, may I ask him
whether he can point to any record since
Confederation which shows that when the two
houses of Parliament were of different poli-

tical persuasion that the Senate so opposed
legislation which came to it that the government went to the country on that issue? If
there is such an instance, I should like to hear
about it.

Hon. Mr. Duff: That is a sensible question.
Hon. Mr. Haig: So that I will not be misunderstood, I may add that in 1919 both
houses had a Conservative majority, and this
house saw fit to amend legislation which came
to it.

Since I came here this house

has

become of Liberal complexion, and it has
amended legislation from the other house. But

I can find no record of an instance when the
other house was so irked by amendments

from the Senate that it made an issue of the
matter and went to the people on it.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I quite agree with my
honourable friend. But what does he deduce
from that observation?

Hon. Mr. Haig: Why be afraid of this house
being contrary in politics to the other house?

I am not afraid of it.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I did not say that I
objected to it being contrary in politics to the
other house. What I have tried to show was
its tendency to become so overwhelmingly
one-sided that the various currents of public
opinion are not represented here.

Hon. Mr. Haig: My friend from Provencher
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) asked a question, and it
was not answered.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Does my friend not think
it possible for a man, upon entering this
chamber, to divest himself of all political
opinions so far as parties are concerned?
Hon. Mr. Duff: Pretty nearly.
Hon. Mr. Haig: He does.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I suppose that would
be possible, but it is difficult for one to get
away from the habits and feelings of a
lifetime.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The same principle would
For

instance, a Conservative government appoints
Conservative lawyers to the Bench and a
Liberal administration appoints Liberals; but
after a lawyer is elevated to the Bench he
acts in a completely non-partisan manner.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I agree with my
honourable friend that for the most part we
as senators act in a non-partisan way, but
I assert that in the face of public criticism
we cannot maintain an almost one-party
house, as the Senate is today, and that such
a house has not the force and effect of one
that represents equitably the general opinion
of the country.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I think that is true.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I come now to the
last point which I want to discuss-as to
whether the membership of this house is
too old. The remedy most commonly suggested for that condition is an age limit of
say seventy-five years for retirement from
senatorship. The question of over-age of
senators is one of the complaints most
commonly heard against this house throughout the country. I am going to take the
unpopular stand-I realize that with the
exception of my leader it is unpopular
amongst the honourable gentlemen who have
spoken-and say to the house that I am a
firm and convinced supporter of an age limit
of seventy-five years for members of the
Senate.
An Hon. Senator: Hear, hear.
Hon.. Mr. Hugessen: I disagree with the
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) and the senator from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris).
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Would my friend combine with his suggestion of an age limit, a
limitation as to term of office, subject to

objection to the Senate, if any objection is
well founded, is that we sit here for life.

position, why should we not make ourselves

judges?
Hon. Mr. McIntyre: Judges of the Supreme
Courts of the provinces do not retire at

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I have been talking
for a few minutes about the civil servants
and the judges who are under our control.
An Hon. Senator: Let me ask a questionHon. Mr. Hugessen: I have had a great
number of questions, and I am trying to
follow the trend of my argument. I hope my
honourable friends will let me go on without
further interruption.
Let me point out to the bouse that the
vast majority of the Canadian people are
under the obligation to retire at one age or
another. I happen to be a governor of McGill
University. The professors there, and those
of every university in Canada, as well as, I
understand, the teachers, have to retire at the
age of sixty-five years. In commerce and
industry hundreds and thousands of our
fellow citizens-and the numbers are increasing-are subject to pension plans and to
retirement at the age of sixty-five or seventy.
In our public legislation we ourselves
recognize that very thing. Why is it that we
provide for old age pensions at seventy? It
is because we realize that the generality of
"the common man" bas come to the end of
an active working life at that age. Why
should we not apply to ourselves the same
rule that we apply ta the people of the rest
of Canada? Honcurable senators, I plead
with you. What we have done through this
special privilege-for which I do not blame
anybody, but which has grown up over the
course of years-is to set a barrier between
ourselves and the common people of Canada,
the people whom we should represent in this
chamber.
An Hon. Senator: No.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: An honourable senator
says "No."
Hon. Mr. Duff: Yes, it is absolute nonsense.
You don't know the common people like I do.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The great majority of
the honourable senators within sound of my
voice have been at one time or another
elected representatives of the peopleHon. Mr. Duff: Quite right.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: -either in the House
of Commons or a provincial legislature or a
municipal council. In the capacity of elected
representatives they were responsible to the
electors who placed them in office for the

views which they expressed in public. May I
suggest to my honourable friends who have
had that experience that they recall for a
minute or two the positions which they once
held. Let them forget for a moment these
four walls by which we are surrounded, and
reflect that in reality we are considering this
matter in the presence of the whole electorate
of Canada. I defy any honourable senator to
get up and tell us that if this question were
submitted to a vote of the people of Canada,
they would not vote overwhelmingly for the
abolition of this special privilege.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Nonsense!
Hon Mr. Hugessen: Why would they do
that? Because they themselves are subject to
these rules of enforced retirement, and they
see no reason-and I see no reason-why we
ourselves should not be subject to the same
rules.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Resign, if you want to.
Hon. Mr. Petten: You can resign.
Hon. Mr. Duff: I am here because the
people want me here. If any member is not
satisfied, let him resign.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: A number of honourable
members have said in the course of this debate
that it is a great honour to sit here as one of
the representatives of the people. I agree.
I take second position to no man in my
appreciation of the great honour of being a
member of the Senate of Canada, but I ask
my honourable colleagues to believe and to
think that we should not abuse that privilege,
that we should make an end of these conditions of special privilege which we of this
chamber enjoy, and which, I am convinced,
Canadians no longer either approve of or
understand. I am in favour of this reform,
and I believe that the provision of an age
limit, particularly if it were suggested by ourselves, would do more than anything else to
abate criticism of this house and increase the
respect and esteem in which we are held by
our fellow men.
Perhaps at this point I should make a statement which has been made by nearly all
speakers in this debate, and say that I have
already taken a great deal more time than I
had expected to take.
One thing further that I wish to say bas to
do with the resolution itself. I am inclined
to agree with the honourable senators who
have criticized the proposal in the resolution
to set up a special committee, under these
circumstances, on the ground that a special
committee would serve no useful purpose;
and that it is not any committee, but the
whole Senate, that should determine important matters of this kind. I suggest that the
resolution might well be withdrawn.

FEBRUARY 22, 1951
I have been contemplating what the Senate
might do in connection with this resolution.
It so happened that a few months ago I was
re-reading that monumental work, Morley's
Life of Gladstone, and I came across an
incident in Gladstone's life, in 1868, which
seemed, to me to afford a precedent which
we 'night very well follow now. At that time
Gladstone was out of office and Disraeli was
Prime Minister. The great question which
was then rising in the public mind had to do
with the disestablishment of fthe Church of
Ireland. As honourable senators know, the
Anglican Church of Ireland was the established Church of Ireland at that time, even
though the vast majority of the inhabitants
of that country were Roman Catholics. What
did Gladstone do about that important question? He submitted to the House of Commons
three resolutions as the basis upon which he
proposed to reform the Irish Church. Those
resolutions were submitted to the House of
Commons, were carried, and later formed the
subject matter of legislation when Gladstone's
own government came into power. It seems
to me that we might take advantage of that
precedent, and as the result of our present
deliberations adopt a series of resolutions as
to what reforms we think should be envisaged
in this house. I have written out very briefly,
without any great consideration, the type of
resolutions which I think it might be advisable for the Senate to consider and vote upon
after the resolution now before us has been
withdrawn.
I would suggest that the first resolution
might read like this:
That the system of nomination of senators, rather
than that of direct election, should be continued as
the best system in the interests of the Canadian
people.

I would make the second resolution very
general:
That
devised
in the
opinion

it is highly desirable that some system be
for a more fair and balanced representation
Senate of the various currents of political
in the country.

The third resolution might read:
That future appointments to the Senate should
not be made for life, but should be made subject
to retirement at the age of seventy-five years at
the latest.

I would suggest that if any of these resolutions were adopted it would mean that the
Senate would be on record as to what it thinks
should be done at the present time about the
serious and important questions which the
present resolution has placed before us.
Sone Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Paterson: Honourable senators, I
wonder if it would be in order for the
honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) to read now the oath that we
all took when we first came into this
chamber?
Hon. Mr. Quinton: Does the honourable
senator from Inkerman intend that the three
resolutions which he has just read should
form an amendment to the motion which is
now before this house?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: No. The motion of the
honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson) is
still before us, and it will remain before us
until the debate has been concluded by the
reply of the leader. I am merely suggesting
that he should withdraw this resolution and
substitute resolutions of the kind I have
mentioned.
Hon. Mr. Baird: Do I understand that there
was no collusion between the leader of the
government and the speaker of this afternoon?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Collusion?
Hon. Mr. Baird: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Agreement.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I knew nothing about
what the leader was going to say, and he
knows nothing about what I intended to say
or what I have said this afternoon.
Hon. Mr. McIntyre: Honourable senators,
what I intended to say when the honourable
gentleman
from
Inkerman
(Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) was speaking was that when I was
addressing the house the other night the
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) was
good enough to put me straight on a misstatement I made. My honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) has said that civil servants
are forced to retire at sixty-five, and that
county court judges and judges of the
Supreme Court of Canada are retired at
seventy-five, but that judges of the Supreme
Courts of the provinces are not retired at

iseventy-five.

Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: That is correct.

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes, that is right.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Honourable senators,
on behalf of the honourable senator from
Kootenay East (Hon. Mr. King), I move the
adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday,
February 27, at 8 p.m.

MIGRATORY BIRDS CONVENTION BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. McDonald presented the report
of the Standing Committee on Natural
Resources on Bill V, an Act to amend the
Migratory Birds Convention Act.

The report was read by the Clerk Assistant
as follows:
The Standing Committee on Natural Resources, to
whom was referred Bill V, an Act to amend the
Migratory Birds Convention Act, having in obedience to the order of reference of the 19th of February, 1951, examined the said bill and now beg
leave to report the same without any amendment.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: With leave, I move the
third reading of the bill now.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: Honourable senators,
when the bill was before the house on the
motion for second reading the honourable
gentleman from Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr.
Isnor) asked a question which, with leave of
the Senate, I should like to answer at this
time.
The information which I have received
from the Honourable Robert H. Winters,
Minister of Resources and Development, is
as follows:
The Official Report of Debates of the Senate
records that in the Senate on the evening of the
19th of February, 1951, Honourable Senator Isnor
inquired of you if any study has been made with
a view to permitting fishermen, particularly in Nova
Scotia, to protect their own interests by killing birds
that harmo fishing equipment.
Senator Isnor did not name the kind of birds
that he had in mind. The language used makes it
seem likely that he was referring to cormorants,
aquatic birds of which two different species occur
along the Atlantic coast of Canada. Cormorants
sometimes become entangled in fishermen's nets.
They are not protected by the Migratory Birds
Convention Act.
If Senator Isnor's inquiry referred to birds
protected by the Migratory Birds Convention Act,
such as gulls or diving ducks, some of which eat
certain fish, although they seldom damage fishing
equipment, the answer is that legal provision for
the relief of fishermen is made and that appropriate
studies are carried out from time to time, as
required.

Subsection (2) of Section 4 of the Migratory Birds
Convention Act provides that the Governor in
Council may make regulations for various purposes,
one of which is stated, in clause (d), as follows:
"(d) for the granting of permits to kill or take
migratory game, migratory insectivorous or migratory non-game birds, or their nests or eggs."
Sections 36 to 40 inclusive, of the current regulations under the Migratory Birds Convention Act,
provide for issuing permits of this type when protected birds are doing serious damage. When a
request for a permit is made, it is the practice to
investigate the local situation, if possible, before a
permit is issued. It is realized that the matter
may be urgent and therefore every endeavour is

department has a small number of scientifically
trained men scattered across Canada who are
prepared to handle requests of this kind. They are
aided, when necessary, by assistant officers or by
members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
The investigating officers make their special knowledge and experience available to the parties complaining and advise them as to the best way to deal
with the situation.
Investigations of this type have been carried out
on both coasts of Canada. An extensive investigation of the economic status of the herring gull was
made at Grand Manan, New Brunswick, in 1949.
Investigations of the economic status of mergansers
and other ducks, with special reference to fish
resources, have been made in British Columbia.
This department and the Department of Fisheries
are carrying on on the Miramichi river, New
Brunswick, a joint special investigation of the
relations between mergansers and salmon.

Hon. Mr. Isnor: I wish to thank the honourable senator from Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr.

The fishermen along the shores of Nova Scotia
will, I am sure, appreciate having these facts
on record.

THE SENATE AND ITS WORK
MOTION-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday,
February 22, the adjourned debate on the
motion of Hon. Mr. Robertson for the appointment of a special committee to inquire into
and report upon how in its opinion the
Senate may make its maximum contribution
to the welfare of the Canadian people.
Hon. J. H. King: Honourable senators, I
enter this debate with some hesitancy. It will
be remembered that on April 27 of last year,
the esteemed leader of the government (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) moved a resolution suggesting
that a special .committee of this house be
appointed to review the constitution and
functions of the standing committees of the
Senate, and to make recommendations to
facilitate the business of the Senate. The
purpose of the resolution was to ascertain
whether Senate committees could not per-.
form a more ,useful service. That resolution
motion was of interest, and the motion was
properly made; but in speaking to the resolution, the leader stated that it was his intention
to come before the Senate this year and, on
his own responsibility, make definite proposals for Senate reform.

SENATE
Honourable senators, I have had a fairly
long experience in public life and in parliamentary affairs, and I took exception to that
statement. If the house will bear with me,
I shall briefiy outline my experience in the
public life of Canada, because, as honourable
senators know, as we grow older we learn the
value of experience, for it teaches us the
need for caution in our daily activities, and
how to avoid mistakes.
I first had the honour of being elected to
the provincial legislature in 1903, and was
elected again in 1907. I did not contest the
election of 1910.
Hon. Mr.
Columbia?

Haig:

That

British

Hon. Mr. King: Yes. At that ýtime I thought
I would retire from politics; but a few days
after the dissolution of the federal parliament
in 1911 I was in Ottawa, and Sir Wilfrid
Laurier, who was then Prime Minister, sent
for me and said he would like me to stand
as a candidate for the federal constituency of
Kootenay. I agreed and was duly nominated
at a convention held in Nelson. I prosecuted
the campaign as vigorously as I could, helped
by my friends, in the party, but I was
cefeated. I may say, however, that of the
nine elections I have contested that was the
only defeat I suffered.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. King: I am very proud of that
record, not because of anything I personally
have accomplished in public life, but because
T obtained the support of many loyal men and
women who believed in the principles that
our party was advocating at that time.
After my defeat in 1911 J thought it would
be well for me to confine myself to my profession-which I love very much, and in
which I enjoyed some success-but in 1915
ny friends in the constituency of Cranbrook
requested me to be a candidate again in the
provincial field. I accepted nomination, and
in the election of 1916 was once more
successful. I was asked by the then premier,
Mr. Brewster, to join his government, and I
accepted the invi'tation and became Minister
of Public Works for British Columbia. Following Mr. Brewster's death, I continued in
office under the premiership of the Honourable John Oliver, and thus I had the experience of serving in the provincial government
under two great leaders.
In December 1921 the Honourable Mr.
King, who was then forming a federal
cabinet, asked me to join his government, and
I acquiesced. The government was formed
on the 29th of December of that year but I
delayed taking my oath of office until I
consulted with Mr. Oliver and my other

colleagues in British Columbia. In those days
we had not the long distance telephone and
other rapid communication facilities that we
have today. I came to Ottawa early in
January, 1922, and was sworn in as Minister
of Public Works. As I had not been a
candidate in the general election, it was
necessary for me to seek a constituency in
British Columbia. I was opposed, and there
was a by-election, in which I was successful,
and I entered the House of Commons in
March, 1922. I remained in Mr. King's cabinet, administering the Department of Public
Works, until 1926.
In that year the government was defeated
in the House of Commons, and Mr. Meighen
an administration and promptly
formed
appealed to the country. Mr. King was again
returned to office. He then asked me if I
would accept another portfolio, that of
Soldiers' Civil Re-Establishment and Health.
I did so, and I continued to hold that portfolio until June 1930, when I was appointed
to this honourable chamber. This is my
twenty-first year as a senator.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. King: Upon the death of Senator
Dandurand it fell to my lot, in a quite ordinary way, to be asked by the Prime Minister
to act as government leader in the Senate.
Mr.
Honourable
the
We all respected
Dandurand greatly.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. King: On the morning that he took
ill his friend, the late Senator Beaubien of
Montarville, who was in the hotel with him,
communicated with me on his behalf, asking
that I adjourn the Senate that day over the

moved the adjournment until the following
Tuesday. On the way to the funeral which
was at Montreal, I suggested to the Prime
Minister that he should give some thought to
naming someone to carry on as leader in the
Senate. He said, "Well, we shall take time to
think it over, but you carry on next week."
Shortly afterwards I was asked to take the
oath of office as a minister, and I was given
the opportunity and the great honour of continuing as representative of the government
here and leader of the Senate. I accepted, and
held that office from 1942 to 1945. I found
my duties onerous, but they were interesting
and I liked them. However, when attending
the San Francisco Conference in 1945 I suggested to Mr. King, that if his government
were returned after the then impending election it would be better for him to nominate as
government leader in the Senate someone who
during the parliamentary recesses lived close
to Ottawa, and possibly a younger man than I.

FEBRUARY 27, 1951
In all I have had thirteen years' experience
in the Legislature of British Columbia, during
six of which years I was a minister, followed by nine years in the House of Commons, as a minister, and twenty-one years
in the Senate-four of them as minister without portfolio, representing the government
here. That is a total of nineteen years of
ministerial responsibility, and forty-four years
of service in the provincial and federal parliaments. I am naturally rather proud of that
record, not on account of my accomplishment,
but more particularly because I have enjoyed
the confidence of the majority of the people
in my constituency, whose loyalty to and
interest in the Liberal party and myself made
it possible for me to give this service.
I consider that I was fortunate in having
the experience, both in the provincial and the
federal fields, of being asked to join leaders
who had been successful at the polls and
were given the responsibility of forming new
governments-in the provincial fieldi, the
direction to form a government being given
by His Honour the Lieutenant Governor, and
in the federal field by His Excellency the
Governor General. Experience has shown
me what a difficult task faces a new leader,
especially a new federal leader, in assembling
a group of men for cabinet appointment. In
accordance with the British practice which
we follow here, he has the sole responsibility
of selecting his ministers. The fulfilment of
that responsibility requires great courage and
foresight, and good judgment. The leader
must be one who during his period in opposition has gained the confidence of the people
of the country, and succeeded in persuading
them to express that confidence at the polls.
'He has the duty of bringing together a group
of men from the scattered places of Canada,
and of formulating and co-ordinating policies
on which they can agree.
During a campaign the successful party's
policy must have been preached to the electorate and it must have been endorsed by
them. But the policy of a government is made
from day to day in the conference chamber.
As some of my honourable friends here
know, there are debates, sometimes serious
debates, about departmental policy, or about
something which does not accord with the
general policy as defined in the campaign.
On such occasions the leader and his colleagues have to exercise their best judgment
and be willing to conciliate in order to arrive
at a conclusion. Members of the Liberal
party, of the Conservative party, and of the
CCF, know that sometimes it is necessary
for individuals to make concessions, so that
there may be that iparty solidarity which
the people respect. Unanimity within the
cabinet on any matter of policy is an oltd

British tradition, which has been adopted in
Canada. This unanimity must be expressed
not only publicly but privately. Experience
shows that nothing is more detrimental to a
government than indiscreet gossip or a
whispering campaign indicating disagreement
or misunderstanding between the Prime
Minister and some members of his cabinet.
Many honourable members here know that
gossip of that kind is often quite unreliable,
but that does not iprevent it from being
widely believed and thereby doing great
harm. We in this chamber have greater
liberty than is enjoyed by members of the
other house or of the legislatures in Canada.
We are not directly responsible to the people,
although the one on whose recommendation
each of us here was appointed, was at the
time of the appointment responsible to public
opinion. We have been recognized and given
an opportunity to come to this chamber; but
it is not intended that we should be subject
to the same discipline as are the members
of the House of Commons or of other public
bodies throughout Canada. We know that
discipline must be rigid amongst the members
of the other house.
For that reason the various parties hold
caucuses. There are in the other house not
only ministers, but members, and every
member, regardless of party, must carry out
the general party policy, otherwise his usefulness to the party is at an end. If he
persists in going against party policy his lot
becomes an unhappy one, and as a rule his
political career is finished. The principle
behind the correlating of the ideas of the
members of a political party by meeting in
caucus is one which may be availed of in
all walks of life, such as in church management, in labour organizations, in business,
and in other organized effort throughout the
country. It even applies to family life, and
if there is disloyalty to it, the family is
destroyed.
I had an experience in this connection
which I may be permitted to relate to the
house. There are in the world today forces
that would destroy the precepts and other
things which we think are worth fighting
for. I recall. that, as whip for the Liberal
opposition in the provincial legislature, I had
to do with a group of seventeen members of
our party and some six or seven independent
members. I think that at that time there
were about twenty or twenty-one government members. My job was to try to interest
the independent group in the policies of the
opposition, and if possible to get them to
concur in amendments which we proposed
making to government legislation. In the
interests of the people as we thought, we

170

SENATE

were desirous of ousting the government. I
talked to the leader of that independent
group, who was a very able man and a fine
speaker, and he said to me: "King, do you
not understand us". I asked him what he
meant by that remark, and he replied in
these words: "Until the Christian Bible is
taken from the homes and the Liberal party
disappears, we cannot succeed". What he said
then has since proven to be true.
I perhaps have gone too far in relating
my personal experiences; but what I have
said has been said-should I in any way
disagree with my esteemed leader-because
of experiences which I have had.
On one occasion last year our leader here
indicated the desirability of certain reforms
in the handling of committee work I am
pleased to see that he has succeeded in his
objective to the extent of getting the divorce
work started early in the session I congratulate him on it. I wish also to compliment the Chairman of the Divorce Committee
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine), who at great sacrifice to
himself has agreed to continue his chairmanship of that committee. I understand that
some of our most prominent lawyers have
been drafted for work on that committeeHon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. King: -and are today fulfilling
what is not only a duty, but part of their
responsibility as members of this body.
The leader suggested last year that, in
view of the early bringing down of the
budget, committees set up for the purpose
would find useful employment in going over
the estimates and calling before them ministers and deputy ministers to explain certain
items. My long experience in parliament
caused me to take exception to that suggestion. I pointed out that as a rule the estimates do not come down as early in the
session as they did last year. But if it is the
decision of the Senate to have one committee,
or more than one, consider the various estimates, I have no strong objection to that
procedure. I would, however, point out that
a minister goes through a difficult period
following the opening of a session of parliament. Many questions are asked and resolutions moved by the members of the house,
and they require the careful attention of the
minister concerned, and his departmental
staff. It is only after the budget has been
brought down and the financial and general
policy of the government has been declared,
that a minister .can heave a sigh of relief,
for then the work of parliament proceeds in
a more orderly manner.
In 1943 I discussed with Mr. King, the then
Prime Minister, the fact that the Senate had
been asked at half-past eleven or twelve

o'clock on the evening of the last day of
the session to confirm the expenditure
of some billions of dollars, and I said that
I did not want to see the house put in
that position again. I suggested that a
special committee of the Senate be set up to
deal with the estimates; or, if it was thought
advisable, that I would move to revive the
Finance Committee, which had served a
useful purpose during the First World War,
so that ministers and deputy ministers could
be called before it to explain more particularly large war expenditures. The resolution
proposed was broad enough to allow any
member to indicate his desire for an explanation of any certain estimates. That plan
was followed until 1945.
I am not pressing my views on this question, honourable senators; but, as a former
minister in the House of Commons, I repeat
that the opening of a session is a tense time
for the ministers, because the members of
the other house have the right to ask questions relating to the administration of the
various departments. I do not know what
practice is now followed by the government,
but in my day it met an hour before the house
assembled, and among the first things to be
discussed were the more serious questions
which had been addressed to various ministers, and the readiness or otherwise of the
ministers to answer them. It was important
that answers should be prepared with great
care; if a minister's reply was careless, or
indefinite, further questions would certainly
be asked of him.
As I say, during the early part of the
session the ministers and their departmental
officials are under great strain; but once the
budget bas been introduced and the financial
policy of the government declared, there is
an easier feeling in the House of Commons,
and parliament settles down to discuss and
deal with in an orderly manner the matters
which come before it. I will not say any
more on this matter, but I invite our friend to
consider the other fellow a little.
Any citizen has a right to question any
item in the estimates, and I believe it would
be helpful to the government if, from the
membership of this house, we formed a
committee of say twenty-five or thirty-large
enough to avoid the necessity of secretaries
running around to obtain a quorum for
various committees. This committee should
include the leader of the government, the
leader of the opposition and such aggressive
members of this chamber as are sufficiently
interested in the work of the house to attend
and express their views. It should call upon
ministers, deputy ministers and others to
attend its meetings and supply necessary
information. I believe that work of this type

FEBRUARY 27, 1951
could be handled to better advantage by
one committee than if it were distributed
among several committees.
The minister, in speaking to his resolution
has removed -a source of embarrassment
which I indicated last year. At that time I
pointed out that it was not the practice of the
British Parliament, nor the practice that bas
been followed in Canada since Confederation,
for ministers to indicate their personal views
on matters of policy, especially a policy that
is under review by the government of the
day. The leader has -removed that objection
by advising the house that he has conferred
with the Cabinet and that they have raised
no objection to his proceeding as -a member
of the Senate without ministerial authority.
We have been further advised by the honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert)
that the leader received, as he said, "the
green light" from the Prime Minister. That
relieves the situation to some extent; but I
sincerely hope that this course will not
establish what would be a dangerous precedent. There must be authority, solidarityand unanimity in government, and from my
own experience I fear that for a cabinet to
say to a minister, "Well, if you have those
views you might try them out, we have no
objection" would be very dangerous, and
such a policy, if followed, might lead to the
destruction of the form of responsible government of which, with reason, we are so
proud. May I add a word of warning as to
the undesirability of gossip. It can have
terrible consequences; let us by all means
avoid it.
The leader has made a suggestion that the
Senate should -appoint from its membership
someone who would be characterized as
"Leader of the Senate". It was difficult for
me to follow what he had in mind, because
in practice, over a period of eighty years, we
have found it necessary to have not one, but
two leaders in the Senate; the government
leader is and has been for many years the
only channel between the Senate and the
government. If we in this chamber agreed
upon and elected a leader, he would not
necessarily be a member of the government.
But to be practical, if it were our function to
elect a leader to represent us, we would have
to go to the Prime Minister and say, "Mr.
Premier, we have in mind as our leader Mr.
So-and-So; he would be a good representative
of ours in your Cabinet". Well, one may
suppose that the Prime Minister would say,
"Gentlemen, that is very kind of you; I have
in mind that individual", or "I have in mind
somebody else". Whose opinion would prevail? Of course the person who would choose
our leader would be the head of the government, which represents public opinion of this

country. I cannot see wherein would be the
advantage of our selecting a leader here and
having the government indicate that they
intended somebody else to be the connecting
link between themselves and this chamber.
That course would lead to confusion and
difficulty as between the two leaders.
The leader himself has suggested that we
should appoint a special committee to further
canvass within our own ranks the question
of reform. Well, we are having a very good
debate in this chamber. The leader, with his
usual fairness, expressed a desire to have the
opinions of the various members. I do not
believe that a special committee would
appreciably forward our desires or clarify
our opinions with regard to Senate reform.
To be effective, such a committee would have
to intrude on a field which is now being
surveyed by the provincial and federal
governments. In other words, this committee
would primarily have to submit a request to
see the Prime Minister of Canada. I have
no doubt that they would be received with
great courtesy and kindness, and be invited
to be seated. I have no doubt that the Prime
Minister would hear their story, but I thinkHon. Mr. MacLennan: It would end at that.
Hon. Mr. King: Well, I think he would say,
"Gentlemen, I am pleased to see you; but you
understand this matter is now one of the
subjects we are discussing in our endeavours
to iron out some of the constitutional difficulties between the two fields of administration,
provincial and federal, and I am not prepared
to go further in the matter with you at this
time. But I do thank you". I think that
would end the conversation. If not, the
committee would next have to go to the provincial premiers, some of whom might be as
courteous as the Prime Minister, but would
not tell the committee anything different than
the Prime Minister had told them. I cannot
therefore see any advantage to a committee
of that kind.
Honourable senators, I think we are
indebted to the honourable leader of the
government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) for his
excellent address in which he gave us the
history of the Senate. I am sure we all realize that confederation could not have been
accomplished without the establishment of
this chamber.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. King: The leader very properly
placed on record in the Senate Debates the
precepts laid down by Sir John A. Macdonald
-then John A. Macdonald-and Brown and
Cartier, who were the leaders in that great
movement. Those precepts indicate very
wisely the functions of this body, and I think

SENATE
the history of the Senate will show that all
the leaders in this house have followed closely
those precepts.
When I came to the Senate the then
leader of the government, Honourable Mr.
Dandurand, impressed upon me that this was
not a political body. I had the views that
a man usually has when he comes here from
the House of Commons. I thought that we
should step out a bit, but Senator Dandurand
said, "You are wrong. This is a revising
body. We hold up legislation, if necessary,
and we have exercised that privilege". In my
time bills have been held up by the Senate,
and I know that we have the formula to deal
with situations of this kind. A bill comes
from the House of Commons. We may be of
the opinion it should be rejected, but perhaps
we are not prepared at the moment to take
such drastic action. A conference is sought
between the two bouses, and managers are
appointed to meet together to try to iron out
the difficulty. In this way a solution may be
found, and if so the legislation in question
becomes law. On the other hand, it is always
within the right of the Senate to say that it
will not accept a bill, and to defeat it; and
this has been donc from time to time. I
think our position is pretty clear.
Incidentally, I think this is one of the
greatest chambers in the world, because the
best fellows I know are here. I want to compliment my friend, the leader opposite, (Hon.
Mr. Haig) on his speech. He must have given
it a great deal of thought. He did not complain because his party has not now the right
to make appointments to the Senate. Like
myself, he believes that "Hope springs eternal
in the human breast." Public opinion is very
fickle, and the wheel of fortune turns rapidly.
I know from my own experience that one
had better be guarded about predicting what
will happen in the political field; it does not
take many unwise moves on the part of a
government to lose public confidence.
Honourable senators, I think I have said
almost enough, but I cannot conclude without
paying tribute to my good friends who have
spoken so far in this debate. I want particularly to compliment my good friend from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck). I think
his was one of the finest speeches he ever
made in this house. He was very guarded,
and spoke more carefully than usual.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. King: I also want to refer to the
speech made by my colleague and friend from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris). I think
he has done as much as anybody to keep me
in public life. I do not believe I ever entered
a compaign that he was not near me, and he

did not have much respect for my opponents.
He could hit harder than anybody I knew.
But as we grow older and become more
mature we soften, and I think he went a bit
soft the other daySome Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. King: -when
he suggested that
30 per cent of the membership of this house
should be appointed by the provincial
premiers. Good heavens! We are trying to
settle differences between the two legislative
authorities in Canada today, so why interject
a suggestion of that kind? It does not sound
right. My own impression is that my able
friend is so desirous of having debate that he
would like a little more opposition in order
that he might extend himself.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. King: I am a great admirer of
the honourable gentleman from Vancouver
South, but I cannot support his suggestion
that the provinces make some of the appointments to the Senate. I think the authority
of appointment should remain with the
federal government
through
the Prime
Minister.
Some Hon. Senators:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. King:
Perhaps the provincial
premiers might suggest two or three candidates for appointment to the Senate; but
the choice of appointments should be left
with the federal authority.
Honourable senators, we know the gentlement of the press well. They form a group
which is set aside and a little beyond parliament. We have in this house several newspapermen, two of whom were formerly very
able reporters.
I refer to the honourable
senators from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert and
Hon. Mr. Bishop).
Newspapermen have
inquiring minds. It is their business to get
information, and I have found that if you
treat them frankly and fairly they will not
abuse your confidence.
Some Hon. Senators:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. King: It is only when you start
to hedge and throw out suggestions that
you give them a lead and they start arriving
at conclusions. The presence here of representatives of the press is of great value to us,
and their advice and confidence is worth
while courting.
I am sorry that my honourable friend from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) is not here. Like
the present leader of the Senate (Hon. Mr.
Robertson), he has held high office in the
councils of the Liberal party. Each served
for a time as Chairman of the federal Liberal
organization, and in that position necessarily
enjoyed the confidence of the Prime Minister

FEBRUARY 27, 1951
and all other ministers of the government.
It is to the credit of my honourable friends
that neither of them abused that confidence.
But I was surprised to hear my honourable
friend from Ottawa say that it might be
well if ministers talked a little more outside
of Council. He referred directly to two
former ministers, who are now members of
this house, and said they knew that members
of the government did not always resist the
desire to express an "untrammeled view on
a problem of the day." Well, those two
honourable gentlemen know, as I do, that we
had differences of opinion, but we kept our
confidence and kept our place as ministers of
the Crown. I cannot agree with my honourable friend from Ottawa that it would be in
the interest of good government and of the
public life of this country that cabinet ministers should on occasion express their personal
views in public.
I think that would be
destructive of government.
My good friend from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen), who speaks with such facility and
clearnessHon. Mr. MacLennan: He got very soft.
Hon. Mr. King: -seemed to have in mind
the extension that has come about in the
average life period, and to feel that there are
todiay a lot of people beyond a certain age
who probably should be dead.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh!
Hon. Mr. King: He argued in favour of
an age limit for seniators. I have no objection
to that, if that is what the public wants,
although if the limit that he mentioned were
in effect now I should not be speaking here
tonight. However, since that limit is not in
effect, I am going to continue exercising my
privilege to speak. I thought his argument
on this point was entirely inconsistent. He
pointed out that in the Civil Service and in
many other spheres of life people are being
retired at the age of sixty-five, and I think
that to be consistent he should have advocated retirement of senators at that age,
instead of at seventy-five.
Of course, we al know of people pensioned off at sixty-five who, because of the
wide experience and knowledge acquired by
them in their positions, are sought after and
given other important work to do in the business and professional life of this country.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. King: Today one sometimes hears
young people say they do not need to provide
for their own independence in old age,
because when they reach sixty-five or seventy
the government will take care of them. I
believe we should warn our young people
against relying for their security upon any
80713-13

prospect of that kind. If they persist they
may be disturbed later on to find that they
were labouring under a false impression.
Honourable senators, in closing I have only
another word to say, and that is in tribute
to our worthy leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson).
I think that he has the unanimous respect of
the members of this house.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. King: We appreciate the work he
has done. He has suggested that he would
like to appoint assistants to help him in carrying on his work. I should not like to see him
do that. I would prefer that he follow the
present practice of utilizing the services of
various honourable members for the explanation of many of the bills that come before us.
I think that in general the members of the
Senate are better informed on legislation
sent over here from the House of Commons
than even the members of that house are.
When a measure reaches here we are
familiar with what has been said about it in
the Commons and in committees of that
house. Then we are given an explanation
on the second reading here, and if we are
not satisfied we can obtain further information from the minister and departmental
officials in our own committee. Finally, we
can still discuss a measure in detail in committee of the whole house. Any senator who
complains that he is not fully informed of
the character of legislation passed through
this house must have been remiss in his
duties, and he has no excuse.
I do wish to assure the leader (Hon Mr.
Robertson) and the deputy leader (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) that they have my full confidence,
and that it is a great pleasure for me to assist
them to the utmost of my limited ability.
Sone Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. J. J. Kinley: Honourable senators, it is
a privilege to speak after the distinguished
senator who has just taken his seat. The
honourable gentleman from Kootenay East
(Hon. Mr. King) has modestly referred to his
services to the state and we ail respect him
very highly for his splendid record in the
public life of our country.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: It is a pleasure to be able
to pay this tribute to him while we are under
the spell of his very able address. He is now
seventy-eight years old and, as one can
readily judge from the speech he has just
delivered, be is a man of keen intellect. I
hope the day will never come when this
Senate will have to retire such men.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

SENATE
minds are alert I am always pleased to take
advantage of their knowledge and experience.
It is most worthwhile for those of us who
are younger in the service of the country.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Until a short time ago
this house was composed of ninety-six senators. Now there are one hundred and, two,
of whom fourteen are over the age of seventyfive years. Well, if these members can be
designated as such, we are not carrying very
much excess baggage. Every human institution has something to carry. When I ride in
an airplane I find that any excess over the
weight allowed has to be paid for. When I
entered this chamber in 1945 my identification

we are invited to assist and advise the King
in matters of government. If we were elected
we would immediately be in competition with
the House of Commons. I do not think the
other bouse would like that. From my observation of the personnel of this house, I
believe that in that event we would dominate
the situation.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I believe the last thing
the House of Commons want is an elected
Senate. It would throw our whole constitution out of balance. The fact is although
members of the Senate, as presently constituted, are not elected nevertheless they are
indirectly representatives of the people
because they are appointees of a government
which is elected by the people.
If there is one thing upon which we may
congratulate ourselves it is that in the last
idecade, in fact in the last twenty years,-and
I do not say this because the Liberal party
has been in office; because any other party
might have held power-we have had in
government the stability which results from
a party invested with a clear mandate to
carry on its work. Had the Senate during all
this time been elective, majority opinion
would have ruled here in practically the
same degree. So this matter of an elective
upper chamber does not seem to me to be
of much practical importance.
I am sure it would be detrimental to the
Maritimes to have an elective Senate. At
the present time they are represented by
twenty-four members, and therefore have
equal representation, numerically, with the
province of Ontario and with the province of
Quebec. Also, since Newfoundland came
into confederation, the Maritime Provinces
are strengthened by six additional senators.
Does anyone suppose that if the Senate were
elected on the basis of representation by
population, the East and the West of this
country would obtain the degree of representation they have now? It follows that as
far as the Maritime Provinces are concerned,
an elected Senate would diminish our influence in the Parliament of Canada.
Some people talk as though democracy
always implies direct election by the people.
Well, down in the United States the "Home
of the Free", the federal government is not
elected at ail. The people who really govern
the United States are appointed by the President; he alone is elected. Cabinet ministers
there have no responsibility to the people;
their responsibility is to the President himself. It is true that their appointments must
be approved by the Senate; but if a man of
sound reputation, who is likely to do a good

job, is put forward, there is not much difficulty about confirming his selection.
The resolution before us is one for selfexamination. Had it been brought down by the
government, we might have felt obliged to
defend ourselves in order perhaps, to preserve our position. But when one comes to the
business of self-exarnination one must have
a single regard to the truth. Personally I
would hate to be a party to supporting some
reform to come in the future, but to which I
myself would not have to be subjected. It
seems to me that if changes are to be made
they should apply also to us. We should not
ask somebody else to do what we will not
do for ourselves.
It is, I think, a compliment to the Senate
that we engage in discussions of this kind.
In every organization there is a wish for
improvement. To put the matter of appointments to the Senate on the lowest conceivable
level, that of security, let me ask honourable
senators to tell me from their experience in
the public life of Canada what reward there
is for the layman who enters politics and
gives his life to that kind of service. The
barrister may become a judge. It is a great
incentive for the lawyer who enters public
life; but for the lay member the case is
different. Everyone cannot be a minister
in the lower house; and can anyone think of
a better reward for merit and long service
than to be appointed to the Senate, a position
of dignity, with the opportunity of giving
experience and wisdom to the further service
of the government? While that may be a
low level on which to approach the matter,
it is after all a practical one.
Now, the Liberal party predominates in this
country, and it predominates in this house.
That is our difficulty. We are overloaded
with Liberals, and the opposition is becoming
weaker and weaker. Everyone here knows
very well that that situation is going to cause
trouble in our parliamentary system, and we
should find a solution. The recommendation
that the provincial legislatures appoint senators is not a new one. The Honourable W. S.
Fielding, undoubtedly frustrated by the fact
that the Senate was overloaded with Conservatives, suggested years ago that the provincial governments appoint some of the
senators. I do not think we should change
the constitution in order to do this. I do not
agree with the suggestion of the honourable
senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) that local governments should appoint
members to the Senate, but I think the government should declare as a policy that the
provinces are to be given the privilege or right
-if you want to call it that-to nominate
from a panel a part of the representation in
this house. This system would overcome the

FEBRUARY 27, 1951

difficulty we now face, and it would probably
bring about a spirit of good will which does
not exist today between the provinces and the
dominion. The way the various provincial
representatives act when they come together
in conference would lead one to believe that
they came from different countries. We are
all of the same country, and we are all the
same kind of taxpayers. It does not matter
how a province may try to arrange that it
will pay less money in taxes, the Canadian
taxpayers still pay the bill and the sooner we
can work together in an intelligent and
congenial manner the better it will be for
everyone.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I interrupt my honourable friend? He said a moment ago that you
might eliminate the preponderance of Liberals
now in this chamber, by having provincial
for
recommendations

legislatures
appointments from a panel. How would that
prevent the appointment of men of the same
political stripe as the government in power?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Well, if you had a panel
from the Ontario government you would bet
Conservatives; from Alberta you would get
Social Crediters; from New Brunswick you
would get Liberals, and frorn Saskatchewan
you would get CCFers. I am one of those who
believe that the Liberal party is going to
remain in power. If the Conservative party
were to get into office the problem would be
solved.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Is it not true that the effect
of your suggestion is to pass on to the provinces the selection of men of their own
parties?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: You are right to a degree.
It would not necessitate changing our constitution because the members of the panel
would only be nominated by the provinces,
and the federal governrnent would make the
final selection. I think this would be a simple
matter.
Honourable senators, some people entertain
the idea that because the Senate is not
always busy it is not doing its duty. The
Senate is like a judge. You cannot say that
a man is a poor judge because few people
appear before him. I think, however, we
should realize that inactivity breeds stagnation, and will destroy the best organization in
the world. It seems to me that we should
endeavour, as far as possible, to keep busy on
matters which are of benefit to Canada. I
think we could institute inquiries into matters
of public interest. Royal commissions are
expensive, and I think the Senate could sometimes take their place.
Most of the work done by the Senate takes
place in committee, and the general public

does not hear much about it. Let me refer,
for instance, to our Divorce Committee. Last
year it heard over 300 cases, and so far this
year it has heard 150. This committee sits
every morning and. dioes a tremendous job.
The task is not a pleasant one, but the work
of the committee benefits all of Canada. The
people of Quebec do not want a divorce court
set up in their province. We respect their
wishes, and it is their right to corne before
parliament with their petitions for divorce.
I think our Divorce Committee is equal in
dignity and knowledge to any court in the
land, and I am sure that the lawyers who
preside at its hearings would grace the bench
of any court in Canada.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Last year the parliamentary fees paid by petitioners to the Senate
Divorce Committee amounted to $50,000, and
this money went into the public treasury.
This surn would pay the indemnities of the
senators serving on that committee. Further,
one should consider what it would cost to
maintain a divorce court in Quebec. I would
suggest, however, that divorce proceedings
be made final in the Senate and that it
should not be necessary to refer divorce bills
to the House of Comftions, where they may be
subjected to the by-play of those who seek
to block them.
I should also like to point out that Senate
committees have handled very technical
legislation such as the Bankruptcy Act, the
Canada Shipping Act, and the National
Defence Act. Members of the Senate spent
hours and days reviewing this legislation,
but you did not read much about it in the
press. It seems to me that we should
advertise more, and tell the people of this
country what we are doing.
Hon. Mr. Euler: How?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: If we did so, it would
create a relationship which would prove
advantageous to Canada as well as to ourselves.
In conclusion I want to say that in my
opinion this resolution is not so bad as some
seem to think. I would not defeat a resolution
of this kind if it came before me as a
member of a board of directors. It would
seem that there is a feeling that this resolution implies that we are not doing our duty.
I do not think it does. The resolution reads:
That a Special Committee of the Senate be
appointed to inquire into, and report upon, whatever action in its opinion may be necessary or
expedient to enable the Senate to make its maximum contribution to the welfare of the Canadian
people.

If honourable senators want such a committee I am all for it. I think the debate on this

He said: Honourable senators, the committee have, in obedience to the order of

the said bill, and now beg leave to report
the same without amendment.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall the bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I want to raise a question
of order. I do this, Mr. Speaker, with great
deference. I think the motion to adopt the
report must be put. Otherwise we are prohibited from dealing with the report. I would
humbly suggest that the rules require His
Honour the Speaker to put the motion for
the adoption of the report, so that we may
discuss it if we choose. I am willing that
this report be adopted, but if I do not record
an objection, I am afraid that some time in
the future that fact will be used against me.
I think, therefore, that- the motion for the
adoption of the report should be put to the
house, to be followed by the motion for third
reading.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
my understanding of the rules is that when
a bill is reported without amendment, the
next step is to call for the third reading of
the bill.

Hon. Mr. Haig: I submit, on a point of order,
that the rules provide that if a bill is with

have to stand over for another day. Unless
I am mistaken, there is no way in which we
can send a report back to committee.

Hon. Mr. Haig: You can send the bill back

the rules provide that a report can be considered on the day it is presented, provided
there is no amendment to the bill. If, on the
other hand, there is an amendment to the

SENATE
The Hon. the Speaker: I should like the
honourable leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) to indicate the rule upon which he is
now basing his remarks. My understanding
of the rules is that when a bill comes back
from committee without amendment, it is
usually read the third time and passed forthwith. I wish the honourable leader would
point out the rule to which he is referring.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I would suggest that this
motion stand until tomorrow, so that I may
have a chance to study the matter.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Would the objection
of my honourable friend opposite be sufficiently met, if His Honour the Speaker were
to defer a ruling on the point my friend has
raised? The ruling could be made tomorrow.

it would not be amiss for me, one of-shall I

FEBRUARY 28, 1951
say?-the newcomers to this house, to state
my opinions on the resolution itself and on
matters which have been mentioned by the
various speakers. May I say first of all that
I think the speeches in general have been
instructive and educational, and the debate
has been conducted on a very high plane.
Most of those who have spoken so far, it
seems to me, have largely ignored the resolution and been at considerable pains to speak
as though the life and usefulness of the
Senate were under attack and criticism. In
fact, if one can judge by the hearty applause
which we have heard at times, it would
appear that many honourable senators held
that same view. Now, while I cannot agree
with all that has been said, I wish to compliment those who have taken part in the debate,
for I repeat that by and large the speeches
have been excellent.
The leader of the government should have
anticipated just such a debate as we have
had, and in my opinion he should have confined himself strictly to the purpose of the
resolution. Since I have been a member of
this chamber I have not always seen eye to
eye with the leader, and I do not expect that
I shall always see eye to eye with him in the
future. However, I believe that his intentions in bringing in this resolution were
honest and very good indeed; and for reasons
which I shall state before concluding, I am
going to support the resolution.
I want first to discuss the question of the
Senate as a second -chamber, and to say that
I heartily agree with all that has been said
about that question in this debate. I believe
that our parliamentary system, with an elective chamber on one side and an appointed
chamber on the other, is outstanding amongst
systems of government in the free democratic
countries today. Without belittling our good
and powerful neighbour to the south, I think
that because of its systern of government, plus
too many radio commentators, it is somewhat
difficult for an outsider to judge which of the
two groups of legislators speaks officially for
that country. All of which tends to confusion.
I am of the opinion that there is greater
need today for the Senate than there was
at the time of confederation and for some
years f ollowing. I shall enumerate three
reasons why I think'this is so. First, I would
point out that the power of the government
today is growing, I find that I am not alone
in believing this, for there are other thinking men throughout Canada who share my
view. As evidence of this fact, I draw the
attention of the house to a speech made last
evening by Professor Corry to a Liberal
convention at the Chateau Laurier. I do not
intend to quote from his remarks at length,
80713-14

but I should like to read one or two statements in support of my contention that the
power of government is growing and to show
that the Senate has a duty to watch it, in
the interests of the people.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: A newspaper article about
Professor Corry's speech, reads in part as
follows:
He said the discretionary powers exercised "by
our government nowadays in time of peace are wide
enough to cause concern." The practical certainty
of cold war, if not actual shooting war, meant an
increase in these powers. This gave rise to a need
for vigilance because-

And I wish honourable senators to pay particular attention to this statement.
-"the wider the powers of government are over a
long period, the more government attracts men who
like to exercise that range of power."
"While we may feel quite secure in the hands of
our rulers today, we can have no such assurance
for the future. So, it is vitally important to look
to the safeguards of individual freedom."
He suggested the country must give some thought
and expenditure to new and better ways of ensuring
the responsibility of government to parliament-

That means the Senate and the House of
Commons.
-and to the people.
If the country was to have a considerable measure
of "order-in-council government" again, it should
be considering seriously the establishment of one or
more committees of parliament to examine, not the
substance and policy of orders in council but the
effect that the powers and procedures contained in
them will have on individual rights and freedoms.
"We should also be studying how to maintain the
influence of parliament over policy and administration," said Dr. Corry.

Honourable senators, I think I need not
elaborate that point further, because Professor Corry expresses very fully and very
well the thoughts I had in mind.
As a second reason why a second chamber
is necessary in our democracy, I would point
to the over-growing numbers and powers of
boards and officials, some of whom have, in
my opinion, dictatorial mentality. I think the
honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert) referred to them as bureaucratic
government
My third reason, and an important one, is
that there is a constant reduction in the
independence of members of parliament on
the government side. Some nay disagree
with me about that, but I can cite many
instances .to support what I say.
I have a suggestion to make which, though
it has to do with the House of Commons, has
some bearing on this body. I should like
to see the rules of ithe House of Commonfs

SENATE

on some minor matter or on the Speaker's
ruling. I know from experience that many
members have felt obliged to vote in favour
of the Speaker's ruling, when they sincerely
believed the ruling was wrong. Such an
amendment as I suggest would allow greater
freedom on the part of the people's elected
representatives. At the same time, it should
not be forgotten that the Senate is the only
body which can defeat a government
measure without defeating the government.
I may say to honourable senators that
many years ago in the British Columbia
Legislature there was what was known as
"rule by caucus". I think the honourable
senator from Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon)
under a Liberal administration had something to do with the making of a change in
the rules of the legislature, with the result
that the provincial government could be
defeated in a vote on a minor measure without, of necessity, having to resort to an
election.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question? Is there any

senators are the highest-paid old age pensioners there are. This statement-and I
say this in a kindly spirit-was rather unfortunate. Recently my honourable friend said
that some radio stations should be put off
the air because of certain statements they
had broadcast about and against the Senate.
No doubt such statements do a certain
amount of harm to the Senate; but the fact
that they are widely publicized shows, I
believe, that that is the kind of reading, or
listening, the public is interested in, and no
apology will ever catch up with the original
statement.
On the other hand, I would remind honourable senators of the publicity which has been
given to this debate. Almost every newspaper in Canada has had something to say
about each speech which is rather unusual
for the Senate, and the publicity is all to
the good. Although I have often doubted
the reason for printing some of the things I
read in the newspapers, nevertheless, I
realize that editors and reporters, generally
speaking, understand better what the public

recommendations are now being carried out.
For example, I remarked that I thought
Ottawa was over-governed, that there were
too many members on its council and board
of control. I am happy to see that some move
has at last been made to reduce the surplus.
The service rendered through this publicity
did not assist me personally, because it had
no effect in my home constituency; and I was
rather astonished when the mayor of Ottawa
said, "Pay no attention to that wild man;
he will never come back." I overlooked one
thing: after the election I omitted to send
him a telegram suggesting that he would be
pleased to know I had been re-elected as
the member for New Westminster.
My chief objection to much of the publicity
we receive-and I think my view is shared
by practically everyone in public life-is, not
so much the criticism that is made, but the
way in which one's statements are sometimes
misreported and misconstrued. If one's exact
words were printed we would not have, I
think, much ground for criticism; for after
all, as I have said, presumably editors and
reporters know better than we do what the
people want. I must admit that I might
make a pretty poor newspaper man, because
my policy would be to print only what I
thought should be printed, and the resulting
product would probably be much less popular
than much that is produced nowadays; in
other words, the paper would not sell very
well.
I come now to the question of whether
appointments to this body should be made by
provincial governments. Let me say at the
outset that I am opposed to this suggestion.
On this score I not only disagree with my
friend the honourable senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris), but I believe that the
suggestion he made is in diametrical opposition to what he said earlier in his speech on
the subject. For instance, he said that the
Senate is a judicial body. With that statement we all agree. Why, then, adopt a method
of appointment which would bring in men
whose utterances might be wholly partisan?
It may be that the honourable senator would
get a lot of fun in the process of disputing
with them; as a matter of fact, if such a thing
occurred here, I should enjoy getting into
the debate. But if we are to preserve the
judicial character of this body, it would be
well not to encourage speeches of that kind.
In my opinion, honourable senators, there
never should have been in this chamber a
formal opposition. To this feature, I believe,
is due entirely the attention which has been
drawn to the fact that the opposition is recognized as a party-one which has now dwindled
to some eleven members. As has been pointed
80713-14J

out, the time may come when the membership
of the Senate will consist entirely of appointees of the Liberal government; and the
Canadian people, believing that there must be
opposing political parties in the Senate, will
not take very kindly to the situation when that
time comes.
It is easy to start something, but often very
difficult to change or go back to former things.
Britain will never revert to the conditions of
former days, even if a Conservative government is returned to power at the next election. In the main, change is irreversible, and
that is one of the reasons that I am concerned
about many of the things which are being
done in this country under the cloak of fear
of war. Bit by bit the people are losing their
freedoxn and being regimented through state
laws and orders.
However, to return to the subject of provincial appointments. In my opinion such a
system would provide no guarantee that any
better class of individual would be appointed
to this chamber.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Quite right.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Nobody can dispute the
possibility that provincial premiers and governments would appoint friends, or even
rivals whom they wanted to get rid of, without
much thought as to the ability or usefulness
of their nominees in public life or in the
Senate. One can foresee jealousies and even
class distinctions; and heaven forbid that we
ever have class distinction in the Senate. At
present, the criticism that I, as a newcomer,
might make of the Senate is that it is too
smug, too satisfied with itself, and too inclined
to look askance at recently arrived members
when they begin to air their views. It may
be that ýafter many years, I too may get smug.
I hope not. But as one recently arrived here
I must admit a suspicion that there is a little
family compact here which seems to run
affairs. If I were a member of that family
compact perhaps I would not mention it;
but being on the outside trying to get in,
naturally I criticize. As a Liberal I am
opposed to vested interests. For this and
other reasons I believe that there is not much
merit in the suggestion that certain appointments be made or recommended by provincial governments. I wonder who would
make the appointments in British Columbia,
where we have a Coalition government. The
person looking for the job of premier might
recommend that the present premier be
appointed to the Senate in order to get rid
of him. Even he, however, would not be any
better than those of us who have already been
appointed to this chamber.
I come now to the touchy subject of a
retiring age of seventy years for senators. I

SENATE
think that when the honourable gentleman
from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) made
this suggestion, many honourable senators
regarded it from their own present age position and not from the point of view of future
appointments ýto the Senate. No one has even
suggested that such a rule should apply to
those already here, because every honourable
member here accepted his appointment knowing and believing that it would be for life.
Some of those who have spoken during this
debate have pointed out many great and
illustrious men who were mentally and
physically sound long after they had passed
the age of seventy-five. Let me say that
they were the exception rather than the rule.
Generally speaking a person's faculties begin
te decline at seventy-five. This is true in
the very nature of things, and I do not think
there is a doctor among us who would disagree with that statement. May I remind the
good Presbyterians and others here that it
was laid down in the Holy Writ that the
allotted span of life is "threescore years
and ten", some being granted extra strength
to carry on a for a time longer. I, too, could
refer to great men of old age. I recall that
in the city of New Westminster there was a
Mr. Furness, who was one of the few men to
live to be over one hundred and to have a
birth certificate to prove it. That is something rare. I remember that in his ninetyninth year he climbed a ladder and pulled
apples off one of his trees, and when he came
down he said "I think I am getting too old
to pick apples. Ill have to stop growing
them." If one had been in New Westminster
they could have visited Mr. Furness, who
celebrated his one-hundredth birthday before
passing on. Honourable senators, I believe
that such a retiring rule as bas been suggested
for the future would bring in younger men
with more vigor, and would remove some of
the accusations which have been made about
or
old-age pensioners
appointees being
appointment being a sinecure for life.
The honourable senator from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) referred te the retirement of civil servants at the age of sixty-five.
I would remind honourable senators that
sixty-five is just five years short of the
allotted span of life.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask the honourable

senator a question?
He approved of not
having men of seventy-five or over in the
Senate because their powers had begun to
fail; but he said no suggestion had been
made that those now in the Senate should
retire upon attaining the age of seventy-five
years. I should like to ask him how he can
reconcile those two statements. Why should
those who were appointed before the age

of seventy-five not retire when they reach
that age?

Perhaps their powers also fail.

Hon. Mr. Reid: It is all a matter of personal
viewpoint. If you hold the view that you
ought to retire at seventy-five, you may very
well not feel like staying after you reach that

age.

On the other hand, having ac.-pted

appointment for life, I might take a different
view.
I have something more to say about this
proposed retiring age of seventy-five. I am
net through w ith the question and if I may

be permitted to do so, I want to mention
some safeguards.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Was not the retiring age

of sixty-five for civil servants stipulated by
the Civil Service Association itself?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: By the young men, yes.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That may be. I have my
own views about the powers of the Civil Service Association. The make-up of the Senate,
from what I have seen since coming here, is

no different from that of the House of Commons or, in fact, from that of any other body

elected to carry out public business or affairs.
I would point out that the attendance in the
House of Commons is not nearly as good as
that of the Senate.

Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: When I was in the other
house I said that if I had my way each
member of the House of Commons would
have an attendance card, and I advocated
such a plan.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: The same as in the
Senate.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes. It is well known that
the government is often afraid to take a vote
because there are not enough members present. I remember one occasion when only
thirteen members of the House of Commons
were present. The late R. B. Bennett pointed
this fact out, and it was my good fortune to
have been one of the small group there.
There was no quorum, so we had te adjourn;
but nothing was said about it in the press. In
my opinion the duties of senators and members of the House of Commons are largely
those of conscience combined with those of
physical ability or condition. As I have said,
for long years I adrvocated keeping an attendance record in the Commons so that the
attendance in that house would be better,
especially on Fridays and Mondays.
Honourable senators, I think you will agree
with me that thousands of those who entered
the public service have not always been
dealt with fairly upon retirement. If a provision requiring retirement at the age of
seventy-five were put into effect, I would

FEBRUARY 28, 1951
start with the members of the House of
Commons, and
recommend
that their
indemnity be raised to $10,000 per annum. I
would also eliminate the income tax exemption. I would establish a voluntary contributory retiring scheme, so that if a member
retired in five year's time, or was defeated,
he would not be left without anything. He
would at least get his money back. After
he had served ten years he would be entitled
to receive an annuity, in the same way that
civil servants do under their superannuation
scheme. But so long as he remained a member of the house he could continue making his
payments, andi if he were, shall I say, elevated
to the Senate, he could keep on paying into
the fund until he retired.
As we all know, many men have given the
best years of their lives to representing their
constituencies in the House of Commons and
elsewhere. During that time they have contributed not only their services but their
substance, and you cannot blame them if in
their dieclining years they request appointment to this honourable chamber for the
remainder of their lives. I say we should
look at the matter broadly and squarely and
see to it that some provision is made for taking care of these people who have done so
much in the public life of Canada.
.
I remember very well the cry that went up
in certain parts of the country when the
indemnity payable to members of the Senate
and House of Commons was increased from
$4,000 to $6,000 a year. I attended a meeting
of some 350 old age pensioners who were
asking for higher pensions, and a meeting of
some 300 members of the Canadian Legion
who also were seeking larger pensions, and
on each occasion someone from the audience
threw at me the question why the sessional
indemnity for members of parliament had
been increased. I stepped to the front of the
platform and expressed thanks for the question, because it gave me an opportunity to
say things which otherwise I might have
hesitated to mention. I pointed out that a
member of parliament is obliged to leave his
home and business for about six months of
the year; that he maintains an additional
home in Ottawa during this period and incurs
all the other expenditures that one has to
meet while in public life; that during the
session he has to work from twelve to fourteen hours a day, and sometimes gets very
little appreciation from the people whom he
serves-indeed, he often gets abuse. I asked
how many of those present would be willing
to undertake that kind of job for the
indemnity, and there was no answer. At first
glance $6,000 may seem like a lot of money
to some people, but they change their minds
when they realize the service rendered in

return for it. I do not know of any man
who has made money out of representing his
constituency in parliament.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: If a pension plan were
inaugurated, I think there should be a proviso
whereby a man after he had served for a
certain number of years in the Senate-I
would hesitate to specify any number of
years-and had reached a certain age, could,
if he desired, retire on, say, 50 per cent of
the sessional indemnity. I believe quite a
few would gladly accept a chance to remain
at home under those conditions rather than
be obliged to come here and live in a rented
room in order to keep up their attendance
and make sure of getting the indemnity. We
all know that sometimes an honourable
member may be dependent on what is provided for him by the State, and I think we
should have a better way of rewarding faithful service to the public than we have had up
until now.
I believe I have covered, perhaps briefly,
most of the points raised by previous speakers,
and I now wish to make a few suggestions.
When I read the resolution, the first question
I asked myself was this: Is the Senate making
its maximum contribution to the welfare of
the Canadian people? In effect, the resolution asks whether we are doing everything
which we could or should do in the interest
of the people. My answer to that questionand I realize some honourable senators may
disagree with me-is that there are many
things which we could do in the interest of
the people that we are not doing, and I believe
that further consideration should be given
to some of the things that we are doing.
First I wish to refer to the work of the
Divorce Committee. I asked the honourable
gentleman from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) if the Senate's duty to deal with
divorce had existed ever since confederation,
and his answer was that it had. But it seems
to me that the Fathers of Confederation could
never have contemplated that the Senate
would receive hundreds of petitions for
divorce and that two committees would have
to sit five or six days a week for a period of
several weeks each session in order to get
through them. I have every respect for the
men who serve on those committees. They
are doing a very fine work, and I think we
are fortunate in having members who will
undertake a duty of that kind.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: But the growing number of
petitions is causing such an increase in the
work that it will soon become more difficult

committee of this house. It need only pick out
one or two departments a year, and deal
with them effectively.
Honourable senators will recall that a few
years ago the National Film Board had in its
employ a man by the name of Grierson, who
later left the country. I have read that he
had elaborate establishments in various countries of the world, supposedly in connection
with the National Film Board, but for which
no satisfactory explanation or justification
could be given.
I come now to my last point. I should like
to know about the expenditure of money in
the United Nations Organization. I know
that that body is paying high salaries, and
that the money comes out of the United
Nations. When we pay certain persons high
salaries which are free of income tax, we
are building up a class. As a Liberal I am
against class distinction. It was with that
view that I advocated that members of the
House of Commons be given an increased
indemnity, subject to income tax, the same -as
everybody else.
In conclusion, I appeal to honourable
senators who have already committed themselves to oppose the resolution now before
us. It may be that such a resolution as this
should not have been introduced. Be that as
it may, this debate has focused the eyes of the
people of Canada on the Senate, and perhaps
some good will ensue. Some able speeches
have been made, and -a considerable amount
of important information has come out
of the discussion. As I pointed out earlier,
however, very little has been said regarding
the actual work of the Senate; most of the
remarks appear to me to have been arguments as to why the Senate was set up and
the purpose of it, with no suggestions as to
ways in which we could, on behalf of the
Canadian people, improve the work and
duties of the Senate. I now fear that if this
resolution goes to a vote and is voted down,
our action may well be interpreted throughout the country as meaning that the Senate
is not prepared even to consider the matter.
So I appeal to all honourable senators to
consider the impact of such action on the
public mind in the light of the wording of
the resolution. As servants of the people of
Canada we cannot afford to have such an
accusation stand before us.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Forgetting for the moment
the question of an age limit, do the suggestions made by the honourable senator
from New Westminster require no amendment to the constitution? If we have the will
to do so, wecan iinplemerit thèm now?

Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes. That is the reason
I suggested that a committee should be set up.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I have one question
to ask the honourable senator in relation to
his closing comments. If I understood him
correctly, he suggested that this resolution
should not be opposed because of the undesirable publicity which the Senate would get
as a result of doing so. Am I right in that
interpretation?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I wonder if the honourable gentleman has considered what
undesirable publicity we might get if it were
voted down?
Hon. R. W. Gladstone: I can assure honourable senators there has been no exchange of
ideas between the honourable senator from
New Westminster and myself.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: No collusion.
Hon. Mr. Gladstone: I say this because
honourable senators will note some similarity
of presentation on one particular point with
which I shall deal.
There is no governing body, all Canadian,
that is as free as the Senate to exercise
independent judgment in matters related to
the welfare of the Canadian people. It is
almost inevitable that politics will enter at
some stage into the deliberations of the
federal government, the provincial legisla.tures and municipal councils. I mean politics
in the sense of political intrigue, as contrasted with politics defined as the science of
government. It shows up even with the
public in its demands for preferments. Sometimes one feels there is more politics outside
of parliament than in it.
The honourable leader of the opposition in
the Senate (Hon. Mr. Haig) has on numerous
occasions proved himself a statesman by his
independent consideration of matters of great
moment. The same tribute can justly be paid
to the honourable leader of the government
(Hon. Mr. Robertson). Both these gentlemen
last year supported a proposal for the nonpolitical consideration of the estimates, with
a view to reducing the cost of government.
I shall refer later to this effort.
We have before us now the resolution of
the honourable leader of the government to
study means of finding new avenues of usefulness for the Senate. Unfortunately some
controversial issues have befogged the real
purpose of his resolution. I would think he
may not be altogether blameless for this
happening. His reference to age retirements
and the method of appointing senators has
stirred up a hornet's nest. The politics of
self-preEervat ion has distracted attention

189

from the primary purpose of his resolution.
In my opinion the difficulty is not insoluble. I
shall endeavour later to propose a remedy to
be accomplished without amendment of the
constitution.
Not being a lawyer, I am not competent to
enter into legal arguments; my approach can
be only from the business angle. My consideration of the resolution will fall under
:hree headings:

(2) Can and should the Senate enlarge the
scope of its work in a way beneficial to
Canada?
(3) What is the remedy for any inefficiency
in the Senate due to appointments for life,
and what better method can be devised to
give representation to the various shades of
political opinion?
The first of these headings-"Has the
Senate carried out its responsibilities as
intended by the B.N.A. Act 1867?"-has been
the theme for discussion by a number of
senators who are members of the legal profession, and others. They have established
that the Senate has functioned at all times
in its duty of amending faulty legislation and
of vetoing hastily considered and ill-timed
legislation. Various examples have been
given. I might cite a revision forced by the
Senate since I have had the honour of sitting
in this Chamber. The charter of the Red
Cross Society permitted investment in
property to the value of $100,000. In 1949 a
private bill came from the House of Commons whereby this limit was to be eliminated.
Debate there eulogized quite properly the
work of the Red Cross Society, but seemingly
overlooked the vital section as to property
investment. The Senate refused to pass the
bill. A new bill was passed by the Commons
in 1950 fixing property investment at a
maximum of $200,000. This bill was acceptable to the Senate and is now law. The point
is that the executive of the Red Cross Society
is not empowered to invest more than
$200,000 of the voluntary contributions of
the people in property, and thereby the
tendency to build up costly organizations is
frustrated. A gentleman commented to me
recently, saying: "You don't have an emergency brake on a motor car to use all the
time, but you don't want to take it off". Lifeguards at bathing beaches are not every day
saving people from drowning. The usefulness
of the Senate of Canada has been demonstrated periodically to effect very considerable savings for the Canadian people.
My second heading for discussion is: "Can
and should the Senate enlarge the scope of

its work in a way beneficial to Canada? It
is sheer nonsense to think that we can justify
the continued existence of the Senate if it

goes along as provided by the Fathers of
Confederation 83 years ago. If, as a govcrning body, we stand still, nothing is more
certain than that in time, the Senate will
be eliminated as an arm of our government.
Progress is about us everywhere. Our forefathers drove ox-teams along the trails. Now
we speed the highways powered by gasoline
from Alberta or Texas. We can breakfast at
home and dine in London. Inflammatory
trouble in the abdomen generally meant
death in bygone days, in spite of hot applications and castor oil. Today appendicitis is
conquered by the surgeon's knife and penicillin. Pneumonia is no longer dreaded since
the discoveries of sulfa drugs, penicillin,
chloromycetin and what have you. One could
go on and on giving examples of progress
through invention, engineering and science.
The Senate cannot restrict its work to "the
second look at legislation" status in this era
of progress.
The honourable senator for Toronto Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) criticized various alleged
aspects of the resolution and advised its
withdrawal, to the extent that the Globe and
Mail, in reporting his speech used the heading "Roebuck opposes Senate Reform". That
heading was unfair, for I find a saving argument in the Senator's speech. I quote:
Work to do! Why, honourable senators, there is
an abundance of it. It is merely a matter of our
taking hold with courage and industry, seeing the
things required to be done and doing them. For
heaven's sake let us cease this plaintive bleat to
the House of Commons to give us work to do. We
should find our own work.
I am in agreement one hundred per cent
with the Honourable Senator in this statement. But I am amazed at the length to
which he goes in the very next paragraph
in his effort to defeat the resolution. He said:
. . . it expresses the thought-perhaps not too
plainly, but by implication-that the Senate is not
now performing its maximum service to the people
of Canada. That is implicit in the resolution, and
I think that to the extent that it is there the
resolution is unjustified by the facts.
Not being a lawyer I am unable to comprehend ýthis finer point of argument in the
debate. But my humble sense of discernment tells me there is weakness somewhere
in a situation where there is an abundance
of work for the Senate and the Senate is
now performing its maximum service to the
people of Canada. The remedy surely must
be more senators or better senators; or it
might be more constant attendance by senators, especially those of us who come from
Ontario and Quebec.

Hon. Mr. Horner:

Hear, hear!

FEBRUARY 28, 1951
Hon. Mr. Gladstone:
And so I would
deduce that the Senate should look about
for places where it may enlarge the scope of
its work. That, I take it, is the primary
purpose of the resolution proposed by the
leader of the government.
This effort should flot be the lone-handed
work of any one senator. It is quite possible
that each and every senator has in mind
sornething that could be advancedl as a resolution to make it a matter for study by a
special committee. Only a certain number of
resolutions could. be undertaken each session.
First things .should corne flrst. A suggested
resolution should be submitted to a resolutions
committee and framed in the broadest and
best ternis before appearing on the order
paper in the namne of the proposer. I have
in mind matters thýat might very weil be
debated, but I would, welcome the advance
consideration and suggestions of a resolutionýs
committee.
Particularizing, I would say that the proposai of the Leader of the Government in
1950 to have quite a number of committees
of the Senate study the estimates of the
various departmenits of goverrament was
timely, but the operation. was flot well
planned.
In some committees it resolved
itself into a mere duplication of the consideration. of the estimates as carried on in the
House of Commons. Th.at is not enough. In
the other house a motion to reduce the estimate for one item of expenditure in one
department woul-d constitute want of conidence in the govern*ment. In -the Senate a
recommendation that a certain section of any
department is no longer needed, or that it
might be amnalgamated with somne other section, would be heeded by the goverrnent in
its fuxrther administrations. In the Senate a
recommendation that the test-tube rooms in
various departments might better be centralized in one test-tube depa-rtment, would
receive consideration, by the governiment in
its further administrations. Too often busy
ministers are the prey of civil servants for
continuation of excessive or needless. expenditure
Some good work was done in 1950 by our
Committees on Estimates. But who knows
about it?--only the six or ten senators who
attended the meetings of the committee. The
other senators do not k-now what transpired,
and the ininister of the department does flot
know beyond what may have been related to
him by members of his staff. The members
of the House of Commons do flot know.
Whatever value might have accrued from.
the study is largely lost. To be of value
records should be made and distributed. I
understand that in the British Parliament it
is the practice to consider the estimates of

about two departments each year, going
through, these as it were, with a flne-tooth
cornb. I would recommend that before committees are set up this year to study estimates, consideration as to procedure should
be given, and that the evidence taken by
committees be printed.
As an illustration of something untouched,
which rnight lead to legisiation in sorne f orm,
may I suggest that a special cornmittee might
give consideration to the trend in our national
if e whereby the commercialization of entertainment is becoming a factor in juvenile
delinquency. It is becoming more and more
difficuit for home influences to combat the
allurements provided by those who are out
to make rnoney for themselves, regardless
of the eflect on the youth of Canada. I arn
sure that everyone in authority in federal,
provincial or municipal affairs, and in
Christian organizations, would welcome any

study by the Senate which had as an objective the elirnination of some o! the undermining influences in our national life. And
here may I say it is to be deplored that a
minor rnis-step by a youth, which earns for
him even flfteen days iniprisonment, brands
hirn on the court records as a ýcriminal for
ail the future years of his if e. His record
follows hlm when hie seeks a passport and
when hie applies for a position with large
corporations, banks, railways or the government itself. Surely after a youth goes straight
for a period of, say, ten years, he might be
forgiven for trivial misdemeanors!
I corne now to the third heading of my
remarks, namely: "What la the remedy for
any inefficiency in the Senate due to appointments for hi! e, and what better method can
be devised to give representa-tion to the
various shades o! political opinion?" A solution of these points, I submit, would require
adjustments affecting both branches -of parliament. Broadly speaking, these involve a contributory retirement fund for the benefit of
both the members of the House of Commons
and o! the Senate, and increased remuneration for members of the Houýse o! Commons.
I wish here to make plain that I have no
thought o! building up a case for additionah
remuneration to Senators. One can think of
many members in the House o! Commons
whose earnings in private business or professional life would be double, treble or quadruple the amount paid them for their services
to Canada. Ju-st for the record I may say
they receive $4,000 as a salary and $2,000,
non-taxable, for expenses.
Expenses o!
persons in business are exempt froxu tax when
they are away froin home on business. The
expense allowance o! senators is taxable.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Horner: Why is that?

Are you

in favour of that?
Hon. Mr. Gladstone: Yes, I am in favour
of it. I think the indemnity of the members
of the House of Commons should be increased,
but that their whole income, including
expense allowance, should be taxed. In the
United States, senators and members of the
House of Representatives receive $12,500
for
non-taxable,
$2,500,
and
annually
expenses. In addition other provisions work
out in many cases to give them substantial
extras.
I do not hesitate to say, after fifteen years
as a member of the House of Commons, that
the members are greatly underpaid when one
considers the election risk, the sacrifices made
and the service rendered. A member must
give up his home life for six months in the
year. During the remaining six months his
first duty is to his constituents. His business,
if he has one, will suffer and, quite probably,
evaporate unless the electors rescue him
through failure to re-elect him. If any continuity of service of able men in parliament
is desirable-and this is admitted-they must
be better paid. I can think of a number of
former members who dropped out of politics
for these reasons, and whose absence from
parliament is a distinct loss to Canada.
All of this has some bearing on the Senate
situation, hence I take time to speak of one
further angle which is extremely painful.
There is quite a list of ex-members and their
wives or widows, and even former cabinet
ministers, who today are in destitute circumstances. Some senators in advanced years,
with health appallingly broken, are keeping
up their connection here because they are
without other means of livelihood. Many
ýame up through long service in the House
of Commons. It would not be proper to
mention names, but most honourable senators
know them. If there were a contributory
retirement fund many would retire voluntarily. Who knows! There might be a dozen
or even twenty retirements immediately,
making room for as many younger men.
Let me say just a word as to the basis of
the retirement fund. I would suggest that
the maximum payment might be based on
twenty-years service in parliament. Fifteen
years service would give entitlement to
fifteen-twentieths of maximum pension. There
would be a certain portion payable to a surviving dependent. It is my thought that the
much-criticized situation as to the age of
senaors would cure itself. Those who were
conscious of their inability to give worthwhile service and those who, in failing health,
felt greater enjoyment with the home folk,

would retire voluntarily. No compulsory age
limit for retirement would be required, and
no amendment to the constitution would be
needed. Earlier in my speech I commented
that the Senate was the one independent legislative body in the entire range of government
in Canada, whether federal, provincial or
municipal. Even so, I can see real merit in
the suggestion for a more certain representation of all parties in the Senate. A system of
retirements would make vacancies more frequent. Provision for a retirement fund for
members of the House of Commons would
minimize the number of applications for
Senate appointments. An unwritten law, to
be followed by the government of the day,
could provide that one in three or one in four
of new appointments should go to an outstanding person holding political views
opposed to those of the government.
The honourable senator for Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) suggested that the present
resolution of the honourable leader of the
government should be replaced by three
separate resolutions. I can go along with him
in his first two suggested resolutions, which
are:
(1) That the system of nomination of senators,
rather than that of direct election, should be continued as the best system in the interests of the
Canadian people;
(2) That it is highly desirable that some system
be devised for a more fair and balanced representation in the Senate of the various currents of
pclitical opinion in the country.

To these I would suggest the addition of a
third resolution, reading:That a joint committee of the Senate and the
House of Commons be named to study methods of
establishing a contributory pension fund for all
members.

suggested
Senators, these
Honourable
resolutions are within the ambit of the
resolution that is before this chamber. I
cannot see why they should not be considered
by the proposed special committee. All that
is asked for is a study of the possible methods
whereby the Senate can make its maximum
contribution to the welfare of the Canadian
people. I suggest that the honourable-senators who have indicated opposition to the
resolution should again consider it just as it
.reads. Its rejection would be interpreted by
the Canadian public as a refusal of the
Senate to try to keep pace with the progress
that Canada has made over all the years since
1867.

COMMITTEE REPORTS
QUESTION OF PROCEDURE-RULING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable sen-

ators, before the Orders of the Day are called
I wish to advert to an objection which was
raised yesterday by the honourable the leader
of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) to the
procedure on a report of the Committee on
Transportation and Communication, returning a bill to the house without amendment.
Following some discussion of the matter, it
was suggested by the acting government
leader (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) that a formal
decision be rendered today.
Honourable senators will recall that when
the report was presented and the question
was put "when shall the bill be read a third
time?", the leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) objected, saying that there should
be a motion for the adoption of the report.
I ruled that when a bill is reported without
amendment there is no need for a motion
to adopt the report.
I find on referring to the Forms of Proceedings of the Senate, pages 24 and 35, that
there may be some room for confusion.
Paragraph 39 states:
The Speaker calls "Reports of Committees." All

Reports are presented by the chairman of committees, who also sign the same, and all marginal

notes there may be. A chairnan having said he is
ready to present his report, the Speaker says: "Is It
your pleasure, Honourable Senators, to receive the
report?" "Bring in the Report." After the report

has been received and 1read by the Clerk, the

It is the practice to move concurrence in the
reports, of committees in certain cases. For instance,
the reports of printing are invariably agreed to, as
they contain recommendations for the printing and
distribution of documents, which must be duly
authorized by the house. Also reports containing
certain opinions or resolutions are frequently concurred in on motion. But when the report does not
contain any resolution, recommendation or other
propositions for consideration of the house, it does
not appear that any further proceedings with
reference to it as a report are necessary.

And further, at pages 478-479:
The reports of the committees relative to private
bills are not concurred in, as they are regulated by
special standing orders. Sometimes, however, when
one of these committees has made a special recommendation requiring the authority of the house to
give it effect, the concurrence of the bouse will be
formally asked and given.

Honourable senators, in the case in question the report contained no recommendation,
but was merely a carrying vehicle to bring
the bill back into the house. There was
nothing in the report to be concurred in, and
the bill was ordered to be placed on the Order
Paper for third reading today.
On the
motion for third reading of the bill, debate
can take place, or it can be moved "That the
bill be not now read a third time" but that
it be amended, or that the bill be referred
back to the committee for further consideration.
So, honourable senators, I confirm my
ruling of yesterday.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I accept that ruling, but
I suggest that from a reading of paragraph
39 of the Forms of Proceeding it would seem
clear that what I said yesterday was correct.
When you read paragraph 41, however, it
would appear that it contradicts paragraph
39; and when you read the paragraph governing reports of the Committee of the Whole,
you find it follows paragraph 41. I would
suggest that this house, in its anxiety to get
something to do, might appoint a committee
to go over the rules and forms of procedure,
so that we may avoid the confusion which
results when they contradict each other, as
paragraphs 39 and 41 certainly do.
I thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I thank your
assistant for giving me all these references.
I understood the matter, and after considering it'I came to the firm conclusion that we

really should revise our rules. That is all the
more necessary because some of them are
different from rules of the House of Commons
and of legislatures, with which many honourable senators are familiar. For instance, I

suggest to the leader of the government, probably at the beginning of next session, that
we appoint a committee to study our rules,
and if necessary to redraft them-certainly
tO redraft any that are mutually conflicting.
I agree, Mr. Speaker, that your ruling is
correct, on the authority of Bourinot, which
I had the pleasure of reading.

decision of that board and not by parliament.
If that be so, I claim that we are wasting our
time in bothering to discuss these bills at all.
But I disagree with that. I take the stand
that each house of parliament has the right
and duty to consider every one of those bills
as thoroughly as it may wish. For one thing,
so many pipe-line companiks are being incorporated that it is a moral certainty that some
of them will not be able to get the steel
necessary for the building of their lines.
It is proposed that this pipe-line be routed
to Seattle, and thence northerly to the city of
Vancouver. I point out that this manoeuvre
is just a little bait to make us believe that
this is a bill for the benefit of Canada, as
well as of the United States.
It is said by some that we in Senate should
not pay too much attention to bills seeking
the incorporation of a company such as this,
because the company must later go before
the Board of Transport Commissioners.
I
would point out when representatives of such
a company appear before the Board of Transport Commissioners, they invariably call the
attention of the board to the fact that parliament has granted them a franchise. I am
strongly of the view, therefore, that parliament should consider seriously these private
measures before passing them.
As to whether Vancouver will get any of
the oil carried by this pipe-line there is some
doubt. It should be said that the states of
Washington and Oregon will use something
like 225,000 barrels of oil per day, and that
Vancouver's requirements will be about 44,000
barrels per day. My information is that this

such-and-such a pipe-line company is to give
them the corporate right to apply to the
Board of Transport Commissioners for
permission to build a line, and to the
necessary authorities in the province of
Alberta for permission to export the gas or
the oil which they desire to export. We do
nothing more than that.
In the past year or two we have incorporated a number of these companies, and we
are in the process of granting charters to
several more. If we pick out one company
or one set of applicants, and say-as we have
done in a number of cases-"We will give
you this right," and pick out another set of
applicants and say "We won't give you this
right," on what basis are we proceeding?
As to the question of route, I think the
basic objection of my honourable friend from
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) to the
particular bill we are now discussing is that
it proposes to build a line partly through the
United States. Well, if honourable senators
will look at the bill they will see that it
does not contain a single word about
route; and the same remark applies to every
one of these bills that we have passed. The
matter of route is one which, by the general
Act, we have left entirely to the Board of
Transport Commissioners. It seems to me
that, having adopted the principle of agreeing
to allow certain people to organize themselves
for the purpose of applying to the board and
to the Alberta authorities, we should not now
take the attitude that we will not allow
certain other individuals to do it. On that
basis are we discriminating between the
people we have already incorporated and
those now applying for incorporation?
Hon. Mr. Reid: My point is that once you
give a charter to a company it is a financial
asset.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I think my honourable
friend from New Westminster is misapprehending the very clear distinction
between this kind of incorporation and the
kind which used to be granted to the
railway companies. Then parliament gave
the railways the power to build a line from,
say, Calgary to Edmonton, or from one place
to another. On the other hand, if honourable
senators will read this bill closely they will
see that all it does is to give the company
power to build such lines within the
Dominion of Canada as the Board of
Transport Commissioners will allow. There
are no special rights to build special routes
anywhere.
Hon. Mr. Haig: On what ground do you
think that the Board of Transport Commissioners could refuse an application?

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I would remind my
honourable friend that probably half a dozen
companies already incorporated are anxious
to build lines in the same direction, and I
think it is generally accepted that between
Alberta and the Pacific coast there is only
roorn for one line. The Board of Transport
Commissioners, and the Alberta authorities,
will have to have before them all these
applications, and they will have to choose the
one which they think is most satisfactory.
I believe I am correct in saying that last
year the Alberta government expressed the
view that, in so far as applications are concerned, the more the merrier because they
would then be better able to choose among
them.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Why could we not incorporate in our pipe-line bills a provision that
every company incorporated by charter or
otherwise would have to go before the Board
of Transport Commissioners?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: As I tried to explain,
that is in the general Act.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Why make these people
come here?
Hon.. Mr. Hugessen: As I endeavoured to
say a few minutes ago, the only reason for
them getting federal incorporation from us
is that that is the only way in which they can
get the right of expropriation.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Could that not be done
under the general Act?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes, that could be done.
Hon. Mr. Haig: As one who does not know
very much about business, the question
I ask myself is: How can these companies
hope to get from the Board of Transport
Commissioners a charter to build a pipe-line
to the coast? My honourable friend has quite
properly said that only one company can
get such a charter.
I agree with the remarks of the honourable
senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid). I cannot for the life of me imagine
a company bothering to build a line to Vancouver after running it through the United
States to Seattle. I certainly would not do
it if I could sell all my oil in Washington.
There is nothing in this Act compelling the
company to build the line to Vancouver, and
in my judgment nobody would build a line
from Alberta to Vancouver unless there was
the possibility of sending oil to Seattle. If
I were from Vancouver, I would fight to the
finish any bill which would result in pipelines being built to Seattle before going to
Vancouver. As far as the city of Winnipeg is

MARCH 1, 1951
concerned, the pipe-line will have to go
through there because of the contour of the
land.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: But the pipe-line will
not go to Winnipeg first?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Oh, yes, it will.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: It will be a branch
line running through Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I understand that $9 million
is being spent on a plant in my city.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: Yes, but the pipe-line
will be a branch line.
Hon. Mr. Haig: My point is that there is
no intervening community which will prevent the line from coming to Winnipeg. On
the other hand, if the line were to run to
Minneapolis first, it would never come to
Winnipeg. I was quite in favour of the bill
once I knew that the line was going to come
frorn Edmonton, through Regina, and then
east, because I knew it would have to pass
through
Winnipeg
either
directly
or
indirectly. I can see no reason why the Board
of Transport Commissioners would refuse a
licence, because it does not have to decide
whether the line should be built through
Canada or through the United States. That
is a political question.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Oh, no.
If My
honourable friend will permit me, there is
one factor which be is entirely overlooking.
The Board of Transport Commissioners is
duty bound to consider the ultimate cost of
these projects to the consumer public. That
is a big factor.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is not the point I am
trying to make. I am told that the line probably could be built cheaper if it were to run
through Seattle. That may not be true, but
I want to make sure that our Canadian cities
will be served by this line, and I am persuaded that if it passes through the United
States it will never be built to Vancouver.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Is it not true that the
Government of Alberta has announced, as a
public policy, that Canada will be served
before the United States?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I shall come to that. Don't
get excited.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I am not excited'.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Just keep your seat. If you
want to ask me questions, I shall answer them
later. Don't worry about that.
There are three ways to protect the
Canadian public. One way is for the Senate
not to pass this bill or others like it. I have
always been opposed to giving charters to
Americans. Now we have a concrete case.

My honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) claims that the Government of
Alberta and the Board of Transport Commissioners will protect the interests of the
people of Canada, but I think the Senate, if
it is to do anything at all, should do some
protecting.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: May I ask my honourable friend just one question?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I would prefer to finish my
argument.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I think what I have to
say would help my friend's argument.
Hon. Mr. Haig: All right, go ahead.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Was my honourable
friend ever opposed to grain interests from
the United States getting charters to operate
elevators in Canada?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I never knew of any such
charters. I do not know anything about that.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: My friend knows that
scores of American companies were interested
in Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, but they did not
operate through the Unitedi States.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Oh, yes they did.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: They operated through
Duluth and Minneapolis.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, they only sent to
Minneapolis the grain they needed.
Hon. Mr. Horner: They can grow a crop of
grain every year, the same is not true of oil.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is our duty to protect
the people of Canada, and I agree entirely
with what has been said by the honourable
senator fron New Westminster. He is thinking of his own province, and he knows, as
we all do, that if this company is selected
by the Board of Transport Commissioners, it
will never build a pipe-line beyond Seattle.
Tankers and other ships will be used to take
the oil to Vancouver. The Board of Transport Commissioners could refuse this charter;
but will it not be impressed by the fact that
the Senate has seen fit to grant it? If I were
a company lawyer appearing before the Board
of Transport Commissioners I would ring
the changes on that to no end.
I gather from what has been said, that the
best protection for the people of Canada will
be given by the Government of Alberta.
Apparently that government is determined
that Canadian users will benefit first from
this oil. I think the honourable senator from
Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) was on sound
grounds when he suggested that oil cannot be

SENATE
reproduced; that once an oil well runs dry it
is through. That does not apply so much to
forestry products or to grain.
Every year
they keep on growing a crop. In some years
it is better than in others, but there is always
a crop.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: What about soil fertility in Saskatchewan, down on the dust
plain;, for instance?
Hon. Mr. Haig:
I visited Saskatchewan
before my honourable friend ever did, and that
province has land which is just as fertile
now as it was forty or fifty years ago. Fifty
years ago I saw grain growing down in the
fertile Red River belt, which my honourable
friend from St. Jean Baptiste (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien) knows so well. Provided there
is a reasonable rainfall in the proper season,
land that is properly cultivated will yield
just as many bushels to the acre now as it
ever did. That is true of all three Prairie
provinces.
Down
near Lethbridge, for
example, when they get moisture at the
proper season they can produce just as good
a crop as they used to in the good old
days.
Personally, I have no objection to the incorporating of this particular company. What
I am objecting to is the principle in the
bill. My only regret is that more of us did
not take this stand when these pipe-line bills
first came here. I had no objection to the
bill sponsored by the junior senator from
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McKeen), because the
company which it incorporates will run its
line through Canadian territory. That is
the kind of thing I like, for I am eager to
see the development of our own resources in
our own country.
As I said once before, I do not criticize the
House of Commons one bit for objecting to
bills like this one. If some of them are not
passed, the only result will be failure of
some proposed companies to get a charter. I
think it is time that we called a halt to this
merry-go-round. I am persuaded that people
in Vancouver must ask themselves why it is
that the House of Commons has put up such
a flght against these bills and the Senate has
made no stand against them at all. So far
as I know, the honourable gentleman from
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) is the first
member of this house from his part of the
country to oppose these measures, and I
agree with him.

Hon. Mr. Euler: Will the leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) permit a question?
Hon. Mr. Haig:

Certainly.

Hon. Mr. Euler: This bill does not say
anything about the route of the pipe-line;
and is it not so that if the promoters of the

bill had not been frank enough te say in our
coimmittee the other day that they intended
to build to Seattle, this argument would never
have arisen?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I -will answer my honourable friend. We asked them that question.
My honourable friend seems to think that
the committee would have reported in favour
of the bill without having that information.
My opinion of the committee is not as low as
that, and I believe that if we had not been
given that information we would have thrown
the bill out.

Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, and I believe that the
senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler)
would have been one of the leaders in objecting to approval of the bill in the absence of
that information.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
if no one else wishes to speak, I should perhaps close the debate. The opposition to the
third reading of this bill is twofold in character. My honourable friend from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner) argues that he has no
confidence in the Board of Transport Commissioners. Well, if that is so, why did he
not say so when we were considering the
general Pipe Lines Act, which made that
board the final authority for the approval of
the :plans of pipe-line companies? Not only
did he not object to that measure, but this is
the first time that anyone bas suggested that
the board is not a suitable body to consider
applications from these companies.

Hon. Mr. Horner:

I thought that possibly

the pipe-lines would run along railway rights

of way.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The other objection that
has been raised is of course understandable;
but before I take it up may I deal with the
point of view of my honourable and good
friend
Reid)?

from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
He says that if the company is given

a charter it will construct a line to Seattle
and not go on to Vancouver at all, and therefore we should reject the bill. Now, is that a
valid reason for rejecting this bill?

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It sounds all right.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Well, I can understand
that some people would think it sounds all
right, but is it valid? What evidence has my
honourable friend from New Westminster
got te support his view that the applicants
for this bill are not speaking in good faith
when they say that they propose to build to
Vancouver?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Actual circumstances
indicate that to me.

MARCH 1, 1951
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I prefer to take the statement of the applicants for the bill, that they
intend to build to Vancouver. It may be that
they would be in a competitive position in
supplying oil to Vancouver, possibly in a
more favourable position than the applicants
for the bill which was given third reading a
few minutes ago.
The next reason set up against this bill is
that we should keep the oil in Canada. That
was the curious argument advanced by the
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig). He
says that this oil is a natural resource, which
in time will be exhausted, and therefore we
should not permit its export but should
conserve it for the Canadian people. Is my
friend willing to extend that argument to
the products of the very important base
metal mines, nickel mines, copper mines and
zinc mines that we have in Canada? Where
is the greater part of the product of the
International Nickel Company marketed?
In the United States. Would my honourable
friend argue that we should cease exporting
nickel to the United States, so that this
resource might be conserved for future
generations of Canadians? Would he make
the same argument with respect to copper?
A big percentage of the surplus copper produced in Canada is marketed in the United
States. That is true of zinc also.
Hon. Mr. Euler: And lead.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: If my honourable friend's
argument were logically extended and
applied, it would cause the closing of most of
the base metal mines in this country.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Those products are not
the same as oil at all.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: A few moments ago he
was arguing that if you take oil out of the
ground you cannot put it back. Does he
contend that copper ore which is taken out
of the ground can, in some mysterious way,
be replaced?
Hon. Mr. Haig: There is copper ore all
over Canada.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: My honourable friend's
argument is not sound. Besides, are we
going to have some reciprocity in these
matters?
Hon. Mr. Duff: "Atta boy"!
are saying something.
Some Ha:s. Senators:
Hon. Mr. Duff:
line.

Now you

Hear, hear.

Go ahead now on that

Hon. Mr. Crerar: Canada gets a great deal
of its oil from the United States.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen:

Coal too.

Hon. Mr. Crerar: Before these discoveries
of oil were made in the province of Alberta,
the central Prairie provinces got practically
all their oil from the United States.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: They do not need our oil.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That is not the question.
It may be to our advantage to ship oil to
Seattle in competition with American suppliers. Why in the name of common sense
should we refuse to export oil to the United
States when Eastern Canada is dependent
upon that country for a large part of its
supply? What would my honourable friends
think if the United States Congress were to
say: "We must conserve our supply of oil" Hon. Mr. Euler: And coal.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: -"for
the use of the
inhabitants of the United States", and for
that reason were to refuse to export it to
Canada?
Hon. Mr. Duff: An iron curtain.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: It is apparent that the
argument against this bill is not well founded.
It is not a valid argument, though it may
possibly appeal to some people who are nervous about our future supply of oi. From
all available information, Western Canada's
oil supply is sufficient to meet our needs for
a very long time.
I submit that it is good business to ship oil
from Alberta to a city like Seattle in return
for the oil that Eastern Canada is now getting
from points, in the United States, and I hope
that the house will see fit to give the bill
third reading.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
the question is on the motion of Honourable
Senator Crerar for third reading of this bill.
Is it your pleasure to concur in the motion?
Some Hon. Senators: Carried.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No.
Hon. Mr. Horner: On division.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed, on division.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING
Htm. A. L. Beaubien, for Hon. Mr. Fogo,
moved the second reading of Bill F-4, an Act
respecting a certain patent application of
George R. Hanks.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to validate a patent application
filed by Hanks in the Canadian Patent Office
on July 16, 1947. In 1947 parliament enacted

SENATE
some amendments to the Patent Act, including section 28A. The purpose of this section
was to permit the filing of patent applicants
in Canada by nationals of countries which
accord reciprocal privileges, and when the
nominal time within which such application
should have been filed had expired during
the war years. The section stipulated two
conditions to the receiving of such patent
applications, namely: (a) that such applications had to be filed not later than November
15, 1947; and (b) that the applicant for a
patent must request the Commissioner of
Patents to extend the time.
There is, honourable senators, a precedent
for a bill of this nature. In the session of
1949 a private bill on behalf of one Beyer was
obtained under almost identical circumstances. In the Beyer case, however, after the
Commissioner of Patents ruled that the
absence of a request for extension of time
precluded the granting of a patent, his decision was appealed to the Exchequer Court of
Canada, and it was held by Mr. Justice
Cameron that an application under section
28A must be accompanied by a request for
the extension of time. This judgment is
reported in 1949 Ex.C.R.115. The private
bill obtained on behalf of Beyer appears in
the Statutes of Canada, 1949, First Session,
as Chapter 26.
When the bill now before us has received
second reading, it is my intention to move
that it be referred to the Standing Committee
on Miscellaneous Private Bills, where full
information about it can be provided.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: What is the nature of
the patent?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: I am not prepared to
answer that question.
Hon. Mr. Haig: What does it deal with?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: The honourable senator
from Carleton (Hon. Mr. Fogo), who had to
leave for Toronto, asked me to move second
reading of the bill. Such information as my
honourable friends require will be supplied
to them when the bill is considered in
committee.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am going to insist that we
follow the rules closely. When I make my
objections known in committee, I do not want
to be told that I agreed to the principle of the
bill on second reading. I can understand that
my honourable friend from Provencher (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien) may not have all the facts
before him, butHon. Mr. Beaubien: I now have the information my honourable friend asked for, as
to the nature of the patent. It is described

as a "chain dredge bucket and method of
forming". That is not the old oaken bucket.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: You cannot patent that.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: What kind of bucket
is it?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: A dredge bucket.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: For digging ditches.
Hon. Mr. Haig: If I agree to second reading
of this bill I trust my friend will not hold
it against me in committee.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I would not do that.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I think the rule is quite
clear that in giving second reading to a
private bill we are not agreeing to it in
principle in the same way as we would be in
the case of a public bill.
Hon. Mr. Haig: This bill involves a principle. Parliament has passed a general law
as to the procedure which should be followed
with respect to patents, and we are now asked
by this bill to override the general law. For
that reason we should consider the measure
most carefully.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I fully agree with the
observation the leader opposite has made, but
I believe I am right in saying that the passage
of a motion for second reading of a private
bill does not commit honourable senators to
the principle of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: My honourable friend
will recall that by reason of the war some
patents were allowed to lapse. We should
make a study of this bill, and if the applicant
is entitled to have his patent reinstated, there
is surely no reason why we should not pass
the measure.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Would the deputy leader
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) be good enough to have
the rule regarding private bills looked up?
My understanding in the other house was
that when a bill had been given second reading its principle was adopted, with the exception that a member could reserve his right
to object on the motion for third reading.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I shall be very glad to
look up the rule. My understanding has
always been as I have stated it; but the point
raised is an important one, and I shall be
prepared to answer it next week.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time, on division.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Beaubien moved that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills.
The motien was agreed to.

printing cannot be proceeded with, with leave
of the Senate, I move third reading now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bills
were read the third time, and passed, on
division.
THE SENATE AND ITS WORK
MOTION-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. Robertson for the appointment of a
special committee to inquire into and report
upon how in its opinion the Senate may
make its maximum contribution to the welfare of the Canadian people.
Hon. Paul H. Bouffard: Honourable senators,
I am not sure that we are following the
proper course to reform the Senate. After
hearing the discussion this afternoon, it seems
to me that a daily application of oil would
be the proper remedy!
May I confess that my first impression
when reading this motion was that it contained, at least implicitly, certain criticisms

of this house and its members; and, from
what I heard, this was also the general
impression created by it. Furthermore, its
introduction by our leader (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) would seem to imply the government's approval and support. The leader
made it clear, however, that his motion
expressed his personal views.
Under such condition, it merely invites
a frank and earnest discussion of our problems, and of the ways and means of solving
them in the best interest of the Canadian
people. The thought given to the matter and
the number of speeches delivered in the
course of the last three weeks indicate the
willingness of our members to examine the
situation carefully.
There may be differences of opinion as to
the wisdom and opportuneness of certain
reforms which have been suggested. Some
may feel that the Senate is adequately and
efficiently fulfilling its functions, as determined by the Canadian constitution; others
would favour the alteration of our internal
procedure in order to broaden the scope of
our work; and, finally, others most sincerely
believe that some constitutional changes
would be appropriate. All this indicates the
wide interest aroused by the motion.
Canada is in full evolution. Her resourees
are being tremendously developed; industrial
and commercial enterprises are currently
undergoing considerable changes. What legislative, administrative, judicial or other public
body should not, at this time, review its own
organization and adapt itself to the present
situation? As a matter of fact, the House of
Commons has increased its membership, created new departments and appointed many
parliamentary assistants. Provincial governments have done likewise. Municipal and
school administrations have been considerably
enlarged.
If one compares the period of fifty years
that immediately followed confederation with
the last thirty years, he fully realizes that
the first period was nothing but a mere
preparation for the great part Canada would
be called upon to play in the mid-century
expansion. From a budget of a few million
dollars, Canada bas passed to yearly expenditures of $3 billion. We are indeed very far
from the end of the 19th century, when the
Flynn Administration was overthrown in the
Province of Quebec because its budget had
reached the fabulous sum of $3 million, and
when Sir Wilfrid Laurier upbraided the then
Conservative government for federal estimates bordering on $30 million. Since that
time our population bas increased threefold.
Canada has become one of the leading exporting nations of the world. Her industrial and

SENATE
commercial expansion places her among the
outstanding countries of our time. Participation in international activities has imposed
new responsibilities upon us. In view of such
development, would not this house be justified in re-appraising its organization and
studying its situation to find out any possible way of contributing more directly to the
welfare of the country?
It gives me great pleasure to pay tribute to
those who have already taken part in this
most interesting debate. I have listened with
deep interest to the suggestions put forward
by the leader of the government, the leader
of the opposition, the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), the
honourable senator from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris) and others. They have all
dealt with the matter in a way that deserves
our warmest congratulations. Their study
was enlightening and complete. It would
therefore seem useless to add anything to
their statement of the principles that have
inspired the creation of the Canadian Senate.
May I, however, repeat that in accordance
with these principles, the Senate is a semijudicial body whose functions do not include
any active participation in the administration
of the country. Among our principal duties,
I would like to mention the following: Careful study of the various aspects of new
legislation, its revision, amendment, improvement, etc.; protection of the freedom of institutions; maintenance of minority rights;
prevention or delay of any arbitrary legislation, sometimes hurriedly drafted, unless and
until it becomes evident that such legislation
corresponds to the will of the majority of
the Canadian people.
The Senate constantly renders great services to the nation. Previous speakers have
already pointed out numerous cases where
laws were changed, amended, improved,
delayed or rejected for the sole purpose of
serving the interests of the Canadian people.
The leader of the opposition has reminded us
of the millions of dollars of the people's
money that have been saved through the
intervention of this house. Only recently the
Senate held up a piece of legislation, thus
giving time to the Supreme Court to decide
on its constitutionality; and to at least one
province-that to which I have the honour to
belong-to amend its own legislation in
order to safeguard the interests of its
population.
These are some of the reasons why leftist
parties, in all countries, tend to change and
restrict the powers of upper houses. Such
independent branches of governments may
impede their arbitrary legislation and! give
the people time to ponder the true meaning
If
and consequences of such measures.

England is today going through a critical
period of her history, and if her present
government passes extravagant laws, is it not
because the House of Lords has become
powerless?
The Canadian Senate does not aim to
oppose the clearly indtcated will of the
people. I would even go further, and say
that certain measures, which we might consider as arbitrary and, contrary to the best
interests of the people, would be passed by
the Senate if the majority of Canadians
indicated their approval of such measures.
In certain cases, the duty of the Senate
will consist of delaying its acceptance of such
legislation so as to allow Canadians to form
and express an opinion. No other governmental institution can serve the interests of
the country in a more flexible and democratic
way.
I need not remind you off the great principles outlined by the Fathers of Confederation-Sir John Macdonald, Cartier, Brown,
Campbell, Taché and the others whose names
appear among Canada's most prominent and
honoured figures. Their views cannot be
ignored. They convey the lessons of the past
and must remain the guiding principles of
our future. Some of those great Canadians
were out-and-out federalists, while others
were die-hardi provincialists. Nevertheless
they came to an agreement, and it resulted
in the Canadian charter, which proved to be
sufficiently flexible to permit the tremendous
expansion of the country. In less than a
century, Canada has become a leading nation
of the world.
Does this mean that Canadian institutions
should be static? By all means, no. In fact,
our constitution has already been substantially amended. Should the provisions of the
charter relating to the Senate be modified?
Before any steps are taken in this direction,
the matter must be carefully studied. The
Canadian Senate-if one of its members may
be permitted to say so-represents one of
the best cross-sections of the country. Its
membership is composed of professional
men, merchants, industrialists, farmers, and
so on. Some members are highly versed in
economics and can readily analyse the possible consequences of proposed legislation
upon the national economy; others are very
close to the masses and can voice their needs
and describe their hardships. All walks of
life are represented in this chamber, and
each one of us brings into the debates the
knowledge and experience he has acquired
in his own field of endeavour.
Too many Canadians are unaware of the
work performed by this house. The Senate
could, of course, make a more vivid impression

MARCH 1, 1951

on our population by exceeding its constitutional limitations, or by being more concerned with publicity in the conduct of its
debates; but thank God! such are not the
aims of the Senate. Senators will continue
to work quietly, in this house and in its
various committee rooms.
The opinion has been expressed that the
Senate should take over additional responsibilities and assume a bigger share of the new
activities of the government, thus relieving
the House of Commons of part of its heavy
load of work. This is undoubtedly a matter
that requires serious consideration. May I
state here that the Senate and its members
are prepared to assume whatever additional
responsibilities that may devolve upon them,
and they are willing to make any sacrifices
that may be required from them. It is not for
us, however, to decide whether the responsibilities of the Senate are to be broadened,
and, if so, what should be the extent of its
new functions.
In view of its ever-growing responsibilities,
the government has found it necessary to
increase the number of its ministers and to
create new departments. Whilst the Fathers
of Confederation deemed it expedient to
entrust prominent members of this house
with portfolios, this has not been the practice
for many years. If such policy was not contrary to the principles of responsible government in the past, I do not see why it could
not be followed at the present time. By
resuming this practice, the government would
allow this house to take a greater share in the
administration of the country. Again, I say,
it is not for the Senate alone to formulate
such policy. The additional responsibilities
facing the government have already added
considerably to the duties of the cabinet
ministers, and have resulted in the appointment of parliamentary assistants. They take
an active part in the administration of the
various departments, and participate in the
drafting of their legislation. Why could not
such a burden be shared by members of the
Senate?
For more than fifteen years Canada has
enjoyed full extra-territorial jurisdiction. It
has the exclusive control of its external
affairs. Ambassadors have been appointed to
many countries, and trade commissioners
represent Canada all over the world. As a
member of the United Nations Organization,
Canada has taken a leading position in world
affairs. Her representatives enjoy the reputation of outstanding statesmanship. Our Prime
Minister, the Right Honourable Louis S. St.
Laurent, has become the symbol of the perfect democratic leader.
Sorne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Bouffard: His sound judgment,
his experience, his knowledge, and the sincerity with which he is contributing to the
establishment of lasting peace in the world,
make him one of the most prominent international figures.
Some members of this house have already
been delegates to international councils and
have fulfilled their task with honour and
dignity. I should like to take the opportunity
to congratulate the honourable senator for
Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon) on the splendid
part he played at the last meeting of the
United Nations. Could not members of the
Senate participate to a greater extent in the
many duties brought about by our international relations? Here again it is not for us
to decide, but it may serve a good purpose
to express our willingness to serve and thus
to help carry the heavy load of governmental
responsibility.
Let us now examine the question of
reforms. Some of us would favour compulsory retirement at the age of 75, while
others would keep it voluntary. In both cases,
retirement would be encouraged by a contributory pension fund. I would not hesitate
to support such a reform if I were to see any
advantage to it. Since I first came here nearly
five years ago it has been from the senior
members of this house that I have received
the most valuable and reasonable advice and
counsel. I have great respect for senior senators, and I consider their wisdom and experience to be great assets to this house.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: We have been compared to civil servants whose retiring age
for superannuation we established at 65. It
must not be forgotten that we were only
enforcing an agreement. We have been compared also to the few industrial workers who
are pensioned at the age of 65 or 70. There
again, in most cases the pensions are the
result of agreements. Such comparisons,
therefore, do not seem very fair. Our chamber
is an important part of the nation's council.
Why should it be the only part of such council
whose members would be compelled to retire
at a specific age? The work of the members
of the House of Commons and of the cabinet
requires more physical resistance than ours.
Who would suggest that they should leave
at the age of 65? Have not the Macdonalds,
the Lauriers, the Bordens, the Kings, the St.
Laurents led the country to its present prosperity when they had passed the statutory
retirement age for civil servants? In all such
cases, the country would have lost the benefit
of most valuable leadership had it applied
the civil service retirement policy. In fact,

SENATE
the most important qualifications required for
statesmanship are experience and sound
judgment, which normally belong to maturity.
Moreover, on looking into the business
world one finds that the boards of directors
of most enterprises are composed of seasoned
executives. How much more important it is
to have them in the greater councils of the
nation! In other words, to use the language
of a member who spoke before me, they
should not be considered as "excess baggage"
here, but rather as important and necessary
advisers at the helm of the ship. We must
admit that age sometimes limits the ability
of faithful servants to fulfil their duties. I
trust, however, that ways and means will be
found to permit those here to retire gracefully and honourably.
Honourable senators, our leader expressed
the opinon that the Senate might elect its own
leader. The unanimous opinion of all those
who have spoken before me is clearly against
this proposal. It is most objectionable from
more than one point of view. I do not intend
to discuss the matter any further. Besides,
the Senate has, at the present time, full
power to carry out such a proposal if it were
considered advantageous. May I repeat what
was said before by the honourable senator
from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) that
we respect our leader; we know that he
works to give our chamber prestige and
reputation; and the sooner he becomes convinced of the confidence we have in him, the
better it will be.
Let us now turn our attention to the
appointment of senators. Three methods
seem practicable. First, appointment by the
Governor General in Council which has been
the method followed since Confederation. It
may be for life or for a definite period of
time. Second, nomination by the provinces
or other important public bodies, such as
universities. This system has been in effect
in some foreign countries.
Third, direct
election by electors at large, or by a limited
number of voters whose qualifications would
be established by law.
Discussing immediately the third method,
I say say that I do not believe that an elective Senate would meet with the approval of
any important part of the Canadian people,
and it would be contrary to the agreed and
basic principles upon which the Canadian
constitution has been founded. We have no
need for two chambers having identical
powers and whose members would be
essentially dependent upon the electorate.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Quite right.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: What public body
would then have the freedom of action necessary to protect the rights of minorities? I

know that my own province would strongly
oppose such a policy. No confederation
would have been possible, no agreement
would have been reached, without the Senate
as constituted, with its freedom from active
politics and its power to oppose any serious
threat facing the nation or its unity. Quebec,
as one of the ten provinces of the confederation, is a minority. Its language, its faith and
its laws are the language, the faith and the
laws of a minority. The representatives of
Quebec, in 1867, agreed upon a form of government which was more likely to safeguard
the rights to which they were-as we are
today-so profoundly attached.
Moreover, the Fathers of Confederation
were almost unanimous upon the basic
principle of an appointed senate.
That
decision was not arrived at without the benefit of experience. Macdonald, Cartier and
Brown had the experience of an elective
upper house. May I be permitted to remind
honourable senators that in 1841 the union
government was composed of an elected
assembly and a council whose members were
appointed. By 1846 the policy was changed
and the members of the upper house were to
be subsequently elected. That was found so
unsatisfactory that when confederation was
established nobody hesitated in coming back
to the principle of an appointed upper house.
If we examine and study the constitutions
of other countries we find many upper bouses
indirectly elected. Their members are often
appointed either by the provinces, the townships, the universities or other important
public bodies. We find very few directly
elected by the voters of the country. I feel
gratified that no member of this house, up
to now, has expressed the opinion that an
elected Senate should replace the nominated
one. I believe that the majority of our
population shares the same viewpoint.
What about our present method of appointment? It is not perfect. It sometimes results
in too large a representation of one political
party. It means that important political
groups are not represented. The situation
would seem undesirable, but of course it can
be corrected without any constitutional
amendments.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Change the government.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: The Governor General
in Council is at liberty to appoint whomever
he finds suitably qualified, regardless of
political affiliations. If such a possibility is
recognized by the constitution, it does not
seem practicable of application.
I listened with a great deal of interest to
the speech of my honourable friend from Van-

MARCH 1, 1951
couver South (Hon. Mr. Farris). He suggested
that one-third of our members be appointed
by the provinces.
Hon. Mr. Duff: He is wrong there.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: This does not meet
with the approval of the majority of our
members. It is, however, worthy of the
greatest consideration. Taking Canada as a
whole, each province is in itself a minority.
Would it be so bad if each of those minorities were able to designate a certain percentage of the membership of this house? These
men would bring to our deliberations a different point of view. They could serve as
excellent liaison officers between the provinces and the Government of Canada. This
would also mean that all important political
parties would be represented in the Senate.
Furthermore, if the government of a country
is to be truly democratic, its decisions and
policies must be open to public discussion as
well as to constructive criticism, and the
members of its parliament, in both houses,
should reflect the views most widely spread
in the country. Should the provinces be
given the opportunity of designating representatives in the Senate, our chamber would
offer a more accurate picture of public
opinion throughout Canada. I cannot think
of a more constructive method of appointing
the members of our house. If such a policy
were adopted the federal government would
retain the right to appoint the majority of
our members and at the same time the provinces would enjoy the privilege of designating a number of representatives who would
be in close association with them and their
local problems. It could have a stimulating
effect upon our debates. Legislation approved
by those representatives would carry the
approval of such important public bodies as
the provincial governments, and in case of
non-approval, they would at least have had
the opportunity of expressing their viewpoint
here.
What percentage of the house should be
designated by the provinces? Should it be
one-third, or one-quarter? One-third has been
suggested, but I would like to remind my
colleagues that one-third is the equivalent of
34 members out of 102, and that such a proportion could often control our decisions.
Hon. Mr. Duff: We would have a dog-fight
all the time, if we had thirty-four Tories
here.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: It might be good for
us if we had a dog-fight more often. We had
a little cat-fight this afternoon, and it was
not bad.
Hon. Mr. Reid:

But some do not like it.

Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I am in favour of a
little more action.
This important aspect of the suggested
reform should receive our utmost consideration. In our desire to improve our constitution, we must not forget that the Senate is
part of the Canadian Parliament and that it
should retain its federal character.
For the reasons already submitted, may
I suggest also that the mandate of provincially-designated senators be temporary, and
not exceed the life of the legislature that
designates them.
I should like to summarize my remarks on
this subject as follows:
First, the provincial cabinet would, by
order-in-council, suggest three persons, of
whom one would be selected and appointed
by the Governor General-in-Council; and
second, such appointments would be made on
a temporary basis, not to exceed the life
of the provincial legislature at the suggestion
of which they are made.
Another improvement could consist of
planning in advance of each session the work
to be presented to the members. For that
purpose a steering committee could be set
up which would meet a few weeks before
the session. The cabinet serves as steering
committee for the House of Commons. I
believe that we also should have a similar
organization which, under the direction of our
leader, would receive suggestions and compile them so as to be in a position to submit
at the beginning of the session a detailed
program of our activities. No organization,
be it governmental, municipal, industrial or
commercial, can work properly unless its
activities are carefully planned and co-ordinated. I believe this is even more essential
in our chamber. In fact, our members are
scatterèd all over this vast country and they
have little oportunity to get together between
sessions. Under our present procedure we
attend sessions of parliament, lasting about
six months, without any planning being done
beforehand. The result is that for the first
five or six weeks of the session we consider
details of no major importance. I believe
that if we had a planning committee we could
get down to work right at the beginning.
I wish to say, Honourable Senators, how
happy I am that this motion has come before
this house. It has provided an opportunity
for a most interesting discussion. May I
suggest, however, that once the debate is
over and every member has had the opportunity of expressing his views, there would be
little use in taking the matter up before a
committee. Since a question of principle
is involved, it should be discussed publicly.
Should any of the proposed changes be

SENATE
decided upon, a committee could then be set
up to work out the details. For the time
being, however, I take the liberty of suggesting that the honourable leader withdraw his
motion.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: In conclusion, may
I say that I am very ýproud of having been
called to this house. If, without violating the
basic principles under which it has been
established, some changes would permit us
to make a greater contribution to the welfare
of Canada, I am sure everyone would approve
of them.
I thank honourable members for listening
to me for so long, and I hope that some day
this debate will bear fruit.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lacasse: May I ask whether my
honourable friend mentioned the exact
proportion which, in his opinion, nominees
of provincial governnents should bear to
the total membership of the Senate? I was
expecting to hear a definite figure. Perhaps
I missed it.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: No. I did not set any
proportion. I merely remarked that in my
opinion thirty-four in a house of a hundred
and two was a little too large. I did not go
into such a detail, because I think that if a
reform of this kind is to be made the question
of the proportion of provincial to federal
nominees should be a matter of study. It
may be that one-fourth would be enough;
it may be that each province should appoint
a definite number of senators. I think that
matter should be left to a committee to decide
when the time cornes. It is not a detail that
I wish to go into in discussing this resolution.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The question I wish'to put
is one in which I am much interested. What
does the honourable senator suggest should
happen if, an appointment having been made
by a provincial government, three months
later the legislature was dissolved? The
suggested that the
honourable senator
nominee or the appointee would sit in the
Senate as long as the government that
selected him remained in office.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: He would lose his seat
as soon as the government which had
designated him was defeated. If that government were again returned to power, he
could be renominated; but if at any time the
government were defeated, or another government established, the new government
would designate those who for the time
being would represent the province.

Hon. Mr. Haig: That would not do.
Hon. Alexander B. Baird: Honourable
Senators, I shall endeavour to confine what
I have to say in this debate to as few words
as possible. My real reason for rising at this
time is to say a word from the viewpoint of
my province of Newfoundland, which this
year, for the first time, has its full representation in this chamber.
I have been wondering about the beginnings of this body, eighty-four years ago. It
was set up as part of the parliamentary
machinery of this country as the result of
the patriotic deliberations of a group of men,
known to us now as the Fathers of Confederation. Its first membership was entirely
non-partisan in character, having been
selected largely from both sides of the
executive councils of that day. Our present
representation from Newfoundland was likewise selected without regard to previous
party affiliations.
You from the other provinces have the
advantage over us of having had eighty-four
years of experience in this Chamber; but it
has occurred to me during the course of this
debate that we, in starting from scratch in
1951, may possibly have some advantages
over you.
I have been wondering what would have
been the reaction upon the minds and feelings
of the pioneer members of the Senate, if at
their first session here they had been confronted by a resolution similar to the one
which has been discussed here for the past
ten days. Would they have had misgivings
about their future? Would they have thought
that somebody
had made a mistake
somewhere?
The men who laid the parliamentary foundations of Canada in those days, I have always
understood, were animated and inspired by
the great idea of rearing a nation of Canadians
in the vast heritage known as the Dominion.
We have always had that idea in Newfoundland, and even before we became the tenth
province in this federation, many of our sons
and daughters had migrated here to make
their marks and assist in the building of a
nation on these shores. We have been proud
to join with you in the great task of making
confederation a success.
There is little doubt in my mind about
Canada's great future. For that reason I
cannot attach any great measure of importance to the resolution which has been receiving so much recent attention. I say that in
all deference to those who have contributed
many excellent speeches on this subject.

MARON il 1951
The resolution expresses the desire for a
maximum of efficiency in the efforts of the
Senate. Just what is involved in the phrase
"maximum efficiency"l? I do not know. The
Senate, 1 suppose, may be regarded as a piece
of parliamentary machinery. A machine in
order ta be efficient must flot become obsolete.
Possibly the idea of obsolescence was implied
when someone emphasized that an age imit
of 75 be applied ta ail its member parts. But
I recali that Mr. G. K. Chesterton once said
that efficiency consisted- of knowing ail about
a machine except what it was for. Is it not
reasonable ta ask whether or not those who
would repair and patch up the senatorial
machinery have any new purposes or functions for it ta perform. after the proposed
overhauling has been d-one? Will it go on
doing the same kind of work that it has been
doing? My friend from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris) said that the Senate did
flot get enough work ta, do. Wiil it do any
more, if a limited term of membership is
fixed, and Senators are "turfed out" at 75?
That word, "turfed" may seem somewhat
f oreign ta some honoirrable members: ta us
in Newfoundland it is quite commonplace.
If Newfoundland., when it decided ta enter
the Canadian federation, had taken another
road which was open at the time, and which
some people were inclined ta take, and had
joined the federal union. o! the United States,
we would have been represented by as many
senators as New York or any other state, in
a body that has a voice in determining foreign
policies, in appointing embassadors, court
j udges, and the deputy administrative heads
of governinent departments.

80713--15

What is mea-nt by maximum eficiency?
After reform, what?
Now, do flot mistake me, I am qulte satisfied with the course that was follawed by my
province; and I am certainly not trying to
amend the B.N.A. Act on the floor of this
chamber. I am jusrt trying ta point out that
the supporters o! this resolution wiil have ta
deal with a great deal more than the personnel
of the Senate if any real meaning 1.3 to be
given to the words "maximum efficiency".
As I have said aiready, I amn confident o!
the future success of Canada; and I should
like ta suggest that honourable senators proceed to, dto as well as they can, the work that
is at hand.
In conclusion, may I also suggest that the
distinguished Prime Minister of this country
and the premiers of the provinces be supported with understanding and sympathy in
their efforts ta arrange the constitution in
such a way as ta serve the interests o! unity
in Canada. These men, at this time, are aur
Fathers of re-Confederation. Let us go forward with them. I, for one, have na fear of
the Senate rising as a barrier between me and
the people a! Newfoundland. My desire and
theirs, I amn sure, is ta go along with you
towards those broacl new horizons pictured
for us by our founders over 80 years -ago.

THE SENATE AND ITS WORK
MOTION-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, March
1, the adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. Robertson for the appointment of a special
committee to inquire into and report upon
how in its opinion the Senate may make its
maximum contribution to the welfare of the
Canadian people.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Honourable members, I
am requested to announce that the honourable senator for Peterborough (Hon. Mrs.

MARCH 6, 1951
Fallis), in whose name the debate was
adjourned, is ill and unable to speak tonight.
Hon. J. Wesley Stambaugh: Honourable
senators, I should like first to congratulate
the leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) on the courage, foresight and
initiative which he showed in moving this
resolution. I wonder if when he moved it
he had any idea of the beating he was going
to take. I should also like to .congratulate
the deputy leader (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) for his
part in the debate. I enjoyed his speech
very much. especially the latter part, when
under the needling of members of this
chamber he really got worked up and said
exactly what he thought. In describing the
resolution he used the word "innocuous". I
was not familiar with the word, and upon
looking it up in the dictionary I found that
it has several meanings. I am a little curious
to know which meaning the honourable
senator would have us apply to the word.
Al who spoke against the resolution commenced their remarks by congratulating the
leader and expressing admiration for and
confidence in him, and then proceeded to point
out what a mistake he had made in moving
the resolution. Now, there are no reservations behind my congratulations on his actions
in this regard. The moving of the resolution
has proved to me that the honourable gentleman is abreast of the times and is in tune
with the thinking public. I do not, however,
agree with some of the suggestions he
incorporated in his remarks supporting the
resolution. Indeed, I doubt if he is prepared
to support them. I think he deliberately used
a scattergun which threw his ideas in every
direction, and each of us was hit by one or
more of these ideas. But I do agree with the
principle of the resolution.
It might be well to remind ourselves what
the resolution proposes:

eighty years ago, and have pointed out how
well it has functioned. With this I agree. But
when they say it is perfect, and cannot be
improved, I must disagree. One honourable
senator has given as his reason for opposing
this resolution that he does not understand
the meaning of "maximum efficiency." Surely
he must have been fooling.
I can see no reason for opposing this resolution. Why should we not consider ways and
means of increasing our efficiency so that we
may, in the words of the resolution, make our
"maximum contribution"? Cast your minds
back to conditions -at the time of confederation and compare them with those of the
present day.
Think what changes and
improvements have been made in our
various institutions-in education, in agriculture, in industry, in banking, in transportation,
in communications. Reflect on the advances
which have been made in medicine. Compare
the old general store with the modern department store. Consider our status in the world
then and now. At the time of Confederation
Canada was almost unknown. Today, in
every respect except, perhaps, population,
Canada is one of the foremost nations of the
world. Is anyone so artless, so innocent, so
naïve as to believe that the Fathers of Confederation were inspired to the degree that
they could form an institution so perfect that
no improvement could be made in later years?
I cannot believe it. No one was ever that
good. Even the twelve apostles in their own
generation found it necessary to improve their
methods.
What are we afraid of? Have we something to cover up?
I know that the public at large are not
fully informed about the work we do. Even
in the short time I have been here many
important pieces of legislation have been

SENATE
the Senate the older you get the better you
become. One honourable senator thinks we
should live to be 150. Any person who claims
to believe that nonsense is not facing the
facts of life. The very idea that men are more
competent when they are old is ridiculous.
There is in the lives of men, as elsewhere, a
law of diminishing returns; a time when we
begin to slow down and become less effective.
This is true in the mental sense as well as the
physical. We cannot clearly define that
age, for it is not the same in all people. We
can, however, fairly well define the age
-when at least the majority begin to weaken
physically. We can also define to a somewhat less close degree the age when the
majority begin to weaken mentally. Scientists are fairly well agreed that this is
between the age of sixty-five and seventydive years. In the various professions, in
industry, and in every occupation, it is a
recognized fact that there is a time in our
lives when because of advancing age we are
no longer fully capable of performing our
regular duties. There are various exceptions to
this rule, and as instances the names of
Winston Churchill, Thomas A. Edison and
Connie Mack have been mentioned. But in the
present debate if you find it necessary to
mention exceptions you weaken your case,
because we must legislate for the majority, or
for the average, not for the exception.
However, let us look at one of these exceptional men and see how he stands up. Take,
for instance, Connie Mack, the manager of
the Philadelphia Athletics baseball team.
When he was in his prime, some twenty-five
or thirty years ago, the Athletics often finished
in the top division of their league, and some
years they were even pennant winners. As
Connie Mack grew older the standing of the
Athletics fell lower and lower, until finally
we find Connie Mack an old man and the
Athletics at the bottom of the league.
Connie Mack's position has been comparable
to that of the members of this Senate, in that
he could not be fired-not because he had a
life appointment, but because he owned a
majority of the stock in the Athletics baseball club.
I very definitely advocate the principle of
a retirement age for senators. The federal
legislatures
provincial
and
parliament
endorsed this principle when, by granting old
age pensions, they helped to make it possible
for people to retire at the age of seventy. The
majority of people have passed their zenith
at that age. Parliament again endorsed this
principle when it set the retirement age for
federal Supreme Court judges at seventyfive. I do not remember that any senator
protested against this stipulation when that
particular question was before this house.

Many of the speakers opposing this resolution
have stated that the Senate serves as a judicial body. Well, if no protest was made here
against a retirement age for Supreme Court
judges, why should there be a protest against
application of the same principle to senators?
Long before I was appointed to the Senate
I thought it a good idea to have a retirement
age for senators, and since I have been here
I have seen nothing to change my opinion.
One of the surest signs of age is given when a
group of old fellows get together and tell each
other how good they are. They talk of the
wondrous deeds that they and their associates
have performed in the past. The aged look
backward, others look forward. Old men are
satisfied with things as they are, or they
sometimes suggest that things were much
better in the past. Younger men are anxious
for change. They demand improvements;
they believe things can be made better. Our
leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson) has shown himself to be one of these younger men. Just a
few days ago I read in one of our dailies that
a former Bank of Montreal employee had died
at the age of ninety-five, after enjoying
retirement for thirty years. What is the
matter with these bankers? Has no one ever
told them that the older men get the more
efficient they become? In industry, in financial institutions, in the teaching profession
and amongst federal and provincial government employees, it is a well-known fact that
in order to carry on efficiently it is necessary
to have a compulsory retirement age. The
only place I have ever heard this principle
opposed is in this Senate.
I well remember that when the Right
Honourable W. L. Mackenzie King decided
to retire he gave as his main reason "advancing age." He gave other reasons, but age was
the chief one. He mentioned that he tired
more easily than in former years. I feel
his remarks could be summed up in a single
sentence. He felt that no one should attempt
to hold public office after he is no longer
capable of fully performing his duties. I was
shocked at the very thought of Mr. King
retiring. It seemed hardly possible that we
could have a Liberal party without Mr. King
as leader. I wanted him to carry on. I was
certain we could never get another leader as
good as Mr. King, but we did. Time has
shown how much wiser Mr. King was than
I. If we all had the wisdom of Mackenzie
King there would be no need for a compulsory
retiring age.
It has been suggested that the Senate
would lose some capable men if all senators
were to retire at the age of seventy-five. I
realize this is true, but one must remember
that there are many men in Canada just as
able as we are, and there exist the same good

MARCH 6. 1951
reasons for appointing themn as there were
for appointing us. I doubt if the Prime Minister would have any difficulty in finding
people wlling and able to take our places.
A compulsory retirernent age would do
much to overcome, though it would not
entirely eliminate, another serious drawback
in our set-up. I have in mind those senators
who are more conspicuous by their absence
than by their presence. Some senators attend
here only one or two days a session. They are
not making any contribution to, the work of
parliament at ail-on the contrary, they are
keeping out those who could and would make
a valuable contribution. One senator, whose
desk is close to mine, I rarely see, and
it is not aid age which keeps him away. A
few senators are regular in attendance, but
that is about ail you can say for thern. I
amn not suggesting that in order to make a
maximum contribution it is necessary to be
on your feet as often as is the honourable
member frorn New Westminister (Hon. Mr.
Reid). I know that some members who have
littie to say in the Senate chamber are active
in committee. The senators whorn I criticize
are not active either in this chamber or in
committee. You will find that year after
year the membership of committees includes
the narnes of sorne senators who have neyer
attended a single meeting of those committees.
The very fact that two of our rnost important
committees, the Finance Committee and the
Banking and Commerce Comrnittee, have
memberships, of forty-nine or fifty and a
quorum of only nine, shows that we do not
even expect ail senators to do their duty. I
realize that I arn referring to a srnall minority,
but such conduct as I have mentioned is an
insult 'to those honourable mernbers who are
here day after day, faithfully performing
their duties. I arn happy and proud to be
associated with those members, but I arn
ernbarrassed to the same extent by those who
are clearly shirking their duty.
I suggest that a senator who for other than
reasons of health does not attend at least
haif of the sittings in any session, should
resign. I speak of "reasons of health"' as
being valid reasons for non-attendance. However, if the illness of a senator is of a permanent nature, Sa that he is not likely to recover
sufficiently to carry out his regular duties,
then he also shouid resign. I suggest that
a senator who is narned on a carnmittee and
does not attend a mai ority of the committee's
meetings held during the session should be
struck off the list and not again placed on
that committee.
No doubt some honourable senators will
think my suggestion is too drastic. I do not
think it is. What are we here for-for fun?
How about the taxpayers who pay our

indemnity, those people whorn we are supposed to represent? Are they not entitled ta
some consideration? One honourable senator
thinks the Angel of Death works fast enough
to eliminate the ilîs I have mentioned. I do
not think Sa; I think he is too slow.
Some Hon. Senaloru: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. S±ambaugh: I like to be on the
side of the Angel, and I amn prepared ta help
him out a littie.
Hon. Mr. Grant: Would you like him ta
drap around and see yau?
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: Well, no doubt he
will, somne time.
Hon. Mr. Fraser: You are asking for
trouble.
Han. Mr. Siambaugh: I arn prepared, to
meet it.
Hon. Mr. Fraser: I have a potent question
that I should like to put ta you, but I shail
leave it for a future time.
Hon. Mr. Sfambaugh: I shall be glad ta
try to answer it.
Another senator thinks we should not even
discuss this subi ect of Senate reforrn, that
we should leave this matter to be decided
at the Federal-Provincial Conference and
should give our opinion only if .asked. This
looks ta me like "passing the buck"'.
Honourable senators, I have covered only
three points, where I arn certain improvement can be made, and I have suggested
how we may do this. I do flot see how anyone
can reasonably oppose these suggestions. If
we decide ta put thern into effect it will
greatly improve aur efficiency and will, I
am sure, be welcomed by the Canadian
people.
I realize, honourable senators, that there
is a wide difference of opinion as to the
usefulness of the Senate. I have letters front
people who go so far as ta say that the Senate
should be abolished. I have received others
suggesting various ways in which it could
be improved. Stiil others express a very high
opinion of the Senate and the contribution it
makes to Canadian life. These many letters,
with their variaus expressions of opinion on
the Senate, have been sent ta me presumably
because of a statement I made hast summer
advacating a retirernent age for senators, a
statement which was quoted in the Press
pretty well across Canada. One letter,
received only today, is frorn a gentleman
who follows closely the doings o! bath houses
of parliament, and I should like ta read what
he says the Senate means ta him.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Are you gaing ta give
his name?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: The letter is signed
and you may see it, if you wish. It is from
Robert L. Kertson. I will read only this brief
portion:

who have lived and grown up with Canada and
Canadians; the Senate contains men of superior

the Senate represents an ideal won by a hard
struggle for a free parliament that had its beginning
in King John's time; the Senate stands for unity of

in many respects it is the better of the two legislative branches of government. In all, the Senate is
the embodiment of a faith that our forefathers
fostered in creating this great nation.

A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bill 24, an Act to confer
certain emergency powers upon the Governor
in Council.
The bill was read the first time.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Beaubien presented the report of
the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous
Private Bills on Bill F-4, an Act respecting

The report was read by the Clerk Assistant
as follows:
The Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private

THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,

Hon. Mr. Fogo: With leave of the Senate,
I move third reading now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time and passed.
PRIVATE BILLS
QUESTION OF PROCEDURE

The principle of a bill is usually debated at its
second reading.

That rule relates to public bills. As to
private bills, our rules contain no similar
provision. The only helpful provision on the
second reading of private bills is found in
Rule 117:
Every private bill, after its second reading, is
referred te one of the standing committees on
private bills; and all petitions before the Senate,
for or against such bill, are considered as referred
te such committee.

That in itself would seem to negative the
idea that the Senate approves the principle
of a private bill on second reading, since it
refers material against the bill to the committee which is charged with consideration
of the measure.
The Law Clerk directed my attention to
May's Parliamentary Practice, 14th edition,
page 962, where it is stated:
The second reading of a private bill is in most
cases formal, and does not, as in the case of public
bills, affirmn the principle of the bill, which may
therefore be called in question before a committee.

Under the Senate rules, if a bill bas been
read a second time it must be .committed to a
standing committee. The same rule is in
effect in the House of Lords and in the House
of Commons in England. On this subject
Bourinot, 4th edition, page 599, states as
follows:
The second reading corresponds with the same
stage in other bills, and in 'agreeing te it, the house
affirms the general principle, or expediency of the
measure. There is, however, a distinction between
the second reading of a public, and of a private
bill, which should not be overlooked. A public bill
being founded on reasons of state policy, the house
in agreeing te its second reading accepts and confirms those reasons; but the expediency of a private
bill being mainly founded upon allegations of fact,
which have not yet been proved, the bouse, in
agreeing te its second reading, affirma the principle
of the bill, conditionally, and subject ta the proof
of such allegations before the committee.

FARM IMPROVEMENT LOANS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. A. McDonald moved the second
reading of Bill 78, an Act to amend the Farm
Improvement Loans Act, 1944.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to extend for another three-year

Honourable senators will recall that during the debate on the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne, I referred to fruit
growers as being a class of agriculturists who
have suffered more than any other group of
farmers in the country. I said that this was
because of the war and, the loss of their
markets, and also because of currency
difficulties. Last June the regulations under
this Farm Improvement Loans Act were
amended so that trees can be purchased and
orchards set out under whatever help the Act
can give. I should also mention that since
we debated this matter an agreement has been
reached-I do not take the least bit of credit
for it-between the federal and provincial
governments whereby an amount of $400,000
is to be paid to those who have old and unprofitable apple trees in the Cornwallis and
Annapolis Valley and will remove them this
year. It is true that when I spoke of this
matter I was hopeful that either the federal
or provincial government would find some
way of providing money at a lower rate than
the farmers can get it even under this Act,
which is 5 per cent, and possibly for a longer
term of years. Under the Act the longest
term for repayment is seven years.
The primary purpose of the original Act
was to fill a gap in the credit system which
has been developed, in Canada to meet the
needs of agriculture. Provision was made for
intermediate credit and, certain types of shortterm credit to farmers, for the purpose of
improving and developing their farms and
raising the general living standards thereon.
The legislation was intended especially for
those average farmers who had found
difficulty in securing bank loans for these
purposes, and it aimed to provide credit in a
form and under terms and conditions which
are convenient and. suited to the needs and
conditions of the particular farm borrower.
During the first three-year period two
changes were made. The original Act permitted loans on only livestock and fur-bearing
animals, and in 1947 the loaning provisions

MARCH 7, 1951
were extended to include poultry farming. In
1948 land security was authorized in certain
instances, and this change aiso enlarged. the
scope of the loaning provisions.
The original Act provide& that guaranteed
f arm improvement loans could be made by
any of the chartered banks of Canada directly
to farmers. The governmnent is made the
guarantor of such loans to the extent of 10
per cent of the total amounit of the loans made
by any one of those banks. In the first threeyear terni of this Act, freim March 1, 1945, to
February 28, 1948, the liabillty of the government was limited to 10 per cent of the bosses
on the 'total boans, which were not to exceed
$250 million. However, the total boans mnade
in that period amounted to on.ly $35 million,
the total liability of the governrnent in the
next three years was with respect to $250
million, less the $35 million, or $215 million.
In the second three-year period, a further
$135 million was loaned, so the total boans as
at December 31, 1950, were roughly $170
million. The government's current contingent
liability under its guarantee for the first threeyear term of the act is $1,022,079 in loans
still outstanding, and for the second three-year
term, up to December, 1950, the amount is
$72,351,104, or less than 43 per cent of the
total loaned in that period.
The hîstory of the Act is one of constantly
growing and increasing usefulness. In the
first full year of operation, the calendar year
of 1946, there were 13,030 boans, amounting to
almost $10 million, and in the year just
ended the number of loans had risen to
0f these
58,970, for a total of $63,417,310.
boans, roughly 85 per cent were for the purchase of agricultural, implements; the remaining 15 per cent were divided mainly between
the construction and reconditioning of farmn
buildings and certain other' miscellaneous
P.rovinces
The
Prairie
improvements..
accounted for 81 per cent of the total of
173,562 loans which were made Up to the
end of 1950, and Ontario and Quebec
accounted for another 14 per cent.
As f ar as repayment of the boans is concerned, the record is very good. 'Up to the
end of 1950, out of a total of more than $170
million lent, $96,681,000 had been repaid,
leaving the total of boans outstanding today

operation of the Act there were no dlaimns by
the banks against the government guarantee.
In 1949 there were thirteen dlaims, amnounting to $10,264. In 1950, twenty-two dlaims
were made, totalling $9,396. On these dlaims
the governinent has subsequently recovered
$506, s0 that the net dlaims on the government in the entire period of the Act have
been $19,154.58.
80713-16

It is,, perhaps, worth while to mention
briefly that a policy of restricted credit has
recently been implemented ini this field, ini
keeping with the steps the governiment has
taken, as an anti-inflationary mensure, to
curtail ail types of credit. For example, the
time for repayment of loans for the purchase
of a motor truck has been set at a maximnumn
of three years. Previously such loans,
depending on the amount, could go over the
whole period of ten years. The amouit. of
loans for the purchase, installation, alteration
and improvement of agricultural. equipment
and farm electrical systems has been reduced
from 75 per cent to 66 2/3 per cent; or i
other words, it is now a case of one-thirdl in
cash instead of one-quarter. There has also
been a reduction in the period for which
boans of various amouints should be given.
As far as interest is concernied, 5 per cent
simple interest is the total rate chargied.
Additional charges, such as were incurred
when private financing of farm implements
was done by commercial firms, are eliminated.
May 1 say, in conclusion, that the usefulness of this Act has had ample testimony in
the response of the farmers of Canada. At
the present time 300 farmers a day, on the
average, are making application for boans.
Their confidence ini the Act is strong, and the
farmers' associations across the country, as
well as the banks, have offered the best cooperation in every way.
Hon. Mr. Gouin:
Will the honourable
senator ailow me to ask a question?
I

had been advanced to the provinces of
Quebec and Ontario. Has he the breakdown
of the figures by provinces?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I have before me the
number of loans and the amounts loaned in
each province over the period in which the
Act has been in effect. The boans, classified

Hon. Mr. Gouin: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Asellmne: Do I understand that
dlaims amouinting to about $19,000 have been
paid and that the government is now attempting to recover that amnount? What has been
the total boss?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. McDonald: The total loss has
been $19,154.58.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Has that amount been
written off?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Only $506 was collected by the banks, after they had taken over
the deposits.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
I should like to say a few words regarding
this bill.
From the information we have just received
it will be noted that Saskatchewan has
received more in loans under this Act than
has any other province. In this regard I
would point out that although the price of
wheat during the past few years has been
fairly good, the cost of farm equipment has,
in some cases, gone up 300 per cent. In an
area of mechanized farming, such as the
famous Rosetown wheat belt, where I come
fromHon. Mr. Beaubien: Where is that?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: -it costs a farmer about
$20,000 to buy the necessary machinery to
farm efficiently.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: On how much land?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: For instance, he bas to
buy a tractor, a combine, a truck and other
pieces of expensive machinery, which have
recently increased in cost by a high percentage. So the farmer who wishes to operate
an economic unit of, say, a section or a section
and a half of land, must expend about $20,000
for machinery. If he can go to the bank and,
under the provisions of this Act, borrow part
of the money he requires, he is enabled to
commence operations which otherwise he
would not be able to undertake.
For the reasons I have given, the people of
the province of Saskatchewan are very much
in favour of the Act. I am pleased to hear
that the losses on loans have not been very
large; in fact, I was prepared to hear that
they had exceeded by far the amount of
$19,000.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
I realize that this Act has operated very
successfully. It would appear, however, that
there are large areas in which the inhabitants
are excluded from the benefits of the Act.
I should like to ask the sponsor of the bill if
that policy is still being followed.

to the people in certain farming areas of the
West. This policy seems to be unjust to a
lot of farmers, and I should like to know if
it is being continued.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Honourable senators,
I have read a good deal about the workings of
this Act, but the suggestion by the honourable
senator from Medicine Hat that some farmers
are excluded comes as a surprise to me. This
is a federal statute and, as I understand it,
is supposed to apply to all Canadian farmers.
It is likely that this bill will be referred to
the appropriate committee, and I would suggest that my honourable friend put his question there. It could be considered there
along with the fruit growers' problem, which
I mentioned earlier.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Do I understand that, under
the provisions of the amendment, farmers will
be able to obtain loans for the taking out of
old fruit trees?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: No. Honourable senators, I said that amendments made to the
regulations last June provided for the purchase of apple trees or other fruit trees and
for the expenses of setting out an orchard;
but so far as the taking out of old apple trees
is concerned-and this probably applies more
particularly to the Cornwallis-Annapolis Valley-that is being done under an agreement
between the federal and provincial governments. Each government, I understand, is
contributing $200,000, so the total will be
$400,000, and it is expected that another
400,000 trees will be removed this year pursuant to this agreement. But that has nothing
to do with this bill.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Do the loans provided for
under this bill extend to the expenses of erecting a new house or barn on a farm, or are
they restricted to repairs of buildings already
in existence?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: My information, honourable senators, is that the provision relates
only to repairs, though it may be extended
to include an addition to an already existing
building. That, perhaps, is another detail
which could be definitely settled if the bill
goes to committee.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Will the bill be referred
to committee for further study?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: That is our hope, yes.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

Hon. Mr. McDonald: I am sorry, but I did
not get my friend's question.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I move that this bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Natural Resources.
The motion was agreed to.

MARCH 7, 1951
THE SENATE AND ITS WORK
MOTION-DEBATE

CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Robertson for the appointment of a special
committee to inquire into and report upon how
in its opinion the Senate may make its maximum contribution to the welfare of the Canadian people.
Hon. Gray Turgeon: Honourable senators,
it is my intention to take up your time for a
while this afternoon for the purpose of putting upon the record my deep sense of
approval of the work of this upper chamber
of parliament since the British North America
Act was passed, in 1867. I have listened with
attention to the fine addresses which have
marked this discussion. Many of them, aside
from whether one agrees with all that has
been said, have been excellent. I might feel
a little more at ease in rising today were it
my intention to make some attack upon the
constitution of this chamber rather than to
approve of what it has done; for I have, of
course, passed the age of thirty, which is, a
necessary condition of membership of this
body, I have been appointed by the Crown
through the federal authorities, and my
appointment is not for a brief period, but
for life.
I not only admit-I assert and I warn-that
throughout Canada there is a feeling of distrust towards the Senate. Probably in large
measure this sentiment arises from the fact
that appointments are for life and are made
by the Crown through the federal authority.
I intend a little later to try to show, what I
firmly believe, that in a very large measure
the critical attitude of so many people towards
this chamber is simply part of an attitude
critical of parliament as a whole, which one
naturally finds in a democratic country. It
is not only the Senate which often is held
in disfavour and sometimes evokes distrust:
similar feelings are expressed against the
House of Commons and provincial legislative
assemblies. To that point I intend to return,
but for the moment I shall confine myself
to the criticism of this chamber which is
based on the appointment of senators for life,
and having in mind the fact that some of us
are older than, perhaps, we should like to
be. The day before yesterday I happened to
look up in Webster's dictionary the word
"Senate," and I find the word defined as
Literally, an assembly of old men; hence an
assembly with the highest deliberative and legislative functions.

Some Hon. Senators:

Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Everyone who has rcad
the deliberations at the conferences held at
Quebec and elsewhere before the formation
80713-164

of the Canadian constitution remembers that
the words "deliberative and legislative" were
applied positively and directly to the chamber
which the delegates had in mind, a chamber
of the kind which generally speaking had
been known as a legislative council in each
of the various provinces or colonies that the
delegates represented; and this body they
called the Senate. So the whole purpose in
the creation of a second chamber was to
have, as part of the Canadian constitution
and of the Canadian parliament, a deliberative and legislative assembly prepared to do
the work that would come to it on behalf of
the Canadian people.
It may be that at some future time an age
limit should be imposed; but, as I hope to
show a little later, in the conditions which
are confronting us today, amidst the great
events which are rolling along and which we
cannot stop, we have something better to do
than to indulge in critcisms of our own parliamentary system.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: I am opposed to the
suggestion that the Senate should be elected.
I say this without regard to the fact that I
happen to be a senator, and hence may be
supposed to be personally interested. I would
sooner see the second chamber of the Canadian parliament abolished at once-and that
is a step which would affect all of us who are
now here-than have it changed into an
elected body. Those who suggest that it be
elected are apt to forget the fundamental
problem with which the framers of the Canadian constitution had to deal. Our Canadian
union is not legislative, but federal. I took
the liberty of mentioning that fact the other
day in a speech about the United Nations
Assembly, when I mentioned some of our
troubles, because many of the delegates there
have no understanding of the questions which
confront a confederation like ours, and of our
need of federal reservations. Canada is a
nation made up of various provinces, at this
moment ten in number, which possess their
own legislative bodies. It was because that
type of organization was created that the
Canadian parliament was composed of two
chambers rather than one, the second chamber
to be deliberative and legislative, and appointed by the Crown through the federal
authority instead of being elected.
Nor do I agree that part of the membership
of the Senate should be appointed by the
provinces. I admit that up to a few years ago
I felt strorigly that this system of appointment would be a good one, but since then I
have come to believe that it would be a sad
mistake to adopt it. Many speakers in this
debate have pointed out that one of the

SENATE
fundamental attributes of the Senate is its
responsibility for provincial rights. The ten
provinces have their rights, and ever since
confederation the responsibility for protecting
these provincial rights has rested entirely
upon the whole Senate. But if the provinces
were to start appointing a portion of the
senators, either directly or indirectly, the
people of Canada would soon find that the
full membership of the Senate would no
longer have the responsibility for protecting
the provinces. That responsibility would fall
upon the shoulders of the provincial
appointees to the Senate. If this were to
happen the provinces would be the losers,
because only part of the Senate would be
dedicated to the preservation of provincial
constitutional rights, and also within a very
few years the Senate would be engaged in
what might be called family quarrels.
In 1867 some glaring differences and
antagonisms certainly existed amongst the
provinces then assembled to form confederation. The people of one province had a fear
of the people of another.
After serious
deliberation it was decided that senators
should be appointed by the Crown, through
the federal authority, rather than by the
The question as to whether
provinces.
senators should be elected or appointed was
decided in favour of the appointive system,
:rd it was also decided that the appointments
should be for life.
Honourable senators, in listening to this
debate I was struck by the fact that the
deputy leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen), an ardent Liberal, proclaimed that
the membership of this chamber was overwhelmingly Liberal and that there were not
a sufficient number of Conservatives here.
Then the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig)-as ardent a Conservative as the deputy
.eader is a Liberal-informed the house that
there is just about the same percentage of
Conservatives in the Senate, placed there by
appointment, as there is in the lower chamber,
placed there by the electors of Canada. That
was an encouraging manifestation of the fairness and sincerity of the members of this body
in discussing public questions.
The deputy leader set out reasons why in
his opinion there should be a retiring age,
and a retiring allowance. I am afraid that
some expressions such as have been used
here in debate are responsible for part of the
ill-will-perhaps that is not the proper termthat so many Canadians feel against the
Senate. Many members of this chamber say
carelessly, "Senators and Members of Parliament", and one will find this lack of precision
of statement all across the country. It would
seem that some people regard the Senate as
an institution separate from parliament. They

forget that this house is part and parcel of
our parliament, which has been based on the
British parliamentary system, for whose
salvation we have from time to time been
forced to ask our young men to go into battle
and if necessary give up their lives. We of
the Senate are just as much a part of the
parliament of Canada as are the members of
the House of Commons.
It has been pointed out that we have
established a retiring age for judges and civil
servants. This is quite correct. Now, I am
not saying that a senator or a member of the
House of Commons is better than a judge or a
civil servant or anybody else, but I do say
that the responsibilities and functions of
senators and members of the House of
Commons-that is, of members of parliament
-are different from those of a judge or a
civil servant. For instance, on any court
there are only a relatively small number of
judges. If one or two judges were to become
incapacitated through old age, that would
have a disastrous effect upon the functions
of a court. But conditions are different in
the Senate, which has a membership of
approximately one hundred.
Furthermore, a judge, though he be of the
highest standing, has a limited responsibility.
He does not create legislation; rather, he
interprets legislation laid down by federal
and provincial parliaments, and applies it
to the particular cases that come before him.
His function is entirely different from that
of members of the parliament of Canada.
The Fathers of Confederation, in the preconfederation conferences, determined that
the members of the Senate should be
appointed for life, so that they would be
absolutely and positively independent when
considering legislative measures and any
other public matters. I fear that if senators
were appointed for a certain period, say ten
years, and were eligible for re-appointment,
the high degree of independence enjoyed by
this body would deteriorate.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: My feeling in the matter is that if it were decided to appoint
senators for a limited period, they should not
be eligible for re-appointment; that is, their
services to the upper chamber should be
terminated upon the completion of their term
of office.
I took the liberty a while ago, honourable
senators, of stating that throughout Canada
and in other countries there is a feeling that
politics is something bad. Possibly the worst
thing that one may be called at a community
gathering is a politician. I happen to have
suffered that "stigma". I was first elected

MARCH 7, 1951
in 1913 to the Legisiature of Alberta. In 1921
1 swore off politics, but later came to Ottawa
as a mernber of the House of Commons,
representing a district in the province of
British Columbia, and today I arn a member
of the Senate. Ail of those who have had a
political 11f e realize that there is a feeling
that the man in politics-perhaps not the
woman, for there are flot many of them in
politics as yet-has some characteristic that
is just not what it ought to be. We in the
Senate have flot escaped the effect of that
feeling which has been engendered in the
minds and in the bosoms of the people of
Canada. Now, what are the reasons for that
feeling and what can be done to avoid it?
First, 1 should say that to a very large
extent the criticism that attaches itself to the
Senate is related to the general criticism of
politics and politicians to which I have
referred. As to the criticism which newspapermen and radio commentators have
directed agaînst this body for a period of
years, I harbour no resentment. Our parliamentary system gives them the freedom and
the right to criticize us, when criticism is
justified; and every member of this body has
an equal right to criticize newspapers and
radio stations. Therefore, I do not think it
wise for us to resent such criticism as we
have received; rather, I think we should
welcome it, as long as we are doîng the best
we can and the criticisma is founded on
earnest convictions of the people directing it.
A few days ago the honourable senator
from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid)
referred to the marvellous speech delivered
by Professor Corry at the Liberal Federation
meeting held in Ottawa last week. Professor
Corry spoke of the pending cabinet decisions,
but not in the sense that a determination o!
them must be reached immediately; rather,
he deait with the growing trend which necessitates certain decisive actions by nernbers
o! the cabinet. He pointed out that some
action must be taken to ensure that ministers
of the Crown-those who are clothed with
authority-do not ýallow themnselves to be
carried away by the flow of power which
is not in keeping with the principles of our
parliamentary system. I was tickled, so to
speak, to hear the senator from New Westminster mention my connection with the
action taken in 1932 by a Liberal convention
in British Columbia to make sure that the
growing strength of the cabinet in thatprovince did not become harmful to the parliamentary system. I have in my hand that
convention's resolution, headed "Freedom of
Members"-referring to the members of the

legisiative assembly. The motion was presented to the convention by me, and was
seconded by another Liberal, from Vancouver
Island.
If honourable senators will permit me to
refer further to, matters of personal interest,
I should like to deal briefly with another
item. I have before me a copy of the May,
1946, issue of the Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science, which was
sent to me a couple of yea-rs ago. It contains
an article dealing with the trend from 1912 to
1921, which will be recalled by a number of.
senators with the same feeling that I have, forsome of them. were at that time also playing:
a prominent part in public if e. The trend'
was entirely against political parties and an
elected legislative assembly; it was towards.
formation of a group government which would
take away the powers inherent in the elected
representatives of the people and give thern,
to those persons commonly referred to as
cabinet ministers.
That trend was being:
developed in Alberta. As a matter of fact, I
do not mind saying that it killed the Liberal
party in that province, at least in. so far as
to prevent its return to power in 1921. I sincerely hope that the party strength in that
province is widely increasing, and I kxiow that
the honourable senator from Bruce (Hon. Mr.
Stambaugh) is playing a real part in its
restoration.
Hon. Mr. S±ambaugh: We have made a good
start on it.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: I recaîl that in 1912,
before my election to it, the Alberta Legislative Assembly, passed a law providing for
initiative and referendum. By that law any
group of people who got others to sign a petition-and I do not have to define the terni
"petition"--could bring about a referendum
which, if cairied, would become law, regardless of the wishes of the elected members of
the legislature. After trying to help others to
defeat this tendency, I presented to the Legislature of Alberta, in February 1920, the f ollowing motion:
That whereas under the generally accepted interpretation of the working of the British parliamentary systemn it Is. assumed that the defeat of a bill
or measure presented to the legisiative assembly by
a minister of the crown offlcially on behaif of the
government la in Itsell a defeat of the governnient;
and
Whereas the members of thîs legislative assembly
feel that the time has come when members ought
to be free to vote either for or agaînst any bill or
measure before the house without thereby expressing lack of confidence in the government;
Therefore be it resolved that the house express
lts, desire that the premier ought not to considerthe defeat; of any government measure a sufflclent.
reason for tendering the resignation of his goverament. unless such defeat be followed by a vote o£
non-confidence in the government.

SENATE
The Speaker of the legislature declared this
motion out of order, on the ground that it
sought to interfere with the powers of the
Lieutenant-Governor of the province. Incidentally, a little later, in dealing with this
particular resolution, the late Dr. O. D. Skelton approved of it and said that the time
might come when it would be necessary to
adopt this principle. It is similar to the resolution which was mentioned the other day by
the honourable senator from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid). I have here, though I will
not read it, a remarkable letter from the then
leader of the Liberal party in British Columbia, the Honourable Duff Pattullo, in which
he expresses himself as wholeheartedly
approving of the motion to which the honourable senator has referred, and which was
.adopted by the convention.
However, I was comparatively late. I
proposed my resolution in 1920, but the
Fathers of Confederation had adopted the
same principle as far back as 1867. When
they created a parliamentary system for
Canada they provided for a second chamber
whose members could take any action which
appeared to them to be proper and just without expressing a lack of confidence in the
government and thereby bringing about its
defeat. That is why ýthis body can reject any
legislation that is presented to it by the government itself, or which comes to it from the
House of Commons, without creating or
declaring any distrust or lack of confidence in
the government of the day, and without
bringing about a dissolution unless the government deems the matter so serious, and
feels so certain of the support of the people
for some legislation which has been rejected
by the Senate, that it determines to dissolve
the Commons and test the question by an
appeal to the public. As was pointed out the
other day by the leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig), action of that kind has
never been taken since Confederation.
The leader of the opposition alluded to the
rejection by the Senate, I believe in 1919, of
that part of a Commons enactment which
dealt with the Crowsnest Valley freight rates.
He pointed out that this action was of direct
benefit, in particular, to the three prairie
provinces. Those provinces, with a membership they had at that time, could. not of themselves have forced Senate action on their
behalf. It was taken by the Senate at large,
at a time when none of the prairie provinces
had a membership of more than six. It is
incidents of this kind which I have in mind
when I speak of the responsibility and the
duty of the Senate to make sure, first of all,
that the constitutional rights of the provinces
shall never be transgressed. and second. that

the ordinary human rights of the people in all
parts of Canada are respected and preserved.
Before I conclude I wish to refer to a suggestion which was made in this debate, while
the honourable senator from Winnipeg (Hon.
Mr. Haig) was speaking, by the honourable
senator from Mount Stewart (Hon. Mr.
McIntyre). He reminded us of the action
taken by the Senate in the session of 1912-13
in rejecting the Naval Aid Bill which,-at the
instigation, of course, of the government of
the day-had passed the House of Commons.
I am going to make a statement with which
perhaps everyone will not agree, though I
believe it to be absolutely correct, that that
action of the Senate laid the foundation of the
British Commonwealth of today, of which we
are so proud, a Commonwealth respected by
all other nations and regarded with fear and
wonder by those who have designs against
the peace of the world. We know that the
Statute of Westminster evolved more or less
directly from the Balfour Declaration, which
was drafted and adopted at a meeting of
Prime Ministers of the Commonwealth. We
know that much of -the credit for the formulation of that Declaration belongs to the late
lamented Prime Minister of Canada, William
Lyon Mackenzie King. Reverting to an earlier
day, we remember that at the end of the first
world war, when representatives of the victorious nations met at Versailles to make a
treaty of peace with Germany and her Allies,
the then Prime Minister of Canada, the Right
Honourable Sir Robert Borden, insisted that
Canada through one of its own accredited
envoys should discuss the terms of the peace
treaty, and stated that to have it signed by
someone appointed at Westminster would not
satisfy Canadians. Could Sir Robert Borden
have taken this attitude at Versailles if the
Senate had not rejected in 1913 the Naval Aid
Bill when it came to this body from the House
of Co-mmons? The thing would have been
impossible. It will be remembered that in
1909 a resolution for the provision of a naval
force was approved unanimously by the House
of Commons; but in terms which clearly stated
that aid by means of periodical contributions
to the British Navy would be entirely out of
keeping with the Canadian constitution and
with the spirit of the times. In 1910 the
Canadian parliament passed a Naval Act
which declared that in times of emergency
the proposed Canadian navy could, by Act of
the Canadian parliament, be placed entirely
under the direction of His Majesty the King.
Incidentally, the term "emergency" used at
that time was described as "war, invasion,
riot or insurrection, real or apprehended."

MARCH 7, 1951
Hon. Mr. Robertson: May I suggest to the
honourable gentleman that he come down to
the centre of the house so that the rest of
us may hear him better?
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Take the vacant seat
of the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig).
Hon. Mr. Hawkins: Very well. Now, where
are my supporters?
Some Hon. Senators: Right here.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Hawkins: Honourable senators, on
rising to speak to the resolution before the
house, I wish first to congratulate the honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson) for having
given us an opportunity to discuss and debate
this question. I also wish to pay tribute to
the honourable gentlemen who have taken
part in the debate for their exhaustive analysis of the problem. A great deal of what
has been said has had to do with achievements of the Senate, and very little has been
said to indicate any possibility for improvement or change to meet changing conditions.
Also, thorough as the arguments have
been in support of the record of the past, there
has been little said which in my opinion constitutes an effective reply to the many criticisms which have been levelled at this body
during past years. It has been noted that
Senate reform was an election issue more than
thirty years ago, and that sinoe that time it
has been kept quite constantly before the
people of this country. The continuity and
diversity of the criticisms through the years
would tend to disprove the accusations that
they have been malicious in their intent or
the result of misguided thought. Therefore,
I say, that it was quite proper that the honourable leader should have proposed this
question for our consideration.
It is not my purpose to criticize this honourable body, for I am fully conscious of the
great contribution it has made to the life
and progress of Canada; and it would be presumptuous of me, a newcomer to this chanber
to propose changes in the discharge of the
responsibilities placed upon it. As I see it,
however, one of the first duties of an organization seeking to serve the public is its
public relations. I think that this body cannot ignore public reaction to its activities. I
think also that every organization should from
time to time make a self-assessment of the
services it is rendering, and explore every possibility of making further contributions to
the welfare of those it seeks to serve.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Great stress has been laid on the wisdom of
Hon. Charles G. Hawkins: Honourable senathe founders of our institutions, but we live
tors, in rising to speak-

That is exactly word for word the same definition of emergency which is to be found in the
Defence of Canada Act passed by this parliament last year.
Then came the election of 1911, which, as
honourable senators know, was fought largely
on the question of the reciprocity agreement
with the United States. This was a more
serious matter in some parts of Canada than
in others. Another election issue was the
action of the Canadian government in proposing to build a navy and place it under the
direction of His Majesty the King. That idea
was strongly denounced, and the election of
1911 settled the matter for that time. Then,
in the session of 1912-13 came the Naval Aid
bill, which was mentioned the other day by
the honourable senator from Mount Stewart
(Hon. Mr. McIntyre). The concrete objective
of that bill was aid to the Imperial navy by
a cash contribution. One of the arguments
of the sponsors of the bill was that if we
passed it the British government would
permit a Canadian minister to spend a great
part of his time in London in consultation
with British ministers on naval and foreign
policy, and many other supporters of the
measure thought the time would eventually
come when Canada would elect members to
the British House of Commons. The bill was
passed by the House of Commons but rejected
in the Senate, and all of Canada a-ccepted its
rejection. No election was called to ascertain
whether or not it was satisfactory to Canadians generally. And as a result of the
Senate's rejection of that bill, Sir Robert
Borden, the great leader of the Conservative
party, made the first important step in the
assertion of the rights of Canada, when he
insisted on having a Canadian, appointed by
the government of Canada rather than an
appointee of the British government, sign the
peace treaty at Versailles on behalf of our
country. That step led to the Commonwealth conference, the Balfour Declaration,
and the Statute of Westminster. These
events, based on the Senate's rejection of the
Naval Aid bill, helped to make the British
Commonwealth what it is today-a communion of friendly nations working together
towards peace in the world.
Honourable senators, these are some of the
reasons why I am strongly in favour of
retaining the Senate as it is at present constituted, and I hope that no positive action
of any nature will be taken to change it
until world conditions, in which Canada is so
vitally concerned, have been cleared up.

SENATE
in a world of changing conditions and we
cannot be unmindful of changing public
opinion and demand.
The members of the Senate, drawn as they
are from industry, the professions, legislative
bodies and almost every walk of life, and
coming as they do from all parts of Canada,
should constitute the best possible medium
for assessing and exploring opportunities for
rendering greater service to this country. I
suggest that the Senate, through its own
Inquiry and deliberations, can institute activities which will commend itself to the great
majority of Canadians.
It has been suggested that this resolution
be withdrawn, but I contend that this would
not satisfy the great majority of the people,
and it might well intensify the present criticism of the Senate. Instructive as the discussions have been, I do not think they have
provided a satisfactory answer to the charges
levelled against us.
The honourable senator from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) made a suggestion which
I think has merit. He said that this question
of reform is the responsibility of the whole
Senate and not of any committee, and he
suggested that there should be three resolutions, each dealing with one aspect of reform.
This is certainly a decision for the Senate
itself to make, and I feel very definitely that
any constitutional changes should be made
as the result of a recommendation from this
body. I endorse the purpose stated in the
resolution, namely, to enable the Senate to

make its maximum contribution to the Canadian people, and I feel that this should be
the guiding principle in any discussion or
deliberation we may have here. I think it
would be unwise for this chamber to disregard the principles embodied in the resolution. I believe that every member should
sincerely give his or her best efforts to seeking ways and means of rendering greater
service to our country, that with this approach
we can enable the Senate to render to the
citizens of Canada an even greater service
than it has rendered in the past, and that
in so doing we shall have the great satisfaction that accrues from having done our best.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Duff: The best speech made yet.
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh:
I should like to
correct a statement made by the honourable
senator from Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon),
that the Liberal party in Alberta is dead.
Hon. Mr. King: That is another debate.
Hon. Mr. S±ambaugh: At the last election
111,000 Liberal votes were cast, and five
members of that party were elected. I think
that is a pretty good showing.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: Honourable senators, I move the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.

HONOURABLE ARTHUR MARCOTTE
BIRTHDAY

FELICITATIONS

On the orders of the day:
Hon. William Duff: Honourable senators,
before the orders of the day are called and
with the permission of the house, I should
like to draw attention to the fact that this
is the 8th day of March, and that if we who
take an interest in public affairs in Canada
will look back over the record we shall find
that on this date in the year 1873 there was
born to two citizens in the little Quebec town
of Sault au Recollet, a male child. That
male child was properly taken by his father
to the church, was baptized, brought up in
the religion of his forefathers and became a
worthy citizen of the province of Quebec.
After being given a good education and
obtaining the degree of Bachelor of Arts, he
took the advice of Horace Greeley and went
west, to settle in Saskatchewan. He began
his career in that province, and from shortly
after the time he arrived there until the
present day his name has been well and
favourably known, not only in the West, but
all over Canada.
Honourable senators, some people are born
great; some have greatness thrust upon them;
some achieve greatness. The gentleman whom
I shall mention in a few moments was not,
perhaps, born great, though doubtless his
mother and father thought more of him than
of anybody else. However that may be, it is
my opinion that this young man, who went
West and made a name for himself in the
history of the new province of Saskatchewan,

and who has today reached the age of seventyeight years, is entitled to the commendation
of his associates in this chamber and of the
people of Canada as a whole, and in particular of the province of which he has been so
eminent a citizen for so many years. This
gentleman, young in looks, sound of phyique, who I notice is eleventh on the list of
senators, is still able to do and is doing a
great work for the people of Canada; and as a
humble member of this Senate I have much
pleasure in saying to him that he deserves
well of the people of this country, just as he
and others like him, in spite of anything that
may be said by anybody, deserve well of the
Canadian people. I refer, honourable members to the senator from Ponteix (Hon. Mr.
Marcotte).
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Arthur Marcoite: Honourable sena-

tors, I do not know what I can say in thanking the honourable gentleman from Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duff) for what he has said
about that poor little fellow who was born
seventy-eight years ago. We hear a good
deal these days about people who, having
passed the age of seventy-five, have become
so feeble mentally and physically that they
do not amount to very much. But one of
these people, whether or not he has become
at all mentally infirm, is still sufficiently
sound of mind to appreciate what has been
said about him and to thank the honourable
senator from Lunenburg for his kind remarks.
I thank you.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. Hugessen moved the second read-

ing of Bill G-5, an Act respecting the Canadian Legion of the British Empire Service
League.
He said: Honourable senators, this is quite
a simple bill and it will, I think, appeal to
the members of the house. It is presented on
behalf of the Canadian Legion of the British
Empire Service League, which, as honourable
members know, is a very important organization of war veterans, and which obtained a
charter from this parliament in the year 1948.
It asks for three changes in that charter. The
first is in relation to the manner in which the
Legion can amend its bylaws and regulations.
At the present time these bylaws and regulations can be amended by the Dominion Executive Council at such times as the Dominion
Convention, comprising the whole membership, is not sitting. This amendment seeks
to deprive the Dominion Executive Council
of this power and to place it solely in the
Dominion Convention.

MARCH 8, 1951
The second amendment is'to provide that
provincial conventions may enact bylaws and
rules for the governing of their own command, provided that any bylaws and rules
so enacted are not inconsistent with or contrary to any passed by the national body.
The third amendment is designed to protect
the badges, insignia and regalia of the Legion
against use by any person other than those
The general
authorized by the Legion.
public is protected by the requirement that
that insignia, regalia, emblems, badges, decorations, and so on, must be approved by the
Secretary -of State under the Unfair Competition Act, 1932.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I move that this bill be referred to the
Standing Committee on Miscellaneous and
Private Bills.
The motion was agreed to.
THE SENATE AND ITS WORK
MOTION-DEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed, from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. Robertson for the appointment of a
special committee to inquire into and report
upon how in its opinion the Senate may make
its maximum -contribution to the welfare of
the Canadian people.
(Translation):
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancourt
When our leader submitted his resolution "for
the appointment of a special committee to inquire into and report upon how in its opinion
may make its maximum
the Senate
contribution to the welfare of: the Canadian
people", I thought it was merely a question
of finding means to increase the efficiency of
our work. No doubt the working methods
employed by us in the past were quite different from those we use today. Nowadays
far greater speed is required. Furthermore,
we have got into the habit of teamwork, of
co-operation, in order' to increase our ideas
as well as our efficiency. The speeches I have
heard show clearly that it is the reform of
the Senate that is involved.
(Text):
Honourable senators, certain principles cannot be altered, because their alteration would
disrupt the whole structure of those principles
and thereby lead to an end which would be
the reverse of the one desired. It will be
recalled that scarcely two years ago, when
we discussed the problem of margarine, I
said that the question of butter was closely
bound to that of livestock breeding, and that
by permitting the sale of margarine in

Canada we would destroy the butter market
and prevent cattle raising; and further, that
we would make it difficult for western
farmers to sell their grain. Now see what
has already happened: we have destroyed
the foundations of our farming economy,
and the poor consumers, whom we tried to
protect, are today the first to suffer. Butter
production has diminished, cattle raising has
been reduced, and now the western farmers
are looking for a market for their grain.
Yet less than two years ago my colleague
from Leeds (Hon. Mr. Hardy) said my arguments were so ridiculous that they were not
worth the trouble of answering.
When the Fathers of Confederation met to
draft the British North America Act and to
organize the then Canadian provinces into a
federation, they laid down some hard and
fast principles. Had they believed that these
principles would some day be changed, would
Confederation have taken place? A fundamental principle, and one which we must
maintain, was the provision for a non-elective
Senate for the protection of the minority. If
the Senate became an elected body, what
would be the result? No one knows exactly
what would happen, but we can foresee that
the first demagogue strong enough to sway
the masses would be able to do as he pleased,
whether his plans made sense or not-and
demagogues almost always breed senseless
plans. I fear that -as a result our country
would be thrown into a revolution.
But there is more to be said on this question. It seems to me that the matter of Senate
reform is in the first place the responsibility
of the government, and that the British
North America Act ought not to be changed
without the consent of the provinces, agreement by this body and the assent of our
gracious sovereign.
However, notwithstanding all the hard and
efficient work done by the Senate, especially
during the past few years, I think our services
can become still more efficient. There are in
this chamber specialists in many fields. For
instance, many of our colleagues are past
masters in financial matters. In the agricultural field, we have our friend from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Godbout) who for many years
was Minister of Agriculture in his province.
I should also mention my neighbour in this
chamber, the senator from King's (Hon. Mr.
McDonald) a former Minister of Agriculture
for the Province of Nova Scotia. There are
many other senators whose careers are a
guarantee of the important services they can
render. For instance, we have in our midst
some eminent members of the legal profession. I shall name no one, for fear of overlooking some. If we are concerned about

SENATE
insurance questions, we have available here
the advice of experts in that field. Some honourable senators are well versed in social
matters; others are well informed in economics. And several of our colleagues are
physicians of high reputation, eminent in the
field of health and hygiene. I could go on
at length mentioning the qualifications of
senators in special fields.
Why~could not members of the Senate be
organized into teams for the consideration
of specific classes of legislation, and every
senator serve on the team where his specialized knowledge could be used to the best
advantage. In this way the house could not
only analyse a measure, but it could offer
constructive suggestions for improvements,
and thereby render valuable services to
individual citizens and to the nation.
In accordance with our present procedure,
honourable senators study a piece of legislation in their own rooms without the benefit
of consultation with senators who have
special knowledge in the particular field concerned, and then meet in committees to pass
or reject the measure. Thus we do not avail
ourselves of readily obtainable expert advice
as to the way in which legislative measures
submitted for our consideration can best be
improved.
On this point I would draw the attention
of the house to the fact that there is near
this chamber a beautiful large room where
senators are invited to get together and talk
things over quietly. But I have never seen
that room open; it is always locked up and no
one can use it. Would that not be the proper
place for the team work I have proposed?
By discussing matters informally in this way,
I think we could make ourselves more useful.
I may seem to be labouring this subject, but
the practice of team work and co-operation
has proved so useful in many fields that I
cannot refrain from emphasizing its value. By
co-operation, problems are solved in the best
interests of all concerned.
I entirely agree with the opinion expressed
by my friend from Grandville (Hon. Mr.
Bouffard), that there ought to be closer cooperation between the cabinet and the Senate,
and that if some of the ministers, ministers
without portfolio .and parliamentary assistants were chosen from among our numbers
we would know more about what goes on in
the other chamber and be familiar with what
the government proposes to do. Moreover,
with better informed members, the Senate
could do its work more quickly and efficiently.
In closing, I should like to say a few words
about what is being said outside this chamber
regarding the Senate. A colleague from the
other place, whom I met in the halls the

other day, asked me. "When are you going to
vote in favour of abolition of the Senate"?
I replied most amiably: "If we were the only
ones concerned it would have been done
long ago, but we have to be fair to others.
Indeed, we thought that by abolishing the
Senate we would be dealing a heavy blow
te more than one of our friends, for so many
of whom would like to take our places. One
has to be considerate."
It is claimed by some people that there
are too many old men in the Senate. To a
friend of mine who repeated this criticism,
I replied: "Can you tell me when a man
is old? You, for instance, are 61 years of age,
but are you an old man?" "Not at all," he
retorted. "Nevertheless," I explained, "the
little boy of twelve or thirteen years who
sees you going by considers you are old. As
you see, everything is relative."
It is sometimes contended that elderly
people cannot work fast enough and keep up
with the present-day tempo. That may be
true, but may we not meet that argument by
saying that some people rush around too much
and by so doing cause many accidents and
sudden deaths? Nevertheless, experience
brings wisdom. To my friend who complained about the age of senators, I also said:
"You will recall that a few years ago we
each had a rather difficult problem to solve.
As we could find no solution, you suggested
to me 'I shall make an appointment with my
father and, if you agree, we will call on him
tomorrow.' We went to see your father. He
listened to both of us; he gave the matter
a great deal of thought, and the next day he
advised us on the solution he thought best.
That solution was found to be the logical one,
the best one, and the only sensible one. And
your father was then eighty-four years old.
When is a man old?"
I have already stated that I know men in
their twenties and in their thirties who are
already old-old through scepticism, old
through selfishness, old through despair. But
I know also men in their seventies and in
their eighties and older who are still young
in their ideals, young in their hopes, young
especially because they have retained common sense and wisdom. Let the younger men
show feverish activity if they wish, but let
us always look for guidance to the mature
judgment of wise men, the best possible guide.
(Translation):
According to the newspapers, the Pope,
gloriously ruling, the other day celebrated
his seventy-fifth birthday. I saw him a few
months ago acting with a manly vigour which
many men of twenty or thirty would envy,
and I believe that people would be astonished,
dumfounded even, if overnight they were
told: "The Pope has reached the age limit, let

MARCH 8, 1951
us replace him by a younger man." In these
troubled times, I believe that the wisdom of
a 75-year old man, who is far from being old,
is worth much more than the bundering
methods of those who do not take time to
think before they act, and who. frequently
repent having acted in haste.
(Text):
Hon. W. A. Fraser: Honourable senators, it
is with considerable timidity that on this, the
third occasion that I have risen in this
chamber, I venture to present a few comments. This afternoon I wish to place upon
the record, and before my honourable colleagues, some observations with regard to the
resolution which is before us. My feeling of
hesitancy is not wholly due to the fact of
my recent appointment to the Senate; it
arises also from my deep apprehensions concerning the condition of world affairs today
and the international position of the Dominion
of Canada. As a member of the Canadian
Senate I have done and am doing my best
to study international conditions and to watch
the progress of the economics of violence
which is rampant in the world today. These
conidtions in themselves would create a
sense of humility in any Canadian citizen,
and not least in the minds of members of this
body. I hope my honourable friends will not
assume I am injecting any political viewpoint when I make the statement that we
Canadians today are extremely fortunate in
our government and in the opposition in
the other place. I do not believe that any
greater tribute has been paid to a Canadian
citizen than was accorded to a French Canadian in 1949 by the English-speaking people
of Canada when they endorsed the Right
Honourable Louis St. Laurent as our Prime
Minister. I feel also that we are extremely
fortunate in having ministers of the calibre
of the Right Honourable C. D. Howe and the
Honourable Lester Pearson, and on the
opposition side, the present leader and the
gentlemen who sit behind him, such as my
friend Howard Green and others whom I
learned to respect in the years when I sat
before the Speaker in that other place. And
while I am deviating somewhat from the
subject of the resolution, I should like to
add that, as a member of the Senate and
one in the public service, I regard it as an
honour and a privilege to be associated with
the Government of Canada in the upper
house of the Canadian Parliament.
I should like at this time to make a brief
reference to the civil service of Canada. In
my opinion we are extremely fortunate in the
calibre of the civil servants who serve the
country in this crucial period of its history.
If a personal reference may be permitted,

for the past ten days I have been nursing a
dose of the flu, and this has given me the
opportunity of reading every speech which
bas been made in this chamber in connection
with this resolution. If the motion before us
has served no other purpose, it has served to
place on record the thoughts, the conclusions,
and in a broad sense the aspirations of members of this august body. I do not think one
could read anywhere finer speeche.. than
have been made by the honourable senator
from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris), the
honourable member from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) and the honourable member from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid).
I want to express my humble appreciation of
what I have learned from their contributions,
the serious utterances of minds trained for
many years in investigating, considering and
of national
pronouncing upon matters
importance. I have been prompted to speak
today because of what I have observed and
read as an ordinary man on the street-as
an individual of the horizontal cut of Canadian citizenship-about the unjust criticisms
which have been made of the Senate. These
criticisms have been far from constructive
and have not been conducive to the national
interests of Canada. A weekly newspaper
published in my part of the country recently
referred to senators as "old fogies and wornout politicians." An article appearing in the
Ottawa Citizen on March 5 contained these
words:
not for a Senate of the maimed, the halt, and
...
the blind, as it is now.

I object to that type of criticism, because
it is destructive and not constructive; it is
malicious and unfair. The speakers in this
debate have placed on record in explicit and
technical detail the constitution and set-up
of the Senate. As members of the Senate we
are members of the Parliament of Canada.
We are part and parcel of the administration
of our country. I consider it a signal honour
to have been appointed to the Senate, and I
am happy to have the opportunity of extending my humble public service to the people
of Canada. As my good friend and respected
colleague, the late Right Honourable R. B.
Bennett, used to say in the old days "and
that I will do", to discharge my duties as
best I can do to the limit of my capacities
as a member of parliament.
Honourable senators, one of the greatest
assets I possess as a result of long experience
in public life is the fact that I personally
know and can call by their first names,
almost every departmental head and deputy
minister in the government service. If I had
no other asset to offer, I think this association

SENATE
with our senior civil servants would in itself
give me an opportunity to continue to serve
the people of Canada.
As senators we have the right to stand in
this chamber and express our opinions, to
kive our advice and do our utmost to transmit
these things to the government through the
leader of the Senate (Hon. Mr. Robertson).
We must not forget that our leader is a
member of the government, and we should
take full advantage of this fact so that we
may contribute more to the administration
of the public affairs of our nation. The
phraseology of the resolution reads in part:
. . . to enable the Senate to make its maximum
contribution to the welfare of the Canadian people.

Now,

honourable

senators,

I understand

that in this chamber a speaker is not limited
to forty minutes, so I shall deviate along
somewhat jovial lines for a minute to tell
you about the letter I wrote yesterday to
the editor of the weekly paper who referred
to us as "old fogies and worn out politicians".
I know the editor quite well and I wrote
something like this:
Dear George, it seems to me that not so long
ago ycu trimmed your mizzen flat and jettisoned
your political ballast over the lee rail when you
tried to luff your political ship of state past the
narrow portals of the Red Chamber.

Hon. Mr. Duff: He capsized it.
Hon. Mr. Fraser: Sometimes our friends
are not consistent, and we are subject to that
kind of criticism.
I should like to return now to a more
serious strain, and I want to go on record
as saying that it would be impossible for any
business organization to have a board of
directors made up of more intelligent and
experienced
persons than are gathered
together in this chamber. I do not think you
could have a more profound body serving the
public interests of Canada than that formed
by the senators in this chamber.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Fraser: I should like to point out
for the record that thirty-nine members of
the Senate were former members of the
House of Commons, and eight gentlemen
who formerly held portfolios in one federal
government or another are now sitting in this
august chamber. There are among us nineteen ex-members of provincial governments,
of whom seven were provincial ex-cabinet
ministers. One gentleman, my respected
friend and colleague from Montarville (Hon.
Mr. Godbout), was once premier of the
province of Quebec.
The membership of the Senate also comprises ten doctors, seven farmers, twentythree lawyers, one mining executive, and

four gentlemen who have been prominent
in the basic fishing industry of Canada. There
are also four gentlemen who have been
prominent in Canada's lumbering industry.
Unlike myself, who has handled the busy
end of a peavey, they have held executive
positions in the lumbering industry of
Canada.
Hon. Mr. Duff: We all work.
Hon. Mr. Fraser: The membership of this
chamber embraces men who have been
trained in matters of finance, some five newspapermen, twelve industrialists from a crosssection of Canadian industry, two university
professors and three commercial businessmen. It includes also four insurance executives, two engineers and two men who have
been most successful in the operation of transportation systems

in

Canada.

There

are

also in this chamber two apple growers.
Sone Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Fraser: One of them is the honourable senator from Montarville (Hon. Mr.

Godbout) and I am the other. Among the
members of this house there are representatives of a cross-section of the women of
Canada.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Fraser: I say without contradiction
that no woman in Canada has contributed
more in a humanitarian way for the cause of

womanhood than bas the honourable senator
from Rockliffe (Hon. Mrs. Wilson). I regret
that the honourable senator from Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis) is not in her place
this afternoon, for there is much that I could
say about her activities. I know that these
two gracious ladies are a tremendous asset
to the Senate of Canada and to the country
generally.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Fraser: The honourable gentleman who just took his seat (Hon. Mr.
Vaillancourt) is the leading maple sugar producer in Canada, and my good friend from
Victoria-Carleton (Hon. Mr. Pirie), the foremost potato grower in this country.
I turn now to another subject which I
think should appear on the records of this
house. First I point out that I do not participate in this debate only to argue the resolution before us, but to place upon the record
what the Senate of Canada means and what
its individual members stand for. In my
opinion, the public should appreciate to a
greater extent the public servants who compose this branch of the parliament of Canada.
There are men sitting in this chamber this
afternoon who were responsible for what I
believe

was the

most

important event

in

MARCH 8. 1951
the history of Canada in the last generation.
I refer to the entry of Newfoundland Into
Confederation as the tenth province of the
Dominion.
Borne Han. Senatars: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Fraser: I say most positively
that there are in this chamber men whose
actions resulted in Newfoundland becoming
the tenth province of Canada instead of the
forty-ninth state of the United States. Do
the people of Canada realize these things?. Do
they ever look at a map of Labrador and
Newfoundland and appreciate the fact that
because of the sincerity and tenacity of some
honourable senators this great coastal area,
which may one day be a line of defence for
Canada, became a part of Confederation? I
could go on and mention outstanding accomplishments of many other members in this
chamber. It would, however, be selfish on
my part to take up too much time this
afternoon.
Hon. Mr. Duif: Go ahead.
Han. Mr. Fraser: But I have on mny mind
some further matters which. I wish to place
on the record.
Last Tuesdayevening I listened to a speech
in this chamber by the honourable senator
from Bruce (Hon. Mr. Stambaugb). Frankly,
bis speech ann-oyed me, as I am sure it did
other senators. I was a member of the
House of Commons for sixteen years, ten
years of which I was governrnent Whip there.
I served for a period as -chairman of an
important comimittee of that bouse, in what
was perhaps one of its crucial times. I refer
to the Public Accounts committee, when the
Bren gun inquiry came up.
As I listened to the honourable senator from
Bruce tihe other evening there flashed tbrough
my mind the biblical quotaition: "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do."
As one who bas spent more than tbirty years
of bis 111e in the service of Canada, I felt that
the remarks of the senator from Bruce were
absurd. I make this remnark witbout any
vinddctiveness, for I only brush off flues with
a swatter-I don't do it on the floor of the
bouse. I would remind 'the senator from
Bruce that there are in, this chamber five
bonourable gentlemen from the province of
Alberta, some of whomn have occupied their
seats for many years. There is my good, friend
the senator from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr.
and
colleague
my
former
Buchanan);
ex-minister of tihe Crown, the senator from
Edmonton (Hon. Mr. MacKinnon); the senator
from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw); the
senator from St. Albert (Hon. Mr. Biais); and
another gentleman for wbom I have great
respect and admiration. my old, f riend from

Calgary (Hon. Mr. Ross). When the senator
from Bruce referred to me the other evening,
flot by name but by my youth-and 1 appreciate that-I was reminded of the old days
when I was Whip in the House of Commons.
This will bring a -smile to t~he lips of the
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck), for he will recali that when a
caucus was called I would talk to the new
members in this way: "Now, my f riends, just
pipe down, and realize that the less you say
around here the less you will have to answer
for."
Hon. Mr. Raebuck: Hear, hear.
Han. Mr. Fraser.- While the senator from
Bruce was speaking the other evening there
came to my mind anotiher biblical quotation:
"Judge not, that ye be flot judged." Certainly,
each and every one of us has enough to do
to look after himself, without criticizing other
people. In my experience across Canada I
have done everyth-ing from mining ore on the
west coast of Vancouver Island to, building
hangars in the new province of Newfoundj
land, and I know someth-ing about this
country, Long ago I came to the conclusion
that the less I worry about other peoples'
business anci the more I look after my own,
the more successful I shail be and the less
criticism I shall accumulate.
There is another thing,-and, this I will
interject in a humorous- strain. Being Scotch,
I believe in punching fromn the front, not from
the back. I notice with regret that ýmy honourable coileague is flot in bis seat this afternoon, or I might say more: however I will
put this on record. When he comes back
from Windsor tomorrow afternoon, after
neglecting his duties here to pick up a motorcar, he can read in Hansard what I say. I
want to say to him, when he talks about his
'%he angel," that he will find himself dodging
his angel to the limit of bis capabilities; and
if he is in the Senate long enough to reaoh the
age of seventy-five he will go through mental
contortions, even if he should not be capable
of physical contortions, to retain his membership here. Of that fact we can rest assured;
it is human nature, and it is in accord with
human psychology. Let me add that I have
come to the conclusion that from now on I
shall apply the Chinese proverb, "'Hold thine
enemy close." Wbile the good Book states,
"Judge not, that ye be not judged4" it would
seem, from what the honourable senator from
Bruce said on Tuesday evening, that he lacks
experience in administrative bodies such as
municipal councils and the House of Commons. This statement is not intended to be
derogatory as far as he is concerned. I forgive him on the score of lack of experience.

SENATE
Apparently he does not realize that the duties,
the functions and the responsibilities of *a
senator are not confined to attendance in this
chamber.
May I say that I take second, place to no one
in my desire to discharge my d'uties as a
public servant. At the present time I happen
to be the only senator on the lakefront from
Kingston to Toronto; and as a member of
parliament-now a member of the Senate,
and formerly a member of the other houseI regard, myself as a public servant. I was
appointed to the Senate of Canada, as I was
elected time and time again to the other
place, to serve the people, to try to interpret
their thoughts and desires, to try to be of
service to my fellow citizens, whether
returned men, members of county councils,
members of benevolent organizations, or
whatever their capacities and needs. Throughout my life it has been to me a source of
pride that the opportunity has been given
me to serve Canada, to be of some help to my
fellow citizens. And never in the history of
Canada, honourable senators, was the equilibrium of the people more threatened and
their thinking more confused than todlay.
Never, I believe, were the people more
anxious for leadership. I ask you, my
honourable friends, 102-strong, and the
elected members of the House of Commons,
to whom are they to look for leadership if
not to us?
Personally, I felt it a great honour to be
appointed to the Senate. I am not speaking
from a financial standpoint, because I venture
to say that the Treasury of Canada gets back
in income tax at least thirty cents of every
dollar it pays in sessional indemnities. Don't
forget that.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: More than that.
Hon. Mr. Fraser: My honourable friend says.
"more than that".
Hon. Mr. Duff: That is the truth.
Hon. Mr. Fraser: He is a better guesser
than I am, and he is probably right. I wanted
to be conservative. But the point is that the
man who offers himself as a candidate for
membership of the House of Commons or
for municipal honours is not moved by the
prospect of the money he will get; he does
so because as a Canadian he is inspired by
the wish to serve his fellow citizens. And
that sentiment, I say, animates us as members
of the Senate. That is why I remarked a
minute ago that if anybody thinks the work
of a member of this body amounts to no more
than sitting behind a desk in this house and
listening to the kind of speech I listened to
on Tuesday night, he has got "another think
coming to him". The members of this body

are experienced men. As former members of
legislative bodies, they have gained experience in the business of Canada. They know
something about the administrative problems
of government. They know a good deal about
the thoughts, the aspirations, the frailties,
the needs of the Canadian people, of whom
they are a cross-section. I say to you, my
honourable friends, that ours is a whole-time
job. I regard myself, as a senator and a member of parliament, as being on duty 365 days
of the year, and my latch-key is out and the
telephone is open to the people, not only of
my town but to anybody else who thinks I
can be of assistance to him, either in connection with government affairs, personal or
any other matters. That, my friends, is one
of the greatest privileges and the greatest
obligations of a member of the Senate.
As I said a few minutes ago, it would be
extremely presumptuous for a recently
appointed member of this body to take up
much time this afternoon, and I want to conclude with just one or two thoughts in connection with this resolution. I have said
previously that in my opinion the resolution
has done a tremendous amount of good. It
has been instrumental in placing upon the
record, and obtaining wider publicity through
the press and otherwise, of the fundamental
facts about the Senate which otherwise would
have been left unsaid and unknown.
In reading the speeches I have notedi two
or three very definite suggestions, the only
definite suggestions that have been made.
The honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) made several constructive suggestions, but the main ones had
to do with establishing a retiring age and
making
provincial
appointments.
The
honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson)
referred in his speech to the conversation he
had with the late Right Honourable W. L.
Mackenzie King about Senate reform. I may
say that I read the leader's speech three
times, andi I asked myself this question: As
Mr. King was one of the greatest statesmen
and cleverest political strategists this country
ever produced, why did he never reform the
Senate?
Hon. Mr. Duff: He did, by appointing me.
Hon. Mr. Fraser: Why would he have
turned to the honourable senator from Shelburne (Hon. Mr. Robertson) and suggest that
he, having just assumed the responsibility of
the leader of the Senate, should take the
initiative in Senate reform? I think there
is a nigger in the woodpile somewhere. Let
us be clear on this: if the Senate was to
be reformed, nobody was more capable of
doing it than the late Right Honourable
Mackenzie King.

a paper mill, and had to import from
Birmingham, England, two 650-horsepower
reciprocating engines. These engines were
delivered and installed, but one of them
refused to operate properly, and we were
stuck. We cabled to Dawson and Company,
the manufacturers in Birmingham, requesting
that an engineer be sent out to Canada to
adjust the engine and to make it run
properly. The engineer arrived at the plant,
and I stood beside him as he looked over the
engine. I saw him take a small hammer from
his pocket and tap the governors in, I think,
three places. We then turned on the steam
and the engine ran perfectly. We thanked
the engineer for his services, and the plant
went into operation. A short while later
Dawson and Company sent us an account for
£300, plus the travelling expenses of the
engineer. The manager of the plant in question, being Scotch, like myself, could not
quite figure out why we should have to pay
£300.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: For three taps.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: £100 a tap.

Hon. Mr. Fraser: We wrote a letter to the
English firm inquiring about the account,
and in due course we received a new invoice
which read as follows: "For tapping, £25.
For knowing where to tap, £275".
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Fraser: In conclusion I will say
this-and let it get into the press and go
across Canada-that the members of the
Senate have experience in business, in
industry and in legislative matters and they
know where to tap; and as far as I am concerned, I make no apologies to anybody.

DEFENCE PRODUCTION BILL
FIRST READING
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, a message has been received from. the
House of Commons with Bill 77, an Act
respecting the Department of Defence Production, to which. they desire the concurrence
of the Senate.
The bill was read the first ti-me.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: When shail this
bill be read the second time?
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, with leave, I now move the second
reading of the bill. There is some urgency
about having it considered at the earliest
possible moment.
It is well-recognized that discussion prior
to second reading concerns the principle of
a bull, so I may perhaps state briefiy the
principle underlying this bill. It provides
machinery to enable the government of the
day to supply to those who are fighting for
us now, or may be fighting in the future, the
best weapons of war that science can devise
and our productive fadilities can furnish; to
provide these weapons promptly, s0 that
should occasion arise it wlll not be a case of
"«too littie" or «"too late"; and lastly, to make
sure beyond any reasonable doubt th-at there
shail be no profiteering in the production of
weapons of war.
I will make a brief reference to the bill in
general, without going into the -details, which
can be considered in committee if and when
this house sees fit to give it second reading.
The bill is designed to do three things. In the
first place. to establlsh a separate department
to carry out the procurement functions needed
for the extended defence program, and to
direct essential materials to meet that program; to confer on the minister of the new
department, powers similar to those formerly
held by the Minister of Munitions and Supply;
and to confer upon the Governor in Couneil
and upon the minister, power to control essential materials, under substantially the same
terms and to the same extent as now provided
for under the Essential Materials (Defence)
Act. It wii be seen, therefore, that in that
sense this is not new legisiation; it simply
re-establishes
authorities and procedures
which were tested and made use of 50 satisfactorily during the hast war. With very few

SENATE
exceptions the powers sought in this bill are
the same as those provided for in the Department of Munitions and Supply Act of 1939.
In the drafting of this bill there has been
some re-wording, and a consolidation of the
legislation which was built up during the
last war; but there is no material addition in
the bill to the powers exercised during the
last war under the Munitions and Supply Act
and the War Measures Act. An illustration
of this consolidation will be found in section
20 of this bill, which provides that the minister may direct that a person entitled to
royalty payments in connection with a
defence contract shall look for compensation
to the Crown rather than to the licensee. This
is based on the fact that a royalty is usually
determined on the basis of anticipated peacetime volume, which may well be substantially
increased as a result of a defence program of
the magnitude now being undertaken. Provision for this situation was not incorporated
in the Munitions and Supply Act, but was
dealt with by order in council. Again it will
be noticed that section 16 establishes a
revolving fund to permit of advance payments
being made in connection with production
programs for Canadian requirements or for
production programs undertaken for other
governments. This procedure was found to
be the only practical method of handling
similar situations in the last war; and
although it was not provided for in the Munitions and Supply Act, it was done under the
authority of the War Measures Act.
In introducing this bill the government is
carrying out plans that it has been developing
over the past few years. The experience of
the last war showed the wisdom of building
a separate department for defence production,
and proved the need for the special powers
which are now sought in this bill. Since the
end of the last war the principle of centralized procurement for the three services by a
civilian department has been followed, and
the nucleus of such a department has been
maintained in the Department of Trade and
Commerce. What is now proposed is to extend
this nucleus, and to grant special powers
to meet the urgency of the special situation.
We are not at war, or at least all-out war,
but there can be little doubt that speed in
getting on with the defence preparations is
the best possible protection against all-out
war. In order that the program go ahead,
there must be authority to place defence
requirements
ahead
of other
civilian
demands. But manufacturers and suppliers
whose order books are full cannot without
properly authorized governmental direction,
displace civilian requirements to make way
for defence requirements.

The powers that are sought in this bill,
such as the requisitioning of supplies, the
directing of production, and the allocating of
materials in short supply to the most essential uses, can all be described as necessary in
order to ensure that defence production
requirements are placed ahead of all other
requirements. As I have said, the powers
now sought are those which were used so
successfully during the last war. They are
not powers which would be appropriate under
normal conditions, and consequently a limited
period is established for the life of the Act. The
period chosen is five years, the time necessary
to carry out and, it is hoped, to bring to a
conclusion the three-year program which has
been announced in detail by the Minister of
National Defence. It will be realized that a
program which includes the building of large
ships, and the designing, development, testing
and production of new types of aircraft, guns,
ammunition, electronic devices and all the
expensive paraphernalia of modern war can
be carried out only over an extended period.
While this has been announced as a threeyear program, the experience gained during
the last war indiciates that a period of at
least two years will inevitably be required to
wind up a program of the magnitude of the
one on which we are now embarked.
The government makes no apology for
asking for the re-establishment of these
powers, and the record of its administration
in the exercise of such powers during the
last war speaks for itself.
To this statement I should like to add one
word. The present bill, like the Munitions
and Supply Act and the War Measures Act,
under which powers were exercised during
the last war, not only provides machinery
for obtaining prompt delivery of defence
materials, but authorizes the minister to
ascertain and determine the degree of profit
made on war production, and to require that
those in a position to produce weapons of
war-if I may use that expression-shall
do so, even though they may wish to do
otherwise. It seems to me that is a very
important point. The financial record with
respect to the great program carried on by
this country during the last war is something
that every Canadian can be proud of. It
was not the record of a particular administration or a particular party only. It is true
that the Liberal party was in power, but
people whom the minister of the day called
in to assist him were chosen irrespective of
politics. I think it is generally agreed that
in this regard and in keeping a careful
check on the ,amount of money made out of
war production he acted wisely, and that it
is wise to provide for a check on war profits
at this time. Whatever differences of opinion

MARCH 13, 1951
we may have on most questions, we are al
of one mind in this, that while our young men
are being called upon to offer their lives in
defence of civilization, the production of war
materials in Canada shal nlot be a gold mine
for those engaged in the business of produeing those materials. There is a responsibility
on this and ail future governments to see
that the record is maintained; and it is
encumbent upon parliament to provide the
government with adequate power and to see
that it is exercised.
We are aware of the tremendous increase
in prices refiected in recent stock market
activities in Canada. Although this activity
rnay be a mere coinciden-ce, it seems to me
to indicate that at ieast some people foresee a
tremýendous war production program, resuiting in a bonanza for many. It may happen,
as it did during the last war, that some people,
upon becoming aware that there is no opportunity to make huge profits, xviii not be very
anxious to give over parts of their productive
facilities to the manufacture of war materials
when it would be much more profitable to
pr.oduce consumer goods on which there are
no price -controls.
I am nlot prepared, to say to honourable
senators that this bill is perfect in every
detail, and that the powers it provides are
the best to accomplish the task before us.
I do believe, however, that it is desirable
to clothe the authorities with the powers
necessary to secure the best material available, to get it promptly, and to see that no
unreasonable profits are made. I firmly
believe that the people of this country would
nlot tolerate profiteering. There is a disposition on the part of some to say that such
powers as are asked would be ail right if
we were engaged in an all-out war, which
we are not: the fact remains, honourable
senators, that Canadiaýn boys are today dying
on the battlefields of Korea, and it is the
responsibility of everyone in authority to see
that parliament provides the power necessary
to enable Canada to maintain the record
she has made for herseif.
I bespeak for this bill your most careful
consideration.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: To what extent does
this bill fali short of the War Measures Act?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I asked the department to give me that specific information,
because I thought it was pertinent. I arn
advised that in essence the powers under
this legisiation are no more or no less than
those which existed under the Munitions
and Supply Act, and augmented by the War
Measures Act. That is to say, to ail intents

and purposes this bill would give the sumn
,-tal of power which was exercised during
the last war under the two measures I have
mentioned. I have no doubt that this question wiil be elaborated on more fulhy when
the bill is before committee.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
1 do not think for one or two reasons, that
anyone would want to speak against the
passage of this legisiation. The peoples of
the western worid today believe, rightly or
wrongly, that the better they are prepared
for war the farther the danger of war will
be removed from them. I amn not qualified
to express an opinion on that belief, but I
observe that the men who are in a position
to know the facts unanimously agree that
full preparations for war by the western
world wiil deter Russia and her satellites
from making an al out attack on us.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: General Eisenhower
thinks so.
Hon. Mr. Haig: And more than General
Eisenhower; practically ail the premiers and
presidents of the countries in the western
worid think so. But I arn not expressing
myseif on that.
Events in Korea have given us ample eviýdence that Russia was the motivating power
behind the North Koreanis in their attack on
the South Koreans; it is obvious that she
schemed to use other people as pawns, to
play her game. We see evidences of this
even in our own country, though why anyone would support the Communist doctrine,
I cannot for the if e of me understand. What
hypnotism is there that attracts people to
that way of 11f e? With this background in
mind, I arn sure we are ail of opinion that
the thing to do is to prepare for the worst.
The government is asking us to pass this
legisiation to give it the power to make the
necessary preparations.
The honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) asked, a pertinent question, the
answer to which may not be quite complete.
The Minister of Trade andi Commerce made
a statement in the House of Commons, or in
an interview, namely, that a measure of this
nature is more useful today than the War
Measures Act would be with which 1 entirely
agree, I do not pretend to be the best constitutional lawyer in Canada, but I arn not
sure that under the War Measures Act we
could legally do what this bill would permit
us to do. The War Measures Act is based
on the premise that the emergency of war
exists; the mensure now before us is not.
It is a generni bill such as the government
may introduce. By utilizing the Wnr Measures Act we might run into legni difficulties,

SENATE

The bill before us indicates the condition
of the world at the present time. The western countries are striving desperately to
maintain the freedom of men 's minds, their
souls and their lives. The people in effect
Do what you will with our
are saying:
money and our property, but let us maintain
our liberty. Reports that come to us from
behind the Iron Curtain show the dangers
facing our way of life. Indeed, we do not
need to look far to see what is happening
today. Through the press we learn what
the Chinese are doing to missionaries and
members of religious orders who operate
hospitals in China. I cannot imagine why
the Red element would suspect such people
of any intention of aggression. Indeed, if
I have any criticism to make of missionaries
-and the church to which I belong has -a
mission field somewhere out there-it is that
people who follow that calling do not recognize that a war exists. But, as, I say, the
commanists show a strange mentality when
they suspect persons who forgo a life of
freedom and simple pleasure, in Britain,
France or the United States, and go out to
teach and heal the people of these far-off
countries. The events of the last day or
two would have convinced, me, had I needed
any convincing, that when the germ of communism enters the souls of men it seems to
drive out all sentiments of humanity and al]
regard for the sacred rights of the individual; 'and I am the last man who would
protest against measures to meet perils of
this kind.
From that aspect I support the bill,
although there are things in it which I react
against. It is one of the paradoxes of life
that to meet the menace of dictatorship we
have to pass laws which invest somebody
with dictatorial powers. I intend no criticism in this connection, either of the legislation or of any individual who may be
appointed to put it into effect. The fact
remains, however, that to oppose dictatorship
we pass laws which give somebody absolutely
dictatorial powers. The very thing we are
fighting is the thing we use to fight it with.
Maybe that is necessary. I am not sure.
When this bill goes to committee I think
it should be very thoroughly examined to
ensure that nothing shall be done to unnecessarily limit the freedom of the individual.
Already, Canadian boys are overseas, and
more will follow them. We cannot blind ourselves to the fact that if war should break
out hundreds and thousands of young Canadians will have to go. There is no comparison
between what the fighting men are required
to undergo, and any demands which may
be made upon the rest of us. The two things
are simply not in the sane category. Most

of us, remembering the last war, can speak
with some feeling about that. At the sane
time, we are fighting to maintain freedom,
and we should not surrender our own liberty
in any greater measure than is necessary to
make an effective fight against dictatorship.
As regards the bill itself, I have only one
suggestion to make. The expiry date is July
31, 1956-nearly five and a half years hence.
That is a little too f ar off. I would prefer a
limit of three years, but I would agree to a
life of four years frorn the 31st of July next.
It should be remembered that a number of
contracts have already been let, and some,
including airplane contracts, are already in
production. So I think the expiry period
should be cut down. I have sometimes fallen
out with the honourable member from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) when he wanted
to tie things down more tightly than I thought
necessary, but I do not think parliament
should surrender its powers permanently or
for a long period. The government should
come back from time to time to ask for
extensions; and July 31, 1956, is too remote.
Though I may be out of order in doing so, I
should like to refer by way of illustration to
the Foreign Exchange Control Act. When
the bill was before this house, it was amended
to require the government to seek a renewal
of the legislation year by year. One consequence of limiting the duration of powers
under a measure is that governments liberalize its terms when extensions are asked for.
I do not say this in a spirit of criticism. At
one time a visitor to the United States was
limited to $50 in American currency; upon
a renewal of the bill the sum was increased.
I repeat when permission must be asked to
renew controls, those controls are reduced;
that is human nature.
I congratulate the government on having
made this legislation effective for only a
limited period, although the period is longer
than I could have wished, and I shall try to
have it shortened a year. I believe that
will make it more satisfactory. I hope, however, that nothing I have said will give anybody the impression that the party I have
the honour to represent is opposed to wholeheartedly getting ready to defend, if need
be, our country and our freedom, and to stand
with the rest of the Atlantic nations in their
determination to protect freedom's cause in
the world. I agree with what the honourable member for Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) said about a month iago that there
must be many people in Russia who do not
support the philosophy or the policies of
their rulers; and if the Russian people can

MARCH 13, 1951
be freed from slavery, it will be an achievement to the credit of this twentieth century
and to ourselves.
For these reasons I give my unqualified
support to anything the government can do,
within reason, to prepare us for whatever
we may have to meet.
May I digress a moment to say that those
of us who went to Cartierville, near
Montreal, to visit a large airplane factory were
much impressed with the performance of a
slim little machine which, I was told by the
chairman of the company, .can fiy over seven
hundred miles an hour. I believe the cost is
about $400,000; a little more when equipment
is added. That, I suggest, is one striking
evidence of the determination of the Canadian people to get ready.
Our expenditure on preparations may be
greater because in the past few months we
have given quantities of equipment to various
Eùropean states. I do not favour granting
these nations money which, some may think,
might be wasted, but I am wholly in favour
of helping Western Europe with the necessary equipment to defend itself against attack.
I speak for myself-although after a recent
debate it is pretty hard for a leader to convince some people that he speaks as an
individual, not for his party-when I say that
I am persuaded that Canada will spend 100
per cent for freedom, for the right of the
people of the world to live their own lives.
We will defend this great cause to the limit
of our ability in men and materials.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
with most of, the remarks made by the leader
of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) in
introducing the bill I think nearly all honourable senators will agree. As this is the
second reading, and the bill is to go to committee, I think I should take a minute or two
to express the views I hold with regard to
the powers in the bill.
The honourable leader bas pointed to the
great part played by Canada in the last war.
I think it is generally recognized that Canadian military and industrial achievements
during World War II raised us to a premier
place in the eyes of the world.
Mention has been made about the profits of
private .companies. In that regard we showed
a great deal of wisdom in sending men to
inspect the books of the various companies
after the war, with result that the government
reclaimed over $100 million of profits which
these companies would otherwise have
retained. We must watch what we grant in
the way of accelerated depreciation. During
Wor'ld War II many companies which went

into war production were granted huge sums
in the form of accelerated depreciation. However, this was not so in the case of smaller
firms which did sub-contract work, and which
were later called upon to hand back some of
the profits they had made, and upon which
they had paid taxes. I know that many
firms were severely crippled when they had
to pay back some of the profits they had
already used.
I was interested in what the leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) said a few
moments ago about loss of freedom. I realize
that I am one of the few in the country who
view with alarm the loss of freedom; we saw
a great deal of this kind of thing during
World War II; but I realize the necessity for
the powers that the government require, and
I think I can say without fear of successful
contradiction that what the Canadian government did was, on the whole, excellent,
and that one of the reasons for the little
opposition to the present bill is the wise way
in which the Minister of Trade and
Commerce administered similar legislation.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I doubt whether anyone
will deny that it is because of his ability and
integrity that there bas been little opposition
in the Commons and throughout the country
to this measure. I have a high regard for
the Honourable 'C. D. Howe, but I view with
some alarm the handing over of powers
extending, beyond the life of this parliament.
I am not speaking particularly of the
Senate but of the House of Commons. I
think we are going a little too far. The
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) said
that he would like to reduce the life of this
measure by one year, but I would point out
that if we hand over these powers for a
period beyond the life of parliament, we are
establishing a somewhat dangerous precedent.
I believe that if in two or three years the
government were to need an extension of
these powers they would have no difficultybecause of the wise administration of Mr.
Howe-in getting parliament to grant it. The
powers granted under this bill are greater
than we have ever handed out before, and
when we are asked to grant them beyond
the life of this parliament, I think it is time
we gave a second look at what is happening,
and I rise to voice my protest from this point
of view. It is not my idea to restrict the
powers of the minister, because I know how
he handled similar powers in the past. But
I can see powers being handed over to controllers, to take charge of companies and of
the lives of the people who are filling war
contracts.

SENATE
Perhaps there would be an election. What
would take place then, with these powers in
effect? They may be necessary in order to
carry out the work which must be undertaken during these darkening days; but I
would again point out that we lost a great
deal of freedom during the last war. Our
people were regimented as never before.
Some of the powers conferred upon the government at that time have never been
restored. Perhaps this is the inevitableness
of things, but I want to draw the attention
of the people of Canada to the fact that bit
by bit and step by step we are being
regimented. I recall that not so long ago we
pointed to the CCF party and said: "Look,
we will have to do something about keeping
these men from getting into power." We
have gone so far now and have taken so much
power that there is not anuch left for the
CCFers; and that is why they are going
down. I agree with the sentiments expressed
by the leader of the opposition when he said
that in our efforts at fighting a dictator, we
must take care and see to it that our children
will not one day wake up to find themselves
completely regimented and under state
control.
Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators,
I think the leader of the government (Hon.
Mr. Robertson), and the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), deserve credit for the
very high and patriotic plane on which they
have based their discussion of this bill. I
share some of the apprehensions expressed
by the honourable gentleman from New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid), but I do not
believe that they weigh very much in the
balance when one considers the conditions
which confront our country today, and the
measures which have to be taken to meet the
present emergency. In 1914 we did not have
to face the same totalitarian states that we
are facing today; yet at the opening of the
war session of that year a War Measures Bill
was introduced which received the unanimous
approval of parliament. It was realized that
without unity of action a war could not be
successfully fought. It was further realized
that unity of action was impossible if the
government had to consult all the people of
the country, or even the representatives of
the people in the Senate and the House of
Commons, because parliament is not always
In session. It was necessary, therefore, to
give the government certain extraordinary
powers to cope with their extraordinary
duties. The same thing occurred at the opening of the second war. I agree with the
honourable senator from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid) when he says that the emergency powers given to the government at the

commencement of World War Il were admirably administered. They were used sparingly
and to the satisfaction of all Canadians, and
this was 'proven by the fact that the government upon which these powers had been
conferred was returned to power in the elections of 1945 and 1949.
The leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) said that he had some doubts as to what
the situation would be if the War Measures
Act were re-introduced in its entirety. I
share those doubts, which have also been
expressed in the other house. We have not
done in Canada what has been done in the
United States. In that country the President
declared a state of emergency, and under the
conditions which follow the proclamation of
a state of emergency the extraordinary
powers that are vested in the government of
the day provide for a measure similar to the
War Measures Act. In Canada the government has not so far deemed it advisable to
declare a state of emergency; but if one considers the bill now before us one will find that
it is very directly linked with national
defence. Nobody will deny that although we
are not yet at war we are confronted with a
world crisis. The United Nations Organization, to which we belong, declared that there
had been an act of aggression and called upon
member nations to send troops to put an end
to it; and it is in response to this call that
our troops are now in the Far East. But
Canada has not made any declaration of war,
nor has a state of emergency been declared
by the government. However, parliament has
the anciillary powers that are necessarily incidental to national defence, and in my humble
judgment this bill as presented to us is so
closely linked up with national defence as to
be within our constitutional jurisdiction.
I am also of the opinion that the measure
is a most expedient one. After the last war
we speedily undertook to liberate ourselves
from all the controls that had been established
during the conflict. We in Canada do not like
controls: they are not consonant with our
method of thinking and our ways of life. We
want freedom of action for all except wrongdoers; but in an emergency, faced with conditions created by a totalitarian state, we
adopt measures to give the government
powers to cope successfully with that emergency. The advisers of the government have
considered this measure essential to carrying
out our war effort. I trust these advisers, for
their advice is in keeping with that given to
the government at the beginning of World
War I and World War II. I am confident
that the government will use the extraordinary powers given by parliament as
wisely as they did during the last war.

MARCH 13, 1951
This bill will also give the government the
power necessary to curb excessive war
profits. I would, however, point out that in
wartime profiteering may be done by others
as well as producers of munitions or military
supplies. The whole economy of the nation
is geared up in an abnormal way, and great
numbers of people who have nothing to do
with war contracts derive extraordinary
profits. The honourable leader of the government is wrong, I believe, in attributing the
recent rises in -prices on the stock exchange
and the apparent speculation in stocks to
anticipated profits on war contracts. Experience during the last war would not lead
people to expect to make gains in this way.
During the last war the Excess Profits Tax
and the Income Tax levied heavy taxes on
profits, and the government used those taxes
to sustain the nation's war effort. I think we
should not expect that any excessive profits
will be made by war contractors or people in
any other walk of life during the present
emergency.
I believe that this bill is timely as well as
expedient. Although in normal times we are
all desirous of having a free economy, in an
emergency such as this we willingly submit
to controls which are essential to the
country's war effort. Nobody would advocate
the permanent maintenance of economic controls, but at this juncture we know that certain controls are necessary. We saw how
impossible it was to remove the foreign
exchange control entirely, and now it is necessary to reimpose certain other restrictions.
We trust the government to use them wisely
and sparingly, and at the earliest possible
moment to give parliament an opportunity
to wipe them off the statute book.
I agree that the period of duration of the
controls is a little bit long. The other day in
committee I expressed the opinion that two
years should be sufficient. I am still of
that opinion. I would draft these powers for
two years, and invite the government to trust
parliament to renew them at the end of that
time, if necessary. It would be in order for
the government to come back to parliament
in two years' time, when, if conditions warranted, the matter could be considered.
With that reservation and limitation, I am in
favour of this legislation to which we are
now asked to give second reading.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
80713-17

Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, in
these difficult and menacing days through
which the world is passing we have to recognize that certain of our freedoms and liberties
must of necessity be circumscribed. Distasteful though the provisions of this bill may be
to my conception of freedom and liberty, it
seems to me to be our clear duty to support
the principle of the measure and the purposes
to which it seeks to give effect. Let us not,
however, deceive ourselves that the bill does
not give extraordinary powers to the minister
who shall have charge of its administration.
It is true that these powers fall substantially
short of those given under the War Measures
Act. Our honourable colleague from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) raised a question
as to how this bill compares with the War
Measures Act. We find that that Act cannot
be invoked in the present circumstances, but
only when war has come upon us or we are
threatened with insurrection.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Or apprehended war.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Yes; but it has to be very
close.
The measure before us gives control, not
over the lives of our people or the individual
personal freedom and liberty of our citizens,
but over matters related to our national
defence. Our obligations in this regard seem
to me to be two-fold. First and foremost,
there is the obligation to defend ourselves;
and secondly there is Canada's obligation,
assumed with the approval òf parliament, to
our associates in the Atlantic Pact. These
obligations require us to build ships, tanks,
guns and airplanes, and to do all the things
that are necessary for defence. The ramifications of these obligations are very wide.
Although we had hoped that we were nearing the time when all the restrictions resulting
from the last war would disappear, we now
find ourselves in dangerous days and under
the necessity of submitting to limitations such
as this measure would impose.
The powers which this measure would give
are almost identical with those which existed
under the Munitions and Supply Act during
the last war, and it is a matter of satisfaction
to me to know that a former colleague, the
present Minister of Trade and Commerce, will
have the administration of this new department. Although I have not always agreed
with the stand he has taken on certain matters, I say without reservation that I doubt
if there is anywhere in Canada a man who
could have discharged more efficiently the
duties which he discharged under the Munitions and Supply Act, or the duties he will
be called upon to carry out when this measure
comes into effect.

SENATE

The honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig) did us a service tonight in calling our
attention to the fact that this interference
with freedom and liberty is a paradox: that
in order to fight authoritarianism and dictatorship in the world we must, to a certain
degree at least, concentrate power in the
hands of the executive, and in particular of
an individual minister. But I can see no
escape from that situation. The important
thing is that we never allow ourselves to
forget that the principles of freedom and
liberty are most important, and that, although
we surrender them temporarily for the purposes outlined in this bill, we keep always
before us the fact that these powers must
some day be returned to parliament and to
the people of Canada.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I am sure that if a
university student interested in political
science were to undertake a study of the
increase in powers extended to the executive
over the past fifty years, it would prove to be
very revealing. During the First World War
we operated under the War Measures Act;
it was necessary, and I am not for a moment
decrying it. But after all, governments
charged with the administration of the
affairs of the country, and their servants,
find such an Act a very convenient instrument. It embodies the principle of government
by decree, which is the cardinal feature of
all authoritarian governments. During the
First World War we became to some extent
accustomed to this form of government.
During the early inter-war years we regained
a good deal of our practice of freedom, but
during the depression years some rather
extraordinary things were done. By the time
the Second World War came along we found
that this type of government was greater
in scope and effect than it was during the
First World War. There again we lost a
measure of respect for the freedom and
liberty of the individual. We became used
to doing business that way, and the government and its servants, as I have said, found
it much easier to get an order in council
for some purpose than to get an Act of
Parliament.
By this means our individual freedom and
liberty has in a rather insidious way been
undergoing a measure of almost unconscious
change. That is a condition which I think
we must constantly guard against. There will
be little profit to ourselves, to our children
or to our children's children if, in the process
of serving freedom in the World, we travel
a road on which we lose a large measure of
our own personal freedom and liberty.

While I agree that under the circumstances
we must give to the executive the powers
asked for by this measure, I do hope that
we will always keep before us the thought
that they are given for a special purpose,
and that when that purpose has been
achieved, parliament will require the return
to it of these powers to be put in cold
storage until circumstances again arise which
make it necessary to use them.
I did not expect that there would be second
reading and a discussion tonight, and so, my
colleagues, what I have said to you has been
more or less impromptu. But the measure
will go to a committee of the house; it may
there be examined in detail; perhaps we can
improve it in certain respects. We can consider the suggestion made by the leader of
the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), supported by
one or two others of our colleagues, that the
legislation should be more limited in the
time of its operation than the bill provides
for. But these matters, which we can consider in committee, do not affect the principle
and the purpose of the bill. However regretfully we may feel about it, our plain duty, it
seems to me, is to pass the bill.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators.
I am one of those who, like the
honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) "view with alarm" when measures
are brought before us which curtail the rights
and liberties and safety of the subject. I
think I have demonstrated that on a good
many occasions. I am rather interested to
note that the honourable member for
Churchill and I are in agreement with respect
to this bill. When in a previous session, a
measure of a similar character was brought
before us, I supported it and he did not. We
are both supporting this measure.
While, as I said, I view with alarm when
the liberty of the subject is being whittled
down and curtailed, I think we ought to take
a good close look at this bill to see just how
far it goes.
It is nothing like the War
Measures Act. That is why I asked the question, in what degree does this bill fall short
of the War Measures Act? That measure is
of a general character; it confers on the
government powers almost of life and death,
over both property and person in the nation.
It forms the basis of legislation which flowed
from the council chamber during the last
war and the war which preceded it,-legiciation of the widest character, which could be
used, if the government felt so disposed, in
the most dominating way. This bill on the
contrary is specific in its character.. As I
read it, it applies for the most part, though
not exclusively, to people who enter into
contracts with the government for the supply

MARCH 13, 1951

of war materials. The main purpose is to
give the executive, when it enters into contracts for the supply of materials and services
necessary to the war effort, power to control
the operation and those who take part in it;
and I do not see why that power should not
be in the hands of government. If we enter
into a really hot war we shall empower the
government to take the young man out of his
home against his will and that of his parents,
put him in uniform and send him to war. It
is very hard to conceive any greater interference with the rights and liberties of the
subject. We are probably approaching that
period. When I view this possibility I find
it rather difficult to become much disturbed
over giving the executive power to interfere
with the carrying on of war contracts, even
though at times the decisions are not acceptable to those who are engaged in the task
of production.
There are one or two ways in which this
bill exceeds the general description that I
have given. For instance, section 23 refers
to a person who owns or controls facilities
which are suitable for or can be adapted to
the work required to be carried on, and it
gives the minister power to requisition those
facilities and direct them into war channels.
Well, it seems to me that if a person, acting
within the scope of our civilization, acquires
materials or owns facilities necessary for the
effort we are putting forward to protect our
freedom, but is not prepared to offer them
voluntarily to our collective selves, there is no
reason why we should not take them, and
why, if they are necessary to our war effort,
we should not put them to work for our war
effort. It is true that in this, as in other
things, the government which governs least
will be the government which governs best;
and the Department of Munitions and Supply
which is in reality the department affected,
will do well to rely as far as possible on
diplomacy and persuasion, rather than on
compulsion. The less that general powers of
this kind are employed, the better it will be
for the department, for those upon whom the
powers are applied, and for the nation at
large.
The other very controversial section in this
bill is that which gives the government the
right to reduce the amount of profits that
may be made by those who enter into war
contracts. I know we have boasted at times
that on the conclusion of the last war the
Accounting Branch of the Department of
Munitions and Supply recovered. from those
who had engaged in war contracts a sum of
semething like $100 million. I do not know
that I am ready to do much boasting about
that. There are two sides to this question of
80713-17J

recovery of profits which have been made in
the carrying out of contracts that have been
freely entered into. There have been businessmen who went into contracts with agents of
the government, perhaps made a good bargain, carried out their obligations efficiently
and well, showed a profit, spent it-as the
honourable senator from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid) has remarked-and then were
attacked by the department and asked, to
return this profit. The measures were drastic;
the result was hardship. I would suggest to
the department that it enter now into contracts with such care and knowledge and foresight that businessmen will not have the
opportunity of making excessive profits out of
the contracts which they sign. The time to
see to it that profits are not excessive is when
the contract is being made. At the commencement of the last war conditions were
the exact opposite. Nobody could see far
into the future; the rush and hurry were very
great; and some of the contracts were not
well-considered. So there was more excuse
than there is now for going back on a contract,
after it had been completed, and having a
re-accounting of the profits. The department
could do very little to recover the profits. I
do not mind letting the government have this
power, but I think it should be understood
that the recovery of large sums of money from
businessmen who have acted upon the
strength of a contract into which they have
entered, is not a matter to boast about. This
is the time to be careful, and not after the
contract has been completed.
I am agreeable to this measure being given
second reading because I fully realize that all
it does is to give the purchasing officers of
our government the right to control munition
contracts; but I agree with the honourablè
senator from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien)
that five years is too long a period for this
measure to remain in force. When powers òf
this kind were sought in committee the other
day I moved to limit the life of the particular
measure to two years, and it was actually
reduced to three years. I think we would be
very unwise to allow this measure to go
through without reducing its life to at most
three years; I would favour two. It is not
that we should give notice that we will not
extendi these powers, but we should take precaution to have these powers brought beforé
us from time to time in order to have their
continued existence justified. I hope that
the committee to which this bill will be referred will reduce the life of these powers.
Han. Gordon B. Isnor: Honourable senators,
I was pleased that the honourable gentleman
from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien) brought up
the question of excess profits, and that he

SENATE

more or less defended the position taken by
manufacturers who showed such wonderful
co-operation during the entire period of
World< War IL I think we should: have a clear
understanding about the profits referrel to
by the honourable senators from New Westminis'er (Hon. Mr. Reid) and Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck), particularly as to the
large arnounts that were later claimed by
the government.
It must be rememberel that many of these
manufacturers were entering on a new phase
of business which had been brought about by
war conditions. At the request of the government they undertook to enter into new types
of production, and they were unprepared at
that time to realize the profits which would
be derived, from their operations. The large
scope and the efficient manner in which these
manufacturers carried out their operations
naturally resulted in increased profits. I would
point out that there was a clause-and I think
those honourable senators who have referred
to these excess profits have overlooked this
fact-which authorized the government to
re-negotiate these contracts. It was under
this clause that the Honourable Mr. Howe
exercised his right to re-negotiate, and
brought back to the country or to the government, and properly so, the excess profits which
were made as a result of the very fine operations of the Canadian manufacturers. I think
Canada found herself in an exceedingly
favourable position, and she was more or less
envied by the rest of the world for the fine
manner in which her manufacturers carried
out their war contracts.
I believe the honourable leader (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) said that this measure was to prevent profiteering. I doubt whether there was
any profiteering in Canada during World War
I think our record was exceptional in
I.
that respect, and I think we should be pleased
at the way in which our manufacturers
co-operated with the government in an all-out
war effort. As to ex.cess profits, we all know
that if they do not ýcome back in one way they
will come back in another.
Honourable senators, I rose particularly to
ask the leader of the government if he would
enlarge upon the words "centralized control"
which he used when introducing this bill. I
think there is an objection to that tern in the
West and in the extreme East. That is what
is causing us to wonder if the West and the
East are going to share in the benefits which
would accrue from an even distribution of
war contracts, and which at the same time
would bring about a better state of economy
in the country as a whole. I wonder if the
honourable leader would be good enough to

explain just what he meant by "centralized
control"? Would it result in the building
up of stockpiles in central Canada at the
expense of other sections of the country, or
has the leader some other interpretation?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I would point out
to the honourable gentleman from HalifaxDartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor) that this question
is covered by the inquiry which now stands
in his name on the Order Paper, and which
I intend to answer tomorrow. If I answer
it now I shall perhaps not have anything to
say tomorrow.

Hon. Mr. Isnor: If the honourable leader
is going to make a full explanation tomorrow,
I certainly do not wish him to enlarge upon
this particular question now.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I certainly am going
to answer the point raised. by my honourable
friend. I have prepared an answer and will
give it publicly tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: That is quite ail right.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
it might not be inappropriate if I were to ask

Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
it is with very great pleasure that I answer

Ordinarily one judges the men and women
of a province by the people he meets from

the people of Nova Scotia from the Nova
Scotians that I had met in this chamber.
However, when I got down to that province
I found its inhabitants were very fine people.
They entertained us lavishly and with great
eclat, and we hatd a very pleasant time.
Curling is a game that you are supposed to
play on ice, and the boys from British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba
thought they were pretty fair curlers. But,
oh, my! Those boys from Nova Scotia took
them to town in no uncertain way! It may
please the people here from Quebec when
I say that the team which gave Nova Scotia
its hardest fight was from that province. It
was beaten by only one point on the last end,
that point having been made by the Nova
Scotia Skip.
I wish to thank the Lieutenant Governor of
Nova Scotia, the Premier of Nova Scotia, the

SENATE

Mayor of the city of Halifax, and especially
the people of Nova Scotia, for the very fine
time they gave us throughout our stay. If I
had any criticism at all to make it would be
that as there are only 24 hours in a day,
and those kind people entertained us for
at least that number of hours daily, we did
not have much time to sleep. Otherwise,
everything went fine.
The weather in Nova Scotia is beautiful.
I may say to my friends of the West Coast
that I visited Vancouver a year ago. That
is in British Columbia, where the people
boast about their sunshine. Well, I saw more
sunshine and fine weather in Nova Scotia in
one day than I saw in the seven drays that I
was in Vancouver.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Haig: If ever I have to leave
Manitoba for a province where the sun shines
bright all day and the moon shines bright
all night, I shall go to Nova Scotia.
I join with all honourable senators in
extending hearty congratulations to the winning team.
Hon. J. A. McDonald: Honourable senators,

I should like to add my sincere ýcongratulations to the curlers of Nova Scotia, and particularly the winning team, from Kentville.
I feel more than a little pride in the winning
team, for it comes from the shire town in the
constituency which I had the honour to represent in the local legislature for many years.
I know that honourable members from my
province will wish to join with me when I
thank the honourable leader of the opposition
and Chairman of the Board of Trustees of
the Macdonald Brier Canadian Curling
Championship Trophy (Hon. Mr. Haig), for
his kind words about the people of Nova
Scotia. He d'id, though, seem to cast a little
reflection on the Nova Scotians whom he has
met in this chamber. He said that from
meeting them he had formed a certain opinion, but when he got down to Halifax he
found the people were very fine.
Last Sunday evening in his regular weekly
broadcast over CBC Mr. John Fisher spoke
on curling, and any honourable senators
who are interested in the game and did not
hear him would find it worth while to get a
copy of his address. He is always good, but
I thought h excelled himself on that occasion. He paid a very high tribute to the
late Professor D. H. McNeill, Registrar of
Dalhousie University, who was the skip of
the only other Nova Scotia team which has
won the Canadian Curling Championship.
I am sure that all curlers and friends of
curlers in Nova Scotia hope that the trustees
will be able to arrange a visit in the near
future to the Evangeline country, the home of
the present champs.

SENATE
went so far as to hint in the debate on the
address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne that some honourable senator might
introduce a discussion on this subject. It
would be a little awkward for me, as a
member of the government, to initiate it, but
I should welcome such a discussion. In these
times, when it is probable that every manufacturing industry in Canada will soon be
producing at its maximum, some firms might
be reluctant to accept war contracts. Realizing that war business is something that might
last for only a year or two, some firms might
fear that if they went into it they would find,
two or three years from now, that their
competitors who confined themselves to the
production of consumer goods had obtained
an advantage in the market.
For my part, if I were directing or concerned with trying to direct the industrial
development of Nova Scotia, for instance, I
should not concentrate my efforts entirely
on war contracts, desirable as the business
might be. I should try to develop the production of civilian goods which are bound to be
in short supply during the war, and it might
be that in the long run this type of business
would prove much the better. I remember the
experience of two shipbuilding concerns in
western Nova Scotia during the last war.
One, which had practically all the work that
it could attend to, was very reluctant to take
war orders, and devoted itself almost exclusively to civilian business. The other firm
started operations at that time and concentrated on war orders. At the end of the war
the firm that concentrated on war orders
closed up, with all the usual accompanying
dislocation as to employees. The other firm
continued to carry on successfully. As I say,
I think it would be worth while to have a discussion in here on this question. To some
degree, such a discussion might appear to be
directed against the government, of which
I am a memb:r, and therefore it would be
hard]y proper for me to initiate it. But there
is no reason why some other senator should
not bring the subject before the house.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Honourable senators, with
your permission I should like to thank the
leader
of
the government
(Hon. Mr.
Robertson) for his reply and kindly suggestion. His reply contains a ray of hope, and
slight though it is I trust that it may brighten
and become an actuality. I trust that the
honourable gentleman's suggestion will be
followed and that this question of decentralization in the placing of orders will be brought
up by some other member. In my opinion,
the matter is of importance, particularly to
the economy of the eastern and western parts
of our country.

THE ESTIMATES
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE ON FINANCE
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved:
That the Standing Ccmmittee on Finance be authorized to examine the expenditures proposed by the
Estimates laid before parliament for the fiscal year
ending March 31, 1952, in advance of the Bills based
on the said E timates reaching the Senate: That it
be empowered to send for records of revenues from
taxation collected by the federal, provincial and
municipal goverrnents in Canada, and records of
expenditures by such governments, showing sources
of income and expenditures of same under appropriate headings, together with estimates of gross
national production, net national income and movement of the cost-of-living index, and their relation
to such total expenditures, for the year 1939 and
for the latest year for which the information is
available, and such other matters as may be pertinent to the examination of the Estimates, and to
report upon the same.
That the said committee be empowered to send
for persons, papers and records.

aware, the Estimates were tabled only a few
days ago, and consequently no examination
of them has yet been possible. It is scarcely
practicable to commence a formal examination before the Easter recess, but I would
suggest to the members of the committee that
we should commence our duties in this
respect as soon as the recess is over. I do not
know just when that will be, because I am
not sure what period of adjournment the hon-

ourable leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) is going to propose. In any event,
I suggest to the members of the Finance
Committee that in the meantime they might
be scanning these estimates to familiarize
themselves with them, and when we reassemble after the recess we can get down
solidly to business. I hope that the examination can be concluded in five or six weeks.
I may say for the information of honourable members that it will be recommended
that the Finance Committee be divideJ into
several subcommittees, each having no more
than seven members, and that a portion of the
Estimates be assigned to each sub-committee.
In that way several committees might sit at
the same time and facilitate the examination
of the whole body of Estimates.
Hon. Mr. Reid:

Honourable senators, I arn

very pleased indeed that the Estimates are
to be referred to the Standing Committee on

Finance. While of course it is very difficult
to specify all the good which was done
through the committee's work last year, I
might draw attention to one little improvement which resulted from their deliberations. If you will glance at the Estimates
you will notice that, following a suggestion
Committee that the

Estimates be presented in greater detail, the
present volume is just about twice the size
of the one last year. Evidently it is now
recognized that members of parliament are
entitled to more information.
Hon. Mr. Gladstone: I should like to inquire
of the leader of the government whether
the proposed committee is to replace all the
committees on Estimates which functioned
last year.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I am glad my honourable friend has asked that question, because
it has just occurred to me that I omitted to
explain the matter. It will be remembered
that last year, when the Estimates were

adopted more or less as an experiment, with
the understanding that after one year's
experience it would be reconsidered. I
believe the consensus of opinion was that the
problem of finding accommodation, and the
engagement of various members on other
committees, caused many complications. So
this year, after consultation with the chairmen of the respective committees, we have
decided to propose that all the Estimates be
referred to the Finance Committee, who can
do their work. if they so desire, in the way
that the chairman, the honourable senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) has indicated. I shal be only too happy to follow
such suggestions as, in the light of experience,
the committee may wish to make.
Hon. Mr. Gladstone: May I suggest to the
leader of the government that the members
of the Committee on Finance be canvassed
to ascertain whether they can attend the
meetings? If certain members should find
it impossible to do so, it might be practicable
to replace them with others who will attend.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: My answer to the
honourable senator's suggestion is that my
responsibility in relation to the committee
on Estimates is discharged when I move the
reference to the committee of the Estimates
of the government of which I am a member,
and about which 1, having approved of
these estimates, theoretically know everything. Thereafter the matter is in the hands
of the comrnmittee, and I shall be glad to
transmit to the house for its attention any

I did not last year attend a single committee
meeting at which Estimates were examined,
and it is not my intention at the moment
to be present at the meetings this year. These
matters are in the hands of the house. If
there is some criticism of the government
by an honourable senator, I suppose I must
try to do something about it. But the question
which has been raised is for the committee,
and what the committee decides to do will
be passed upon by the house as a whole.
Hon. Mr. King: I want to congratulate the
leader and the committee on the fact that,
guided by the experience of last year, they
have decided to recommend the appointment
of one large committee. I believe that, in
view of the character of the work, this
procedure will be more satisfactory.

SENATE
EMERGENCY POWERS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. A. K. Hugessen moved the second
reading of Bill 24, an Act to confer certain
emergency powers upon the Governor in
Council.
He said: This bill is, I think, a rather
unusual bill, and it results from the unusual
situation in which the world finds itself today
-a state not of peace and not of all-out war,
but one which some people refer to as a "cold
war", and which, I suppose, might with equal
aptitude be spoken of as a "hot peace". At
any rate it is the twilight zone in which this
world now exists-of not exactly peace and
not exactly war-which necessitates this
particular bill at this time. It is perhaps
a paradox through which we are living that
at the moment it would seem that the best
way for the western democracies to avoid a
third world war-if not, indeed, the only
way-is to prepare themselves to wage war
as fast as they possibly can. This bill is
designed in pursuance of that objective.
I should perhaps point out that this
measure was clearly forecast in the Speech
from the Throne which was delivered just a
little over a month ago. To refresh the
memories of honourable senators perhaps I
will be permitted to quote a paragraph from
that Speech, which among other things says:
The policies of the government are designed to
prevent war, but the dangers of the international
situation and the magnitude of the defence effort
required as a deterrent have, in the opinion of my
ministers, created an emergency situation. You will
acccrdingly be asked to approve legislation vesting
in the Governor in Council additional powers to
ensure adequate defence preparations to meet the
present emergency and to prevent economic dislocaticn resulting from defence preparations.

This bill is designed to meet an emergency
situation and, in fact, the first paragraph of

its preamble

warns that

an international

emergency exists that threatens the security

of Canada. It is proposed, therefore, to confer certain emergency powers upon the
government. As I say, we are living in a
condition of half-war, so I suppose this bill
might properly be referred to as a half War
Measures Act.
Perhaps the first question that might be
asked in considering this measure would be
this: If we are in a condition of emergency,
why do we not go back to the War Measures
Act under which this country was governed
during the first and second Great Wars? That
is a logical question, but there are a number
of reasons, I suggest, why it is not advisable
at this stage to go back to the War Measures
Act.
The first reason is in the order of a legal
argument. As honourable senators know, the

War Measures Act can only go into effect
upon a proclamation by the Governor in
Council of the existence of real or apprehended war, invasion or insurrection. I think
it is doubtful or at least arguable whether
the present international situation could be
brought squarely within the meaning of those
words. If there is any douibt about this
question, I suggest that it would be a very
unfortunate development in our affairs for
the government to proclain the War Measures

Act now, and to have a great deal of necessary action taken under it, only to have some
court declare later on that the government
did not have the power to bring the Act
into force in the light of the restrictions upon
its coming into operation.
The second argument against the introduction of the War Measures Act at this
juncture partakes more of the nature of a
psychological argument. After all, the only
two occasions in the history of this country
when the War Measures Act was brought into
effect were times when the country was
actually at war and fighting for its life.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Declared war.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: That is not the position
today. It might conceivably have an effect
upon the mentality of Canadians if the
government were to proclaim the War
Measures Act for a third time. The people
might say, "Well, the government knows a
great deal more about international conditions than, we do, and the fact that it has
proclaimed the War Measures Act quite
obviously means that a third world war is
almost inevitable and likely to corne at any
time". The government is trying to avert
war and I do not think we should do anything
to lead Canadians into the belief that a third
world war is in any way inevitable.
There is a third reason against the War
Measures Act being introduced now, a reason
which I think reflects a good deal of credif
upon the government of the day. Under
present conditions the government-which is
a democratic government of a democratic
people-does not want to seek greater and
more extraordinary powers than it believes
to be essential at the present time.
Despite all this, it is idle to deny that the
bill under consideration confers extremely
wide powers upon the government. The
objects for which these powers are sought are
clearly set out in the preamble in a general
way: first, to carry out adequate defence
preparations; second, to regulate the economy
of Canada to meet the needs of defence, and
third, to stabilize the economy and safeguard
it from disruption. These are pretty broad
objectives, and equally broad powers are
required in order to attain thiem. But again

MARCH 14, 1951
I think that the powers which the government is asking us to confer upon it by this
measure can very usefuiiy be compared with
those which the government wauld have
obtained under the War Measures Act. I
think it was the leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) who asked yesterday evening
the very pertinent question as to, what was the
difierence between the pawers now being
sought and thase which the goverrnent
would have under the War Measures Act;
and with leave of the hause I shouid like ta
go shortly over the powers given by the War
Measures Act and indicate the extent ta, which
they are cut down in this bil.
Both the War Measures Act and the bill
now befare us start out with very generai
language empowering the Governor in Council ta make any such orders and regulations
as he may deem necessary or advisabie for
the security, defence, peace, order and wellare of Canada, and then each measure gaes
an. ta specif y certain particular pawers. The
first power specified in the War Measures Act
is censorship. Weli, that power is specifically
omitted frorm the bill. The second power
un-der the War Measures Act is the contrai
and suppression of publications, writings,
maps, plans and photographs. Under this bili
the government does seek power ta contrai
and suppress maps, plans and photagraphs,
but nat ta suppress publications or writings.
Both measures are designed to contrai communications and means af communication.
Another power, a very wide one, canferred by
the War Measures Act, is the power of arrest,
detention, exclusion and deportation. There is
no such power cantained in the present bill.
Three af the powers in the War Measures
Act are repeated word for word in this bill.
They are: (1) contrai of the harbours, ports
and territorial waters of Canada and the
movements af vesseis; (2) transpýortation by
land, air or water and the cantrol af the
transport of persans and things; (3) trading,
exportation, importation, production and
With regard ta these three
maniufacture.
items there is no difference between the two
bis.
The iast of the powers given in the War
Measures Act is an extremeiy broad power
over ail kinds af property, expressed in these
words: "appropriation, contrai, farfeiture and
disposition of property and of the use
thereof."~ That is about the widest language
that one could possîbiy conceive af for giving
the government contrai over every kind af
praperty and every kind af use and disposition of property. That provision is not ta
be found in the bill bel are us.
Sa, generaiiy speaking, I think I can say
withaut fear of contradiction that the powcrs
80713--181

which this bill seeks ta confer upan the
governiment of the day are substantially less
than those which it wouid have had if it had
thought fit ta invoke the War Measures Act.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I wonder if I may interrupt
the honourabie gentleman and ask a question?
Hou. Mr. Hugessen: Certainiy.
Han. Mr. Reid: Subsection 5 of section 2
provides that parliament may annul any
order in council passed under this measure.
What procedure wouid have ta be foiiowed
in the Senate, for instance, ta bring about
annulment?
Han. Mr. Hugessen: I shail be coming ta
that," if my friend will aliow me, in a few
minutes.
Generally speaking, I think it can be said
that the powers which are sought in this
bill are powers ta contrai the ecanomic hi! e
af the country, in sa, f ar as such contrai may
be necessary by reason of the emergency, and
not ta contrai individuals by arrest or by
suppression of newspapers or anything of
that kind. I am bound ta say, of course,
that this bul does inchude a very large measure af contrai of the economy of the country.
On the ather hand, there are a number of
very important safeguards. In the first place,
any regulation made by the Governor in
Council under the powers conferred in this
bill must be tabled in parliament within five
days after the niaking of the regulation, and
any other regulation under the power herein
conferred must be tabled in parhiament within
fifteen days after the regulation is made.
Then there is the safeguard which was
referred ta a few minutes ago by the honourable senator from. New Westminster (Hon.
Mr. Reid). I think this is an entirely new
provision af haw. At any rate, I do nat
know of any simihar provision in any other
statute. It is ta be found in the hast subsectian of section 2 of the bill, and it says that
if the Senate and House af Commans, within
forty days of the passage of a regulation
unaer this bull, resolve that the regulation be
annuiied, it shall cease ta have effeet. In
otýher words, parliament reserves ta itseif,
within farty days of the passage of any order
in council under this measure, the right ta,
deciare that the order is annulled, and if
parliamnent does de.-lare that an order is
annulhed, that order shahl thereupon be
annulled. In answer to rny friend's specific
question, I shauhd say that the pracedure for
annulinent wouhd probably have ta take the
farm of a resolution adapted in simihar hanguage by bath hauses of parliament. Fro .i
a practicai point of view a question which
arises, and which in fact was raisei. in the

SENATE
other house upon consideration of this particular subsection, is whether the government of the day might prevent the House of
Commons from passing a resolution of this
kind by refusing to allow time for the discussion of the resolution.
Obviously, of
course, the government could not do that in
the Sen-ate. The leader of the government
in the other house gave formal assurance
that if any honourable member there at any
time introduced a resolution under this subsection for the purpose of having an order
in council annulled, the government would
see to it that ample time for the discussion of
the resolution was provided immediately, in
order that debate on the resolution might
not be prolonged beyond the forty-day limit
provided in the subsection.
A third safeguard against abuse of these
powers is to be found in the duration of the
legislation itself. Thé Act expires on the
31st day of May, 1952, so it will last for
about two years.
Hon. Mr. Reid: One year.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I beg your pardon;
yes it is just a little over one year. There
is a proviso that these extraordinary powers
shall be continued beyond that term if the
Senate and House of Commons by a joint
address request an extension.
So, generally speaking, I think we can say
that the government has done its best to
import into this legislation fairly adequate
safeguards against abuse of the wide powers
which the legislation confers.
Of course, nobody can foretell the future,
and it may be that the crisis will develop to
such an extent that the War Measures Act
will have to be brought into effect. It is provided, therefore, that in such circumstances
this Emergency Powers Act will fall by the
wayside and be replaced by the War Measures
Act, when proclaimed, but that any action
that has been taken under the Emergency
Powers Act prior to the proclamation shall
be continued and valid as if it had been taken
under the War Measures Act.
Honourable senators, I think that I have
given a fairly general explanation of the
terms of the bill, and that I do not need to
go into further detail.
In conclusion, I associate myself'very fully
with the remarks that were made by a number of honourable senators yesterday evening
during the debate on the second reading of
the bill respecting the Department of Defence
Production. In Canada, a democratic country, we are always reluctant to confer extraordinary powers upon government. We confer
them sparingly and with hesitation, and
only when we are satisfied that the condition
of the country and the state of international

affairs requires that such powers be conferred. And we grant them only on this
final condition, that as soon as the emergency
is over, as soon as the particular purpose for
which these powers have been granted has
been fulfilled, they must be returned to the
people of Canada, to whom they properly
belong.
Hon. John T. Haig: I do not intend to
address myself to the bill. My attitude
towards measures of this kind has been
expressed so many times that you may look
on me as a machine which always says the
same thing. I do not like controls. I never
did; and, if I mgy mention the fact, only this
morning in committee I voted and worked
hard to make my views prevail when we
were considering another bill.
However, this is a different kind of legis-

lation. Maybe the country needs it.

Of that

I am not at all sure. I do not like the bill,
because, for one thing, it is unnecessary.

Should an emergency arise we can invoke the
War Measures Act. One honourable senator
has suggested that to do so might stir the
people up. I do not think the people need
to be aroused any more than they were when
it was declared that in three years we intend
to spend $5 billion; if that announcement does
not stir them up, they will be fully aroused
by the 12th of April. This bill is no more
than a shot in the arm; its effect may last
a week; but the shock the people will get
on the 12th of April will last for years. I
feel as though we were taking part in a manoeuvre; and we are fooling nobody, certainly
not ourselves.
We are not doing anything that means anything. For the life of
me I cannot see any necessity for the bill.
All the government has to do is to pass an
order in council putting the War Measures
Act into effect, and ipso facto it goes into
effect, with all that it involves. But such
action presupposes a crisis. If we are going
into war, parliament should be called upon
at once to deal with whatever is necessary. I am not going to vote against the bill,
but to my mind, as I said, it is a mere
manoeuvre, and whatever effect it has will
be the very opposite of what my honourable
friend seems to expect.
Incidentally I might mention that, during
the week I was away from here, al I learned
from the press about what was going on in
the Senate was that two honourable senators,
one from Nova Scotia, the other who, as he
is not here, I will not identify, made speeches.
To be candid, the people I met seemed to be
getting along all right without hearing any
more than I did; and I will add that they
were no better informed about the House of
Commons.

MARCH 14, 1951
I do not think a bill of this kind, has any
calming effect; it is more likely to make
people excited and nervous. If I were sitting in a farrn house or a small house in -a
village, reading in a newspaper about two
weeks old that the Parliament of Canada had
passed a bill cont-aining ail these drastic
powers, I would think we must be on the
brink of a crisis, with war just around the
corner. I will concede, however, that the bill
bas one menit, wbich I believe was noticed
by the honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) and the honourable
member from Toronto Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck)-who is flot in bis place. I do not
know where he is.
An Hon. Senatar: He is in the Divorce
Committee.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I arn glad that somebody
besides tbe bonourable member from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) is working there.
None of us likes the granting of extraordinary powers for a long terni. This bill
is subi ect to the opposite objection; it wil
be outlawed a year f rom May, very soon after
[t goes into effect. My main objection is
that ail these powers are to be conferred on
the government in time of peace. I can
understand the purpose of providing for the
making of munitions, but for the if e of me
I do not see wby we need controls when, in
ail tbeir speecbes in another place and al
their public statements outside the other
place, members of the government cry down
the prospect of war. By legisiation of tbis
nature tbey refute their own statements. I
for one do flot like that kind of thing.

SECOND READING

Hon. A. L. Beaubien moved the second

Ruthenian Greek Catholic Episcopai Corporation o! Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, the Ruthenian Greek Ca'tholic Episcopal Corporation
of Canada was incorporated by Cbapter 191,
3-4 George V, 1913, being a church under the
jurisdiction of the Roman Pontiff, but
foliowing tbe Greek rite or liturgy rather

Czecboslovakia, Russia and other Slavic
countries of Eastern Europe.
Since 1913 these people bave developed
into fine Canadian citizens, a fact which is
recognized throughout the country. Orîginaliy
they settled in Manitoba and tbe otber prairie
provinces, but sinçe that time tbey and their
descendants have spread tbroughout ail the
provinces of Canada.
As a result o! this great increase in their
numbers, the Holy See has establisbed two
new dioceses, one for Eastern Canada, with
a bishop resident in Toronto, and the other
for Western Canada, wîth a bishop resident
in Edmonton. The third diocese is the original
diocese, which now bas spiritual jurisdiction
over central Canada, witb a resident archbishop at Winnipeg. The apostolic junisdiction of the arcbbishop, wbo is resident in

SECOND READING

Hon. A. L. Beaubien, for Hon. Mr. Biais,
moved the second reading of Bill X-5, an Act
to incorporate the Ukrainian Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Western Canada.
He said: The sponsor of the bill, on whose
behaif I arn speaking this afternoon, is
unavoichabiy absent because of an accident.
As was stated in connection with Bill W-5,
which has just been given second reading,
the Ruthenian Greek Catholîc Episcopal Corporation was incorporated in 1913. The
membership of this church bas increased
materially since that time, and consequently
it has been divided into three dioceses, each
presided over by a bishop, and incorporation
is desirabie in order to properly administer
the property, business and corporal affairs of
each diocese.
The purpose of the present bull is to incorporate the Diocese of Western Canada, which,
is presided over by His Excellency Bishop
Savaryn at Edmonton. This diocese includes
and British
the provinces of Alberta
Columbia, the Yukon Territory and the areas
in the Northwest Territories immediately
north of Alberta and British Columbia. Honêourable senators will observe that the bill
contains clauses respecting bylaws, the holdIng and transfer of real property, and borrowing and investment powers. These are

VALLEYFIELD BRIDGE BILL
SEC~OND READING

Hon. L. M. Gouin moved the second reading
of Bill E-6, an Act respecting the construction
and maintenance of a bridge over the St.
Lawrence river at or near the town of
Valleyfield, in the province of Quebec.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
simple bill and is purely a permissive
measure. It provides the authority to approve
the plans and the site for a bridge to, be built
by the Quebec Government over the St.
Lawrence river at or near Valleyfield. The
southern end, of the bridge will stand in my
own senatoriai constituency of De Salaberry,
and on behaîf of the member of another
place from Beauharnois, and the inhabitants
of Valleyfield, Beauharnois and Huntingdon,
I wish to thank the leader of the government
for having introduced this bill early in the
session so that it may receive immediate
consideration.
First of ail I shouid like to give a genera]
outline of the legai aspects of the bill. Chapter
140 of the Revised Statutes of Canada (1927)
contains general legisiation for the protection
of navigable waters, and section 4 thereunder provides that:
No work shall be bujît or placed in, upon, over,
through or across any navigable water unless the
site thereof has been approved by the Governor in
Council..

I wouid point out, however, that
11 of this statute provides that:

section

No approval shall be given under this part of the
site or plans of any bridge over the river St.
Lawrence.

It is for this reason that this bill is before
parliament, although, as far as we are concerned, it is pureiy a formai matter. The
provincial Government of Quebec, which is
ta buiid the bridge, bas represented to the

MARCH 14, 1951
Minister of Public Works in the interests of
the public it is necessary to construct a bridge
at this point as soon as possible.
Honourable senators who have visited
Valleyfield know that the only bridge across
the river in that vicinity is the Canadian
National Railways bridge at Coteau. If you
wish to cross the St. Lawrence from Valleyfield for pleasure or on business, in either a
motor car or a truck, you have to drive down
the river as far as Caughnawaga, a distance of
about 35 miles, or up the river to Prescott, and
that again is at least 35 miles away. The
whole region there is an important one.
Valleyfield, Beauharnois, Huntingdon and
Chateauguay are busy centres, and the rural
area is famous in particular for its dairy
products. I imagine that evey senator has
eaten some of the well-known Huntingdon
cheese. Valleyfield and Beauharnois and their
neighbourhood have a number of thriving
civilian industries, including, for instance, the
textile industry, as well as some large plants
engaged on war work. This is a vitally strategic district, within the zone of the Beauharnois canal.
For years there has been a demand for
construction of a bridge to serve the good
people of Valleyfield and district, and also
those on the opposite shore in Coteau, Vaudreuil and that general locality. The lack of
a bridge places these people under a serious
handicap. During the summer a small ferry
runs between one of the islands and Coteau,
but the service is quite inadequate. When I
was appointed a senator, in 1940, one of the
first things mentioned to me was the need for
a bridge at Valleyfield, and of course the
development of the region over the years has
made the need more pressing. In 1944 my
friend Mr. Robert Cauchon, then Mayor of
Valleyfield, convened a meeting of 65 mayors
of municipalities in the region concerned, and
they were unanimous in favouring the construction as early as possible of a bridge to
connect the two shores of the river in that
section. Mr. Cauchon, who is now the member for Beauharnois in the other house, has
made himself not only the advocate but, I
should say, the champion of the bridge, and
thereby has earned the commendation and
support of all our people in that industrious
area, which he so ably represents.
The proposed bridge, which is to be built
with provincial funds, has already been the
object of an Act of the Quebec Legislature,
and recently I saw by the newspapers that
necessary funds for the construction have
been voted. In these circumstances the
premier of my native province has addressed
a request to the federal government for the

necessary approval of the site and plans of
the bridge. Accordingly a favourable recommendation was made by the Minister of
Public Works, who evidently would have
sponsored this bill if it had been introduced
in the other house. It must be realized that
the measure before us is a public, rather than
a private, bill. It is in the interest of not only
a local area, but of a large section of the
provinces of Quebec and Ontario, for the
bridge will become part of the highway system of the Province of Quebec and will benefit the country at large. It will greatly facilitate the movement of vehicular traffic, and
be a wonderful aid to the tourist business.
The bridge will provide a shorter road to
Montreal for the people in part of the
Beauharnois constituency. Also, it will give
the farmers of Vaudreuil access to the Valleyfield market, which is of great value to them,
for Montreal is too remote. Valleyfield, as
the centre of the region in question, is
important not only from an economic point
of view, but also because it is the Episcopal
See of the Bishop, His Grace Monsignor
Langlois, and of his very devoted Coadjutor,
His Grace Monsignor Caza. I might add that
the diocese of Valleyfield includes also the
whole of Vaudreuil, and numerous social conferences are constantly requiring people from
all over this large area to come to Valleyfield.
There are also a number of well-known
educational institutions in the region. For
instance, there is an excellent college in
Valleyfield, and another on the opposite side
of the river, at Rigaud, and Vaudreuil has
several convents and schools. So a great
deal of travel is going on all the time between
one side of the river and the other. Besides,
the people on the north shore wish to use the
facilities of the splendid hospital at Valleyfield, which is much closer to them than
Montreal. The chief surgeon at the hospital,
Dr. Caza, who also is the Mayor of Valeyfield,
enjoys the confidence of all his patients and
the esteem of the people throughout the district. But however desirous a patient on the
north shore might be to receive treatment at
Valleyfield. it would be out of the question
to attempt to take him there in winter over
the long route that is necessary to travel at
present.
In my humble opinion, the volume of traffic
which will use the bridge, when completed,
cannot be overestimated.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Before my honourable
friend goes on, would he tell us how much
of the cost of this bridge is being contributed
by the Dominion Government.
Hon. Mr. Gouin: I have not heard that one
cent is being contributed by the federal

SENATE
government. I have always understood that
this is purely and simply a provincial bridge;
and the only reason why it is necessary to
apply to the Parliament of Canada is that the
bridge is being built over a navigable river,
the St. Lawrence. The bill merely authorizes
the Governor General to approve the site and
the plans to be submitted for the erection of
the bridge in question. There is an enumeration of the various drawings and maps which
are to be submitted with the application, and,
of course, no change may be made in the plans
without the approval of the Governor in
Council.
Hon. Mr. Davis: Will this interfere with
the new St. Lawrence waterways project?
Hon. Mr. Gouin: Oh, no. The bridge in
question is to be built to specifications
approved by the Governor in Council, and in
such a way that it will not interfere with the
plans for the development of the seaway
canal. The bridge, by the way, is in a sense
three bridges. Already there are dams erected
which connect some of the islands between
Coteau and Valleyfield, and I am informed
that the site to be chosen will be below those
dams, in a position which will be convenient
for the public, and cannot possibly interfere
with navigation or the scheme to which the
honourable senator has just referred. We
have a somewhat similar situation concerning
the Caughnawaga bridge. And, by the way,
the structure provides clearance, at much
additional expense, for ships with the highest
masts. Section 3 provides that the Governor
in Council may make regulations as to the
construction and the maintenance of the
That
bridge, and concerning navigation.
answers, I think, the question which was just
put to me. Similar provisions are found in
the general Act, chapter 140, but it is
necessary to repeat them in the bill because
that act is not applicable to this project.
Finally, and I submit as a matter of course,
the last paragraph states that compliance
with the regulations will be obligatory.
Hon. Vincent Dupuis: I beg permission to
add a few words with respect to this bill, as
it concerns my senatorial district, because one
end of this projected bridge will be in the
vicinity of Coteau station, in the county of
Vaudreuil. I shall not delay the house very
long, as we have been served with a full and
detailed statement on the matter by my
honourable colleague from De Salaberry (Hon.
Mr. Gouin). Nevertheless I want to put on
record the fact that for a long time, even
before I was appointed to this house, I was
doirig my humble share to foster and advance
the project of building a bridge there. My
home town is very far from Valleyfield; yet,

when citizens of Laprairie, or further souththose of St. Johns-Iberville, Brome and
Missisquoi-want to go towards the northwest
part of the country, in order to cross the river
they must travel, either on the King Edward
highway to Laprairie, or by the new Sir
Wilfrid highway which leads to the same
place. They then cross the Caughnawaga
bridge. So for those who reside in the southeast part of the province-say at Huntingdon,
Lacolle, Iberville and St. Johns-if they want
to go to Ottawa or Toronto, the journey is
increased by a good many miles.
By the way, my honourable friend spoke
of the Caughnawaga bridge, but he was too
modest to mention who was responsible for
the building of that bridge. In fact, it was
one of his distinguished relatives, the Honourable Honore Mercier, whose name the bridge
officially bears.
My honourable friend has explained, and I
want to repeat what he said so that there
shall be no misapprehension in the mind of
any honourable senator, that the federal
government have the control of the navigable
waters. Without their permission no project
that will affect navigable waters, whether it
be of the nature of a bridge or a canal, can
be undertaken without the consent of the
federal government. That is why this bill is
before this parliament. The details, including
the plans and specifications, have been already
approved by the authorities in Ottawa. I
humbly suggest, therefore, that there should
be no objection to the passing of this bill for
the building of this bridge. I shall be very
glad if it receives your approval.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I wonder if I could be
informed whether the steel for this bridge
has been assuredý? I ask this question because
the government has stopped the development
of other projects in Canada which require
the use of steel.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: This bridge is for a
national purpose.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I would inform my
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Reid) that I
have no specific knowledge as to whether the
steel has been assured for this bridge, but I
assume that the passage of this bill is no
more dependent upon the availability of steel
than is the passage of any of the bills seeking
the incorporation of a pipe-line company. The
authority for building the bridge is one thing,
and the pertinent question raised about steel
by the honourable gentleman from New Westminster is another. I do not think that these
questions have any bearing on each other.
Hon. Mr. Reid: We can agree to differ on
that- point, but I am entitled to ask for the
information.

MARCH 14, 1951
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I do not think it has
any bearing on the question of whether we
should pass this bill or not.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It has a bearing on cases
that I have in mind, and that is why I asked
the question.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Well, I have no
information on the point.

THIRD READING
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable sena-

tors, when shall this bill be read the third

read the third time, and passed.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Salier A. Hayden moved the second
reading of Bill G-6, an Act to incorporate
the Mercantile and General Reinsurance
Company of Canada Limited.
He said: Honourable senators, the Mercantile and General Reinsurance Company of
Canada Limited, which will be incorporated
under this bill if and when it becomes law,
will be a subsidiary of an English company
bearing practically the same name-the Mer:antile and General Reinsurance Company
Limited. This is a well-known company
which has operated for many years in England. The kind of business to be carried on
by the company in Canada will be entirely
in the nature of reinsurance.
This bill complies with the requirements
of the Canadian and British Insurance Companies Act and carries the approval of the
Superintendent of Insurance.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

Hon. Mr. Haig moved concurrence in the
amendment.
He said: Honourable senators, the amendment simply requires that investments of the
corporation's funds be subject to the limitation
set out in the Canadian and British Insurance
Companies Act.

That the parliamentary fees paid upon the Bill D,

APPENDIX

UNVEILING 0F PAINTING BY HOBBEMA

"The Two Water Mills"
PRESENTED TO CANADA BY THE PEOPLE 0F THE NETHERLANDS

Addresses delivered at the ceremýony in the Hall of Fame, Parliament Buildings, Ottawa,
Wednesday, March 14, 1951
His Excellency

the Governar General of

Canada: Mr. Speaker of the Senate, Mr.
Speaker of the House of Courmonis, Prime
Minister,

Mr. Ambassador,

General

Crerar,

Ladies and Gentlemen:- I have been asked
by my ministers to preside at this ceremony
at which one of the greatest of Dutch paintings
-the gif t of the people of the Netherlands
to the people of Canada-is to be unveiled
and added to the national treasures of aur
country.
The people of the Netherlands have demonstrated in many ways their appreciation of
the share ,vhich Canadians had in liberating
their nation during the last war. At the
anninil memorial services held in the beautifully maintained Canadian military cemeteries, there are always large throngs of Dutch
people whose presence manifests the depth
of public feeling. In a more intimate manner
-which touches very directly the hearts of
the mothers and fathers, the widows and
children of those who lie buried thereDutch men, and women, boys and girls, have
year after year placed flowers on individual
graves and written to the next of kmn in
Canada of the loving care so spontaneously
offered.
These tributes to Canada's sons who made
the supreme sacrifice have been greatly appreciated here in Canada. So have the many
evidences of friendship, individual and
national, given by the Dutch people to Canadians and to Canada. We recognize, however,
the desire of the people of the Netherlands
to give symbolic and tangible expression to
the bond between our two peoples. We know
how deep is the attachment of the Dutch
people to the paintings of their old masters.
Consequently we realize that only tremendous
generosity and deep friendship prompted the
gift to Canada of this national treasure of
the Netherlands-"The Two Water Mils"this masterpiece of the great Meindert

Hobbema.

This

knowledge enhances aur
the outstanding beauty of
the landscape and gives greater significance
ta the unanimity of the Netherlands Parliament in sanctioning this priceless gift.
I know that the Canadian people were
pleased that Her Majesty the Queen of the
Netherlands should have made the presentatic n personally f0 the Canadian Ambassador.
As Princess Juliana, the Queen endeared
herself to Canadians, during her residence
amongst us in the war years, because of her
nability of character, charm of manner and
dernocratic attitude. Her personal association
wxith the gift adds to its value.
As Canada and the Netherlands share the
tradition of parliamentary democracy, it is
par-,icularly appropriate that this painting
should, in accordance with the wishes of the
Neiherlands Gavernment, hang in the Houses
ï,ppreciation

of Parliament

0f

of Canada.

In this Hall of

Fame "The Two Water Milîs" will be seen
by countless visitors every year. I believe
the painting will convey a double message.
It will speak fromn the depth of its loveliness
to all who appreciate beauty and, at the same
time, it will canstantly recaîl the very special
ties which connect Canada and the Netherlands. To you, Mr. Speaker of the Senate,
and to you, Mr. Speaker of the House of
Commons, who preside over the two Houses
of Parliament, I entrust this painting, which
will remain in your custody in trust for the
people of Canada.
Would you, Mr. Ambassador, kindly convey
to Her Mai esty and to your government and
to the people of the Netherlands how profoundly touched are all Canadians by this
gift, and even more by the spirit which
inspired it. And would you add that, in the
minds of the Canadian people there has not
been merely the transfer of a painting from
one friendly country to another, but rather
that what was once the national treasure of

MARCH 14, 1951
one nation has become the national treasure
of two nations. To Canadians, Hobbema's
"The Two Wa.ter Mills" will be known as
"The Dutch Painting".
I believe the people of Canada will consider it most fitting that I should cail now
upon General Crerar, who was Commanderin-Chief of the Canadian Army of Liberation,
ta unveil this painting.
Major General H-. D. G. Crerar: Your
Excellencies, Mr. Speaker of the Senate, Mr.
Speaker of the Hause of Commons, Mr.
Prime Minister, Mr. Ambassador, Members
of the Senate and of the House of Commans,
Laýdies and Gentlemen;-To unveil, at the
behest of Your Excellency, this priceless
painting by Hobbema, given by The Netherlands ta Canada, in commemoration of the
part played by Canada's armed forces in the
Liberation of the Netherlands people in 1944
and 1945, is a signal honour. It is an honour
which I arn proud ta acknowledge, not in
any personal sense, but as a representative
of the many thousand Canadian sevicemen
and women who gave their utmost, and, in
many -cases, their ail, in order ta assure the
restoration of freedam. ta a people who, for
centuries, have cherished it.
It was in September 1944 that the Canadian
army first reached Dutch territary and cammenced the 'bitter fighting which terminated
some weeks later in the freeing of the Scheldt
Estuary-thus apening ta, allied use the great
port a! Antwerp. From. that time, on through
the heavy battles in February, March and
April o! 1945, and until the return ta Canada
0f its remaining traops in the spring o! 1946,
those in the Canadian army had full opportunity ta learn ta know the Dutch people.
We found themn stalwart and uncamplaining
in distress, loyal and courageous in their
beliefs, constant and warm-hearted in their
friendships. This gift would indicate that
the warm memories we Canadians bear for
them are reciprocated by those they retain
of us.
There is deep symbolism in the fact that
the Canadian and Dutch fiags, which flew
side by side on the battleflelds of a few
years ago, are seen together again, today,
flanking this peaceful landscape of The
Netherlands, Sa magniflcently reproduced on

canvas by that master-painter, Meindert
Hobbema.
This unique gif t, from one country ta
another, I now unveil.
His Excellency the Netherlands Ambassador:
Your Excellencies, Mr. Speaker of the Senate,
Mr. Speaker of the House of Commons, Mr.
Prime Minister, Members of the Senate and
of the House of Commons, Ladies and Gentlemen:- Af ter the very kind words which Your
Excellency has just spoken on the occasion
of this ceremony I feel that there is not much
that I can add. But there is one thought I
want ta express. Namely, that I arn interpreting the feelings of my country's government
and its people when I say that we are proud,
and grateful, for the place which the Canadian
Government have selected ta hang this
Hobbema painting, for the Hall of Fame is at
the very heart and centre of the seat of the
Canadian Government. No more honourable
place coul be thought of than here on
Parliament Hil-in the very centre of the
Hous-es of Parliament.
Hobbema's painting the "Two Water
Mils" is a good example of the achievements
of Dutch artists in the seventeenth century.
It was an age when my country was reaping
rich cultural benefits of its recent fight for
f reedom of conscience and religion, an age
when these concepts were stili far from
cammanplace.
I think that it is quite fitting, therefore,
that this, painting should henceforth hang in
this, place overlooking the Ottawa river,
because it was the blood of Canadians that
helped ta restore ta us our lost freedomn during the Second World War, when a latter-day
tyranny had taken from us what we prized
Most.
It will be a most agreeable duty ta report
ta Her Majesty Queen Juliana, wha f ound
with her child-ren such a hospitable sanctuary
in Canada during the Second World War, and
ta aur people at home, as requested by Your
Excellency, on the impressive and solemn
ceremony enacted here this afternoan and on
the great appreciatian shown today for this
symbol of Dutch gratitude.
I hope that Habbema's masterpiece will
continue ta hang in this place for centuries
ta came as a tangible syrnbol of the lasting
friendship between aur twa countries.

done me the honour of asking me to move
the second reading of this bill and to explain
the measure.
By way of introduction I may say that when
I read in the Speech from the Throne a paragraph with reference to this matter I entertained a mild apprehension. The apprehension was unjustified, but it was there. This
is the paragraph to which I refer:
Appropriate amendments to the Canadian Citizenship Act will be introduced to prevent the retention
of Canadian cititzenship by persons who have
renounced their allegiance or shown by their conduct that they are not loyal to Canada.

My apprehension was that the Citizenship
Act might be extended in some way so as to

which a person who is not a natural-born

citizen, namely:

of Bill 77, an Act respecting the Department
of Defence Production.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was

CANADIAN CITIZENSHIP BILL

MARCH 15, 1951
years is too long a time, and for that reason
the bill contains a new paragraph, as follows:
(d) has, since becoming a Canadian citizen or
being naturalized in Canada, been for a period of
not less than two years ordinarily resident in a
foreign country of which he was a national or
citizen at any time prior to his becoming a Canadian
citizen or being naturalized in Canada and has not
maintained substantial connection with Canada.

That is to say, if a naturalized Canadian
citizen returns to the country where he
previously was a national, which usually is
his country of origin, and, resides there for
two years without maintaining his connection
with Canada, his citizenship here may be
cancelled; but if he goes to a country other
than the country where he was a national, or
his country of origin, six years must elapse
before cancellation can take place.
One's mind immediately jumps to the
incidient-although there is nothing in the bill
which refers to it-when a number of persons
from Yugoslavia announced their intention of
leaving Canada permanently and returning to
their homeland. A good deal of publicity was
given to the incident, and perhaps there was
too-free talk on their part; but they made it
perfectly clear that they did not wish to
remain in Canada and that they were going
to live permanently in Yugoslavia. Under
such circumstances their naturalized citizenship in Canada can be cancelled after two
years.
The next paragraph of the bill reads:
(e) if out of Canada, has shown himself by act
or speech to be disaffected or disloyal to His
Majesty.

This is similar to the first part of paragraph
(d) as it appears in the Act. Then there is
added:
(f) if in Canada, has, by a court of competent
jurisdiction, been convicted of any offence involving
disaffection or disloyalty to His Majesty.

This provision previously read:
(d) if out of Canada, has shown himself by act or
speech to be disaffected or disloyal to His Majesty;
or, if in Canada, has been convicted of treason or
sedition by a court of competent jurisdiction.

The extension is this, that under the- old
Act offences against such measures as the
Espionage Act and the Official Secrets Act
were not covered, but they will be covered
by the amendment. I suppose that nobody
will take serious objection to that. If a
naturalization certificate could be cancelled
because, for instance, of sedition, which is
loosely defined in the dictionary as "any
offence against the state not actually reaching
the point of insurrection or treason; the stirring up of discontent or rebellious feelings
against lawful authority," surely it ought also
to be cancelled for offences against the Official
Secrets Act and other such statutes.

That is all as far as that subsection is
concerned.
Subsection 2 of section 19 of the act reads
as follows:
(2) The Governor in Council may, in his discretion, order that any person shall cease to be a Canadian citizen if, upon a report from the minister, he
is satisfied that such person has, at any time after
the first day of January, nineteen hundred and
forty-seven, when in Canada and not under a
disability, acquired the nationality or citizenship of
a foreign country by any voluntary and formal act
other than marriage.

If this bill is carried, there will be added
this further provision:
(a) when in Canada and at any time after the
first day of January, nineteen hundred and fortyseven, acquired the nationality or citizenship of a
foreign country by any voluntary and formal act
other than marriage;
(b) taken or made on oath, affirmation or other
declaration of allegiance to a foreign country;

Of course he should be subject to cancellation of his Canadian citizenship if he
has made an oath or affirmation or other
declaration of allegiance to a foreign country,
even though he does not actually become a
national of that country. Cancellation is also
to be effected if he bas(c) made a declaration renouncing his Canadian
citizenship.

Under the present Act there is no way by
which it can be effected upon a declaration
of renunciation of Canadian citizenship.
Even though a man renounces his Canadian
citizenship he remains a Canadian citizen.
That will not be the case under the proposed
amendment.
These, it seems to me, are very moderate,
necessary, and thoroughly guarded amendments. The latter two provisions which I have
read apply to a natural-born Canadian citizen
as well as to a naturalized citizen. That is,
a natural-born Canadian citizen can renounce
his citizenship, and he may have his citizenship cancelled in consequence of having done
so. But every precaution is thrown around
the Act, as is evidenced by the following
provision:
(3) The minister before making a report under
this section shall cause notice to be given or sent
to the last known address of the person in respect
of whcm the report is to be made, giving him an
opportunity of claiming that the case be referred for
such Inquiry as is hereinafter specified and if said
person so claims in accordance with the notice, the
minister shall refer the case for inquiry accordingly.

And the
inquiry:

(4) An inquiry under this section shall be held by

Provlded that any such inquiry may, if the
Governor in Council thinks fit, instead of being held
by such commission, be held by the superior court
of the province in which the person concerned
resides, and the practice and procedure on any
inquiry so held shall be regulated by rules of court.

Even though the bill is very moderate in
its substance and provisions, it may be seen
that every precaution is thrown around the
Canadian-born citizen. He cannot be deprived
of his citizenship by an arbitrary act of any
civil servant or by a mere department of any
government. Any fears which I had about
this bill have been dissipated, and I trust that
my fellow senators will join with me in
passing this bill.
Hon Mr. Haig: I presumne that the mover
of the bill intends to have it sent to committee?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes. I think that every
bill of this kind should be sent to committee,
unless it is the unanimous desire o! the bouse
to do otberwise.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity a question? At
the beginning o! his remarks he said sornething about the Yugoslavs who renounced
Canada and went to Yugoslavîa, and he intimated that this bill would prevent their
return by cutting off their Canadian citizenship. Would this bill affect Yugoslavs who
were born in Canada and who lef t these
shores? I sbould also like to inquire whether
the amendments in this bill would affect the
Japanýese, born in British Columbia, who of
their own volition went ta Japan and fought
against our Canadian boys? Many of these
British Columbia-born Japanese are stili in
Japan, sa I think this bill is an important
one.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, it is important.
If the type o! person to whom my friend has
re!erred has made a declaration of allegaiance
to a foreîgn country, then this bill will affect
him, irrespective of whether he was Canadian-born or a naturalized Canadian. This
bill will certainly affect any person who has
renounced his Canadian citizenship. It does
not affect a person who merely goes to, say,
Japan; but should he become part of the
armed forces of that country I believe he
would be subi ect ta other provisions of the
Act.
Hoa. Mr. Reid: We had better find out al
about this in cammittee.

THE SENATE AND ITS WORK
MOTION-DEBATE

CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, March
8, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Robertson for the appointment of
a special committee to inquire into and report
upon how in its opinion the Senate may
make its maximum contribution to the welfare of the Canadian people.
Hon. R. B. Harner: Honourable senators,
when this resolution waýs introduced I was
sure that it would be deait with by a number
of distinguished and able senators, and I
thought that I would have littie if anything
to say about it. I have changed my mind. I
thought the resolution was ail right in itself,.
but I was amnazed when the mover (Hon. Mr.
Robertson)-who said he was not speaking
on behaif of the govemnment, although he
represents the government in this chamberwent on to suggest certain ways in which the
Senate could be reformed. He referred to a
conversation he had bad with the late Mr.
Mackenzie King about the Senate and its
functions, but I do not think he gave us the
correct date of that conversation. I believe
it took place before the honourable gentleman
was appointed to this chamber.
Some Hon. Senalors: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I think the term "confusion worse confounded" can be applied to
some of the speeches which bave been made
in this ýdebate. I wish to point out to His
Honour the Speaker that I bave a f ew notes
here, but I shahl probably ignore themn cernpletely. Incidentally, I think it would be wefl
in a debate of this kind to adhere to the rule
against the reading of speeches. When the
honourable gentleman from Bruce (Hon. Mr.
Stambaugh) was reading bis speech recently

MARCH 15, 1951
1 kept watching His Honour the Speaker, but
I realized, of cour~se, that hie was too, kind. to
raise any objection.
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: I should like to tell
my honourable friend that I did flot read that
speech.
Han. Mr. Horner: Well, it seerned to me
that you read every word of it.
The Hon. the Speaker: With leave of the
Senate, the honourable senator from Blaine
Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) may read his speech
if hie so desires.
Han. Mr. Morfler: On that occasion I was
reminded of the passage in the Bible about
Isaac and his sons, when hie said: "The voice
is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands
of Esau", for in the instance I refer to
"Jacob's voice" was that of the author of a
scurrilous article which appeared in the
Ottawa Citizen a few days ago. Some honourable senators have said that they do not
object to criticisrn. I do not object to it either;
I welcome it and expect it, and I know that
I sometirnes deserve it; but I think an article
like the one I mention is in a different category-and there can be no mistake about
who the writer was referring to. I shail deal
with this more thoroughly before I conclude.
The honourable senator from. Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen), in his great speech on
this resolution, when dealing with the question of retirement cornpared us with civil
servants. I object to that comparison, and I
shaîl have something to say about it later.
When I criticize the speeches of the honou-rable senators it is not to be unkind, but
because I feel that as a member of this chamber it is my duty to, do so. I arn not of the
legal profession. A lawyer will stand up in
court and tell his opponent what a wonderful
fellow he is, and then he will intimaýte to, the
judge that hie should not pay any attention to
his adversary, that hie doesn't know what hie
is talking about.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.

Some Han. Senatars: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Horner: The mian who, crowded
people off the road with bis ox-cart five
thousand years ago has his counterpart in
the modern motorist who crowds people off
the hîghway with his automobile. We tend
to lose sight of this fact that human nature
has not changed.
Speakers who have preceded me in this
debate apparently do not share my understanding of why we have 'been appointed to
this honourable chamber. It would seem
also that their view on this matter is dIfferent
from that of the people in the part of the
country where I corne from. After I had
been made a senator I was amazed to learn
that not only Conservatives but many Liberals
did every-thing they could to help secure rny
appointmient. Then the people of my village
and district, regardless of their political affiliations, gave a banquet to celebrate the appointment, and a second -banquet for the same
purpose was given by the people of Prince
Albert. The appointrnent was regarded as an
honour for the cornrunity. Why? The people
would not have felt that way if I had been
appointed to a postmastership or to, some
other civil service job, from. which in time I
would be retired on pension. Andi if I was in
honour then, arn I to be in dishonour and
retired when I -arn s-eventy-flve.
Some people complain about the cost of
the Senate. But many able men make their
services available to the country through the
Senate. If I wanted a sound legal opinion
on a constitutional point, I should try to
secure it f rorn the distinguished senator from
North York (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth); and
if I were seeking outstanding advice on a
medical or sugical subject, I should consult
our eminent colleague frorn Richibucto (Hon.
Mr. Bourque). I would certainly prefer the
judgment of men like these to that of Austin
Cross.

SENATE
(Hon Mr. Fogo), from the presidency of the
National Liberal Federation. To my mind it
detracts from the dignity and honour of this
body when senators travel about the country
and work and use their prestige to advance
the interests of any political party.
It would appear that the honourable senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris)
and the honourable senator from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) believe that the Liberal
party has a corner on the best brains in the
country and is likely to continue in power
for ever. If I thought that view was sound I
would suggest to His Honour the Speaker
that the time allotted for prayers in this
chamber be lengthened.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Horner: In other words, the Lord
help us.
Of course, errors are bound to be made
in the operation of any institution, and perhaps some appointees to the Senate have not
been worthy of the honour conferred upon
them. It may be that a grave mistake was
made in my own appointment.
Some Hon. Senators: No, no!
Hon. Mr. Horner: However that may be,
to err is human, and sorne mistakes will be
made.
Now, I will not attempt to discuss any constitutional points, but I imagine that the
Fathers of Confederation felt it would be
unwise to create in Canada a second chamber
composed of holders of hereditary titles and
honours, and that the Senate should be so
constituted that people of outstanding ability
could be appointed to it. And there is -certainly no lack of examples to show how well
that idea bas worked out in practice. Age in
itself was surely not intended to disqualify
a person from appointment. Who objected
when the late Pat Burns was made a senator?
If I am not mistaken, he was at least seventyfive years old at that time. And though he was
a lifelong Liberal, his appointment was made
on the recommendation of a Conservative
Retirement of senators at

seventy-five would deprive the country of the
opportunity to make use of a great deal of
ability that otherwise could be put to good
service. Many a man who has made a lifetime study of a branch of science or of some
other subject is at his best between seventyfive and eighty years of age. Specialized
knowledge is certainly of great value in a
body of this kind. Distinguished Canadians cannot be honoured by the giving of
titles, but we are not opposed to honorary
degrees. I notice that despite his busy life,
the Prime Minister had tie to go to London

and receive an honorary degree. I am not
making any criticism of that at all; I think it
is quite proper.
I disagree entirely with the honourable
senator from Wellington South (Hon. Mr.
Gladstone) and the honourable senator from
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) that the
sessional indemnity of members of the House
of Commons should be raised, if the indemnity
for senators is to remain as it is. All members
of parliament should be treated equally in
this respect.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I was just noticing that
the value of production in Canada during
1950 was $14,164 million. But notwithstanding the great development that our country
has had, some people complain of the cost of
the Senate. A large business which engages
legal counsel to represent it in an important
matter might not consider $50,000 an excessive fee, and I think that in the Senate some
members of the legal profession are giving
their services to the country at a relatively
low cost.
The honourable gentleman from Bruce
(Hon. Mr. Stambaugh) says the fact that some
of our committees have a membership of fifty
and a quorum of nine indicates the small
attendance of members at committee meetings. But, as we all know, it often happens
that a senator finds on a certain day that
there are meetings of three or four committees of which he is a member. He cannot
attend them all, and so he goes to the one
dealing with the matter in which he is most
interested, or with respect to which his
experience and advice will be most useful. It
frequently happens that when the Divorce
Committee is sitting in two sections, at least
two other committees are meeting, and in
these circumstances it is impossible to have
a full attendance at every committee.
Then in computing the percentage of members who attend Senate sittings, it should not
be forgotten that there are usually a number
of vacancies here. I think that in general the
number of vacancies would average ten. At
present there are fourteen.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Eleven.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Well, the book says there
are fourteen. Anyway, there are always some
vacancies.
In the parlance of the lawyer, a thing is
sometimes said to be founded on a "wrong
premise"; or in the surveyor's language, the
"wrong base line". I always enjoy listening
to the speeches of the honourable senator
from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen); I only
regret that I am not able to express myself

MARCH 15, 1951
in the beautiful language he uses; but I say
that in this instance he started from a wrong
premise, and the more he talked the more
wrong he became. Or perhaps he was like
the surveyor who was a foot out at his base
line and ended up miles out of line.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I am sure the senators
from Newfoundland were shocked at the
unfortunate slip my honourable leader (Hon.
Mr. Haig) made when he spoke of senators
as the highest-paid pensioners in Canada.
How quickly these new senators flared up,
and how horrified they were that anybody
should think that by coming to the Senate
they were merely being pensioned off. The
difficulty faced by the senator from Inkerman
and by the leader of the government in this
house is that they were appointed to this
chamber while relatively quite young. The
thought that rises in the minds of the people
across Canada is not so much that senators
should be retired at a certain age as that
some of them remain in this chamber too
long. To me, compulsory retirement at
seventy-five would seem like unravelling a
ball of twine from the wrong end.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Horner: It is my opinion that the
age for appointment to the Senate should
be sixty years, rather than thirty. If I remember correctly, it was at one time thirty-five
years, but later was reduced to thirty years,
for the purpose of bringing a certain gentleman into this chamber. My honest opinion
is that the minimum age should be at least
flfty years, and perhaps sixty.
The proposition has been put forward in
this debate that if an age for retirement is
fixed, the present senators should not be
affected by it. Well, if the good Lord happens
to spare me, under such an arrangement as
has been suggested I would be bidding goodbye to some senators appointed after the
change, and who would have to retire at
seventy-five while I carried on. I abhor the
thought of any such distinction. Although I
have no particular objection to allowing the
provinces to name some senators, I certainly
think that in this chamber we should all be
appointed on the same basis and for the
same term, namely, for life. It was intended
that this chamber should be composed of men
of experience.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Quite right.
Hon. Mr. Horner: But how can *a man of
thirty have gained experience or demonstrated his ability? It is impossible. The
criticism in the minds of a great many people
in this country is that one person occupies

a seat in this chamber for too long a time,
and thus prevents the government from honouring another. Indeed, if I am spared to live
to a ripe old age, the people of Saskatchewan
will be thinking it is about time I passed on
and gave somebody else a chance.
The Senate, to my way of thinking, was
not intended to be made up only of former
members of the other place; rather, this
chamber was made appointive so the government name to it men who by reason of their
life work are well qualified to be senators,
but who, perhaps because of their positions
are unable to become elected to the other
house. I have in mind men who might have
been associated with a type of police work,
but who nevertheless would make able senators. There comes to my mind the name of
the late John R. MacNicol. Who in Canada
would have objected to his appointment to
this chamber?
An Hon. Senator: Not one.
Hon. Mr. Horner: He was eighty years of
age when he died, and under the proposition that has been made he would have
been disqualified for membership in the Senate some years prior to his death. That
distinguished gentleman had travelled all
over the world, and he knew every foot of
Canada. For instance, he journeyed down
the Mackenzie River to Aklavik, and there

were sufficiently large, every senator could
afford to leave his business and see for himself what extensive irrigation works, for
instance, would do for Western Canada: he
would then be in a better position to advocate policies beneficial to the nation. I agree
with the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) that there is
work for this chamber to do. There is any
amount of work, and there are plenty of
men here able to do it, even if it be true that
a few of our members are not in attendance at all times.
One thing that I think we in this chamber
should do is introduce a bill for compulsory
voting. The Commons might hesitate to do it.
I have favoured this reform for over thirty
years. The cost of elections is nothing short
of a national disgrace, and many citizens
evade their responsibilities. The man who is
hardest to get to the poll is the man who is
loudest in his denunciation of politicians. As
the honourable senator from Cariboo (Hon.
Mr. Turgeon), whose contributions I always
enjoy-because, for one thing, he speaks without notez-remarked the other day that about
the worst thing one can be called at a community gathering is a politician. Those honourable senators who have served in local
councils know that it is there you get all the

for all the inclination to complain about their
elected representatives-which perhaps is
natural-too many people will not take
enough interest in their country to vote.
When I mentioned this matter of compulsory.
voting to an honourable senator who is present
today, he said that the man who has to be
forced to vote might as well be ignored. But
to my mind, if every citizen is forced to pay
his taxes, every citizen should be compelled
to vote. Politically we are moving very fast
to a condition where only monied men can
afford to run for office. I believe the compulsory ballot is long overdue. I understand
that the system works out very well in
Australia.
A word or two with regard to this question
of change, which seems to obsess some people.
All change is not reform. I believe that some
changes which have taken place in this chamber, have tended not to reform but to deform
it. One of these changes is one which places
us on a different basis from members of the
other branch of parliament. It has lowered
the dignity and usefulness of this honourable
body. But at about the time it happened
the two leaders in this chamber had a plan
whereby they increased their own salaries.
I was opposed to those increases at the time,
and I am still strongly opposed to them. The
effect was to "deform" this honourable chamber. We as a body were not attended, to,
but the honourable gentlemen attended to
themselves.
When I was visiting in the district of the
honourable senator from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid) I noticed that everybody
spoke well of him and admired his independence of character. I was reminded of that
verse in Proverbs, "A good name is rather to
be chosen than great riches, and loving favour
rather than silver and gold." But it would
seem, according to the honourable member
from Bruce (Hon. Mr. Stambaugh), that our
good name should not avail us anything, that

we should be retired on pension at the age
of seventy-five. To subject the members of
an appointed body to that condition is, in
my opinion, the most unbearable proposition
one can think of. Whatever government
proposes it, whether it is to apply here or in
the Commons, it should be rejected. We shall
be criticized all over the country for receiving
a pension which we have voted to ourselves,
and by and by, as public expenditures
increase, we shall have to pay it all back
in income tax and accept an old-age pension,
possibly without a means test. The idea of
parliament sitting down and voting a retiring
allowance to itself is one that I cannot accept
and will not support.
A word or two in conclusion. I think I
have made it clear that, although I am not
particularly opposed to a certain number of
senatorial appointments being made by the
provinces, the proposal that one-third of our
body be elected will not have my approval.
But I favour raising to fifty or sixty years
the minimum age for appointment, for I
believe that such a provision would silence
much of the criticism one hears about the
length of time senators hold office.
I hope that none of my honourable colleagues, not even the leaders, will take offence
at what I have said. I have stated what I
believe to be the fact-that what changes
have been made in the constitution of the
Senate since I became a member have
deformed it; and I would hate to see any
further deformation which would result from
the adoption of some of the suggestions we
have heard during this debate.

SENATE
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
has the honourable leader of the government
the leave of the Senate to make his explanation on second reading of this bill this
afternoon?
Some Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
this bill proposes three amendments to the
Canadian Wheat Board Act, 1935. The first is
of a very minor character, involving the
definition of the term "pool period". Section
20 of the Act makes erroneous reference to
the "31st day of August", and it is now proposed to substitute therefor the "lst day of
August". This was a typographical error
which has been perpetuated.
The other two amendments, which are of an
administrative nature, are the result of experience gained in the operation of the Canadian
Wheat Board since its inception. Today
increases in the initial payments must be
uniform for all the grain in the pool, regardless of quality or grade. The second amendment would make it possible to vary these
increases for different grades. Certain contingencies could arise from time to time by
reason of which it would in the interests of
the pool not to make the sane increases in
the initial payments on all grades of grain.
I am advised that had the lower grades of
grain not sold as readily as they have this
year, when there was a relatively small
amount of high-grade grain, the problem of
keeping increases uniform might have been
difficult. It is suggested that this amendment
is in the interests of all concerned, and that
the right to vary the increases on various
grades will work to the benefit of growers
in the future, although I am advised that its
value in relation to this year's crop will be
less than was originally contemplated.
The third amendment is the most important
of the three. By its terms, annual pools may
be wound up promptly. In the past it has
occasionally happened that the board has
operated two or more pool accounts simultaneously. In such circumstances the procedure has been to divide sales between the
pools, thus inconveniently delaying the winding up of a particular pool. This amendment
will empower the Governor in Council to
authorize the transfer of unsold grain from
one pool account to the next for the purpose
of concluding the earlier account, thus permitting a final payment as soon as possible
after the end of each crop year. A careful
valuation of the inventory to be transferrei
is contemplated by the amendment, with the
principle in mind that the later pool should
neither gain nor lose because of the unsold
grain transferred to it. In practice, of course,
it will not be possible to entirely eliminate

the element of risk to the pools concerned,
but it is felt that the proposed method is
preferable to holding up the final settlement
wi.h producers under each pool until such
time as the last of the grain in a particular
pool has been sold.
I am advised that the chief criticism of this
measure is that the action foreshadowed is
not made mandatory. However, there was
reluctance on the part of the government to
do this because of the possibility that, if at a
particular time the proportion of unsold to
sold grain was very large, uncertainty as to
price might make it difficult to fairly assess
the inventory value.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members, I
have read the amendments. The first one
just effects a change of date from the 31st
of August to the lst of August. The second
one provides for payment to producers of
various grades of the amount of the increase
relating to the particular grade of wheat
delivered. Much of this grain, of course, was
frozen. It is hard to see the effect of this
change. As to the third amendment: this
year, when the pool was taken over on or
about the lst of August, the amount of good
hard wheat in the pool which was unsoldHon. Mr. King: When the honourable
senator says "pool", what does he mean?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I should have said "Wheat
Board"-the quantity of No. 1 and No. 2 hard
wheat held by the Wheat Board, amounted to
between ninety and one hundred million
bushels. The probability is that this year
there will not be such a big carry-over of
hard wheat-frozen or damp wheat-and the
question will be one of setting a price on the
wheat for next year. There could be a little
honest manipulation one way or another; but
apart from what is provided for in the bill,
I cannot see any other policy under which
the Wheat Board could operate. So much
for that.
As the Honourable Minister of Trade and
Commerce said in another place, this is just
as good a time as any to discuss the winding
up of the British Wheat Agreement. I do
not intend to go over the old debate on this
subject. Honourable senators know that I
was always opposed to the agreement. I was
sometimes accused of speaking on behalf of
the Conservative party. A leader in this
chamber sometimes finds himself in a
difficult position in this regard.

Hon. Mr. Fogo: Will the honourable gentleman permit a question?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: What assurance is there
that that price would have been available to
the farmers had this other part of the Canadian grain not been covered by the agreement?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Thank you for asking that
question. I will give you the answer. When
Britain was buying 160 million bushels from
us she bought, I think, 82 millions from Australia at $2.34, and she bought from Argentina at $4.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: That does not answer my
question.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, it does. There is a
world demand for wheat, and the price is
based on that, as it always has been.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: If you take a certain part
of the wheat out, does that not affect the price
of the balance?
Hon. Mr. Haig: It might cause the price to
go down two or three points, but that is all.
The price would only be affected by the
proportion of the whole amount that was
taken out.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: If the sale of that huge
quantity of wheat at a lower price affected
the market at all, would it not depress the
price?
Hon. Mr. Haig: It would depress it a little.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: It is a question of how much
the price would be depressed.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Argentina was getting $4.
The world has got to have wheat, and the
price is bid up until other food commodities
can be bought and set off against the wheat.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: But the less available, the

thought fit. They should not have been compelled. They should not have been taken by
the throat and told that all of them must
deliver their wheat to the one organization. In
a country where we talk about freedom and
democracy, they should have been able to do
as they liked.
Hon. Mr. King: Did the compulsion not
come after the agreement?
Hon. Mr. Haig: It came after the agreement. I say the government should not only
have sold the wheat as it saw fit, but should
have gone into the open market and bought
the wheat instead of making the farmers
give it up. The people of Ontario, Quebec
and the Maritime Provinces say that the
government took some action with respect to
cheese and apples. But what we are conplaining about is that the government did not
buy the wheat from our farmers at the
farmers' own price. The government should
have given the farmers their price, but
instead it took the wheat from them and
made a deal.
The wheat pools favoured this agreement
because they thought that thereby they could
drive the Winnipeg Grain Exchange out of
business. That is why they did it, and they
were wrong. And they lost how much? One
estimate is $330 million; I think the Toronto
Saturday Night says it was $313 million; but
if you count the wheat that the government
sold to the people of Canada at the same
price, which was below the market, our
farmers actually lost under the agreement
between Britain and Canada $488 million.
You only need to read the report to find
that out.
My friend the editor of the Ottawa
Journal said that if we had not made the
agreement with Britain we could not have
sold our wheat anywhere else. What nonsense! The Grain Board actually sold each
year wheat outside of the agreement and
got an average of $2.36 a bushel. The board
sold that outside the contracts.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Haig: The governiment can take
cognizance of them, but that is only part of
the question. The minister must flot take
only what the farmers say, and do precisely
that. There is another side to the picture.
This arrangement of marketing was not
unanýimous by any manner or means. There
was a body which thought they should be
allowed to seli their wheat as they liked, but
the governrnent overrode their opinion and
took their wheat from them.
My friend fromn Northumberland (Hon.
Mr. Burchili) said that for every carload of
timber sold in Canada, the governiment
allowed one to be exported. But in the case
of wheat the government did not give the
farmers even haif; it took, as it were, both
carloads.
The loss by reason of the wheat agreemnent to the farmers of Western Canada,
excludiýn,ý the last year, wvas not less than
$330 million. The loss on the wheat sold
to the people of Canada was at least $48
million. As against that loss of a total of
$378 million the government now offers the
farrrers $65 million.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: Does the honourable senator oppose the payment of $65 million?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I will come to that. In my
opinion it shoulýd be at least $375 million.
Why should the farmers pay the shot? I
repeat what 1 said in 1946 and again in 1947:
Why shouiid wce throw out our chests and
take credit for supporting Great Britain in
hier trouble by selling her wheat ýat $1.55

Britain, but who stood in the gap -and made
that assistance possible? It was men like
(Hon. Mr.
my friend from Rosetown

Mr. Horner) and ail the other wheat producers in western Canad-a. I repeat, why
should we boast of what we did? I did not
own any wheat, so why should I take any
credit for offering help to the British people?
When the government compels the farmer
to enter into such a deal, and a loss results,
the government should pay the shot. I am
certarnly in favour of the payment of $65
million, but I say it does not go nearly far
enough. Such a small amnount is an insuit
to the people who have suffered the loss.

Hon. Mr. Fogo: What about $2 a bushel?

*a piece of lanci that was once worked by a
team of horses and a plow whîch cost hlm
$500, it is hard to estimate the difference
accurately.
Hon. Mr. Pirie: I have neyer paid over
haîf that amount for a tractor.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, that is what the western farmer has to pay for a tractor to haul
a big combine.
Hon. Mr. Horner: The diesel jobs cost
$5,000.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The farmers borrowed
money from the banks to expand their equipment, and they thought the least they would
get as a bonus would be 15 cents a bushel.
Even that would have been only *a token
paynient. I would like to ask the government
how it came to decide upon the figure of
$65 million. Why did it not choosýe to pay the
farmers $75 million or even $95 million?
Hon. Mr. Duif: Why did the government
not pay themn 10 cents?
They could not have
Hon. Mr. Haig:
insulted us any more. What we are getting
on the basis of this allowance amounts to
4-6 cents per bushel. The people of Western
Canada have been "done in" by this agreement. No matter what anybody may say,
the fact is that their right to seli their wheat
was taken from them. It is not for us to
prove loss; the very action of the board
demonstrates the loss; the value is evident
from the price of what was sold apart from
the board.
In answer to the question of my honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Fogo). I know that we
cannot get any more than the $65 million
now offered. The governiment will not pay
any more. The House of Commons would
not vote for it. As a westerner, while I assert
that we are not; getting f air value, I shail
vote for the grant of $65 million because I

MARCH 19, 1951
will not cut off my nose to spite my face.
We in the West are good enough business
men to face the facts. We say that we should
have had at least another fifteen cents a
bushel, and we are getting only 4-6 cents;
but if the government will not grant us any
more, all we can do is to wait until the next
election, register our disapproval at the
ballot box, and then get the additional six
cents.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: I do not want to interrupt
the honourable senator, but may I ask him
one other question? Despite what he says,
in view of their returns over the last four
years are not the wheat-growing communities
of Western Canada better off today than they
ever were? Have they not paid off more
mortgages; have they not more money in
the bank? By any measure one wishes to
apply, are they not better off?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I will answer my honourable friend in this way. Suppose that six
years after I buy a house for $18,000 I am
offered $50,000 for it. Should I sell it? I do
not know. Today a dollar is worth only
about half what it was a few years ago;
under these conditions the people who stand
to lose are those who own securities. The
market price of bonds is falling. Why?
Because-at least in my belief-the government has "got out from under"; and people
do not believe that government securities
represent the amount of commodities which
their money, when it was originally loaned,
would buy. Let nobody suppose that the
farmer is debt free. Go to the banks and ask
how much western Canadian producers owe
on machinery.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: These dollars are perfectly
good for paying off debts when you come to
clear off fixed obligations.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That has nothing to do
with it. Though I could sell for $10,000 a
house which cost me $8,000, would I not be
foolish not to want $15,000 if that were its
real present value? It is true that necessity
might compel me to accept $10,000. On this
reasoning I do not see why the farmer should
be content to take $1.55 a bushel when his
fellow-farmer across the boundary can get
$2.50 for a bushel of the same grade of wheat.
And that is the world price. I am not taking
into account items of adjustment.

short supply it must advance forty-two cents
before our wheat can be sold there at a
profit. But if the United States has a surplus
of wheat we are not affected by that duty.
The real reason why wheat sells at a higher
price in the United States than here is
because of the terribly high tariff by which
they protect it. It must also be remembered
that, whereas 80 per cent of our production is
exported, 90 per cent of United States production is -consumed at home. That makes a
difference.
Hon. Mr. Baird: We in Newfoundland paid
during the war the highest possible price for
Canadian flour and wheat. Now we are part
of Canada, and you ask us to pay you in
taxes a sum of money to help liquidate this
debt. Is that reasonable? Is that typical of
Western Canada?
Hon. Mr. Haig: As a matter of fact your
province pays only about 1 per cent of the
federal taxes.
Hon. Mr. Baird: Quite enough.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Western 'Canada will write
off your one per cent if you are really concerned about it.
Hon. Mr. Baird: We will keep you to that
bargain.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Ontario, Quebec and British
Columbia pay about 90 per cent of the taxes
of Canada, so they are the people who will
pay practically all the $65 million.
Hon. Mr. Baird: Then why not the whole
of it?
Hon. Mr. Haig: When you paid the prices
you refer to, Newfoundland was not part of
Canada; it was an outside country. It had no
claim on us.
Hon. Mr. Baird: If the farmer is to be
recompensed, who has to pay the bill?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Mainly Ontario and Quebec,
although British Columbia provides a pretty
fair proportion. But I remind you that Newfoundland at the time you mention was not
part of Canada; therefore it had to ,pay the
world price.
Hon. Mr. Baird: We did not realize that we
would be caught so quickly!
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Will the honourable
leader of the opposition not admit,-with due
Hon. Mr. McIntyre: Is not the price of allowance for all his arguments,-that today
more farmers have title to their lands and
wheat always higher in the United States money in their pockets than ever
before in
than in Canada?
Western Canada?
Hon. Mr. Haig: That depends on whether
Hon. Mr. Haig: I cannot answer that, I do

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: If my honourable friend
will go to the land titles offices he will find
that what I say is true.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, it is no argument ta
say that because I made money I must have
been crooked. I may have been, but nobody
has a right to say it unless he can prove it.
If I am told, "You got $1.55 a bushel and you
have paid off some of your debts", I reply,
"If I had got $2.55 a bushel I would have
paid off a lot more."
Hon. Mr. Fogo: You would have gone to
California!
Hon. Mr. Haig: Maybe I would have gone
to California. My honourable friend ought
to know that the people of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta are not the only
people who take trips to California. And let
me add that not a few of the big manufacturers of the central provinces have been
enabled to go to California through profits on
the machinery they have sold to farmers out
west.
The only reason I entered into this debate
was because I felt I might never have a
chance again.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Not getting tired, are
you?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators will
recall that five years ago I "bucked" the
wheat agreement. I believe the honourable
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) was
a little inclined to be with me.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: A little!
Hon. Mr. Haig: But, except for himself-I
appreciated his support-and the members of
our party, no one in this parliament opposed
the wheat agreement right from the start.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: And your friends in the
other house did not.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Mr. Bracken predicted what
would happen. He said that the agreement
would lead to bitterness between Canada and
Great Britain; and that is precisely what bas
resulted. In Saskatchewan the Minister of
Agriculture has been preaching that the
British are at fault because they did not
"corne through" in the way they should have
done. But the Minister of Trade and Commerce coming from Ontario, says that they
did. You pay your money and you take your
choice.
In a country which pretends ta believe in
free enterprise I think it is unfair to go to one
of the largest industries and say "We will
take your goods and sell them and give you
the proceeds, but if there is a loss you will
have to suffer that loss". That is what they
did. These are the cold-blooded facts, and I

do not understand how the people of our
two great central provinces, Ontario and
Quebec, can deny ta the wheat producers
of Canada reasonable compensation for the
tremendous losses they have suffered under
the British Wheat Agreement.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. G. P. Burchill: Honourable senators,
I did not come here this afternoon prepared
to speak on this question, but I would be a
poor representative of the Maritimes, and
particularly of New Bruswick, if I did not
say a few words in vigorous protest against
an expenditure from the public funds, even
to the extent of one dollar, let alone $65
million, to supplement the payments which
have been made ta Canadian wheat producers
under the British Wheat Agreement.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I know that when I
say this I will be supported by every thinking citizen of the Maritime Provinces. I am
not arguing the merits of the British Wheat
Agreement. The fact is that the agreement
was negotiated and carried out, and therefore
the people who made it should stand by it.
When I first came to the Senate this agreement was being introduced. As an easterner
I thought it was rather strange legislation
ta be brought before parliament, because in
my section of the country, where lumber is
ta the people what wheat is ta westerners,
we had similar problems during the war to
those experienced by the wheat producers.
The lumber producers from all over the Maritimes formed their own voluntary association,
and when they were holding their organizatian meetings they considered compulsory
government legislation; but, being the Canadian citizens they are, they decided in favour
of private enterprise. They were not going
ta ask for government legislation ta compel
producers ta channel their lumber through
the organization.
During and since the last war the lumber
producers of the Maritimes have done business with the British Government through
this voluntary association. During the war
period, of course, we were subject to government restrictions. There was a ceiling on
lumber in Canada, in the United States and in
Great Britain, where we made certain agreements. We were subjected ta the same sort of
conditions which have been described by the
honourable leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) this afternoon.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: It is not true that
although ceilings were imposed on lumber,
the lumber producers did not have ta sell
their products, whereas the wheat farmers
were obliged ta sell their wheat?

MARCH 19, 1951
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I shall come to that in
one moment. The point I want to make is
that during the war period the Canadian
producers of any natural product were
unable to get the highest prices for their
products because of the imposition of government ceilings. The lumber producers of the
Maritimes took the position that, in order
to help the Canadian war effort, they should
not ask for everything the traffic would bear.
As I say, when I first came to the Senate
this agreement, which compels certain people
to do certain things, was being introduced,
and coming from the atmosphere which I
have just described I felt that it was certainly un-Canadian. I could not understand
it receiving the support it did, but I was told
by senators from the West-certainly those
from the Liberal party, and some from the
Conservative party-that the various farmers'
organizations wanted that sort of legislation.
I was told that the farmers had made representations to the government about such an
agreement, and that in fact it was the only
type of agreement with which they would be
satisfied. Having been given that information,
I was disposed with others to acquiesce to
the passing of this legislation. That information must have been correct, despite everything that has been said this afternoon by
the leader opposite, because there has since
been a general election at which the policies
of the party which put through this agreement were endorsed by the farmers of the
middle west in an unprecedented way. So it
would appear that the farmers, through their
organizations, certainly wanted this legislation. Well, they got it, and if it has not worked
out to their liking they should take their
medicine and not ask the people of the rest
of Canada to contribute to an extra payment
under the agreement. I think this is dangerous
legislation.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Absolutely.
Hon. Mr. Burchili: We cannot embark on
a policy of giving bonuses, for if we did so
it would mean that right away producers
from every section of the country would ask
for the same consideration. Take the poor
potato producers of New Brunswick. I do not
come from the potato belt, so I am not as
familiar with their problems as is my honourable friend who sits beside me (Hon. Mr.
Pirie); but I have been told that the potato
producers have not made any money on their
crops this year and that there is a huge
surplus of potatoes on the market. I understand that even last fall the New Brunswick
potato people appealed to the government to
help them out of their unhappy situation.
Honourable senators, I know for a fact that
the potato producers of my province are
80713-19J

going through difficult times right now, and
I am sure that if the honourable senator
from King's (Hon. Mr. McDonald) were here
he would have something to say about the
predicament in which the apple producers
of Nova Scotia now find themselves.
Honourable senators, speaking as a Canadian from the Maritime Provinces, I want to
say that I am definitely opposed to the granting of $65 million from the public funds of
this country to the wheat producers of
Canada.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
I think the amendments in the measure
before us can be supported by every member
of this house. In my judgment the legislation under which the Wheat Board has been
operating for several years now is unsound
and unfair. But if it is unfair and unsound,
and we have to live under it, we should try
to improve it. And the amendments here
suggested would improve the administration
of the Act.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I scarcely need to deal
with them at any length at all. They are
simple and would be advantageous.
Possibly in the minds of honourable members who are not familiar with the ramifications of grain marketing in Western
Canada there is some doubt as to what is
meant by the term "pool". That term is
used in two different senses. There are the
wheat pools, which have a large membership
of farmers and operate in the usual fashion,
having country elevators collecting grain and
terminal elevators storing it at terminal
points, and having the machinery for marketing it.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: But the pools do not
buy now.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: They buy wheat in the
same sense that any other country does.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No, they cannot buy
anything, and they have not been able to
buy for years.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Neither can anyone else.
That is one of the criticisms which I shall
make a little later on.
The word "pool" in the sense used here
refers to an operation covering the marketing of grain within one year. The British
Wheat Agreement was termed a five-year
pool. That meant that grain would go into
the pool for a period of five years, and at the
end of that time the whole thing would be
wound up and a final distribution be made
to the producers.
My honourable friend

SENATE

from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) states
that the pools do not buy grain. It is quite
true that since September 1943 they have not
bought or sold grain, but prior to that they
operated precisely as the ordinary grain elevator company did. That was following the
period when the original pool contracts had
expired. Since 1943 the sale bas been channelled through the Wheat Board and the pools
have operated in the same way as any other
grain elevator company. That is, they are
agents for the Board. They take grain into their
country elevators on the terms set by the
board and they deliver it to the board; and
sometimes, if they are in the exporting business, the board may give them the opportunity to carry through sales which the board
has made to countries abroad.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That is precisely the
situation that exists today, and there is no
difference between the way in which a pool
elevator operates and the way that any other
elevator company operates.
Now I have a few words to say about the
famous British Wheat Agreement. I do not
wish to recall the past, but I am on record
in this house as having opposed this agreement when it was introduced. And, honourable senators, may I add that I am on record
also as having opposed the International
Wheat Agreement, which I fear will, when it
is through, prove as great a headache as the
British Wheat Agreement is proving now.
What was the British Wheat Agreement?
It was an agreement whereby the government sold 600 million bushels of wheat; 160
million bushels to be delivered from the crop
produced in 1946, and the same quantity from
the crop produced in 1947. The price for
those two years was fixed in the agreement
at $1.55 a bushel, basis Fort William No. 1
Northern. For the two succeeding years a
minimum price was fixed in the agreement,
and as to this I am taking the information
given by the honourable leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig).
Hon. Mr. Haig: It was $1.25 for the first
year.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That is, for the third
year of the agreement, the minimum price
was to be $1.25 a bushel; and for the fourth
year it was to be $1 a bushel.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That meant that the
price for those two years could not go below
those respective figures. There was in the
agreement, however, a clause to the effect
that if at the end of the first two years it so
happened that the world price for wheat

had been higher than the $1.55 a bushel
which the British government paid under the
agreement, then when negotiating the price
for the two final years the British government would have regard to that fact. And
sat down to
when our representatives
negotiate with representatives of the British
government, in December 1948Hon. Mr. Haig:

1947.

Hon. Mr. Crerar: My honourable friend is
correct. At the end of 1947 they sat down
to negotiate what the price would be for the
wheat produced in 1948.
Hon. Mr. Haig:

Correct.

Hon. Mr. Crerar: In the meantime the world
price had- advanced very greatly. As a matter
of fact, in the first two years of the agreement
the farmers of Western Canada lost $329
million. There is no question whatever about
that in my mind. It has been argued that
it is impossible to determine what the loss
under the agreement was.
It has been
argued that all this Canadian wheat, if thrown
upon the market in the ordinary way, without any British agreement, would have had a
depressing effect on values, and <that consequently there cannot be said to have been a
worldi price during the period of the agreement. But in my judigment that argument
is not valid.
The Minister of Trade and
Commerce at that time, who now is our colleague the senator from Edmonton (Hon. Mr.
MacKinnon), stated in the House of Commons
in July 1947 that the loss on the first year's
operation of the agreement was calculated to
be $123 million. That statement was easily
The loss on the second year's
verifiable.
operation of the agreement was substantially
higher, because during the 1947 crop, while
we were selling wheat to Britain at $1.55
basis Fort William, the Wheat Board was selling to Belgium, Holland and other countries in
Europe at a price as high as $3.40.
The argument that if the agreement had not
been made, and this volume of Canadian
wheat had, been put on the market, the price
would have been adversely affected,, does not
hold water. That argument could only be
made successfully if it can be shown that
Britain would have purchased less wheat from
Canada than she did undier the agreement.
There are two reasons why this claim is not
sound. The first is that Great Britain had to
have wheat to feed ber population and! the
second is that during the period of the agreement she bought wheat outside of the
Canadian wheat agreement, from Argentina
and Australia at, as the leader opposite
bas said, very much higher prices than those
agreed on in the Canadian wheat agreement?
Great Britain required the purchase of as

MARCH 19, 1951
much wheat as possible from Canada. It is
true that she had a dollar problem at that
time; but she had to have wheat and even at
higher prices the way would have had to be
found to enable her to secure the necessary
supplies. So I dismiss that argument as
having no validity whatever.
We come now to the two concluding years
of the agreement. In the negotiations in the
autumn of 1947, for the 1948 crop, the price
was fixed at $2 a bushel at Fort William; and
the price for the final year, covering the 1949
crop, negotiated a year later, was the same.
During both those years wheat was sold to
France, Norway, Belgium, and other countries which buy our wheat, at a price higher
even than the British agreement price, namely
$2 a bushel, and it was not until July, 1950,
a few weeks before the termination of the
agreement, that the price of Class 2 wheat
sold to countries other than Great Britain
dropped down to $2 a bushel.
The loss suffered by the western wheat
grower in the first two years of the agreement
was regarded by the British as a reason why
they should increase the price in the two
final years. The British, I presume because of
the loss suffered in the first two years, agreed
to pay $2 a bushel in the two final years. That
point of view seems to me to have some
validity.
I call particular attention to the fact that
not only was there a loss on the wheat sold
under the British agreement, but there was
also a loss on the wheat consumed in Canada.
The Canadian four mills bought their
requirements from 1946 to July 31, 1950, on
the same basis, Fort William, as the British
did under the -agreement and consequently
the bread consumers of Canada undoubtedly
benefited by that arrangement.
We come now to the question of the payment of $65 million. And that is not "the
$64 question", but the $65 million question.
My honourable friend from Northumberland
(Hon. Mr. Burchill) bas taken the stand that
the payments should not be made. Without
hesitation I say that I agree with him.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: It is necessary to substantiate my reasoning by going back to the
genesis of this agreement. Why did the government enter into the agreement in 1946?
Some of the farmers' organizations, the grain
pools, and the orators who journeyed back
and forth across the prairies, gave as their
reasons stability and the removal of the
gambling element frorn the sale of grain on
the open futures market. I put to this honourable house and to the people of Canada
this question: Was there ever in the history

of wheat a greater gamble than that taken
by the government in 1946 when it made this
agreement?
Hon. Mr. Duff: Would my honourable friend
answer this question? Why should the government want to get into the wheat market
anyway?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I will come to that
question.
There is no doubt that the pool organizations and the Federation of Agriculture
pressed an agreement of this kind upon the
Dominion Government. Moreover, the Minister of Agriculture is on record as saying that
before the agreement was signed he submitted
its terms to the representatives of the pool
organizations and the Federation of Agriculture, and they approved of it. Now, if they
approved of it and the agreement was entered
into at their request, and it turned out to be
a huge gamble on which there was a heavy
loss, why then should the taxpayers of
Canada be obliged to make good that loss?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: How long ago was that
statement made by the minister?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Everybody knows it
was made.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Was that statement
made at the time of the agreement?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: My recollection is that it
was made shortly after the agreement was
signed.
That is the position I take now regarding
this agreement. If the government is liable
to make good -any loss under this agreement,
why should it stop at the payment of $65
million? Why should it not take steps to
determine the whole loss and reimburse the
farmers for it?
Hon. Mr. Duff: Quite right.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I am not arguing that the
Canadian government should not, at the time
made have
that the agreement was
given some assistance to Great Britain, but
I contend that they should not have placed
the burden of doinig so only upon the wheat
producers of Western Canada. I am one of
those producers, and I hasten to say that I
would not be taking part in this debate
today, and I would not vote on the supplementary estimates covering the final allowance of $65 million, if I were not opposed to
it. I have sold several thousand bushels of
wheat under this agreement, and I am a
beneficiary of the government's bounty to
the extent of 41 cents a bushel. In those
circumstances I think it would be highly
improper for me to support the payment of

SENATE

the amount set out in the estimates, either
by speaking in support of the question or by
voting for it.
The result of this agreement is unfortunate
in another aspect. We hear complaints, particularly in the part of the country that I
come from, that Great Britain has welshed,
on this agreement, and in certain quarters
a feeling is d'eveloping that the British
have not lived up .to their undertaking. Now
in this time of international tension I think it
most unfortunate that any notion of that
kind should exisit, let alone be expressed.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I think the British people
made a shrewd bargain; I also believe they
have lived up to it. Consequently it shows
poor grace for those who have lost by the
deal to complain that the people with whom
they dealt were too shrewd for them.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Quite right.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That is not, according to
my idea, the way that business should be done!
In my business experience, when I made a badi
deal I accepted the fact without complaint;
and if I made a deal which the other party
thought was a bad one from his point of
view, I ex'pected him to live up to it. I
think that that priniciple of conduct should
govern in this case.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: A sort of Shylock
attitude: "I want my pound of flesh".
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Oh, no. My honourable
friend from Margaree Forks (Hon. Mr. MacLennan), for whom I have a very high
respect, will agree on reflection that what I
have said is in no way related to the character he has in mind.
The consequences of this agreement are
unfortunate in another respect. I have no
doubt that a good deal of feeling will be
aroused in certain parts of Canada over the
contribution by the Canadian treasury of $65
million for this purpose, at a time when we
are faced not only with an increase of taxation, but with estimates which will raise our
expenditures over three-quarters of a billion
dollars as against the previous year. It is
undesirable that such sentiments should be
abroad when we want to bring about the
greatest possible degree of unity to meet the
difficulties and dangers which may confront us in the not distant future.
There is yet another argument which I
would put forward. I think it is a pretty safe
assumption that other interests will come to
the government with the claim, "We also
have been discriminated against; we also
have lost money." What about the people
who produced hogs to fill the bacon contract

with Great Britain? At the time those hogs
were being raised they could have been sold,
had the government so permitted, in the
United States at much higher prices than
were obtained under the British bacon
agreement. Whether or not the producers
have a grievance, they will feel that they
have one; and the same may be said of thepotato growesr, the apple growers and the
cheese producers. The demands may extend
beyond these classes into other fields of
production.
We have had this experience, and it has
not been very pleasant. I do not suppose
many taxpayers will raise a cheer over the
withdrawal of $65 million from the treasury
for this purpose.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: There is one other point
I want to mention, and I am sorry that my
honourable friend from Carleton (Hon. Mr.
Fogo), a very good friend of mine, is not now
in the chamber to hear it. We have been told
that the farmers of Western Canada are
pretty well off, that they have paid off a very
large part of the mortgages on their property.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: So bas everybody else.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Quite right: so has everybody else. Is it any argument in favour of
discrimination of this kind that farmers in
Western Canada have done pretty well and
have paid off mortgages during the war years,
when they could not buy farm implements or
build houses or anything else? It seems to
me that even the suggestion that the results of
this agreement, for this reason, should not be
criticized, falls pretty flat.
I come now to the last point I have to
make, and it is by way of an admonition or
rather a suggestion. We have had the experience of this agreement. Probably, before the
expiration of the International Wheat Agreement, which bas two years to run from the
lst of August next, we shall be considering
the handicaps which it has imposed upon the
farmers of Western Canada, because today
wheat is being sold by the Wheat Board to
those importing countries which are not
affected by the agreement at as much as 30
cents a bushel above the price which is
being charged to countries that are signatories
to the agreement. If that situation is not a
sign of trouble ahead, I do not read the
omens aright. All that is needed is a major
crop failure in any of the large exporting
countries to send the price of wheat very
much higher than it is at present. But across
the path of higher prices to our producers
stands the International Agreement, madeagain-on the urgings of the wheat pools and
the Federation of Agriculture, signed by the

MARCH 19, 1951
government, and ratified by this parliament.
I believe these -are circumstances which will
give us cause for serious discussion a little
later on. In the meantime the suggestion I
wish to offer is directed to the government,
and it is this: Get out of the business of
state tradingHon. Mr. Duff: "Attaboy"!
Hon. Mr. Crerar: -and blocked agreements,
and stay outHon. Mr. Duff: Quite right.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: -for the good of the
Canadian people.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Quite right. Let them mind
their own business.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: We must travel in one
direction or the other. We cannot stop half
way. Either we are going to proceed on a
course which will put the whole commerce
of this country in a government strait-jacket,
to be regulated and controlled by boards, or
we must get back to a free-market basis,
wherein the law of supply and demand and
the price mechanism operate to determine
values.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: So far as these amendments are concerned, I say without any
hesitation that they shall have my support.
I think the Act is a bad Act. I think the
present Wheat Board legislation is an
unsound device. It is unsound for a very
important reason, which I can state in a
few words. As a wheat-grower in Western
Canada, today, I cannot market a bushel of
my wheat until I get a permit to do so from
a government board. That is a straight invasion of the fundamental rights of the individual citizen, and as such it should never
find a place in the statute books of our
country in a time of peace.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: I am willing to have
the bill referred to committee or to have it
given third reading now, whichever honourable senators wish.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Is the bill to be given
third reading now?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: If there is unanimous
consent.

The Hon. the Speaker: When shall the
bill be read the third time?

The motion was agreed to, and the bills
were read the third time, and passed, on
division.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I should like to know
what all the hurry is about.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: It does not make any
difference to me whether the bill is given
third reading or is sent to committee.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Is the bill even before
us now?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: It is now. I shall
move either that it be sent to committee or
that it be placed on the Order Paper for

The Hon. the Speaker: If the bill is not
referred to committee it will be placed on

The bill stands for third reading tomorrow.

That precedent having been

MOTION

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved:
That, for the duration of the present session of
parliament, should an emergency arise during any
adjournment of the Senate, which would in the
opinion of the Honourable the Speaker warrant that
the Senate meet prior to the time set forth in the
motion for such adjournment, the Honourable the
Speaker be authorized to notify honourable senators
at their addresses registered with the Clerk of the
Senate to meet at a time earlier than that set out
in the motion for such adjournment, and non-receipt
by any one or more honourable senators of such
call shall not have any effect upon the sufficiency
and validity thereof.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall the bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: With leave of the
Senate, now
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.

He said: Honourable senators, it is customary to make this motion whenever it is likely
that the Senate will be in recess during a
period when the House of Commons is sitting.
I intend on Wednesday, to ask the house to
consider adjourning for the Easter recess
until April 5, on which date the President of
France will address a joint session of parliament. At that time I shall discuss the further
sittings of this house in the light of any
business which may be forthcoming, but in
all probability I shall ask that the house
ad:journ for a further period.
Honourable senators, the Senate has been
sitting steadily since the opening of parliament on January 30. The Divorce Committee commenced its hearings five days lateras compared with twenty-eight days after the
opening of parliament a year ago-and as a
result of hard; work has disposed of practically all the business which will come before
it during this session.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Could the honourable
leader advise the house whether it is intended
that the Senate will sit for just one day when
it re-assembles on April 5?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: That is the intention
at the present time, but I would point out
that circumstances over which I have no
control may alter the situation.
The motion was agreed to.

SENATE
motion for third reading would be made
today I decided to defer my remarks until
now.
By common consent in both houses of parliament we are permitted to discuss the
Anglo-Canadian wheat agreement and the
amount of $65 million which it is proposed to
pay as compensation for alleged losses through
operation of the agreement over the last
four years. In my judgment no useful purpose can be served by trying to recapture a
lot of water that has passed over the dam in
that time. In reviewing the situation yesterday, my honourable friends the leader of
the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) and the senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) made
it quite clear that a number of members of
this house, including myself, had taken the
position that the agreement was not a sound
business proposition. Having said that, I
cannot see any practically useful purpose in
trying to assess controversial figures as to
losses, or to determine what might have been
done or might not have been done. We all
know what happened in 1946 in response to
what seemed like an almost unanimous
demand from organized agriculture in Western Canada in connection with the marketing
of grain. Both houses of parliament voted on
the matter without even a division, and while
critical opinions were expressed about the
possible application of the agreement, I cannot see that much satisfaction is to be gained
now by saying "Well, I told you so," or by
attempting any other measure of selfjustification at this time.
The main point that appeals to me is that
the agreement was made between the British
Government and the Canadian Government.
each representing the people of its own
country, and not between a certain British
group and the Western wheat growers.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The interests of the
people of both countries were concerned in
this deal, and I think that in considering the
situation now we must do so as members of
parliament who are responsible to the people
of Canada for the results, rather than as
representatives of any region or group.
Tomorrow afternoon, perhaps at about this
hour or later, we shall have before us a
request for supply, and as a long adjournment
is pending we shall not have much time to
discuss it. Therefore at this time we should
try to think of our position with respect to
the wheat agreement in terms of action rather
than of words.
The wheat agreement lapsed a year ago,
and the final price was formally announced
last June by the appropriate minister in the
other place; later it was clearly explained

before the annual meeting of the Alberta
wheat pool in Calgary. Incidentally, at the
conclusion of the minister's statement on the
subject, a resolution was passed unanimously
expressing confidence in him and in the statement he made. There was no word of dissent,
disagreement or appeal from any part of the
country, or by any member of parliament, in
connection with the final announcement
regarding the wheat agreement.
Can anybody explain to me why now, a year
after the termination of the agreement, when
all the facts were known, all this fuss is
taking place? Possibly there is a reason.
For one thing, western Canada expected a
crop of 500 million bushels this past year, but
it got only about a third of that quantity.
From the statistics I have seen and the advice
I have received I understand that some twothirds of that grain was reduced to very low
grades, worth a fraction of the value of high
grade wheat. I contend that had western
Canada not unfortunately been the victim of
unfavourable natural conditions, but had
realized a crop of 500 million bushels, very
little would have been heard about the
demand for further compensation for the
losses incurred on the wheat agreement.
It was made quite clear by my friend from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) in his remarks
yesterday, that there is no legal or moral
obligation on the part of the Government of
Canada to pay anything more than has been
paid on account of this agreement. My
friend from Northumberland
(Hon. Mr.
Burchill) asked what the Senate is going to do
about it. Well, almost all of our time so far
this session has been taken up in debating
how the Senate can best contribute to the
welfare of Canada; here is the first opportunity to give substance and sincerity to our
pretensions. What is the maximum contribution the Senate can make in connection
with this matter? Certainly it will be a most
ironical demonstration of what can be done,
if tomorrow we give docile and tacit
acquiescence to the payment out of the
treasury of Canada of $65 million to the
western farmers. I trust that between now
and tomorrow afternoon some thought will
be given to what the Senate can do when the
supply bill comes before us.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: In conclusion I want
to say that there is not only no moral or legal
justification for this proposed payment, but
in my humble opinion it cannot be supported
in the interests of decency and justice.
Some Hon. Senajors: Hear, hear.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
it was not my intention to say anything today,

MARCH 20, 1951
but because of what has been said by the
senator from Northumberland (Hon. Mr.
Burchil) and the senator from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert), I feel obliged to reply. But
should the Senate decide to vote against the
passage of the bill under which this payment
will be made to the western farmers I, as a
wheat producer and one interested in the
agreement, must refrain from voting.
I think the house should bear in mind
what the honourable senator from Churchill
said yesterday, namely, that this agreement
was one of the biggest gambles in the history
of wheat marketing. Indeed, that statement
was made before the government entered
into the agreement. We hear it said that the
farmers asked for this agreement, and that
it was supported by the heads of the Federation of Agriculture. But it must be
remembered that the main body of that
federation is in eastern Canada, and knows
very little about wheat growing. As to the
part taken by the wheat pool, I may say that
I, as a member of the pool, was never consulted in such matters; and I venture to
suggest that not more than 25 per cent of the
practical wheat producers wanted to hand the
marketing of their product over to the government. Remember, honourable senators,
the farmers did not enter into this agreement: the government entered into it on their
behalf. Had the gamble turned out well, and
had wheat gone down in price, those who had
to do with the negotiations would have been
patting themselves on the back and saying
what a good bargain they had made. As it
turned out, it was the British wheat purchasers who made the good bargain. Wheat has
been very much higher than the price agreed
on by the agreement, and therefore, the
government cannot escape responsibility for
the resulting loss.
I am worried now about what our prospects are under the International Wheat
Agreement. Indeed, I will be very much surprised if we do not suffer a similar loss
under that arrangement.
It has been said that the western farmers
have been disappointed with the wheat yield
of the past year. I would point out that if
we are able to thresh all the grain we have
without much loss, it will show quite a good
return. Feed wheat and low grade wheat
are now selling in large quantities in California at $1.58 a bushel, which is 3 cents
more than we received for No. 1 wheat in
the early years of the wheat agreement. So
my answer to the suggestion of the senator
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) that we
took a trimming this year, is that if the
80713-20j

crop is all threshed we will have a nice thing
out of it, for although the wheat is low-grade,
the yield is good.
While, as I have said, I will be unable to
vote on the question of the payment of $65
million, I would remind honourable senators
that the Minister of Agriculture travelled
through western Canada prior to the last
election and said that the "have regard
clause" would be taken up later on. The
information was given out that there would
be a substantial payment forthcoming.
In answer to the argument that the timber
people had to sell lumber under certain conditions, I say that when cement was selling
at $3 and third grade lumber was going at
$100, the articles the farmer had to sell were
not correspondingly high.
I repeat, the government cannot have it
bo h ways. They took over the marketing
of the farmers' wheat, the arrangement was
made as between governments, and the
gamble went bad. Therefore the government
must take the responsibility.
Hon. A. L. Beaubien: Honourable senators,
I should like to say a few words on the
proposed payment of $65 million to compensate the western wheat growers for wheat
sold under the agreement with Great Britain.
I am not very much concerned with the
question of whether there is a moral obligation on the part of Great Britain to increase
her payments or not, but I would point out
to honourable senators who do not live in the
West, and particularly to the honourable
senator from Northumberland (Hon. Mr.
Burchill), who spoke yesterday, that the
wheat growers did what they were obliged to
do; in order to give the Canadian people
cheap breadi, they supplied wheat for domestic
consumption at a certain fixed price.
Hon. Mr. Horner: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: If my information is
correct, and I think it is, had wheat for
domestic consumption been sold at the same
price at which it was disposed of to Great
Britain for the first two years, namely $1.55
a bushel, the farmers returns would have been
increased by forty to fifty million dollars.
The difference ýbetween that amount and, the
sum which it is now proposed to vote them by
way of recompense is about $15 million.
Remembering that the wheat producers of
Western Canada by every means possible
made their maximum contribution to keeping
down the cost of living when it was important
that it should be kept down, I think the
amount it is proposed to give them is not too
much.
Hon. Frederick W. Pirie: Honourable senators, we have heard a good deal in this house

MARCH 20, 1951
Hon. G. P. Campbell: Honourable senators,
after listening to the debate here this afternoon, and reflecting upon the debate which
took place when this agreement was originally
before this chamber, perhaps I, though a
lawyer from the city of Toronto, may be
permitted to say something about the matter
under discussion.
This debate takes place on the third reading
of the Canadian Wheat Board Bill, and I feel
that the matter in question goes to the very
root of the Wheat Board Act and state
marketing in Canada. The question facing
the country is whether or not a policy will
be laid down whereby all agricultural products, and possibly products of every kind, will
come under state control in so far as their
disposal is concerned. This would result in
pretty strict regimentation of persons engaged
in the production of state-controlled goods.
I was pleased to read what the honourable
member from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
said yesterday. He claimed that the time had
come when the government of this country
should decide whether we are going to -adopt
a system of state merchandising or are going
to return to a system of private enterprise.
It seems to me that there can be no half-way
mark in this: If you go so far you have to go
all the way. When the debate on this Wheat
Agreement was originally before the house I
said that its language was not clear, and I
predicted that there would be some difficulty
in its interpretation.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: It is quite apparent
now that my statement was correct. There
were many in this .chamber who voiced
exactly the same opinion, and the government department in charge of the administration of this wheat agreement had plenty of
opportunity to straighten it out so as to obviate all the ýdifficulties which have since arisen.
The agreement nevertheless, was carried out,
and it seems to me that its interpretation by
the Minister of Trade and Commerce is a
correct one. The price for the first two years
was fixed, and according to a provision in the
contract the price to be fixed for the subsequent years was to have regard to the difference between the price fixed in the first two
years and the world price that existed over
that period of time.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think the honourable senator has forgotten a certain fact. He knows
that the government had already signed the
wheat agreement before it came to this bouse.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: I am quite aware of
that, but there was ample opportunity for the
authorities to consider the agreement because
its difficulties had been forecast in the

debates of this house. Now, whether the price
fixed was high enough is not for me to say.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Was it not the responsibility of the government to fix a proper price?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: I shall deal with that
point. The difference between the contract
price and the world price in the first two
years was not reflected in the re-negotiated
price for the last two years.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: The result was that in
the last two years the wheat farmer did not
receive the difference between the contract
price and the world price. There is no doubt
about that.
The question then arises as to what the
world price would have been had these contracts not been entered into. But that is
something so speculative and so uncertain
that no one could prophesy what the correct
answer would be. Had there been no control
over the sale of the western farmers' grain,
they would have received substantially more
than $2 a bushel-possibly close to $3 a
bushel. The facts are, however, that the contract had been enered into, and under statutory power, the Canadian Wheat Board had
control over the merchandising of grain, and
it had the wholehearted approval of the
western wheat pools, who knew the risk
that was being taken. I am sure that the idea
in the minds of the farmers and the wheat
pool authorities was to get a fair price which
would result in a profit and at the same time
remove the element of gamble that would
have existed if the wheat were sold on the
open market.
Honourable senators may wonder why I
am speaking on this question, but as a
member of the Senate I could not take my
place here without protesting the payment
of $65 million to compensate any one particular group of people in this country. I
cannot help thinking about the white-collar
workers-bank clerks, office workers, store
clerks and so on-in the metropolitan areas of
our cities, who have paid more taxes than
any other group. 'hey are unorganized, with
no one to speak for them, and they have to
spend substantial sums of money in order to
maintain their families and hold their positions. In my opinion the voting of this money
is a serious thing at a time when the government is looking here and there to raise large
sums to carry out its defence program. I am
sure the budget will disclose that Canadian
wage earners who fall within small income
brackets will be faced with heavy taxation.
I think it is the duty of the government to
economize in every way possible, and I do
not feel that there is any legal or moral

SENATE
obligation for voting $65 million in this way.
I should like to ask why the payment should
be $65 million? Apparently the farmers think
it should be more, others think it should be
less, and still others think there should be
no payment at all. If this amount is voted
without protest it will establish a precedent,
and the western farmers will be able to come
back to the government at a latter date and
say, "You merchandised a lot of our wheat
under the International Wheat AgreemeAt,
and you did not get as high a price as you
might have got if you had sold it to Japan
or China or some other country which was
not a party to the agreement". You can
carry the same argument right down the line,
and apply it to every commodity merchandised under any state merchandising program
introduced into Canada. When we examine
the various bills empowering boards to carry
on this state merchandising program, we
realize that it is a flagrant interference with
the rights of individual citizens, and I do not
think the people of this country are in favour
of that. I agree with the senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) that if we wish to show
that the Senate is looking after the welfare
of the people-I mean the people of all
classes, from one end of the country to the
other-we must consider their feelings about
this proposed payment of $65 million. I feel
that the people expect the Senate to investigate matters of this nature.
It is expected, I understand that the bill
appropriating this money will probably pass
the other house today and come to us tomorrow, and there may not be much opportunity
for diebate at that time. If we vote against
it and the matter has to be considered further
by the other house, our proposed adjournment may be interfered with. However, that
should not deter us for one moment. We
should consider this matter very carefully
and use our best judgment in an endeavour
to corne to a proper conclusion.
I am going to vote against the payment,
because there is no legal or moral justification for making it. It would create a very
bad precedent. In my opinion the proposal
should be voted. down, as a lesson to the
farmers, or to any other group merchandising
their products through a public board, that
they must be satisfied with the terms of any
contract entered into by the board, and with
the amount of money they receive under the
contract.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
I was not expecting a long debate on this
question and therefore had not intended to
speak on the bill, but because of the position
taken by some honourable members I feel
ooliged to say something. You all know that

I was appointed to this honourable body as
the representative of the wheat growers of
Saskatchewan, which is the greatest wheat
growin-g province in Canada. I therefore
feel more or less responsible for seeing to it
that the payment proposed-or a larger sum,
if possible-is voted, in order that the farmers may have some compensation for the great
losses which they suffered und-er the AngloCanadian wheat agreement.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Will my honourable
friend allow me to interrupt him? As a
resident of central Canada I have followed
the debate on this matter as closely as I could,
and I am not convinced that the situation of
the western farmers is very bad, in comparison with the one just mentioned by the
senator from Victoria-Carleton (Hon. Mr.
Pirie). I should like definite information on
this.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Honourable senators
know that right from the beginning I opposed
the Anglo-Canadian wheat .agreement. I
spoke of it on several occasions. I was sure
that it would not work out as planned, and
that I, along with other wheat growers in
Western Canada, would lose very substantially because of it. I am not going to reiterate the arguments that I used on those
occasions, but I would remind honourable
senators, as I then pointed out, that a study
of history has convinced, me that every great
war has brought about extensive destruction
in wheat growing areas and that in consequence the price of wheat has remained high
for some time after the war has ended,. This
was true of, for instance, the Crimean war
and the Napoleonic wars. I was sure that
after the termination of World War II wheat
would remain at a high price for quite a
number of years, and that therefore it was
nonsensical on our part to enter into the
Anglo-Canadian wheat agreement. I expressed
that view also when the agreement was
before us.
Now the senator frorn Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Campbell) has admitted that during the first
two years of the contract the wheat growers
suffered a substantial loss.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: How much?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: They lost $330 million.
Besides, they lost by supplying wheat to the
millers at a very low price. The millers
paid a fraction over 77 cents a bushel, and
the farmers got $1.25, the difference being
made uip by the people of Canada, through
a subsidy. The millers made the wheat
into flour, which was supplied to the people
of Canada cheaply, in order to keep down
the cost of living. So the wheat growers
subsidized the people at large to the extent

MARCH 20, 1951
of the difference between $1.25 and $1.55,
until such time as the price was finally raised
to $1.55 and the subsidy was increased
accordingly. The loss incurred by the farmers
in this way is reported to have been $48
million, and if you add that to the $330 million you find the total amount that the
producers lost under the agreement during
the first two years.
Now let me go a little further and show
what happened. As has been explained, the
agreement required that in determining the
price for the second two years the governments of Canada and of the United Kingdom were to have regard to what had happened in the first two years. Well, the government of Canadia surely knew by that
time-and if it did not, it was not because
we had not told it-that in the first two
years the produicers had suffered a big loss.
Yet, so far as I can find out, the government
fixed this price of $2 a bushel for the crops
of 1948 and 1949 without any reference of the
question ta the western wheat growers.
Therefore, the government now has a responsibility to make up to the wheat -growers the
loss that they suffered under the agreement
in the first two years. So I have no scruples
whatever in accepting the eight cents and a
fraction per bushel that is proposed to be
paid to me as a wheat grower.
Hon. Mr. Pirie: Chicken feed.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Sa far as I am concerned, it really does not amount to anything
worth mentioning, because my loss is tremendous. I could give the bouse sorne idea
of that by stating the number of bushels that
were grown by me and by men who worked
f or me on the land that I am interested in,
but I will ýnot go into that. I repeat, though,
that my loss is tremendous. Unlike the
senator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner),
I will not refrain from voting when this
question comes before us. I think that it is
my right and my responsibility to vote, and
I intend to vote.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: May I ask my honourable friend a question? The position he
now takes is consistent with that which he
took in the beginning. He said he was
appointed to represent the wheat growers of
Saskatchewan, so he represents a large number of people. Did 'any of thern try to dissuade him from voting for the agreement at
the time it was put into effect?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Well, honourable senators, the farmers were not consulted at all
with regard to this agreement. It is true that
the heads of the pools in the three prairie
provinces-the pool in Saskatchewan is called
the Saskatchewan Co-operative Producers

Limited-pretended to represent the farmers
in western Canada. But I say they do not
represent the farmers; and I do not think
the farmers knew they were getting into this
agreement.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: They represent 50 per
cent of them.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I have been a member
of the pool in Saskatchewan since its beginning and have marketed many thousands of
bushels through it, but I did not hear of this
agreement until after it was signed and we
were delivering wheat under it to Great
Britain. In those circumstances what could
we do but ratify it?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: May I be permitted to
ask a question?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: As I understand the setup, there is a wheat pool in each of the three
prairie provinces, officers are elected to these
bodies by the wheat growers and meetings
are held periodically. Is that correct?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: The directors are voted
on by the members of the organizations.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Have any of those
people who agreed to the signing of the agreement with Great Britain been dismissed from
office by the wheat growers?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Not one of them.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I cannot answer that
question definitely, but I know that the director from our district was defeated in the last
election. Whether he was defeated because
of that or not, I cannot say.
Hon. Mr. Duff: I dislike interrupting my
friend, but would he be good enough to tell
me, as an ordinary person trying to gain a
little knowledge, what would have happened
if this agreement had not been entered into
and wheat had been sold on the open market?
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: I think I would have
sold most of my wheat for about $3 a bushel,
instead of $1.55. And just on that point, I
want to say that we did not get either the full
$1.55 or the $2 paid by Britain. These prices
were f.o.b. Fort William, Port Arthur, Fort
Churchill and Vancouver. About 18 cents a
bushel was taken off for handling and freight
charges. Further, I should add that the prices
that I have mentioned apply to No. 1
Northern. But we do not always sell that
grade; we have grades 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and
feed. For instance, this year we have grown
more feed wheat than any other kind, and the
18 cents will still apply to that grade because
the price is f.o.b. Fort William.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Duff: Do I understand that if this
agreement had not been entered into the
Canadian public would have had to pay $3
a bushel?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I think that is the price
they would have paid.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Then what would have
become of all the wheat we had? Certainly,
we could not have eaten it all ourselves.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: The answer is that
wheat was in short supply, and there was a
market for every bushel we could possibly
grow. That is why I say the price would
have been up.

Hon. Mr. Duff: Then we have a crazy
government in power, that is true.
An Hon. Senator: Order!
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: As I said previously,
the price has always been up under conditions
of this kind.
I rose this afternoon only to agree with
the honourable senator from Provencher
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) in the remarks he made
a few moments ago. I just want to point
out that this is a responsibility of the government. They fixed the price with Great
Britain in 1948, and they fixed it again in
1949, and in neither of those years did they
consult the farmers. Therefore, I say the
government is responsible and should pay
the loss.
Hon. Gray Turgeon: Honourable senators
I had not intended to speak this afternoon,
but as I will be unavoidably absent from the
chamber tomorrow I want to say that if I
were here I would vote for the appropriation
bill under which this $65 million is to be
paid.
While I am on my feet, may I say a few
words regarding the fundamental principles
behind such a transaction? I am strongly
of the opinion that the upper chamber of
parliament would make a mistake if it turned
down this item in the estimates, which has
already been passed by the lower house,
where there is a particular responsibility
upon the members regarding items of taxation and the spending of public funds. I
recall that when this question was before us
in 1947, the bill which was presented to us
had practically nothing to do, directly, with
the wheat agreement between Canada and
the United Kingdom. That agreement had
already been signed and the governments
were committed to it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Secondly, I remember
that I took the liberty of suggesting-and
because I was new in this chamber I did not

press my point-that the Senate should deal
with this particular phase of the wheat
question in Committee of the Whole, and in
that way discuss the general principles
involved in the agreement that had been
executed. I further suggested that this chamber should set up a committee for the purpose
of discussing everything related to the
marketing of wheat and coarse grains. I
made those suggestions in the hope that, if
such a study were undertaken, we would
strongly recommend that in the future the
government should keep out of trading in this
way. I am opposed to government trading.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: I took the liberty of
saying at that time that whenever such an
enterprise was entered into by the government-and I admit that there may be such
occasions-it should be subject to the same
rate of tax and other charges as enterprises of
a private nature operating in similar
circumstances. I was hopeful in 1947 that
the Senate would be instrumental in avoiding
participation by the government in such
trading in the future.
The question has been raised today as to
the Senate's responsibility in agreeing tofor we are not proposing-this suggested
payment of $65 million. I have already
pointed out that this measure has been agreed
to by the other house, which has a singular
responsibility regarding money matters, and
I assume that the government has made a
complete study of the whole matter.
I want to draw the attention of the house
to the serious fact that the proposed payment
will be made to people in the three prairie
provinces, particularly in Saskatchewan
where, as the honourable gentleman who sits
to my right (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) knows, wheat
represents by far the largest source of
revenue. There is very little manufacturing,
mining or oil drilling done in that province.
Thus, the revenue from the production of
wheat is the very lifeblood of the province.
Regardless of whether the government itself
was at fault in making this agreement, or
acted on poor advice, the family life and the
standard of living in the three prairie
provinces must be properly maintained by
means of compensation under this agreement.
I therefore suggest that this chamber
should accept the recommendation and vote
for the measure. It is not one originated by
ourselves; it comes to us from the other body
of parliament, to which it was presented by
the government after those concerned had
made a thorough study of the subject. If I
could be present, I would vote for it, but as

MARCH 20. 1951
it is impossible for me to be here tomorrow,
I have taken the opportunity of saying these
few words today.
In closing, I would record my belief that
the Senate, if it gives approval to this legislation, will take the greatest step it yet has
taken to make certain that state interference
with the industrial and productive life of
Canada shall be kept to a minimum. The
admission of default will of itself do much
to discourage action to the detriment of the
free individual life of the country.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, I was unavoidably detained, and
so did not have the advantage of hearing
all the speeches that have been made on
this subject; but I understand that, while the
bill before us does not commit us one way
or the other as to payment of the $65 million,
the present occasion has been used for a
discussion of that question. The real vote
on this issue will take place when the estimates arrive; but as, by common consent, we
seem to be discussing now the principle of
the matter, I have something to say.
My honourable friend the senator from
Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon) has just told us
that we should approve the vote because it
has been passed in the other place.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Not solely because of
that.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That, at all events, was
the main argument; and I was going to ask
him, if that is the case, what is this chamber
for?
Hon. Mr. Duff: That is the point.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Surely we are entitled
to use our own judgment in this regard. If
we are to lean upon the wisdom of the
other house, why keep ourselves in existence
at all?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: If the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck)
or any other honourable senator understood
me to say that that was the sole reason for
my vote, I expressed myself very poorly.
My statement, which was purely incidental,
was that the estimates were not created by
the Senate, and that they had already
received consideration in the place from
whence they have come. My conviction of
the good effect this provision will have on
the family life of some of our provinces was
my main reason for suggesting that we
support it. Either I expressed myself poorly,
or the honourable senator badly understood me.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I will accept the responsibility of saying that I badly understood the
honourable senator. There is no longer any

question about it. I understand that he
advances as one of the reasons why we should
pass this proposal the fact that it has been
approved in another place. My answer is
that we should judge the issue on its own
merits and not according to the judgment
of other men in other places, and that we
should approach it without regard to what
took place in another situation; otherwise
we might as well surrender at once.
We have been talking at some length about
the function of this house, and how it may
at times perform a great service to the people
of Canada by the exercise of a judgment
independent of the popular house. It seems
to me that this is one of the occasions when
we should exercise the very best of good
judgment, the best we have, and that this
moment presents us with a golden opportunity to impress upon the people of the
dominion the advantage of having a Senate
where there is sober second thought.
My friend's reference to the family life of
his province is a justifiable one. Sixty-five
million dollars is not to be sneezed at by
the western provinces, and I have no doubt
that British Columbia's share of the vote
would have some effect on the family life
of my friend's province. But, honourable
senators, I come from another province, Ontario; and I would point out that there are
many families also in that province and
Quebec and in other provinces, and that
the voting of $65 million in addition to other
taxes may influence the family life in these
provinces as well. So the family life argument can be said to cut both ways. The
payment of this sum may help 'families who
reside in the West, but a $65 million addition
to the taxes of the other provinces will also
have its effects upon the families who live
there.
The honourable senator from Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) holds the government
entirely responsible for this obligation. Well,
I sat in the House of Commons when this
proposal was originally made, and I heard the
Minister of Agriculture lay the matter before
the house. I vividly remember him saying
that if the price of wheat went up his name
would be "mud" in this dominion,-or words
very nearly to that effect: I believe he used
that expression.
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: It is, right now.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: At all events, in proposing such a measure he was taking a serious
personal responsibility, but he justified it on
the ground that it was asked for by the agricultural interests of the country; that the one
thing which was required by the farmers at
that time was to have an assured price, so
that they might make their investment in

SENATE

money and in labour in the raising of the
crops in the West-he was referring particularly to the West-with some assurance that
there would be a price commensurate with
their outlay. The minister gave us the
roundest assurance that the measure was
asked for at that time by the farmers of
Canada, and I think he was right. It accords
with my memory and my knowledge. Now
my honourable friend from Rosetown (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) says that, if the price went up,
the responsibility is entirely on the government.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I beg your pardon, I did
not say that.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, that is the effect
of what you said.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I said the government

was responsible in setting the price for the
last two years without making provision for
the loss in the first two years.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It all boils down to the
same thing. My honourable friend says that
he might have sold his wheat for $3 per
bushel, instead of $1.55 with deductions.
Under those circumstances he objects to the
agreement, and be wants the government to
pay the entire difference between the two
amounts. He will accept, perhaps, his share
of the $65 million as a compromise. But he
assumes that the government insured the
price-which it did not do.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I am not satisfied with
the $65 million.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the honourable gentleman from Rosetown what would
be the situation had the price of wheat fallen
below $1.55 per bushel? Would the farmers
of the West consider themselves indebted to
the government for what was lost?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: If the world price had
fallen after the price had been fixed for the
last two years of the British contract, would
not the loss which Great Britain would have
suffered been deducted at that time?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I do not suppose so.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: Why not? You have
got to be consistent.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: My proposition is a
plain and fair one. If the government is to
be charged when the world price goes up, is
the farmer not to be charged when the world
price goes down? If the government has to
lose on the one hand, should it not gain on
the other? No one would have suggested,
of course, that the farmers should make up
any deficit had the price gone down. The
interpretation now sought to be placed upon
the agreement would appear to be one of

"Heads I win, tails you lose". Whether it
was heads or tails, the government was
apparently to be the loser.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Might we not have been
called in to make a readjustment of the
contract, in the way my honourable friend
was talking about the other day?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Surely the honourable
gentleman is not serious when making that
statement, because there is no legislation
which provides for the readjustment of farmers' profits on the growinig of wheat. Some
readjustment may be applied, however, to
the industries in my city. In a number of
instances the government stepped in and took
a portion of the profits from industries in
Toronto, but there is no such legislation in
regard to wheat growers. If they make a
profit no one will take any portion of it away
from them, unless it is by their own consent.
Honourable senators, I hope that the admonition so eloquently expressed yesterday by
the senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
will be taken to heart, and that we will
rapidly abandon this business of government
buying and selling, or at least limit it to the
smallest possible degree. Instead of these
commercial transactions being mere incidents between individuals, they are magnified
trem-endously because they are between a
government and, its people or between the
governments of different nations. Disaster is
the only thing that can possibly follow this
sort of policy, and I do hope that this experience will be a lesson to Canadians and that
they will soon return to normal trade customs.
When this agreement was made it was the
government's responsibility to pass the best
legislation it could, and this it did. I do not
hold Mr. Gardiner or the government of that
day responsible for anything that has happened. He is a poor gambler who cries when
he loses and who says nothing when be
wins. The people of Canada took a chance
which they thought was a reasonable one to
take at that time, and it is altogether unjust
and unreasonable to blame anybody for what
has happened.
Honourable senators, I do not know how
I could justify to the industries of urban
Ontario, which I represented in another
place, this payment of $65 million which is
to be paid to the western wheat growers.
How could I justify to the manager of a
Toronto business firm the payment of $65
million to the businessmen of the West
merely 'because they had made a wrong
guess? Would not the immediate answer
be, "We too have been deprived of profits
by government action"? Would there not be
a thousand cases in which Toronto manufacturers could have made more money if

MARCH 20, 1951
the government had not restricted the importation of this commodity or imposed a price
ceiling on that? Could they not claim that
the government should compensate them
because of the effects of certain legislation
passed five or ten years ago? Honourable
senators, we are only at the beginning of
all this.
My honourable friend from Cariboo (Hon.
Mr. Turgeon) has said that if we approve
this vote it will deter the taking of similar
action in the future; but I predict that a
whole avalanche of these sordid claims will
come down on our heads. I have heard flax
growers maintain that governmental legislation has reduced their profits, and I think I
can make just as good a case on their behalf
as my honourable friends can make on behalf
of the wheat growers.
Hon. Mr. Pirie: And what about the potato
growers?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes. Have there not
been occasions when the potato growers
would have made a greater profit had the
action of the government been different from
what it was? I could name many types of
manufacturers, one after another in long
procession, who could present arguments
which would be at least as strong as those
which are now coming from the western
wheat growers.
If this proposal goes
through, I am sure that the granting of
government bonuses will be perpetuated.
Instead of getting away from this sort of
thing we will be getting deeper and deeper
into the mire. I think the Senate has a
magnificent opportunity now to rise in its
might and good judgment and protect the
people of Canada from this sort of outrage
against the public treasury by refusing to
vote for the payment of this money. Such
action would benefit the government of
Canada, and I am sure that it would also be
of lasting benefit to the Senate as well as
to those whom we are here to protect. When
this measure comes before us I for one, even
if I am alone, propose to vote against it.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Salter A. Hayden: Honourable senators, as several members who come from
areas which are not primarily concerned with
the production of wheat, including my two
colleagues from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell
and Hon. Mr. Roebuck), have ventured to
express their opinions in this debate, I have
no hesitation in setting forth my own ideas.
Usually I can find grounds for agreeing with
both these gentlemen from Toronto, but I
cannot findi any grounds for agreeing with
them at this time.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Hayden: I could agree in principle
with some of their statements if they were
lifted out of their context in relation to this
particular issue. For instance, I think the
Senate should always be prepared to show
its independence in dealing with legislation,
but I am not prepared to take a standi against
any government action which I think is fair
and reasonable. If I am, going to assert an
independent viewpoint, I want to be right
when I do so.
Let me tell you why I think the voting of
this money is a fair and reasonable action.
When I rose to speak in the debate of 1947
the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
referred at once to the position that he had
taken-that the agreement was a factual
thing, that the Government of Canada had
signed, it and therefore was committed to it
-and he wished to know if I thought that in
these circumstances we should give the
government the necessary power to carry out
the agreement. My answer was that I did.
Then I went on to be criticalHon. Mr. Dupuis: May I ask my honourable
friend a question? I understood him to say
that the government hadi already engaged
itself to pay any difference between the world
price and the agreed price.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No. If my honourable
friend understood me to say that, he misunderstood me completely.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: That is what the government is doing.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: If the honourable senator will wait just a moment he will see what
conclusion I am coming to. At that time I
was very critical of what I regarded as being
the nationalization of the wheat industry, in
its every phase, because I was against the
government's policy of going into business.
However, I said that in this particular case
the government had committed itself to an
agreement, and while I criticized that action
I thought we had to give the government
the necessary power-but only as much power
as was necessary-to carry out the obligation
to which Canada was committed. If honourable senators care to read what I said they
will see that I was critical of the government's action. The bill then went to committee, and with those reservations I voted
in favour of it when it came out of committee.
Now may I go back to look at the agreement which the government signed a year
before the amendments to the Wheat Board
Act came before parliament. In my opinion
the agreement had the effect of nationalizing the wheat industry at that time.

SENATE
Section 2 (a) of the agreement sets out
that the United Kingdom government is to
pay to the Canadian government these prices
per bushel:
In
year
In
crop

respect of wheat bought and sold in the crop
1948-49, not less than $1.25.
respect of wheat bought and sold in the
year 1949-50, not less than $1.

Those were basic or minimum prices.
Then the agreement went on to provide
this:
The actual prices to be paid for wheat to be
bought and sold within the crop year 1948-49 shall
be negotiated and settled between the United Kingdom government and the Canadian government not
later than the 31st December, 1947.

purpose of justifying the good faith that they
displayed in the government when, as we
are told, they agreed to be parties to delivery
of their wheat and to the nationalization of
the wheat industry for the purposes of this
agreement.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: What about the domestic
situation?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I am only touching on
this other phase, and I think that basically
there is a solid argument along the line I
have indicated.

Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I ask my honourable friend a question?
He has duly
And there was a similar provision that emphasized the compulsory feature of the
the prices for the next year were to be arrangement. Does he really think that the
settled not later than the 31st December, 1948. farmers of Western Canada were compelled
against their will to go into this arrangement,
Then there was this provision:
In determining the prices for these two crop or did the government act as a result of their
years, 1948-49 and 1949-50, the United Kingdom demand?
government will have regard to any difference
between the prices paid under this agreement in
the 1946-47 and 1947-48 crop years and the world
prices for wheat in 1946-47 and 1947-48 crop years.

That was the agreement with the United
Kingdom to which Canada committed itself
and the Canadian people in July 1946. And
when it came to settling the prices for the
last two years, and the price of $2 was agreed
upon, the fact was that the world price of
wheat at all times during the period of the
agreement had been in excess of $2. Now
whatever may have been the reason why
Canada argeed to that price of $2 for the
second two years, Canada, as between itself
and the United Kingdom, must have agreed
that the establishment of that price did have
regard to the difference between the actual
prices paid in the first two years under the
agreement and the world prices which could
have been obtained at that time.
When you start with that situation, the
question resolves itself into this very simple
one: Did the Canadian Government, which
for the purpose of implementing this contract
nationalized the wheat industry and compulsorily took the farmer's wheat away from
him at certain prices, have due regard for
the farmer's rights?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The government is now
proposing to give $65 million to the western
farmers. Obviously this must be on the basis
that while the price of $2 as arranged
between the governments of the United
Kingdom and Canada may have been
considered as having been reached after due
regard was had to the conditions provided for
in the agreement, in fact due regard to those
conditions was not had and the farmers are
entitled to some additional amount for the

Hon. Mr. Hayden: In answer to my
honourable friend all I can say is that the
amendments made to the Wheat Board Act
in 1947 were compulsory in their nature. We
in this Senate, and the elected representatives
of the people of the House of Commons,
voted in favour of those amendments by
which wheat was compulsorily taken from
the farmers in Western Canada. The plan
set up by virtue of those amendments was
such that if a farmer did not want to deliver
his wheat to the board for purposes of
enabling the government to satisfy the terms
of this agreement, the only thing be could
do with it was to feed it to his own stock or
to truck it within the limits of his own
province. He was even barred from delivering
it to elevators unless he got the necessary
permit or licence, and he could only get that
by coming in under this arrangement.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: My honourable friend
has been reading the wheat agreement. Does
he find in that agreement any guarantee by
the Government of Canada that the farmers
would receive the world price or any other
price?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No, the agreement does
not contain anything specifying a guaranteed
price or giving any assurance or insurance
to the farmers.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Was it not understood
that the government would pay to the
farmers what the government itself obtained
on the sale of wheat?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I do not know what the
understanding was.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is in the agreement, is it not?

MARCH 20, 1951
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No. I have read what
the agreement said about prices. What I am
pointing out is that it was not the farmer
who was in the position of going to the
United Kingdom buyer and saying: "The
price which you are going to pay in the last
two years must genuinely take account of
or have regard to the low price which was
paid in the first two years of the agreement".
It was the government of Canada which took
the responsibility of making that representation, and now the government must have
admitted that the price for the second two
years fell short of realizing the full amount
to which the farmers were entitled, for it
is proposing to implement that price. And I
am prepared to accept the government's
policy in that regard.
Hon. Mr. Moraud: May I ask my honourable friend a question? Why should the taxpayers of the province of Ontario pay $65
million to a special class of people, when
other classes of people have also lost through
action of the government?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The taxpayers throughout Canada, not in Ontario alone, are contributing this amount. I think the argument
that one part of the country is putting up
the money to reimburse another is a specious
one. The proposed payment is either
inherently right or inherently wrong. If we
think it is inherently wrong we should, as
the senator from Toronto Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) suggests, rise up and vote against
it. In my view it is inherently right, and
therefore I think it should be paid out of
the revenue of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Do I understand my
friend's argument to be that if any industry
is, as he puts it, nationalized and obliged to
have its products marketed through a state
board, the producers in that industry should
be compensated whenever their goods are
sold at less than the price on the world
market?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No; that is not what I
said. Certainly, it is not what I intended to
say.
Hon. Mr. McLean: How about gold?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I had reference to what
I call state marketing, embarked upon on the
basis on which this agreement operated. In
this case the government made the dealand for the moment let us agree that the
farmers requested them to do so-and there
was this compulsory feature under which
the merchandising was taken over by the
government.
The negotiations were not
carried on as between the farmers and Great
Britain, but between the two governments,
and on that level the terms were agreed upon.

To my mind the neat question now is
whether or not in increasing the price to $2
for the last two years, due regard was had
to the difference between the price for the
first two years and the world price that
existed in those years. I am not in any way
concerned with the emotional or sentimental
side of the picture, or the fact that there may
be many other cases in Canada where this
or that condition existed at some other time.
I say that each case must stand on its own
feet. If the government is wrong as regards
its dealings in potatoes, as the honourable
senator from Victoria-Carleton (Hon. Mr.
Pirie) stated, that is a matter in which there
should be redress. But I am not going to
accept as a basis for my own conclusions the
argument that, because the government was
wrong with regard to its dealings in potatoes,
it must be wrong in its activities in relation
to wheat.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: May I ask the senator
this question? Does he not regard the government as the agent for the wheat growers
in the making of this agreement with Great
Britain?
Hon Mr. Hayden: No. I regard the government as the principal, and that is the whole
basis of my argument. The government did
not consult the farmers; it just set up the
machinery to take the wheat away from the
farmers.
Hon Mr. Campbell: Is my honourable
friend not mistaken in that position, in view
of the fact that the Canadian Wheat Board
Act constitutes the board as the agent for the
growers, the elevator operators and everyone
else concerned?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: My friend has missed
the point of my argument. I repeat: for the
purpose of forming my own opinion, I refuse,
to regard the government as the agent of the
growers. The government enacted legislation,
and by compulsion took away the wheat from
the growers. In other words, they lost
control of it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Do I understand my friend's
argument to be briefly this: That the government made a deal for the sale of wheat over
a period of four years, for the first two years
of which the price was $1.55, and that during
that period the world price was very much
higher? In fact, according to the Minister
of Trade and Commerce, speaking in the
House of Commons at that time, the price
reached $2.36. As I understand my friend, he
has argued that when negotiations for the
prevailing price during the last two years of
the agreement took place the government
should have taken into consideration the substantial loss the farmers suffered in the first

SENATE
two years; further, that the price of $2 was
fixed for the remaining two years to help
compensate for that loss; and finally, that the
proposed payment of $65 million is to compensate for part of that loss suffered by the
farmers.
That is exactly my
Hon. Mr. Hayden:
argument, and I think it must be the view
of the government. As I read the discussioi
which took place in the other house, the government has taken the position that in an
agreement of this kind it had to deal as best
it could with the other party to the agreement.
Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck:

Hon. Mr. Hayden: The Canadian Government got the other party to the agreement
up as high as it could on the price per bushel.
Having reached that maximum, there was
no course open to the government by which
it could compel the other party to agree to
botter terms. Therefore, if there was to be
any implementation, it had to come from the
Canadian Government in its relationship with
the people with whom it was dealing. That
is the basis on which the money was voted.
Hon. Mr. Campbell:
$65 million?

But why is the amount

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question? Seriously, I am
in a fog with regard to his remarks. He read
us a portion of the agreement between the
Canadian Government and the Government of
the United Kingdom, by which the United
Kingdom agreed to have regard to world
prices. Now, is it his contention that the
United Kingdom did not have the regard
which it promised?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Before answering my
friend, may I say that I must be slipping, for
though the senator from Toronto-Trinity and
I do not always agree, I think that each of
us has always understood perfectly what the
other was saying.
Some Hon. Senators:

Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. Hayden: I gather that when my
friend prefaced his remarks by saying that
he was in a bit of fog, he was being a bit
oratorical. He has too much good sense and
intelligence to fail to follow even my imperfeet performance byHon. Mr. Campbell:
Hon. Mr. Hayden:
sentence.

It occurs to meI have not finished my

Hon. Mr. Campbell: -that
perhaps my
friend does not understand what the senator
from Toronto-Trinity has just asked him?
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. Hayden: This seems to be becorning an all-Toronto discussion. I will answer
my friend from Toronto-Trinity, and I do
not need to be prompted by my brother
senator from Toronto. The United Kingdom
entered into an agreement for the last two
years of which the minimum price was to be
$1.25 and $1, and it is obvious that the Government of the United Kingdom, when it
agreed to pay and did pay more, intended
to have some regard to the difference between
the world prices existing in the first two
years and the price which was paid for the
wheat at that time. Thus, the question
ie;olves itself into one of whether the government had sufficient regard for that difference.
There is a volume of opinion, and it is vocal
even in this chamber, that the differences
between $1.25 and $2 as applied to the third
year, and between $1 and $2 as applied to the
fourth year, do not reflect sufficient regard for
the actual differences. The government must
therefore be taking the position that sufficient
regard was not had to the differences that
existed, and I am prepared to accept the
viewpoint of the government in that respect.
In taking on the marketing of the wheat
the government assumed a heavy responsibility, and before it is through it will have
learned not to venture into the wholesale
merchandising of commodities. If a lesson has
been learned, perhaps we are not paying too
much for it.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: I do not wish to interrupt my friend againHon. Mr. Hayden: I am not sure about that.
Hon. Mr. Campbell. -but does he not feel
that if the wheat growers, the pools and the
sponsors of this agreement had any objection
to the price of $2 when that rate was renegotiated, they would have taken objection at
the time?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: But they were not
consulted.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I can offer only a limited
answer to that question. First of all, I have no
kno\Jledge whether the wheat pools, and the
farmers individually or collectively made any
objection; and if objection was taken, I do
not know what form it was in. But I refuse to
believe that the decision of the government to
spend $65 million originated solely within the
intellectual circle of the Cabinet, and that
there was no inspiration from the rank and
file of the farmers and their organizations.
On that ground I say that this proposed payment must be the result of some protests.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I have no apologies to
make for asking questions of my friend

>IARCH 20, 1951
from Toronto, particularly when he is so jollywell able to take care'of himself. So I have
another question along the lines of the one I
have just asked. As I understand the answer
to my previous question, it was that the
United Kingdom government did not have
sufficient regard to world prices. If that is the
position my friend takes, does he also contend that the Government of Canada guaranteed the performance of the agreement by the
United Kingdom, and if it did, is that the
basis upon which he thinks we ought to pay?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Al I can say-some of
it may be repetitious-is that machinery
was provided through the Wheat Board
whereby wheat was compulsorily taken from
the farmers.
The government made the
agreement with the United Kingdom: the
government established the machinery of the
Wheat Board which carried out the agreement. I did not say my opinion was that
the United Kingdom-to use the language of
my honourable friend-did not have "sufficient regard". I said-and this is differentthat the "regard" which the United Kingdom
"had", by supplementing a price which was
to be not less than $1.25 in the third year,
and $1 in the fourth year, might from their
point of view have been sufficient, but that
from the point of view of morality, and from
the viewpoint of the Canadian government,
representing the best interests of the farmers
whose wheat it had compulsorily taken, the
question was: Were the farmers, as they had
not been able to get more than $2 a bushel,
as fully and fairly and adequately compensated as they should have been? Obviously,
the answer of the government must have been
that what it had been able to do was not a
full and fair implementation of the agreement; therefore it is taking this means of
implementing it.
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable senators, owing to my limited knowledge
of both law and wheat, I would have hesitated to say anything had not the leader of
the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) asked me the
very pertinent question why the amount of
$65 million was decided upon. That question
has also been asked elsewhere, and as a
member of the government instrumental in
making the original agreement, I feel that
I must say a word or two by way of defence
and explanation.
As honourable senators
know, I do not profess to be an expert on the
subject of wheat marketing, and there are
other honourable senators who can contribute
far more information about it than I can.
I suspect that the people of the West-and
they are very clear-minded people-wanted
this agreement, and it is my impression that
they are not so disappointed over it as some

honourable senators would have us think.
Now, I can imagine that some of my honourable friends opposite-the leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), the member from
Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner), and the
senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)will make the welkin ring in future, as they
have done already, with this line of argument: "Had the Conservative party been in
power, you farmers would have had $3 for
your wheat instead of $1.55"-or whatever
it happens to be. From the little I know of
the West and its history, I suspect that the
individual farmer-although, like any of us,
he would rather have $3 than $1.25-will say,
"Yes, but I have very vivid recollections of
30-cent wheat. What are you going to do
about that?" The only reply my honourable
friends could make would be, "Well, that is
the law of supply and demand. Be prepared
to tighten your belts. If you get as much as
$3 a bushel now, you must be prepared to
accept 30 cents a bushel if and when the
market falls that low." And I think that the
ordinary man in the West, remembering the
time when a bushel of wheat sold for 30
cents, would prefer some kind of protection
against such a low price, even if it involved
a temporary ceiling of $1 or $1.25. Whether
the method by which this protection was
originally brought about was the best, I am
not in a position to say; but I suggest to my
honourable friends opposite, however strongly
they may urge the avoidance of governmentsponsored agreements in future, that whatever government in time to come may
approach the people of the West on this issue
will not be able to disregard the possibility of
30-cent wheat again.
Hon. Mr. Horner:' May I ask a question?
Is the honourable government leader (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) seriously suggesting that
world conditions today in any way resemble
those in the early thirties? Surely not.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I am not predicting
that these low prices will return, but my
honourable friend is no more a prophet than
I am. He may profit by hindsight. My honourable friend the leader of the opposition
said, in the debate on the Speech from the
Throne, that he knows prices are going to
stay up.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I never said that. Ail I
said about this agreement was, "You are
gambling in wheat, and it is a poor thing ,to
gamble in."
Hon. Mr. Robertson: You are gambling on
the amount of your profits.
As my honourable friené pointed out, the
farmers wanted security. Whether this agreement gave them security or not is a question

SENATE
that I will not discuss at this moment. But
the idea was firmly in the minds of the people
of the West; and I suggest to my honourable
friends opposite that if in due course they
become the government of the day, and then
proceed to tear up agreements and say to
the people of the West, "We have no program whatever to guarantee thait if the price
swings down you won't have to accept 30
cents", they will be in for a tough time.
Hon. Mr. Moraud: Even if that is so, why
should parliament give them $65 million?
Hon. Mr. Roberison: If my honourable
friend will wait, I will answer that. I do
not want to discuss it at the moment. I wish
to refer to the matter of the loss which my
honourable friend has talked about. I suggest that there is -a lot of hocus-pocus
about it.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No doubt there is.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The first point on
which our friends are wrong-how wrong,
I do not know-is that they take the price
actually paid, and the highest price for which,
so far as they can discover, wheat has been
sold anywhere in the world, and subtract
the one figure from the other.
Hon. Mr. Horner: No.

It is the average.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: We are told that on
this basis of reckoning, the farmers were
deprived of $330 million in the first two years
and my honourable
of the agreement;
friends from Rosetown and Blaine Lake have
been mentioned as among those by whom
these sacrifices were borne. I suggest that
the amount of the loss is exaggerated. To
begin with, what evidence is there as to what
the net gain would have been had no contract existed?
In the next place, although the price may
not have been as high as some could have
wished for-most people in business like to
get as much as they can-it was generally
understood to allow a fair profit. If to that
profitable figure could have been added
another $330 million over and above all
expenses, do my honourable friends suggest
that they could at that time, in 1945, appropriate that as their full profit without paying
anything in taxation to the Government of
Canada?
Hon. Mr. Horner: They would have paid
pleity. Don't worry.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Of course my honourable friend would. So when he undertakes to say that fhe farmers' losses approximate that figure, there is the second point
on which he is at fault. Of course he would

pay. The excess profits tax in business was
in effect in 1946. Everybody else was subject
to taxation.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: The excess profits tax
did not apply to farmers.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: If in actual fact it
did not, morally it did. In any event the
farmer pays personal income tax; and I suggest that, if the proportion of clear profit was
as high as seems to be indicated, his payments
would be considerable. Hardly any of us
were subject to a tax rate of less than 50
per cent.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I did not come under
the category of a farmer, so I paid.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: And so you should
have, just like the rest of us; and you should
have been, glad to pay. Why not? These
profits did not

result from

our

particular

efforts, they resulted from the trials and

tribulations of the world, from the hunger of
a starving people. Why should anybody who
was able to make a profit not have paid taxes?
Hon. Mr. Horner: As my honourable friend
seems to have some knowledge of business,
I wouldi like to ask him whether the world
price might have risen higher had it not
been for this agreement? Does he not think
that this great bulk of Canadian wheat which
was being sold at a price below the price on
the world market hadi the effect of keeping
the world price down?

Hon. Mr. Robertson: First of all I suggest
that the figure of $330 million-which has
been suggested by my honourable friendwould immediately be slashed by whatever
amount they were out in their calculations.
Then a further slash of somewhere between
50 and, 75 per cent for taxes due the government would again reduce the amount. If my
honourable friends feel that they had a right
to take the highest price they could get for
their products on the world market, surely
every other Canadian should have had the
sarne right.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Take, for instance, the
steel industry.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Did not othersHon. Mr. Robertson: I did not interrupt
the honourable gentleman when he was
speaking. If he wants to ask me a questionHon. Mr. Horner: I just wanted to say this.
Did not others do that?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I am telling my
honourable friend that the prices of other
Canadian products were controlled. and he
knows this as well as I do.

MARCH 20, 1951
A third deduction from the figure of $330
million would be the costs, which would rise
in proportion to the higher gross returns of
other producers. I am prepared to say that
from the point of view of the western farmers
themselves, this agreement does not begin to
look as bad as my friends opposite would have
us believe. What they have said as ta their
net loss has been grossly exaggerated. They
can build it up as much as they like. Anyone
who is in business can sit down and "cry
over the piano" about the money he would
have made if there had, been no control on
the price of his particular product. When the
honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig)
gave his graphie description yesterday about
the losses the wheat growers have suffered,
I could just picture the senators from Blaine
Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) and Rosetown (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) "crying over their pianos".
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: They were tin whistles,
not pianos.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I would never do that.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I did it in the case
of my own business.
Now, honourable senators, I want to read
from a statement made by the Honourable
Minister of Trade and Commerce in another
place on March 12 when dealing with this
whole question. He pointed out the importance to this country of the United KingdomCanada Wheat Agreement during the period
from 1947 to 1949. He referred to the grave
danger of losing the British wheat market
entirely because of that country's inability
to make payments, and he stressed the fact
that the United States government respected
the United Kingdom-Canada agreement and
did not demand that Marshall Aid funds to
Britain be used to purchase American wheat
despite the fact that large stocks of wheat
were aocumulating in the United States.
The Honourable Minister of Trade and
Commerce had this to say:
From 1947 to 1949 the United States permitted
Marshall aid funds to be used for the purchase of
Canadian wheat, and though large stocks of wheat
were accumulating in the United States that government respected the United Kingdom-Canada agreement and did not demand that the Marshall aid
funds be used to purchase United States wheat
instead of Canadian wheat. However, before the
1949 crop came on the market United States wheat
was declared in surplus supply, which automatically
stopped the use of Marshall aid funds to buy Canadian wheat. Just think of the importance of that
Because of the
agreement during those years.
agreement, the United States paid money to Canada
for supplying wheat to Britain, instead of giving
away her own surplus wheat to England, ai a time
when the surplus in the United States was becoming
burdensome. Those who are making up the equation to show losses might very well put in that
intangible for a very considerable price indeed.
Passing on now to the 1948-49 crop year, which
was the third year of the contract, producers will

receive $1.83 for deliveries of 293 million bushels.
Throughout this crop year the payment difficulties
of the United Kingdom continued acute. To put it
bluntly what we faced here in Canada was the very
real possibility that the United States would drive
Canadian wheat out of our traditional markets.
This actually occurred in the European markets
with the exception of the United Kingdom, and the
fact is that the Canada-United Kingdom wheat
agreement was of the greatest value at this time in
retaining our position in the United Kingdom
market. As a matter of fact we have a very seroius
problem ahead of us in regaining markets in continental Europe which are now being supplied by
the United States under Marshall aid. It was for
that reason the government sent a mission to Europe
last year for the express purpose of finding out how
to regain a foothold in some of those markets.
What the Canada-United Kingdom wheat agreement
actually accomplished was to enable us to hold our
position in the United Kingdom market. The United
States government respected the agreement, and in
fact went so far as to provide a very substantial
amount of United States dollars, $175 million to be
exact, which enabled the United Kingdom to finance
her wheat purchases from the 1949 wheat crop
under the agreement. This amount was provided
as the result of negotiations which took place in
Washington early in September, 1949.

A little further on the Minister had this
to say:
In weighing the losses under the agreement, let
them weigh in the $175 million supplied by the government in the United States to pay Canada for
wheat shipped to Britain, which it is very probable
Britain could not have bought without that assistance. Incidentally that assistance was barred under
the strict terms of the Marshall aid plan.
Mr. Speaker, I can well imagine how the members
of the opposition would have denounced the government if Canada had been pushed out of the
United Kigdom market in 1948-49 and 1949-50 by
Marshall aid wheat. I can testify personally, for I
took part in the negotiations, that such a result most
certainly would have occurred without the Britsih
Wheat Agreement.

I want to tell my honourable friends
opposite that I have always felt that one of
the most fundamental mistakes the wheat
growers made was ta take the last cent they
could get for their wheat and force people to
use other commodities thereby endangering
their own markets for the future. I think this
agreement was a blessing in disguise because
the market may not always be booming.
I will close by quoting the Prime Minister.
In reply to the question "Why $65 million?"
he said:
Now, why $65 million? From the start it had
been clearly understood there could not be any
mathematical calculation of the consequence of
this "have regard to" clause. I remind honourable
members of the statement made by the then Prime
Minister when the price was set for the third year
of the contract: I refer to the public statement
that was made at that time. He said:
"Having in mind the magnitude of the agreement
and the long-term security which it provides, a
precise arithmetical calculation of the difference in
price was not suggested."
That has been the position from the start, that
there could not be any mathematical calculation
of something expressed in the terms used in this
agreement.

SENATE
When this decision was made and accepted by
the government of Canada as being the position
taken, and the position they were entitled to take,
in the United Kingdom, there was still $65 million
that had not been drawn from the credit provided
by the agreed loan of $1,250 million.
Had the
government of the United Kingdom seen fit to draw
that amount of $65 million and use it as a settlement of anything legitimately or properly excepted
under the "have regard to" clause, the government
of Canada would not have felt required to do anything more, and would have been quite content
to say that everything that could reasonably be
expected as a consequence of the "have regard to"
clause had been discharged by that payment . . .
. . . Without attempting to make any mathematical calculation, but taking a rough approximation of what could be regarded as just and fair,
the Canadian government decided to recommend
to parliament that a sum equal to the $65 million
be put into the pool because that placed no heavier
burden on the production of this year than would
have been placed upon it by the drawing and use
for other purposes of the available $65 million of
the credit. There was no other calculation made
or attempted.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators, I
should like to correct a statement I made a
few moments ago. I said that the excess
profits tax did not apply to farmers but it did.
I am sorry that I made the statement; I realized at once that it was wrong.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROL BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Saller A. Hayden moved the second
reading of Bill 147, an Act to amend the
Foreign Exchange Control Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
very simple in its terms. It is intended
merely to extend the Foreign Exchange Control Act for a further period, which would
end sixty days after the commencement of
the first session of parliament commencing
in the year 1953. In other words, the bill
would extend the duration of the present Act
for a period of roughly two years.
This is the second occasion upon which we
have been asked to extend the life of this
legislation. The original Act was assented to
in 1946, the bill having been passed by this
chamber at the end of August that year.
Among the many amendments which the
Senate made to the bill was one providing
for a limitation of the life of the Act to
sixty days after the commencement of the
first session of parliament commencing in
the year 1949. Then in 1949 we extended
the duration of the Act for a period which
would bring about its expiry on about the 31st
of the present month, unless this bill were
passed in the meantime.
The government requests an extension at
this time because of the present state of the
world and because of the impact which the

program of military preparedness in Canada
and its allied countries may have upon our
economy and theirs. In other words, the
extension is sought because the government
wishes to be able to take whatever action it
may deem necessary in order to cope with
possible economic and financial pressures. I
say frankly that if the bill had come before
us at a time when there was not an extraordinary situation such as now exists it
might have met with a very rough reception.
But already both houses of parliament of this
country, which takes second place to none in
its love of freedom, have passed two measures
committing us to a program of military
preparedness which we consider to be necessary for our national defence. One of these
measures set up the Department of Defence
Production and gave it broad and rather
unusual powers. The other measure, the
Emergency Powers Bill, incorporated all but
two of the provisions of the War Measures
Act, which provisions, under the terms of
that Act, could have been invoked by proclamation of the Governor in Council, if the
government had felt the situation warranted

that course.
Having subscribed to the principle that
there is a situation of emergency in Canada,
and to the principle under which the Department of Defence Production is being set up
to aid in the military preparedness of ourselves and our allies, we do not have to take
much of a step to say further that as part
and parcel of our over-all program of military
preparedness we must have some organization
to deal with the question of foreign exchange
control.
If we were to set about writing a new
Foreign Exchange Control Act today we
might or might not embody in it the broad
and arbitrary powers and prohibitions contained in the present Act. But those powers
and prohibitions are in that Act, and so are
part of the law of the land; and in any case,
they could be re-enacted as regulations under
the provisions of the Emergency Powers Act.
In these circumstances, notwithstanding the
well-known position which I believe every
member of this house bas taken from time to
time with relation to controls, I am prepared
to support this bill for the extension of the
life of the Foreign Exchange Control Act. No
matter how much we may disagree on other
questions, we are all of the one mind on the
general principle that controls should not be
continued for one minute longer or made by
the slightest fraction broader in scope than
is necessary in the interests of our country.

I had planned, honourable senators, to say
much more about this measure, but I concluded that the simple question was: Should
the statute be extended for a further term of
two years or not? It occurred, to me that,
at a time when we are approving a national
program of defence preparedness and are
setting up a statute for the mobilization of
industry with the broadest possible emergency powers in relation to all phases of our
economic life, we could not properly make a
distinction and leave out foreign exchange.
I regard the subject of foreign exchange
control as being so closely knit with the rest
of our emergency program that it must be
part and parcel of it. With that in mind, I
have refrained from going into a lot of
detail.

Exchange Control Board has been in operation I have not found, either from personal

my opinion Canada has very fine public
servants, and the men who have operated
this particular board have been moderate,
polite, decent and considerate; and in the
operation of the board Canada has given as
little cause for objection as one could expect
from legislation of this kind.
But I dislike the legislation, not only
because it exercises control, but because it
has been detrimental to the interests of
Canada ever since it was enacted. It interferes with the flow of the lifeblood of our
country, namely, foreign exchange, by bossing
people around in an indirect rather than a
direct way.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Quite right.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It is not necessary to
say that you cannot buy a certain commodity
if you have already been denied the money
with which to pay for it. I see no good in
this board. During the war it made a
monopoly
of
foreign
exchange,
taking
foreign currencies from the individual in
exchange for Canada's promise to pay. And so
there was accumulated in the government
coffers at the end of the war something like
$12 billion. In the year and a half that followed the war about a billion of those dollars
went down the sink, and we are poorer to at
least that extent by reason of the operations
of this board. There have been losses all
along the line in the trading communities
as a result of miserable interference by the
board in matters of exchange. I have yet to
hear an argument that convinces me that
we have gained any advantage by reason of
this body, and I would like to sec the end
of it.
My friend from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden)
can of course justify the extension by citing
an emergency of some kind. If we consent
te a two-year extension at this time because
of an emergency, we are sure to meet the
same argument when this legislation expires.
I shall be very much astonished if the fertileminded gentlemen who are operating this
board cannot always find that an emergency
exists. We may suppose that an excuse will
never be lacking for extending this act, at
least so long as we will accept it. At the
present time a real emergency exists, but I
do not think that it is sufficient to justify the
continuance of this legislation. I would like
to see it abolished. I have no doubt that the
house will support it, but personally I intend
to oppose it.

This is brought
about by the property and residence qualifications

The division of the dominion into senatorial
districts differentiates the two Upper Houses. The
senators first of all represent their provinces or
districts and their first duty is to them. Then the
"swamping power" was taken away for the express
purpose of making the Senate independent of the
House of Commons as a condition precedent to
confederation.

contingencies the delegates from those provinces

to an elective House.

Page 10:
At page 89, Mr. George Brown says: "But honourable gentlemen must see that the limitation
of the numbers in the upper house lies at the base
of the whole compact on which this scheme rests."
He went on to say that power to increase the
number would sweep away the whole protection
they had from the lower house. He shows further
that the Senate though nominated is representative.
At page 90, he says, "The desire was to render
the Upper House a thoroughly independent bodyone that would be in the best position to canvass
dispassionately the measures of this house and
stand up for the public interests in opposition to

effect of abolishing the swamping power was to
make the Senate entirely independent."

Page 11:
"The federal state is the most complex and
ingenious of modern political communities and its
upper chamber usually exhibits one aspect of that
ingenuity. One principle is, however, common in
all such formations. The federation is based on a
union of individuals, and of states, and that union
is expressed in the constitution of the two chambers. The lower one represents the rights and
powers of the people-the total numerical majority.
The upper chamber represents the rights and
powers of the states in their separate and individual
capacity. Population has always full representation
in the lower chamber."

On page 9:
Sir John Macdonald says at page 29, Vol. 1.
"We were forced to devise a system of union in
which the separate provincial organizations would
be in some degree preserved."
At page 38, column 1, speaking of the limitation
of the number of Senators, Sir John said, "To the
upper house is to be confided the protection of
sectional interests: therefore it is that the three
great divisions are there equally represented
for the purpose of defending such interests
against majorities in the Assembly" and further
on he says, "For the same reason each State
of the American Union sends its two best men to
represent it in the Senate".

On page 11:
To the smaller States on the other hand, this
principle was the condition precedent, the "sheet

anchor" of their rights and liberties. And, once
asserted, it is fundamental and (except in unimaginable conditions) unalterable.

On page 13 Eugene Lafleur and Aime
Geoffrion stated:
To those reasons might be added this further
consideration that there is very little analogy
between the Lords and the Senate. The Lords
represent themselves, the Senate represents the
provinces.

Honourable senators, these are my reasons
for saying that the most important duty of

the Senate is the protection of provincial
rights.
Now let us see what the senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) says. He
always makes good speeches. He is a great
lawyer, and has a vast experience in public
affairs. I was at one time reproached for
admiring him too much and for saying that
I admired him. Well, I do admire him, and
it gives me pleasure to say so. But this has
not prevented me in the past from differing
with his opinion, and I have never hesitated
to oppose his views. In his address before
the Senate on February 19, he said, as
reported at page 114 of Hansard:
Sir John A. Macdonald-and there is not a
senator in this house who does not look back with
pride and admiration to that great leader in Canadian affairs-said this: "There would be no use
of an upper house if it did not exercise, when it
thought proper, the right of opposing or amending
or postponing the legislation of the lower house. It
must be an independent house, having a free
action of its own, for it is only valuable as being
a regulating body calmly considering the legislation
initiated by the popular branch and preventing
any hasty or ill-considered legislation which will
come from that body."

He also quoted this statement by Sir John:
The Senate was to be the sober second thought
in legislation.

Then our colleague went on to say:
In addition to the world-wide, or at least Britishwide, views of the necessity of a second chamber,
there were special reasons applicable to Canada. As
I have just stated, the Fathers of Confederation
recognized these general principles. They generally
recognized that a truc democracy had to have
this balance-wheel to give it the full effect of a
government of the people, by the people and for
the people. And Canada had special reasons for
insisting upon a second chamber. The first was the
need of such a chamber as a guardian of provincial
rights.

A little further on the honourable gentle-

man

quoted what

he described as "these

words of a great Liberal":
On no other condition could we have advanced
a step.

The honourable senator continued:
We can read those solemn words and appreciate
that but for the Senate there would not be this
great Canadian nation of today. No man in Canada
can fail to say with heart-felt emphasis, Thank
God for the Canadian Senate.

MARCH 21, 1951

He then offered this quotation from Sir
Alexander Campbell:
The main reason was to give each of the provinces
adequate security for the protection of its local
interests that protection which it was feared
would not be found in a lower house, where the
representation was based upon numbers only, as
would be the case in the general assembly. It was
determined that in one branch there would be a
fixed number of members nominated by the Crown,
to enable it to act as a counterpoise to the branch
in which the principle of representation according
to population would be recognized.

The senator from Vancouver South went
on to say:
Sir George Ross, after analyzing these statements and many others that appear in his book,
follows with this unchallenged conclusion:
"It is quite evident, from the preceding quotations that the Senate of Canada was intended to
be in a special sense the guardian of provincial
rights."

Honourable senators, if our colleague from

Vancouver South were in his seat I should
possibly quote further from his address. But
is that necessary? Do we not find in his own
word's and in his citations exactly what I have
contended and am now repeating, that among
its other duties and powers the Sen'ate's most
important duty is to protect provincial rights?
In the past I have dealt with other matters
from the point of view of this duty to protect
provincial rights. When the Unemployment
Insurance Act was before the Senate I stated
that the consent of the provinces to the
passage of that legislation hadt not been
properly and legally given. And last session
this house unanimously approved my resolution that consent of a province means consent
of its legislature.
I also stated that the Family Allowances
Act was ultra vires of parliament because it
was an encroachment on provincial rights.
What do we find now? In a debate in the
other house on February 22 this year, as
reported at page 581 of the House of Commons
Hansard, the Honourable Paul Martin,
Minister of National Health and Welfare,
cited paragraph 93 of the British North
America Act:
In and for each province the legislature may
exclusively make laws in relation to education,
subject and according to the following provisions-

Mr. Martin then went on to say, as reported
at page 581 of the House of Commons
Hansard:
The ensuing provisions have no relation to the
subject under discussion. The important thing is
that not only have the provinces been given
jurisdiction in this matter; the word "exclusively"
is used, and some significance must be attached to
the inclusion of that word in the section, for it is
not widely or generally used throughout most of
the other sections of the Act. This clearly indicates
that the intention was, as in fact we know it still
is, that education was and, as we all believe, should
be the domain of the provinces. We know the

80713-21J

national unity of this country is predicated in very
large measure upon the preservation of that constitutional fact; and any interference with it I
submit would greatly impede the cause of education instead of furthering it.

Is it not strange that the federal government cannot give a subsidy for educational
purposes because it would be an encroachment
on provincial rights, although that government pays out more than $300 million yearly
under the Family Allowances Act, every
clause of which encroaches on provincial
rights?
When speaking on the resolution to secure
for this country the right to amend its constitution, I stated that before adopting the
resolution we should consult the provinces;
that a conference between the federal and
provincial governments was to be held in the
near future and no harm would be done by
waiting until after that conference had taken
place. The resolution was adoptedi, and we
securedi the right to amend our constitution.
But in his excellent speech in the present
debate the senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert) pointed out that, as reported in the
proceedings of that federal-provincial conference, the Prime Minister "gave definite
undertakings" to the provincial premiers "that
the application of the B.N.A. Act (1949) No. 2
would be held in abeyance pending the production by the provinces of a better method
of amending constitution". Was I wrong in
my view of the matter?
Honourable senators, I will not review all
the speeches made in the debate so far.
There have been some suggestions which
really have nothing to support them. For
instance, an elected Senate was proposed.
Apparently no one is really for that. There
is a good reason why that is so: the Senate
was deliberately created an appointive rather
than an elective body. It must not be forgotten that the Fathers of Confederation, who
decided once and for ever that the Senate
would not be elected, had had experience
of both an elected and an appointed upper
chamber.
Another suggestion has been abolition of
the life tenure of senatorial office. Do those
who suggest this not realize that life tenure
was established in order to make the Senate
absolutely independent, free frosn any coercion, or even persuasion? By way of comment on the proposal that senators should
retire at seventy-five, I wish to refer to one
of our members who reached that age on the
14th of this month, the senator from Bedford
(Hon. Mr. Nicol). Considering his experience
as a lawyer, a member of the Legislative
Assembly of Quebec, a minister in the government of that province, a legislative councillor, President of the Legislative Council,

SENATE
the owner and publisher of newspapers, the
president of a number of trust companies,
a director of banks, and so on, do you not
think that it would be a crime against the
Senate and Canada to deprive this chamber
of the advice, knowledge, wisdom and experience of this man just because he is seventyfive years old?

Hon. Mr. David: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Marcoite: Honourable senators
that would be criminal. The senator from
Bedford (Hon. Mr. Nicol) is not the only one
in that position. Check the list, and you
will learn what the Senate will lose if in two
or three years there are put on retirement
a dozen senators who will have reached the
famous seventy-five-year lirnit.
No, you should be kind to those of us who
have the misfortune of being sick or ailing.
Such men are not numerous, and it should
be remembered that for many years they
gave the country the best that was in them.
They did not come here for money; the
indemnity was not large enough to attract
them. They just responded to the command
to be here. Are you going to dismiss them
today?
I have already spoken too long; but may I
be permitted to refer to the statement made
in the address of the senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert), that the conferences
between the federal government and the provinces are not over, and it is necessary once
more to cover this ground of our responsibility to the provinces. I should like to
answer the critics who say that times have
changed, but it is not necessary to do so at
the present. Other opportunities will come,
and if I am still here I will then take more
time to answer the questions.
I will conclude this long address by reading
a ýparagraph from a letter written to me by
the young and talented senator who left us
so unexpectedly. I refer to the late Senator
Bench. These are his words:
I respectfully think that it will take more than a
few speeches to raise the present level of public
opinion of the Senate. However, I am equally sure
that, should we take on a few pieces of work of a
constructive nature in the national interest, the
Canadian people would soon become conscious of
the value of this branch of our parliament. In
giving a few talks of the character of that represented by the pamphlet which you have received,
I have discovered that there is a woeful ignorance
on the part of our people of the real purpose and
function of the Senate. In every case I have found
a very interested and acquisitive audience. The
people want to know, and it is our own fault if we
do not inform them.

It has been my personal experience, and
I am sure that of my honourable colleagues,
that because of a lack of publicity there is a

consequent lack of knowledge of our duties,

our powers and our activities, and of the
reasons for the existence of the Senate.
May I suggest to our two honourable
leaders that they should join with those
members of this house who are owners or
publishers of newspapers, or special writers,
and form a committee to bring before the
public the much needed publicity of the
Senate. All large corporations have today
what are known as public relations men.
Why does not the Senate have them?
Does the Senate wish for more work to do?
This question was intelligently elaborated on
by the senator from Vancouver South (Hon.
Mr. Farris). Is our work just what we do here,
or does it not also include what we do outside of this chamber? I would not go as
far as my friend the honourable senator
from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) in his
remarks on the salaries paid our two leaders,
because I want men who are doing special
work to be adequately paid. But what is
their special work, if it is not the finding
of things for the Senate to do, such as
researches, inquiries and investigations for
the good of the country, quite apart from its
legislative duties.
Do not make the mistake which has been
made here so often. The Senate was not
created to initiate, but rather to revise, correject legislation
rect, amend and even
initiated by the one body elected by the
public. No matter what you do or how you
do i:, you will Le criticized. It has been said
that you cannot please everyone and your
mother-in-law. This applies to all mankind.
Everyone is criticizing the Senate, but it is
worthy of note that almost every club,
society and association has created it own
senate. Every member wants to be a senator
and, by parenthesis, this abuse of our title
should be stopped.
Honourable senators, do not worry about
the fate of this chamber. The men who by
reason of their past experience were so
wise, have made of the Senate a kind of
Gibraltar which will survive all attacks. Just
remain what you are, what your predecessors
have been, what your successors will be:
wise, patient men of goodwill, always ready
to obey the command which brought you
here, anxious to co-operate for the public
good, accepting the duties cast upon you, and
even more at the requests of your leaders.
Just do that and you will be as happy as I
wish you to be.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Cairine R. Wilson: Honourable senators, as the only person in this chamber at

MARCH 21, 1951
the moment who could possibly be a motherin-law, I should perhaps be a little more
nervous about addressing this honourable
body than I am.
When my leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson) proposed this extremely mild resolution, it never
occurred to me that it would bring forth so
many speeches or engender as much heated
discussion as it has. We have learned much
from the very fine addresses to which we
have listened about the history of the Senate,
its duties and its accomplishments over the
years.
I must express my surprise at the impressive speech-possibly the longest and most
important one delivered in this debate-of the
senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris), for was he not chairman of a committee which was appointed for the very
purpose of determining whether the role
of the Senate could not be made more effective and its work more efficient.
I am sure we are all convinced of the
wisdom and foresight of the Fathers of Confederation and of those who framed the
British North America Act. But I choose
to agree with the late Minister of Justice,
the Right Honourable Ernest Lapointe, who
said that it should not be regarded as being
as sacred as the Ark of the Covenant. When
the seniator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr.
Horner) alluded to the deformation of the
Senate, I quite expected that he was about
to mention the entry of women into this
body. The Fathers of Confederation, I am
quite sure, never envisaged their admission,
and the justices of the Supreme Court of
Canada seemed to be of the same opinion, for
the members of that tribunal, with the
exception of the Honourable Mr. Justice
Duff, were unanimous in their verdict that
women were not persons within the meaning
of the British North America Act. The
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council-and
I may be subject to correction on this statement-seemed more disposed to accept changing conditions than to agree with the narrow
interpretation of the law; and that body gave
as its verdict that women were persons, and
therefore eligible for appointment to the
Senate.
I entered this chamber, I confess, with
much trepidation, but I am quite ready to
admit that the senators treated me with every
possible courtesy. I was particularly gratified
when two years later the late Senator Riley
said, "We did not like it one bit when you
came in, but we would not have it changed
now.",
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mrs. Wilson: I have always understood
that no body or no person can remain stationary: either we go forward or fall back.
I was driving on one occasion with an
important executive who held a very responsible position. He had reached the age of
sixty-five, and he said, "I should like to
retire. I no longer go out to meet -problems;
I always wonder if there is any reason why
I should make a decision today." I know that,
like the honourable senator from Shelburne
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) and the honourable
senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen)
I am subject to the reproach of having been
appointed too young, and the suspicion that
therefore I may subscribe more readily to
their opinions. But I do not think it is right
for anyone to have the privilege of remaining in the Senate too long. I realize that
wisdom is not the sole prerogative of age. I
could cite the classic examples of Pitt, who
was Prime Minister of England at the age of
twenty-four, and Alexander the Great who,
longing for "more worlds to conquer", died
at thirty-three.
There is no indignity involved in retirement. I realize that most pension schemes
which embrace women require them to retire
from the active scene at sixty; and although,
I confess that I cannot now comply with that
age limit, I would readily consent to retire
at the age which has been suggested during
this debate. Our bankers, business men and
others are, in general, required to retire at
sixty-five; and do we not owe them a great
debt of gratitude for the manner in which,
when their business lives are brought to a
close, they serve in the administration of our
philanthropic organizations? The same spirit
inspires not a few of our college professors.
I should like to refer to Dr. Tory, former President of the Research Council, who at the age
of seventy-nine established Carleton College,
Ottawa. He did not feel that it was necessary
to give up active life because of his withdrawal from the particular work which he
had been doing. Dr. Archibald, formerly head
of our Experimental Farms, was called upon
after his resignation by the Government of
Ethiopia to survey their agriculture and find
means of increasing production.
We listened the other night in the other
place to a debate on the problems of the older
worker; and I fancy many have read the
mimeographed report on the film "Date of
Birth" which has been issued by our Department of Labour. Unfortunately many of our
pension schemes impose hardship on the
older worker, for firms are loath to engage
people over forty-five because they cannot
make a proper contribution in terms of money
to their pension schemes.

SENATE

did not like to hear the honourable senator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) say
that he did not wish to be classed with the
civil servants. I for one should be very proud
to be classed with many of them, for they are
doing a splendid work not only for Canada
but in the international bodies. One of our
ministers complained that his only difficulty
in relation to his staff was that his senior
officers are so much in demand that he cannot
get the full benefit of their services at home.
Yesterday we paid tribute to one of these
men, cut off at a very early age, who had
given incalculable services and certainly will
be very much missed.
Criticisms have been expresed of some
articles in the press; but I should like you to
read two very carefully considered and
sympathetic contributions in Saturday Night
by Wilfrid Eggleston. Having served as
secretary of the body that considered the
subject of Dominion-Provincial relations, he
should know better than any other newspaperman what is the constitutional position
of senators.
Before concluding, I should like to quote
a few lines from John Buchan's book,
"Memory Hold-the-Door":
My years in parliament left me a more convinced believer than ever in democracy, but
convinced too that the democratic technique wanted
overhauling.
I
remembered
Burke's words:
"There ever is within parliament itself a power of
renovating its principles and effecting a selfreformation which no other place of government
has ever contained . . . Public troubles have often
called upon this country to look into its constitution. It has ever been bettered by such a revision.

Dr. W. D. Coolidge, world-famous scientist
and director emeritus of the General Electric
Research Laboratory at Schenectady, New
York, at the official opening of the new
synchroton laboratories at Queen's University
uttered these comments:
It is easy for us to forget that our democratic
form of government, to which we owe our freedom, needs constant effort on our part for its
preservation.

I have risen at this time to support wholeheartedly the resolutions suggested by the
honourable senator from Inkerman. The
adoption of these, and some provision for
nominations from the provinces, would enable
the Senate more adequately to represent
public opinion throughout the country.
Hon. Mr. Pirie: Honourable senators, I
move adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.

APPROPRIATION BILL No. 1
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved second
reading of Bill 169, an Act for granting to
His Majesty certain sums of money for the
public service of the financial year ending the
31st March, 1952.
He said: Honourable senators, I need not
enlarge upon the fact that the particular
supply bill which is before us embodies a
request of the government for supply for the
year ahead. It has nothing whatever to do
with the measure relating to the supplementary estimates, which is still before the
other place. This deals with interim supply
for a certain period in the new year. For the
information of some honourable senators who
are newcomers and may be unfamiliar with
our procedure, I will mention that it is a
common practice to ask for a certain amount
of money to take care of more immediate
obligations with which the Department of
Finance is faced. This bill permits the government to finance the public service and
carry on the business of the country for a
specified time, pending the passing of a final
supply bill. The general proportion of onesixth for all services is intended to provide
for all ordinary requirements of the public
service to the end of May. The additional
proportions requested for certain special
items are necessitated by the seasonal and
sessional nature of the services affected. In
no case, however, is the total amount of any
item being asked for. The form of the bill
itself varies in no way from that of similar
bills in previous years.
The first amount asked for under this bill
is $413,758,902.33. This represents one-sixth
of the main estimates to be voted, excluding
those estimates authorized by statute, and is
covered by section 2.
Honourable senators are aware that while
most types of expenditure run more or less
evenly throughout the year, there are a few
items which require in a given period-more
than the one-sixth allotted to them under this
measure. The special expenditures in the
bill before us are listed under schedules "A",
"B, "C", and "D". They concern twentysix different votes. With respect to these an
increase is sought in the allotment, such
increases ranging by degrees, from onetwelfth to three-quarters.
Section 3 of the bill would grant an additional sum of $1,644,656.25.
This is threequarters of the items set forth in schedule "A"

MARCH 21, 1951
to the bill. This amount is to cover payment
to Trans-Canada Airlines for the transportation, of United Kingdom immigrants, which
it is contemplatefi will take place in the early
part~of the fiscal year. It will also cover the
administration of the Wartime Prices and
Trade Board, which will cease to function by
July 31, 1951; assistance to certain residen-ts
of Newfoundland to give effect to the Terrns
of Union with Canada, and. payment by the
government of Canada, under agreement with
the government of Manitoba establishing the
Greater Winnipeg Dyking Board.
Section, 4 of the bill provides $4,040,634.67,
or one-third of the three items listed in
schedule "B" to the bill. This additional
amount is required because of the heavier
expenditure early in the fiscal year for freight
assistance on western f eecl grains, the
Canadian-International Trade Fair 1951, and
the census which is to take place this year.
Section 5 of the bill would provide
$536,759.17, or one-sixth of the amnount. of the
five items listed in schedule "C" to the bill.
These items cover, principally, the early
acquisition and improvement of desirable
properties for Canadjan goverramenst offices
and residences abroad, and the principal
administrative costs of the Senate and the
House of Commons, which. tend to be incurred early in the fiscal year.
Section 6 of the bill woulcl vote $1,322,403.33,
or one-twelth of the items set out in schedrule
"D".
This amount is required because
expenditure under th.ese items, particularly
as regards those that corne undier the Depaýrtment of Resources and, Development, are
beaviest in the spring months.
Honourable senators, it is hardly necessary
for me to say that the passing of this bill will
not prejud-ice the rights and privileges of
members to criticize and discuss any item in
the estîmates which will come up for consideration fromn time to time tbroughout the
remainder of the session. I give the usual
undertaking that such rights and privileges
will be respected, andi wilýl not be curtailed.
or restricteci in any way as a resuit of the
passirng of this measure.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
for the benefit of our newer members I
should like to repeat what the leader of the
governmnent (Hon. Mr. Robertson) bas just
said. The passing of this bull will not preclude any member from criticizing and discussing any items that will, corne before this
house during the rernainder &f the session,.
In fact, this bill could be deait with as a
budget matter, and bonourable members
would have the right to discuss the whole

gamut of expendituresi which the government bas made or may be expected to make
this year. However, it is the practice-and
I think it is a reasonable one-to pass, these
interim supply bills without too much protest
or delay, in order that the government may
-carry on the business of the country for a
certain period.
At this time I wish to refer to one or two
items in the bill, merely because I do not
want to býe found guilty of something which
the honourable leader of the government
accused me of doing yesterday. He made his
accusation in the hallway and not in this
chamber; otherwise I would ask birn to
retract bis remarks He s'aid that when I
got up to discuss the wheat question my
speech incited about fifteen other senators
to f ollow me in the debate.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I was not criticizing
my honourable friend, I was complimienting
him.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The trouble seems to be
that the fervour of the debate bas returned
to the other place, and no one can tell when
this particular wbeat question wîll be settled.
Honourable senators, with reference te
the item under sehedule "A" which bas to
do with the Greater Winnipeg Dyking Board,
I want to say that the money paid by the
Government of Canada to the Government
of Manitoba bas been wisely used. The
affairs of titis Board bave been ably administered, and those in charge are to be
congratulýated.
Honourable senators, I think it is proper
for me at this time to again thank the people
of North America, the United Kîngdom,
France and other counitries, who so magnificently responded to the Manitoba Flood Relief
Fund. A little over eight and a quarter million dollars wa-s raised, and the money has
been spent te rehabilitate the people of the
Red River Valley w-ho lest furniture and
equipment in the flood disaster of last June.
I think the only possible criticismn that could
be made of those wboadministered thýis fund
was that sometimes they were too liberal.
As the people of Manitoba put up approximately a quarter of this money thernselves,
naturally tb-ey have been concernied about
its disposal; but I have neyer heard a single
word of complaint about the administration
of the fund. I believe that only two officials in charge cf the fund received any
remuneration. and many Winnipeg citizens
contributed their services voluntarily.
I wish also to congratulate the federal
government upon the contribution made te
flood relief and to the work that bas been
done towards coping with floods that may
occur in the future. No one can definitely

SENATE

say yet whether this work will prove to have
been sufficient, but any reasonable person
will agree that the dyking and engineering
have been done as well as possible and
should provide ample protection against any
emergency that may arise in the foreseeable
future.
With these remarks, I have no objection to
the passage of the bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon.

the

Speaker:

Honourable sena-

tors, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: With leave of the
Senate, I move the third reading now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
STAFF OF THE SENATE
REPORTS OF INTERNAL ECONOMY COMMITTEE
CONCURRED IN

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the second report of the Standing Committee
and Contingent
Economy
on Internal
Accounts.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Honourable senators,
if I may have unanimous consent, I will move
concurrence in this report, as well as in the
committee's third, fourth, fifth and sixth
reports, all of which are now before the
bouse for consideration.
The motion was agreed to.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
as we have now cleared our order paper, I
will move that the house adjourn during
pleasure, to reassemble this afternoon at the
call of the bell. For the convenience of
members I would point out that we shall
not be reassembling earlier than 4 o'clock.
The only matters likely to come before us
this afternoon are the supplementary estimates and interim supply, and these have
still to be dealt with in the other house,
which is meeting at 3 o'clock.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

The sitting was resumed.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
the supplementary estimates have not yet
reached us, but there is some hope that they
will come to us later this afternoon. Therefore I would suggest that the house again

adjourn during pleasure, to reassemble at
approximately 5 p.m., at which time we can
decide upon a further adjournment, if
necessary.
I move, honourable senators, that this house
do now adjourn to reassemble at the call of
the bell, not earlier than 5 o'clock this afternoon.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
The sitting was resumed.
THE ROYAL ASSENT

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that he had received a communication from
the Assistant Secretary to the Governor
General, acquainting him that the Honourable Patrick Kerwin, a Judge of the Supreme
Court of Canada, acting as Deputy of His
Excellency the Governor General, would
proceed to the Senate Chamber at 5.45 p.m. for
the purpose of giving the Royal Assent to
certain bills.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: The answer furnished
me is that, while the Minister of Citizenship
and Immigration has not received any direct
advice from the provincial government of
British Columbia that water rights have been
granted in the interior of the province to the
Aluminum Company of Canada, he is aware
that a statement appeared in the press to the
effect that an agreement had been reached
between the province and the Aluminum
Company of Canada covering the granting of
such rights. The Department of Fisheries has
had under active study the matter of salmon
conservation in the urea covered by the
agreement, and bas been working closely with
those concerned on ways and means of protecting salmon, in the interests of Indians and
others who might be affected.

The Hon. the Speaker:
senators, when shall the bill be read the
second time?
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: With leave
of the Senate, I move the second reading now.
Honourable senators, as I mentioned
earlier today, this measure contemplates the
granting of certain sums of money to cover
the supplementary estimates for the public
service of the financial year ending March 31,
1951. The total amount asked for by the bill
is $201,556,559. The schedules of this bill
include a considerable number of items, but
at the moment it is my intention to refer to
only four of the larger items, which total
some $167 million, or approximately 83 per
cent of the supplementary estimates.
The first item of any size is one of $65
million, the subject matter of which is well
known to all senators, because the house
availed itself of the opportunity to discuss
this matter under the bill to amend the
Canadian Wheat Board Act. This fact does
not preclude honourable senators from again
discussing this item. The point is that this
subject is not new to honourable members,
and I do not intend to go over the ground
which has already been covered.
80713-22

I have in my hand a sheet which covers ail of
the net costs of subventions, bonuses and subsidies
paid by the federal Department of Agriculture for
the fiscal years 1939-40 to 1949-50, covering the
period of the war and not covering last year.

That is 1950. I point this out because,
whether right or wrong, this is an attempt
to settle a disputed matter which has been
given wide publicity, and which covers
operations over a considerable number of
years. The minister went on:
From those dates it will be noticed that there is
still one year that we will have been paying after
that. The total amount of the payments, before
there was any vote proposed for wheat, was $727
million. Of that, over $169 million went to the
dairy farmers in one form of subsidy or another;
$248 million of it went to the livestock producers,
and the greater part of that $248 million will be
paid to the saine persons as are producing dairy
products.
Then one could go on to quote the figures with
regard to all the products that have been talked
about. But the only other figure that I am going
to use ai the moment is the one having to do with
apples and vegetables, including potatoes-and I
must say that the potato one is the small one
among these--of $30,124,000. When one recalls that
there are only about 4,000 fruit growers in Nova
Scotia, where they got about $21 million or rather
$18 million of that amount-the $21 million would
not apply until another year's payments are made
-and that the province of British Columbia, with

SENATE
a similar number, received up to that time some
$2 million, and since then has had $2 million, one
will realize that when 250,000 farmers have a
subsidy of $65 million, per family the payment in
every one of the other classifications, with the
possible exception again of potatoes, has been
higher than the payment per family in connection
with any grants that have been paid to the wheat
growers in connection with wheat. I give those
figures in order to ease the minds of those who
think that they have got to vote against this item
because the people they represent did not get
anything. They have all had something. In my
opinion, if you take into consideration the farmers
in this country from one end to the other with
regard to the payments that they have received, it
will be found that they have been dealt with
extreme equality, no matter what part of Canada
they live in or no matter what part of agriculture
they have been conducting.
May I say that I am not altogether sure that
the potato growers have been dealt with as favourably as others.

Hon. Mr. Vien: Has the honourable leader
the detailed statement referred to in the
passage he has quoted?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: No. I may say that the
Minister of Agriculture said he would place
it on the House of Commons Hansard today.
Hon. Mr. Haig: And he did.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: My honourable friend
th leader of the opposition says that he did.
The Minister of Agriculture went onHon. Mr. Vien: Before the honourable
leader proceeds further, would he undertake
to have that spread on Hansard?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I certainly will. It
cannot be done today, perhaps, but it will be
done. I am glad that my honourable friend
has drawn my attention to the matter.
This is the ex-cerpt from the minister's
remarks:
May I say that I am not altogether sure that the

potato growers have been dealt with as favourably
as others. Something of the kind is being con-

templated at the moment.

So much for the past; now let us consider
the future. I would remind honourable senators that on the statute book of this country
there is legislation known as the Agricultural
Prices Support Act, under which there is
constantly in existence for this purpose a
revolving sum of $200 million. I shall use
the phraseology of the Act:
. . . the

board

shall

endeavour

to

ensure

adequate and stable returns for agriculture by
promoting orderly adjustment from war to peace
conditions and shall endeavour to secure a fair
relationship between the returns from agriculture
and those from other occupations.

My honourable friends will recall that
upon the expiration of that Act on March 31,
1950 it was renewed without limitation as to
time. I point out that the Act specifically
excludes wheat. Regardless of the merits or

demerits of the proposed payment of $65 mil-

lion to the wheat growers, a review of agriculture generally throughout Canada in the
past readily shows that there is no undue
discrimination in the present transaction.
I shall deal now with those who are not
primarily interested in agriculture, but who
are opposed to subsidies and subventions.
May I say to such people-and many of them
come from areas which benefit from the activities of secondary production-that while
business may not receive direct subventions
or assistance by way of taking money from
the taxpayer and giving it to the producer,
nevertheless, secondary industry has been
receiving subsidies from the very day tariffs
were instituted in this country.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: True, this is an indirect form of assistance, but it gives protection
and thereby assures for the consumer prices
lower than he would otherwise expect to pay.
Those who come from areas which benefit
from such assistance realize that it is just as
genuine a subsidy as that which the farmer
receives directly from taxes. Whether the
assistance is direct or indirect, the result is
the same. The practice of assisting industry
has gone on for a long time, it is going on
today, and will probably continue in the
future. There was a time when agricultural
interests recognized the help that was being
received by industries and fought against it,
saying that farm prices were competitive and
that secondary industries enjoyed tariff protection.
My friend, from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
a few years ago came out of the West leading
a group of men who were dissatisfied because
of the progress made on behalf of the farmer.
When I first heard him he was championing
the cause of low tariffs in order that primary
producers in this country could get goods
cheaper. But in this direction my honourable
friend and a great many other agriculturists
have wearied in well-doing. The day for
championing lower tariffs seems to be gone,
and leaders of agriculture in this country now
try to achieve economic parity through
direct subsidies or subventions of one kind
or another. If you tell them that this is not
the best way to accomplish their purposes, if
you suggest that they should fight for lower
tariffs and reduced, costs, they will laugh at
you. Probably they will say, "We tried that
kind of thing for years, and we gave it up
as hopeless".
Honourable senators who represent parts
of the country which do not receive statutory
aids must bear in mind that businesses which
do not enjoy relief in this form receive much

MARCH 21, 1951
assistance in other ways. They have had it
in the past, they are getting it now, andi they
will get it in the future. As a matter of fact
there is hardly a business or occupation in
any part of Canada which is without public
aids of one sort or another. I am not to be
understood; as defending this system; sometimes I wonder where it is all going to end.
But that is not the point I have in mind. I
am addressing myself to the question of
whether there is anything new or relatively
unfair, either to secondary industry or other
types of agriculture, or to any other economic
activity, in providing a subsidy under the
circumstances we are considering. I repeat
that from one end of Canada to the other
people are recipients of bonuses or assistance
of other kinds. Practically speaking it boils
diown to the question of how much this or
that person gets, and from what.
Hon. Mr. Duff: I am ashamed of you.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Let it be understood
that I have never lost my belief in low tariffs.
I do not approve of governmental subventions
or bonuses; and so far as I am concerned,
if those who receive these indirect and less
manifest aids would join me, I would fight
tariffs of all descriptions. To my mind the
greatest danger to this world today is not
Russia; it is a pyramided system of protective
measures whereby many countries, particularly those composing the Atlantic union, are
taxing each other's products to an extent
which endangers their entire economy. I
invite my honourable friend from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) to join me in
opposing not only subsidies which are open
and above board, but the secondary aids
which apply to practically all industries in
this country. I would like to devote my time
to eliminating them all and letting the breath
of free trade circulate through our entire
economy.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It's a deal.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: That, I think is the
most worth-while work in which we could
engage. I arm not now speaking officially.
As honourable senators know, I occasionally
find some difficulty in defining my position
-whether as that of a member of the governr
ment, or an individual. Personally I have
more than a passing interest in Atlantie
union, not only because, as far as defence
is concerned, it is our only hope, but because
it offers a way, and I believe, the only way,
of enabling ourselves and others to produce
and pay for the necessary sinews of war.
To my honourable friends opposite who feel
that the sum proposed does not begin to be
enough, I would say that I have no fault to
find with them for enlarging their claims ta
80713-221

the extent of $330 million, or even $530
million. I believe I pointed out yesterday
that however much the farmers receive they,
like everyone else, will have to pay a big
chunk of it in income tax. In those circumstances a large sum dwindles pretty quickly.
So, bearing in mind that almost every
honourable senator present represents some
area which receives subsidies, direct or
indirect, hidden or disclosed, I suggest that
on this particular issue, "He that is without
sin among you, let him first cast a stone".
I now address myself to the next item, but
briefly, for I know that other honourable
senators want to take part in the discussion.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I ask the honourable leader a question at this point? The
amount of $65 million is included in the
estimates for the Department of Agriculture,
while the Canadian Wheat Board, to which
this money will be paid, is under the direction of the Minister of Trade and Commerce.
There is also another item of $2ï million in
the estimates which is to make good certain
flax losses incurred a few years ago. This item
is being voted in the estimates for the Department of Trade and Commerce. Perhaps the
leader will explain why the $65 million does
not come under the estimates of the Department of Trade and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: This question is of
a technical nature, and I do not know that I
am prepared to answer it. I would say that
if this money is granted and it does not find
its way to the Wheat Board, somebody will
hear about it.
There is another item of $7,250,000 for
Canada's contribution to the United Nations
Relief and Rehabilitation program for Korea.
I have no particular information about this
item, but the expenditure is for a deserving
cause, to which we obligated ourselves. I
should imagine that if the war in Korea is
not soon ended, it will not be long before a
substantially larger amount is requested for
this same purpose.
There is an item of $75 million to provide
for the transfer to the Civil Service Superannuation Account of a special government
contribution of a portion of the amount by
which the estimated liabilities exceed the
balance in the account. My information is
that for various reasons there has been in
that account a growing shortage of the
necessary money to put it on a strict actuarial
basis. This shortage dates back to the days
of Mr. Bennett. It was considerably less at
that time than it is now, but it has been
growing steadily, and it is a government
obligation. I believe the Minister of Finance
said in another place that following a

SENATE

complete examination of the matter a detailed
report will be made; and if it is found
necessary, legislation will be introduced to
correct the situation before the termination
of this session of parliament.
There is an item of $19,410,000 to provide
for the defence forces of the navy, army and
air services. This money is required in
addition to what has already been voted for
the costly defence program upon which this
country has embarked.
Honourable senators, I do not profess to
have any great knowledge of the details of
all the estimates before the house, but I shall
be glad to try to answer any questions
honourable senators may ask.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
I rise to speak tonight because the leader
of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson),
made particular reference to me yesterday
when discussing the wheat question. We
have heard a lot of talk in this chamber about
the duty of honourable senýators to protect
provincial rights. We have also heard that
the province of Saskatchewan produces more
wheat than the other nine provinces put
together. It is needless to say, therefore,
that Saskatchewan is vitally interested in
this question. Yesterday the leader of the
government spoke about the time when the
western farmers got as little as 30 cents a
bushel for their wheat, and he intimated
that they would prefer some kind of protection against such a low price, even though
it involved a temporary ceiling of $1 or $1.25.
Certainly the farmer of the vast Saskatchewan plains is somewhat of a gambler. He
goes to great expense to seed a large acreage,
not knowing what harvest he may reap.
When the world price for wheat was low he
had to take what he could get; but, when
world conditions warranted paying him a
price for his wheat which would enable him
to rehabilitate himself by constructing new
farm buildings and buying new m'achinery
what happened? The government negotiated a
contract, and now it comes along and offers
the farmers this almost insulting amount of
$65 million. It will be remembered that the
Canadian Wheat Board was taken entirely
out of the hands of the farmers and was
made a political board. The wheat farmers
of Western Canada, who once had to accept
as little as 30 cents a bushel for their grain,
found that under the Anglo-Canadian wheat
agreement 'they were forced to take a price
lower than that offered on the world market.
And this was at a time when world conditions warranted a higher price. The western
farmer was put in the position of a poker
player who has been constantly losing and

who, just when the pot gets full and he finally gets a good hand, finds that somebody
upsets the table and calls off the game.
An Hon. Senator: The farmers themselves
upset the table.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I feel that I am duty
bound to protest this small payment of $65
million. Some people talk about the farmers
of Eastern Canada objecting to it. Why,
the amount should be $565 million; what is
offered here is really an insult.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Let us all be insulted.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: This is just the first

payment.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Yes, and it will only go
a little way. I resented the leader of the
government pointing his finger at me
yesterday.
Talking about world conditions, I notice
that the people of five of the states in the
Republic of Brazil are suffering from starvation, and these states have asked the national
congress for assistance. As I have said, the
Saskatchewan farmers are ýthe wheat producers of this country, and their annual crop
has proven of benefit to all the people of
Canada. I cannot sec why there should be
any hesitancy in voting this measly sum of
$65 million when the wheat producers have
already had $700 million taken from them.
Let me tell honourable senators another
thing. The Saskatchewan farmers have paid
more income tax than the farmers of any
other province of Canada.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: And they will pay more
next year.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Yes. Their taxes for
1950 will probably amount to $10 million.
That is real money. It isn't hay. I think
the people who balk at paying this money
should feel ashamed of the way the wheat
farmers have been let down.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
it is a pretty safe prediction that when the
history of these times is written this whole
wheat marketing episode will be set down
as a remarkable incident. This experience
affords to us one clear and excellent lesson,
that governments should not be in this kind
of business.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Bulk trading in different
commodities
between
governments
has
always been one of the cardinal tenets of
socialist doctrine. That was the cardinal principle of the CCF, so-called, in its various

MARCH 21, 1951
appeals at different times to the Canadian
electorate, and never on any occasionexcepting in one province, and for a particular reason-did the CCF ever come
within striking distance of attaining office.
In other words, the Canadian people time
and again repudiated the philosophy of state
trading and bulk contracts as between governments. The remarkable fact that will be
noted by future historians of these times
is that it was a government calling itself
Liberal which fastened this thing for the
time being on the people of Canada. Except
under very special conditions, such as exist
in time of war, any socialist doctrine of state
trading and govern.ment operation of plants
is not sanctified and glorified by being given
the name Liberal. Such a doctrine is just
as socialist today as it ever was.
What has been the result of the AngloCanadian wheat agreement? I am aware of
the pressure that the government was under
in 1946, a ye'ar or so after the war, to make
an agreement of this kind. That pressure
came from organized farmers, chiefly in
Western Canada, who in a large measure
were supporters of the CCF policy; and the
unfortunate fact is that at the time the government conceded their point of view, and
we entered into this contract for the sale of
600 million bushels of wheat over a period of
four years. This was the greatest gamble ever
taken in the whole history of wheat marketing. How could it be justified? Today we
have the inevitable result, for the gamble
went the wrong way, and because of that,
despite the hard-pressed circumstances of
these times, and our mounting budgets and
growing inflation, we have to dig into the
natonal treasury for $65 million as a partial
compensation for the losses that the farmers
suffered under this agreement.
Hon. Mr. Horner: "Partial" is a very good
word there.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Yes. My honourable
friend from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner)
is on the other side of the fence from me
on this question.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Not very far.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: There is no justification
for the payment by the government of a
single cent on this deal.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I say that as a western
farmer who, as I mentioned the other day,
will be a beneficiary of the government's
bounty to the extent of an additional four
and one half cents a bushel if this money
is voted.

Is there no justification for a payment by
the government? It was the leaders of the
farm organizations in Western Canada and
the Federation of Agriculture who pressed
this policy upon the government. According to
a statement made a few years ago by the
Minister of Agriculture, after the contract
had been entered into, they approved the
contract even before it was signed. And now
that it has not worked out satisfactorily, they
come back and ask !to be compensated for
their losses. They vary in their representations to the government as to the amount
lost, but none of them place the figure as
high as the $750 million estimated by the
senator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner).
I do not think the actual loss was that heavy,
but it is certain that it was a great deal more
than the amount provided in the measure
before us.
Presently we shall have another illustration
of an agreement that has not worked out
well, and perhaps the Minister of Finance
had better be giving it some consideration.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I did not know until this
moment, honourable senators, that the
minister was in the gallery. He has now
received my message personally. The result
of the International Wheat Agreement will
probably be similar to that of the United
Kingdom agreement. I am against state
trading, and I do not care who knows it.
The leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) paid me the compliment
of
mentioning that on one occasion, a good
many years ago, I headed a delegation to
parliament. That is quite true. Then he
expressed some regret that I had wearied in
well doing. Well, the honourable leader is
a very good friend of mine, and I think that
after a little reflection he will agree that I
still belleve in the fundamental policies that
I believed in thirty years ago.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I was talking about
tariffs.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: As to tariffs, we have
achieved a great deal. I have marched in
step with the leader of the government in
this house (Hon. Mr. Robertson), and I am
quite willing to go with him as a delegation to
the Minister of Finance, to see if we cannot
get further reductions.
I repeat that the loss under this wheat
agreement is the result of a wholly
mistaken policy. I am not going to suggest
that those in the government who advocated
this policy at the time it was adopted were
not acting in good faith. Nor am I going to
suggest that they did not think it would be

SENATE
in the interest of the farmers of Western
Canada to have an agreement of this kind.
Not for a moment. But, out of a long experience in the grain business, let me say that
any individual or government that sells 600
million bushels of wheat for delivery over
the succeeding four years is doing nothing
else than gambling on the result.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Quite right.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That has been demonstrated time and time again.
There was a way in which the government
could have sold wheat to Britain without
entering into an agreement of this kind.
After Britain had suffered the terrible strain
of the war years, during which her economy
had been practically wrecked, if the -Canadian government had wished to give her some
assistance-and in those circumstances the
giving of assistance was wholly justified-it
could have done so by having the Wheat
Board buy wheat in the open market, and
sell it to Britain at a certain price-$1.55 a
bushel, if you like-and having the people of
Canada bear the loss.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Does the honourable
senator not mean that the government should
have ýbought the wheat on the open market
and given it to Great Britain?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Yes, that is what I mean.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: You said the Wheat
Board should have bought it.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Perhaps I did not make
that clear to my honourable friend. The
wheat could have been bought in the market
for account of the government, which could
have accepted $1.55 a bushel and written off
the difference out of the treasury. In that
way the government and the people of
Canada could have given whatever assistance
they wished to the British people, and we
would1 not have been in this mess todiay. But
for this marketing arrangement, the consumers of Canada would have paid the full
price for their bread, and the flour mills
would have had to buy their wheat requirements at the market price. As it was, the
Canadian millers bought their wheat at the
price fixed by the British agreement, with
the practical result that the western wheat
growers really subsidized the bread consumers of this country.
Hon. Mr. Horner: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: There is no question about
it. I realize that though I speak with some
vehemence against this procedure and this
policy, the vote will go through.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: I think it will.

Hon. Mr. Crerar: The energetic Whip on
this side assures me that that is the case.
Let us not deceive ourselves: this is costly
business. I was not much impressed by the
argument put up by the leader of the government that the potato growers, the fruit growers and the livestock producers had over a
period- of years benefited to the extent of an
amount in the neighbourhood of $727 million.
How does that justify a contribution now by
the treasury of $65 million to the wheat
growers?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It is a pretty goodý argument.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Are we going to put this

whole business on the auction block, as it
were, with one class of producer bidding
against another? My answer to the argument
of my honourable colleague is this. The
Minister of Finance had, better give some
serious thought to the direction in which we
are going. The only salvation for this country,
in my humble opinion, is to get away from
this sort of thing, and get back to some of
the old virtues which were possessed by the
people who developed this country. They did
not look te the government on every occasion
for a handout. I say, with all the sense of
responsibility I have as a member of this
house, that no economy, here or elsewhere,
can stand such pressure and such drains upon
it. Sooner or later we will burst into more
inflation, and we will never catch up with it.
As a result we will all sink down together in
trouble and despair. Frankly, that is not the
kind of Liberalism upon which I was
nourished.
I do not think you can take
C.C.F. policies of this kind, turn them around,
and call them Liberal policies.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The opposition to these
policies seems to me to be directed at doing
as much damage as possible to the government and getting as little odium as possible
from the wheat growers. We have had a fine
exhibition of straddling the fence. But honourable senators, the people of this country
are getting a little weary of fence-sitters and
fence-straddlers.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I hope you are not
referring to us over here.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Yes, he is.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: We must get down to a
sober sense of realism in dealing with these
things. The Canadian people are a great
nation, but the apparent characteristic of
governments today seems to be their fear of

MARCH 21, 1951
the people. That is wrong; governments
should trust the people. That is a cardinal
principle of Liberalism.
Hon. Mr. Duff: "Attaboy."
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I have enough confidence
in the sanity and judgment of the Canadian
people to believe that if they are given the
real facts they will inevitably reach a sound
and honest judgment.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable senators, I understand that by giving second
reading to this bill the house agrees ta the
principle of the measure as a whole. I am
particularly interested in Item 576 in the
bill, but I intend to defer further comment on
it until the motion for third reading. I have
no desire at the present time to thresh old
straw or to repeat what was said yesterday in
the debate on the Canadian Wheat Board
Bill. For that reason I will defer my remarks
on this particular item until third reading;
and in view of the exception that I take to
this one item, I trust that when the bill
before us in given second reading it will be
noted that it passes on division.
Hon. A. W. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
I too have no desire to thresh old straw. In
speaking yesterday afternoon I made my
position .clear beyond all peradventurethat I would have none of this type of legislation and would vote against this feature of
the measure. My objection is to the proposed
payment of $65 million to the wheat growers
of the West. It is not necessary for me to
go over that argument tonight.
I must, however, acknowledge and respond
to the two very kind invitations which the
government leader extended to me tonight.
He pointed out that the industrial interests
of the locality from which I come have for
many years enjoyed special protection by
reason of tariff concessions, and that they
are charging more for their goods than they
are worth on the world markets. He pointed
out also that the member from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) came down from the West
on one occasion championing lower tariffs,
but that he wearied in well doing. I want
to say to my friend from Shelburne (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) that I have advocated lower
tariffs all my adult life, and I come, not
frorn the free-trading West, but from the
protectionist city of Toronto. Regardless
of the riding I represented, I kept the lowtariff flag flying. It has been my view that
the people who have lost most by reason
of obstructive tariffs are the people of the
industrial city of Toronto, and that it and
other cities like it stand to gain most by
freer trade.

Hon. Mr. Duff: Quite true.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: In all the years I have
never declared a truce with those who raid
the treasury in this way, and I am not
changing my attitude now.
The honourable gentleman from Shelburne
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) invited me to join him
in a raid on that particular form of special
privilege. I accepted his invitation, and said
it was a deal.
But what am I to say to his other
invitation; that, because there are in my city
protected interests-whom I always opposeI should join with him in this raid upon the
public treasury by the wheat growers of the
West? That is something of the same
character, and in the saine category as protection. Why, when the honourable gentleman
from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) was
talking about what the raiders expect to
get as a "measly" $65 million, I could even
recognize the language of the protected
interests. I remembered how "infant industries" in my own city and other industrial
centres, after obtaining a tariff protection of
7 per cent-raised later to 10, 15, 30, 35, 40
and even 50 per cent-complained that the
protection was not high enough. We are to
understand that this raid of a "measly" $65
million upon the treasury is to be regarded
as an insult to those who are getting away
with that amount of money! I observe the
same type of thinking which actuated those
who, because of governmental favours, have
been able to raid their fellow citizens by
charging for their goods more than those
goods were worth. I note the sarne kind of
logic in the speech of the honourable gentleman from Blaine Lake. So I do not accept
the second invitation: I will not join the
honourable senator from Shelburne or anyone else in one raid on the treasury because
there have been other raids on the treasury.
As I said in my opening remarks, I am
not going to thresh old straw. I made my
position clear yesterday and on many
previous occasions. I am opposed to this
grant of $65 million.
Hon. Frederick W. Pirie: Honourable
senators, as I do not wish to prolong the
debate I shall be very brief. Like the
previous speaker, I have not changed my
position. The honourable leader (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) presented this evening a very fair,
straightforward case in connection with
the supplementary estimates; but, as he
mentioned some subsidy that has been paid
to potato growers in the East, I want to make
it clear that I am a potato grower and a
farmer, and up to the present moment I have

Hon. Mr. Robertson: With leave of the
Senate, I now move the third reading.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: I move, seconded
by the honourable member for VictoriaCarleton (Hon. Mr. Pirie):
That the bill be not now read a third time, but
that it be amended by striking out Vote No. 567
in the schedule.

If I may speak briefly to this amendment,
I should like to express my regret that circumstances obliged so many members of the
Senate to leave the city this afternoon. But
for this, and the fact that certain members
have been paired for the vote, the expression of our collective opinion on this subject
and on the amendment might, I think, have
been more revealing.
I am sorry also that there is not a fuller
attendance here tonight, because this amendment establishes a precedent, the precedent
of the Senate moving for a reduction in a
supply bill, and therefore represents as
important a question as has been presented
te this house in its whole history. There
have been many occasions when votes of
public moneys for buildings, or railways, or
-omething of that kind were curtailed in
this house. We

are all

familiar with

the

record in that connection. But there has
never been an occasion when it was found
necessary to ask for a reduction of the
amount found in a bill of supply; and I submit that the object of this amendment fully
justifies the precedent that is being set.

Hon. Mr. Crerar: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Lambert: The final purpose of
my amendment is to remove a stigma from
our trade relations with the Motherland and
other countries, because these relations are
bound to be prejudiced by the unjustifiable
expenditure represented in this vote.
Honourable senators, I duly submit for
your favourable consideration this amendment which has been seconded by the honourable gentleman from Victoria-Carleton (Hon.
Mr. Pirie).
Hon. G. P. Campbell: Honourable senators, I
do not intend) to take up much time discussing

this matter, because it was fully debated yesterday afternoon in this chamber. I merely
rise to make one or two comments on behalf
of certain industrial interests in the city of
Toronto. I think the leader of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) has implied that
the people living in industrial areas are
privileged people. I should like to inform
him that the manufacturers of farm implements, with whom the agricultural interests
of Canada are most closely associated, have
no tariff or other protection. They compete
in a free and; open market with American
manufacturers. This situation came about
as a result of pressure brought to bear on
the government by Canadian agricultural
interests.
Like the honourable gentleman from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) I have
always been a low-tariff man, and I still

MARCH 21, 1951

favour the reducing of tariffs. I think some
of the people living in our industrial areas
have suffered greatly as a result of the high
tariffs imposed in this country.
Honourable senators I feel that we should
clearly understand the particular problem
that seems to be troubling most honourable
senators with respect to this item of $65
million. I do not think that the members of
this chamber have ever refused to approve
grants, by way of subsidy or otherwise, to
take care of any specific item, when the facts
have been clearly put before them at the
proper time. This item, however, does not
fall within that category. This $65 million
is to be given gra-tuitously to a special group
in this country. Let us examine for a moment
the facts surrounding the situation. The contract with Britain was entered into in 1946,
andi it assuredi the Canadian farmers a certain
minimum price for their grain over a specified period& It also provided for a higher
price should the price on the world market
increase after 1947. There could be no
objection to the price fixedi for the first two
years. The price for the subsequent years
was to have regard to the difference between
the price fixed in the first two years andi the
worldi price that prevailed during that time.
The farmers and the wheat pools endorsed
this agreement. I suggest that when the contract was to be re-negotiated to establish a
price for 1948 and 1949, due regard was had
to the fact that the world price was higher
in the two previous years than the contract
had provided for, and that a higher price was
accordingly agreed upon. I suggest also that
the contract was carried, out in its entirety,
and that the British Government lived up
to it.
It was not until a later date, after the
performance of the contract, that this question- of an extra payment was brought up. I
submit if the farmers had any serious complaint to make when the price was being
negotiaýted for the final two years of the
contract, that was the time when they should
have registered their objection.
Let us examine why they did not do so.
I think the answer is a simple one. I am
sure the western farmers would be glad
today to enter into an agreement which
would guarantee them a price of $2 a bushel
for their wheat over the next two or four
years. The fact is that when the price of $2
a bushel was negotiated in 1947, to be paid
over the next two years, this arrangement
was entirely satisfactory to the wheat farmers
and to the wheat pools. Not a single voice
was raised in protest until the contract was
nearing its end. This method of merchandising and marketing grain was largely

brought about by reason of the requests
made by the western farmers and the wheat
pools. The Canadian people did not force it
on them. The wheat producers got from both
the British and Canadian governments what
the contract provided for, and I am sure
they received in the last two years of the
contract what they considered to be a fair
price. It just happened that the world price
for wheat remained above $2 a bushel, and
when this contract had run out the farmers
complained to the government that they had
not received for their wheat the high price
they could have gotten for it had it been
sold on a free market. Now they are asking
the Canadian people to make up the
difference.
I feel that it is a bit unfair for any one
group in this country to expect the Canadian
taxpayers to give them an additional profit.
That is really what is being done. The farmers
are not being compensated for any loss they
suff ered.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There was no loss.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: The truth is that the
price negotiated under this contract provided
a fair profit. What we are actually doing
in voting this $65 million is to pay a bonus
to the farmers, and there is no obligation
on the part of the British or the Canadian
government, nor upon the low-wage earners
of Canada, to provide money for a purpose
of this kind. It is for this reason that I support
the amendment proposed by the honourable
senator from Ottawa.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
the question is on the amendment of Hon.
Mr. Lambert, seconded by Hon. Mr. Pirie,
that the bill be not now read a third time,

(Text):
You are visiting Canada, sir, at a difficult
time in the history of our two countries-a
difficult time in the life of free men all over
the world. We had set high hopes on the
United Nations organization as an instrument
of peaceful co-operation among men and governments of good will; we still hope there are
in the world enough men and women of good
will to assure the ultimate triumph of those
high purposes. Unfortunately one of the great
powers bent on extending the domination of
its dictatorial masters has constantly worked
to spread among its people, and among the
peoples already under its domination, distrust, fear and unfriendliness toward their
fellow men. This it is which has made it
necessary for us to join together to build up
our own military forces, not for aggressive
purposes but to deter aggression by a firm
demonstration of our capacity to overcome
it if necessary.
You come to us, sir, after spending a few
days in the United States of America. You
cannot fail to have been impressed by the
strength of that great country, and also by
the sincerity of the peaceful aspirations of
all its people. Here in Canada you will not
fail to note the close, friendly relations which
bind us to our southern neighbours, and also
the untrammelled independence we enjoy in
our own land. If our frontiers bordered on
those of some grasping imperialistic neighbouring state, we might not have this opportunity of welcoming you in a free parliament
as the distinguished and respected head of a
free France. Canada is, I think, the best
evidence, permanent and historic evidence,
of the peaceful purposes of the United States.
These confident, friendly and co-operative
international relations which we enjoy with
our great southern neighbours we wish to
share ultimately with the whole world, and
in the meantime we expect to share them
with all the nations of the North Atlantic
community. We know we can count upon the
people of France, and we wish to assure you
the people of France can count upon the
good will and effective co-operation of all the
people of Canada.
(Translation):
I know that you share our convictions as
to the means of warding off the danger
which threatens us. This means is none other
than the pooling of our forces in the face of
any possibility of aggression and of any
attempted domination or even intimidation.

As I have just pointed out, our generation
has twice already seen Canadian soldiers
fight as brothers-in-arms with French
soldiers. Thousands of them rest side by
side in the vast cemeteries of France.
It was not only your homeland that our
Canadian soldiers went to defend, it was also
their own, their physical as well as their
spiritual homeland. Similarly, your own
soldiers fought for an ideal greater than the
defence of French territory. Neither you
nor we could watch with indifference the fate
of the glorious heritage which they preserved
for us at the cost of their lives. Without a
doubt, we wish to do everything possible to
prevent a new disaster from sweeping down
on our peoples, but we shall never give up
the right to defend, ourselves; we shall never
try to escape the duty of helping to defend
those who, like yourselves, are more immediately exposed than we.
Upon your return home, you may tell your
compatriots that here in Canada you have
met men of good will, a people anxious not
only to prevent the iron curtain from falling
on the shores of the Atlantic, but eager to
ensure that the tricolour shall ever wave in
the air of freedom, because the Canadian
people realize that the free world would no
longer be free if ever France or the Europe
from which our ancestors came should lose
their freedom.
Ladies and gentlemen, Monsieur Vincent
Auriol, President of the French Republic
His Excellency Vincent Auriol, President
of the French Republic: Mr. Prime Minister,
Mr. Speaker of the Senate, Mr. Speaker of the
House of Commons, gentlemen: My heart is
deeply touched with emotion and pride.
I realize the full significance for France of
the warmth of your greetings, the acclamations of your people, the supreme honour you
have done us in officially welcoming us in the
imposing edifice of your parliament, and,
finally, of the eloquence of the words just
spoken.
I am fully aware of the value of this
symbol: the President of the French republic
bringing to Canada the affectionate message
of France on this very hill at the boundary of
the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, the
meeting place of forces, young and eager,
English and French, the union of which has
created your nation, which increases in
strength and grandeur every day and constitutes an immense human treasure for the
future.

SENATE

(Translation):
Sons of the British isles, sons of France,
what a magnificent example is given to the
world, what a long path travelled together!
Great Britain and France-how long we
struggled and fought! But in those hard and
often long battles there never appeared the
slightest divergence in our conceptions of
life, in our forms of civilization. The reconciliation bas been complete, and together we
may admire today this vigorous Canadian
nation which is the expression, diversified but
united, of the genius of the two races.
(Text):
The meeting of our spirits bas begotten
your spirit. And this spirit, illuminated with
idealism, guides you toward a magnificent
future. The two ancient peoples, their rivalries forgotten, are proud to recognize something of themselves in your common fidelity,
and to find themselves rejuvenated and more
closely united by your extraordinary ascent.
They are moved to see Montaigne and
Shakespeare preside over your debates in
common respect for human dignity and common love of liberty.
Mr. Speaker of the Senate, I beg you to
accept, as a Canadian of French origin, the
message of friendship I am bringing to the
faithful guardians of the French language
and, culture. They prove that in a solid
national unity like yours you nevertheless
cherish, as we do in France, the memory of
your origins, and you perpetuate the Christian
and human civilization that France was the
first to bring to you. Your history, as a
matter of fact, is in some ways our history.
As Maurice Barres bas described it, "You
have, as we did in France, reached the highway through bypaths, and you remain
assembled beneath your banners". And those
banners are always worthy of your love.
It is to you, Mr. Speaker of the House of
Commons that I address my message of
friendship for the English-speaking Canadians, whose origin reminds us that Great
Britain, also defender of the right, knew how
to "beget consciences" and carry the flag of
honour everywhere. A few months ago the
world mourned the loss of a great Canadian
statesman and a great democrat who, even
in the darkest days, always affirmed his faith
in the destiny of France. I pay respectful
homage to the memory of William Lyon
Mackenzie King, one of the principal artisans
of the common victory of the allies. As our
poet Rutebeuf bas said, "He was not one of
those friends that the wind carries away
when it howls around the door".
I greet also the Prime Minister, whose visit
to Paris permitted us to admire his fine spirit
and generous heart. I greet his colleagues of

the government, and also, if you will permit
it to an old opponent, the parliamentary
opposition.
And now, gentlemen, I take this occasion
to tell you that at this very hour the whole
of France joins with you and with me in
paying homage to the sacred memory of
thousands of Canadians who, in the course of
two world wars, fought and fell for the liberty
of the world; and, to their families andi to
their surviving comrades I bring our affectionate thought and grateful sympathy.
At Vimy, where a memorial reminds us of
their legendary heroism, at Tilloy, at Dieppe,
at Bretteville-sur-Laize, at Beny-sur-Mer and
in so many other places which speak of their
courage, France, whose heart beat faster
when she saw them parade through her
towns, now tenderly watches over their
eternal rest.
Finally, to the people of Canada I express
the enduring friendship of France, our gratitude for all they have done for our liberation,
and also for that inexhaustible generosity
which, under the impetus of national and
private organizations, has been lavish in its
help to relieve the misery of our people
exhausted by the war and a long and sawful
oppression.
In this world which becomes every day
smaller and smaller, and where the interdependence of nations is a fact, you have understood that our destinies are just the same,
and that there are not for man, whether in
the midst of storm or the calm of peace,
several conceptions of virtue and honour.
Of this vital solidarity I never heard a
more concise definition than that which I
heard on the radio in a small mountain chalet
where I had taken refuge after my confinement in prison, when I fled from the oppressor
before my departure for London. "World
prosperity, like security, is indivisible". They
were the words of Mackenzie King. They must
always be our common motto.
France, being the first country on the road
of invasions and battles, knows perhaps better
than anyone that security is indivisible. If
she had remained alone during the war she
would have definitely succumbed. And with
France enslaved, all Europe would have lost
everything, even hope. If our old civilization
were to disappear from Europe one day, what
would become of the rest of the continents of
the world in the face of an erupting Asia?
No nation, therefore, bas the right to leave
"to chance the smallest parcel of its security,
its dignity or pride." Every nation bas the
duty to preserve the liberty of man against
all those who would or could attempt, from
their own autocratic will, to impose their

APRIL
fanatical ideology and thus unleash the most
frightful of wars. Canada bas understood
this; for twice she has already given men,
material and resources, an enormous and
sacrificial contribution, to the victory of right
and liberty.
Thus your determination has foiled the
efforts of an enemy who hoped that, being
far from Europe, you would not take any
part in the conflict.
Certainly Great Britain could rely on your
traditional loyalty, honour and courage. Certainly France could say she knew you were
faithful to the motto of Quebec, "Je me
souviens".
But the real truth is that the highest ideal
inspired your action. You knew that liberty
has no frontiers; that if anywhere in the
world the light is extinguished, then the rest
of the world is darker. You want to sustain
the light and preserve for the nations the
proud right to live in freedom and to flourish.
Thus you encounter France, because she
has already experienced, the horrors of war
on ber own soil, the sorrow of ruins because
she knows what it is to endure, though temporarily, the oppression of foreign enslavement; because she experienced the mortal
peril of solitude in the face of aggression she
thought, like you, that our forces must be
united in proper time for the founding of
peace. With you, with Great Britain, with
the United States, we had hoped that the
charter of the United Nations, signed by all,
would assure the protection of every nation
by the organization of collective security, as
well as the happiness of mankind by the
co-operation of nations.
But the spirit of intolerance and the will to
dominate has not permitted the materialization of this great hope. And the United
Nations, partially paralyzed, have not been
able to save countries from losing their
independence again or men their liberty.
Once again, one after another as before the
last war, the free democracies have been
smothered. Vast countries are closed and
hostile to the rest of the world. Violence has
reappeared; it is menacing, and even strikes.
And so the great democracies enjoying civil
liberties had to organize into regional defence
pacts. It was with great relief that we
greeted the conclusion of the pact among the
north Atlantic countries, due in great part
to the clairvoyant initiative of Canadian
statesmen-this pact which, ratified by the
unanimous vote of your parliament, has
established a powerful bond between Europe
and America, a bond among the peoples
united by the same civilization and by the
same desire and anxiety to protect and
defend it.

If the aggressors of 1914 and 1939 had
known that France was not alone, that Europe
was not alone, they would have retreated
from the criminal folly of their enterprise.
History is the witness: solidarity in defence
is a token of peace.
France wants neither war nor servitude.
Her sole aim is peace in justice and freedom.
It is for common defence, but also for
common prosperity, that France strives to
create a united Europe, to build a young and
coherent federation.
In the military field, a European army that
will be integrated into the Atlantic bloc is
the first link of collective security.
In the economic and social field, the free
association of productive forces, of which the
Schuman plan is the first step, has to organize
collective prosperity.
Eventually, in the political field, the
European council of ministers and the
assembly of Strasbourg is the beginning of
federal unity to which we wish to give
strength and! efficiency.
For the success of this great design we have
silenced our resentments toward the enemy
of yesterday, who nevertheless was responsible for the death by torture of the best of
our citizens. Our only condition has been and
remains that he shall not forget his crimes
and faults; that he shall renounce plans of
domination and revenge; that he shall sincerely rally to the principles of democracy.
And so we want a democratic Europe,
created not through the subordination of
some nations to another, but through a fruitful harmony. And this free Europe, open to
all the peoples who respect the liberty of
others, will associate itself with the new
world so that upon this international
economic and political co-operation may be
built enduring peace.
Whatever it may cost us, the victory of
peace is the prize.
Let us not miss any possibility of agreement, even partial, and no occasion to dissipate misunderstandings; but so long as
the United Nations have not the necessary
armed forces to maintain international order,
we must neglect nothing in the organization
of our common regional defence.
Let us not cease to proclaim the right and
the principles of an enduring peace, but let
us judge the sincerity of our partners by
their acts and by their actual contribution to
the easing of international tension.
France is not giving herself up to any naïve
neutralism, and whatever sacrifices our
rearmýament efforts add to our already
crushing burdens for rehabilitation and
re-equipment, we know that no sacrifice is
as heavy as that of liberty.

SENATE
There is no better testimony of our resolution than the heroism of our soldiers who
are fighting in Korea in the service of the
United Nations, and for more than four years
have been fighting in Indo-China, where it
is now recognized, after much injustice, that
they defend no selfish interest but the
independence that France has given to the
young states of Viet Nam, Cambodia and
Laos. They mount guard at the gates of
southeast Asia.
France is thus faithful to her traditions and
the ideal of our common civilization.
Momentarily exhausted by the wounds she
received while the world was unorganized,
she always knows that it is in the exaltation
of the spirit that great things-the proud
cathedrals and lofty monuments of rightare wrought.
With Great Britain, Canada and the United
States, and the free world, France shares a
common faith. And the visit of the President
of the French republic to your country is not
only the manifestation of the enduring affection of France, but the expression of our will
to work together to achieve greater liberty,
greater justice and greater fraternity.
Hon. Elie Beauregard, Speaker of the
Senate, (Translation): Mr. President of the
Republic, the Canadian Senate joins with the
Prime Minister in greeting you as the first
citizen of France and in wishing you a most
cordial welcome.
Owing to your visit among us we have the
honour of paying our respects ta Mme. Auriol
and the pleasure of renewing acquaintance
with some of the best builders of the alliance
of nations and of world peace.
Even before your arrival we had heard
of the message you bring to America, a
mesage of co-operation and solidarity. It
will help to strengthen the feeling of true
democracy that Canada has inherited from
its two mother countries.
The position of our country-a country in
some respects so new-its abundant natural
resources and its ideals of life, have caused it
ta occupy in the Council of Nations a place
formerly held by nations of greater population.
Canada enters the scene at a time when
more than ever before, Western democracies
must maintain a social order mindful of
the true scale of values, where money serves
production, where production serves humanity and humanity itself serves an ideal that
gives life its true meaning.
That objective has always been pursued
by the civilizing power that is France.
To-day the French people, who have wit-

nessed, within thirty years, two invasions,
two victories and, need I add, two post-war
periods, remain the unconquered champions
of human freedom. Not only have the French
people fought alone for several years against
Asiatic communism, but they remain the
corner-stone of the fortress which Western
democracies must build in Europe.
Four million Canadians share with the
French people an inalienable heritage, based
on a glorious past and a culture of universai
significance.
One of your historians was
thinking of that past and culture when he
said that England is an empire, Germany a
country, and France a lady.. May I be permitted to offer to that lady, the mother of
letters, arts and arms, the tribute of our
attachment and our admiration.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald, Speaker of the

House of Commons, (Text): Mr. President,
the Speaker of the Senate has expressed to you
in the beautiful French language our appreciation of your eloquent and inspiring address.
May I add. an expression of appreciation in
the English language. Canada is a bilingual
country, and whether we speak in French or
in English we speak the language of Canada.
Canada over the years has been honoured
by visits by the heads of state of several great
countries, but never in its history by the
President of France. Canada was discovered
by a Frenchman in 1534. Our existence,
therefore, has been known for 417 years, andi
although it could hardly be said that we have
waited all those years for this visit, nevertheless I can assure you, Mr. President, that
the warmth of our welcome is in direct ratio
with the warmth of the 417 summers of our
existence.
As we listened ta your address this afternoon we recalled that when we go back to
the birth of our nation we go back to France.
It is interesting to note that when the first
Frenchman arrived in Canada he sailed up
those great waters which were ta be known
as the St. Lawrence, or St. Laurent and that
when the first president of France to visit
Canada arrived in our country he was greeted
by a great prime minister bearing the same
name, St. Laurent.
It was Jacques Cartier, a Frenchman from
St. Malo, who first set foot in Canada and
carried the cross and the fleur-de-lis to the
Island of Hochelaga. It was another Frenchman, Champlain, who established the first
colony in Canada and founded the city of
Quebec.
It was a French Jesuit priest,
Marquette, who first sailed in a frail canoe

Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
perhaps, before the Orders of the Day are

honourable colleagues to the fact that during
the adjournment of the Senate we have lost
one of our members, who has been appointed
a Judge of the Superior Court for the Province of Quebec. I refer to our former colleague from Shawinigan (Hon. Mr. Ferland).
As honourable senators know, for six years
Senator Ferland was a member of this house,
and previously, for nearly eighteen years,

Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
I crave
your
indulgence
for
a
moment to draw attention to the matter
of the examination
of the
estimates which was referred to the Finance
Committee several weeks before the recent
adjournment of the house. At that time the
estimates were allocated to five subcommittees, with the suggestion that they examine
the particular estimates assigned to them
and be prepared, when the house reassembled, to suggest the items which might be
examined into by the Finance Committee. All
members of the committee received that notification. If we are to make any headway in
the examination of these estimates, it is
important, since the task is a very considerable one, that we get to work as soon as
possible.
I hope, therefore, that the subcommittees will be prepared to report to a
meeting of the Finance Committee which is
to be called for Thursday morning at 11
o'clock. I hope that we will be in a position
at that meeting to decide what estimates we
shall inquire into, and other related matters,

NATIONAL RAILWAYS AUDITORS BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. A. K. Hugessen moved the second
reading of Bill 6, an Act respecting the
appointment of Auditors for the National
Railways.
He said: This is a matter which comes
before parliament annually. This bill provides for the appointment of the firm of
George A. Touche and Company as auditors
of the National Railways for the year 1951.
Honourable senators may recall that since
its inception in 1923, this firm has audited
the accoun-ts of the National Railways,
except for the year 1935.
Parliament has provided for the manner
in which the audit shall take place. The provision is set out in section 13 of the Canadian
National-Canadian Pacific Act, 1933, as
amended by the Act of 1936. In effect it
provides that a continuous audit of the
accounts of National Railways be made by
independent auditors appointed annually by a
resolution of parliament, and that they make
an annual report to parliament in respect of
their audit. The firm of George A. Touche
and Company is well known and I do not
think I need give any further explanation
at this stage.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: Have they a Canadian
office?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: They have a number
of Canadian offices.
Hon. Mr. Haig: They have one in my city.
I would not dare go back to Winnipeg if I
failed to say something in favour of this bill.
One of my greatest friends in Winnipeg, a

SENATE

very able man, is a partner in this firm. His
only objection has to do with the size of the
annual fee and I sometimes question the
amount of the stipend myself. The audit is
a tremendous undertaking.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Do you mean that the
stipend is too large or too small?
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is $50,000 a year for
auditing the accounts of the Canadian
National Railways and associated companies.
It is a very great responsibility for the
auditors.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: And a great distinction.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I have never heard anybody question the payment in any way, and
I am not at all surprised at this if the other
members of the firm are as good accountants
as John Parton, C.A., of Winnipeg. It is a
great firm.
Hon. J. J. Kinley: Honourable senators, the

for the last three or four sessions it has been
our habit to send that bill to the Standing
Committee on Transport and Communications, where officials and employees of the
Canadian National Railways are available to
answer questions. I think that is a more
appropriate way to obtain the information
that my honourable friend desires. I fully
agree that this house is just as desirous and
just as much entitled as is the other house
to receive full information every year with
respect to the Canadian National Railways.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I thank the honourable
the deputy leader. I suggested sending this
bill to a committee because the last time we
had a Canadian National Railways financing
bill before a committee I had some difficulty
in getting information. We were told that
the committee was called to consider the
flnancing bill, not to ask questions about
affairs of the Canadian National Railways;
but after some discussion we were allowed a
little latitude. The affairs of the Canadian

in this chamber for some time, I move concurrence in these amendments.
Honourable senators, the amendments suggested by the House of Commons to this bill
are quite simple. They appear on the second
page of the Minutes and Proceedings of
yesterday, and are designed to ensure that
the pipe-line of the company shall be built
entirely within Canada. I am informed that
the sponsors of the bill have no objection
whatever to these amendments, and in order
not to delay proceedings until the honourable
gentleman from Carleton has returned to the
Senate, I would suggest that these amendments be now concurred in.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
The motion was agreed to.
YUKON BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. T. A. Crerar moved the second reading of Bill 188, an Act to amend the Yukon
Act.
He said: Honourable senators, it is quite
unnecessary to enter into a lengthy explanation of the principle of this bill, with which
I am sure everyone here will agree.
The bill has two purposes. The first is to
increase the number of members of the
Yukon Territorial Council from three to five.
The reason for this may be briefly stated.
The older senators here will recall that
following the Yukon gold rush, which commenced in 1896, the population of the Yukon
Territory increased very rapidly until 1898,
when it reached about 40,000. But as the
placer mining declined the population
declined also, and in 1921 it reached the
low point of slightly over 4,000. In keeping
with the falling population, and in order to
lessen expense, the Yukon Territorial Council
was made smaller, and for several years now
it has consisted of three members. However,
with the building of the Alaska Highway
the population tended to go up again, and
it is estimated that today there are approximately 8,600 people in the Territory. In the
light of that fact it is considered desirable

Hon. Mr. Euler: What salary do the members get?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I have not that information here, but it can be obtained in committee.
Hon. Mr. King: Is the council elected or
appointed by the government?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: It is an elected council.
The next amendment, clause 2 of the bill,
readis as follows:
Section one hundred and twenty-nine of the said
Act, as enacted by chapter s'eventy-five of the
statutes of 1947-48, is repealed and the following
substituted therefor:
"129. Except by permission of the Commissioner,
no intoxicating liquor or other intoxicant shall be,
(a) manufactured, compounded, or made in the
Territory, or
(b) imported or brought into the Territory from
any province in Canada or elsewhere."

At present the Commissioner can permit
the importation of intoxicating liquor, but
manufacture of intoxicants within the Territory is prohibited. This amendment would
make it possible to manufacture liquor in
the Territory under the supervision of the
Commissioner. I am not quite clear as to
why the change is necessary, but this information also can be obtained when the bill is
in committee. Probably the intention is to
place the Yukon Territory on the same footing as each of the provinces, by having the
manufacture and importation of intoxicants
under the control of the local authorities. If
the bill is given second reading, I shall move
that it be referred to the Committee on
Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

NORTHWEST TERRITORIES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. T. A. Crerar moved second reading
of Bill 189, an Act to amend the Northwest
Territories Act.
Honourable senators, this bill,
He said:
like the Yukon Bill, is evidence of the march
of progress in the nortihern part of Canada.
By it the boundaries of the Northwest Territories as described in existing legislation are
re-defined. The area comprises all that part
of Canada-excluding the Yukon Territory
beyond the northerly limits of the four western provinces and Ontario and Quebec.
There is in this area at the present time
what is called the Northwest Territorial Council, which until a few years ago was composed

A few
entirely of federal civil servants.
years ago an additional member outside of
the civil service was appointed to the council by the Governor in Council. The bill
before us provides that the council shall
consist of eight members, three of whom
shall be elected and five appointed in the
manner that has governed heretofore. The
bill also provides for the machinery to set
up electoral districts, determines the qualifications of voters in the election of members
to the Territorial Council, and states that at
least two meetings shall take place within
each twelve months, one of which shall be
held at the seat of government-that is
the City of Ottawa-and the other at such
a point as may be designated by the Territorial Council and approved by the Governor
in Council. For instance, it may be desirable
to hold a meeting at Fort Smith, Yellowknife or Fort Simpson, depending on the
particular problem which the Northwest Territorial Council has to deal with at that
meeting.
The bill provides also for the remuneration of the electedi members of the Council,
contains a useful provision for an allowance
for expenses which may be claimed as a
deduction from income for taxation purposes.
Hon. Mr. Moraud: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Discrimination.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The bill sets forth the
number of members which shall constitute
a quorum of the Council for the conduct of
business. These, generally, are the matters
covered in the bill, which gives the people
of the Northwest Territories an opportunity
to elect some of the representatives who shall

progressive step in the matter of selfgovernment.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: When the bill has received
second reading by the house, I shall move,
with the consent of the acting leader (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen), that it be referred to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, where the government officials concerned, can appear and answer such questions
as to details as the members of the committee may ask.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Perhaps the honourable senator could tell us why the members
of council are not all to be elected?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The answer to that question is something which I must pull out of
the air. Heretofore the federal government
has appointed all the members of the council
who govern this territory where the government has bad to bear practically all of the

MAY 2, 1951

expenditure. If that body were a fully
elected council, I presume there would be
a fear that it night possibly enbark on
further expenditures and commit the government to them. My own judgment is that at
this initial stage it is wise to elect only three
of the eight members. I have no doubt that
within measurable time further amendments
will be passed providing for an increased
council and more elective members.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Does not the argument with respect to the Yukon Territory,
where all the members will be elected, also
apply to this area?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I would point out to my
honourable friend that the election of members to the Yukon Territorial Council is a
matter of comparatively recent growth, and
that it went through precisely the same
ambit as the Northwest Territorial Council
is now going through. It must be remembered that it is only within recent years that
there has been a Council of the Northwest
Territories. The population in the area has
increased substantially within, I would say,
the past ten or fifteen years, due mainly to
the development of the radium mines at
Great Bear Lake, where there is now a substantial community. In equally recent times
a community has been established at Fort
Nornan, where certain oil production is
taking place; but more particularly within
the past ten years there has been an increase
in population in the Yellowknife area north
of Great Slave Lake where, at the present
time, several active mines are in operation.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the honourable
senator a question? What is the length of
time for which the elected members will
hold office?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The bill provides for a
period of three years. Perhaps I should add
that if a member dies during his tenure of
office, the Governor in Council has the power
to appoint a successor for the remainder of
the term.
Hon. W. M. Aselline: Honourable senators,
this bill, which provides a step towards selfgovernment in the Northwest Territories, is
to me quite an important measure. As the
territory concerned extends for a great distance north of the 60th parallel of latitudethat is, the northern boundary of the Prairie
Provinces-we senators who come from those
provinces are very much interested in the
proposals contained in the bill.
I have a number of questions that I should
like to ask, and there are a number of the
provisions in the bill which bother me. For
example, I should like to ask where this
government of the Northwest Territories is
going to sit? I think the honourable senator
80713-23j

from Churchill said one sitting would be
held in the City of Ottawa, and another would
be held somewhere in the Northwest Territories. I take it that there would be two
sittings every year. Is that correct?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The bill provides for
two sittings within twelve months.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: One will be in Ottawa
and the other in the Northwest Territories?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: One will be at the seat
of government, which by definition is Ottawa,
and the other at a point in the Northwest
Territories to be fixed by the Northwest
Territorial Council and approved by the
Governor in Council.
As I have stated, the purpose of that provision is to facilitate dealing with local
problems. The territory is quite large. Fort
Smith, for instance, is just beyond the
Alberta boundary; four hundred, or at least
three hundred and fifty miles north of Fort
Smith, is the Yellowknife district; several
hundred miles to the west is the Mackenzie
river and Fort Simpson. There are prospects
of active mineralogical developments at the
eastern end of Lake Athabaska, south-east
of Fort Smith. There may be specific problems relating to each of these particular
areas, and I presume the provision that
meetings of the Northwest Territories Council
may be held at points to be designated is to
enable it more effectively to deal with
matters which then require attention in a
certain district.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I understand that at the
present time all members of the coundil
reside at Ottawa, with the exception of one
member who, as all meetings are held at
Ottawa, comes here to attend them. The
arrangement which has just been explained
marks quite a change from the present
system.
One point which bothers me somewhat is
this. We understand that the council will
consist of eight members instead of, as previously, only five. Three will be elected.
Where will the other five come from? Arethey to be appointed from among the residents of the territories? Are they to be civil
servants?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I have no precise information on that point, but the likelihood isv
that they will be civil servants. Of thepresent Territorial Council, all but one are
civil servants, although not necessarily civil
servants living in Ottawa. One of the members
is the local Commissioner in charge, who i
believe is a resident of Yellowknife; another
member, appointed from outside the service
personnel, is, as I recall, the manager of one
of the mining companies. But I assume that

SENATE
four, or possibly five of the appointed members of the council will be civil servants. That
is a point upon which information cen be
got from the minister or the deputy minister
when we meet in committee.
Hon. Mr. King: The chief official is known
as the Commissioner, and lives in the North?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I understand that in
addition to the eight members of the council
there is a 'Chief Commissioner.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: No doubt it would be
interesting to honourable senators if the
sponsor of this bill could tell us a little more
about the present population of the Northwest Territories. How many people reside
in that district, including Eskimos, Indians
and others; what is its present revenue, and
how much money is appropriated by the
Dominion Parliament towards the government of the territories? While the honourable senator is looking for that information,
I will ask him another question. I am considerably worried about section 8A, which
states:
(1) Subject to subsection two, the Commissioner
in Council may prescribe the qualifications of those
entitled to vote at an election of members to the
Council.
(2) A person is not entitled to vote at an election
unless he is a Canadian citizen, has attained the
age of twenty-one years and has been ordinarily
resident in the Territories for a period of at least
twelve months immediately prior to the date of the
election.

In other words, by section 8A (2) parliament
prescribes who shall be allowed to vote; but
subsection (1) of the same section qualifies
the subsequent subsection by saying that "the
Commissioner in Council may 'prescribe the
qualifications of those entitled to vote at an
election of members to the Council".
I should like to know what, in addition to
the prescription of qualifications of those
entitled to vote, is to be included in the
powers of the Commissioner. It seems to me
that if parliament assumes to prescribe the
qualifications of those to be allowed to vote,
it should prescribe them all, and not leave
any part in the hands of the Commissioner.
To my mind we are being asked to sanction a
departure from the usual practice. I wonder
whether the honourable senator who has
sponsored the bill can explain that feature
of it? Will Indians be allowed to vote? Will
Eskimos be allowed to vote? Will the Commissioner have the right to say whether an
Indian or an Eskimo shall vote? The matter,
it seems to me, is very important and should
I repeat that in my
be fully clarified.
opinion the Parliament of Canada should
define all the qualifications of voters and not
delegate to others the power to prescribe
further requirements.

As regards the cost of administering the
IYorthwest Territories, I think it will be found
that the greater part is defrayed by the
federal government. The revenue from all
the Northwest Territories is only about
$700,000 a year; the expenditure runs to
somewhere between eight and nine million
dollars. If we pay the bill, why should we
not prescribe who can vote, and other related
matters?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I ask my honourable friend if this bill does not remind him
in some respects of the evolution which
occurred and the procedure which was
followed before 1905 in what is now his province of Saskatchewan, as well as in Alberta?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I was not there then.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: It was at that time that
the late Sir Frederick Haultain was seeking
to gain responsible government for those
parts of the Northwest Territories, which was
finally effected through the Autonomy bill
of 1905. It seems to me that the procedure
in connection with the present bill is exactly
the same as was followed at that time. The
natural resources of Saskatchewan and
Alberta did not come under the control of
the provinces until 1930; but there was no
attempt to deny the people of Saskatchewan
and Alberta their provincial rights.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I do not clearly understand my honourable friend, because I do not
know precisely what happened in 1905. When
the Saskatchewan and Alberta acts were
passed, did the government specify the qualifications of voters?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Quite.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: Or were they prescribed
partly by the Government of Canada and
partly by the then Council of the Northwest
Territories? That is my point.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Those new provinces
were given full autonomyHon. Mr. Aseline: I understand that.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: -except the control of
their natural resources. In 1905 and earlier
years, under the very vigorous and able
leadership of Sir Frederick Haultain, efforts
were made to acquire these new powers; but

it took a good deal of time to get them. My
honourable friend from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr.
Calder) could throw a good deal of light on
this subject, because he lived through most
of it.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I am not complaining
about the graduai assumption of self-government by the Territories; I think that is
proper; but I do not think that all eight members of the Council of the Northwest Terri-

MAY 2, 1951
tories should be elected. I am in favour of
three being elected and the remaining five
being appointed by the Governor in Council.
What I am complaining about is section 8A,
which sets out the qualifications of those who
are allowed to vote at an election of members
to the Council.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I will attempt to answer
my honourable friend's last question. Section
8A(2) defines who is not entitled to vote. That
is to say, a person cannot exercise the franchise unless he is a Canadian citizen first, has
attained the age of twenty-one years and has
been ordinarily resident in the Territories for
a period of at least twelve months immediately prior to the date of the election. I think
these provisions are quite usual in a provincial franchise.
Section 8A(l) has brought criticism from
the honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine), who thinks that it is too
restrictive or perhaps too dangerous a power
to be left in the hands of the Council. I take
it that every Indian and Eskimo in the Northwest Territories would come under the definition in section 8A(2), which I have just outlined, but the government of the Northwest
Territories might not wish to give the franchise to all its Indians or Eskimos. This
measure would leave the Council free to do
just as it chose; and, after all, I think the
local governrnent is the best judge of what
should be done in that respect.
The next point that occurs to me is this.
These districts have a very large floating
population. Now, if there should be a referendum or .a vote on the expenditure of money,
would the franchise be limited to those who
are property owners? For instance, you might
have a situation where a majority of the local
population, not owning any property in the
district, might take part in a vote dealing
with an expenditure of money that would
ultimately involve the district in a heavy
expenditure. These are only surmises on my
part, but I take it that this limitation is placed
in the Act as a precautionary measure against
this sort of thing. In other words, the Territorial government will be the judge of whether or not the Indians and Eskimos should
vote.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The Act contemplates that
only citizens can vote. That of course is
proper, but the honourable senator from
Churchill mentioned the possibility of Indians
and Eskimos voting. Are Indians and Eskimos
regarded as citizens, or are they merely
wards of the Crown?
Hon. Mr. Aiseltine: We shall have to wait
until we get to the Indian Act.

Hon. Mr. Crerar: I would take it that they
are wards. At any rate, this is a point which
we can clear up when we get the officers of
the department before us. I am not a lawyer,
but this question would seem to hinge on the
definition of a citizen. My attention is drawn
to the fact that section 8A is practically the
same as the present law.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That does not make it
any bettter.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: My honourable friend
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) raised the question of
expenditures. In 1947-48 the total expenditure by the federal government in the Northwest Territories was $7,758,000. In 1948-49
it was $9,778,000. In 1949-50 it was $7,963,000.
In 1947-48 the revenue accruing was over
$640,000, or roughly 8 per cent of the
expenditure. In 1948-49 the revenue was
$719,000, and in 1949-50 it was $720,000, or
approximately 9 per cent of the expenditure.
Expenditures are heavy at this time for
these reasons. The department has built a
power plant and transmission line on the
Snare River, and it is servicing the local
mines with the electrical energy necessary
for their operation. I understand that the
sale of this power has been placed on a sound
basis. Another reason for heavy spending
is that schools and public buildings have had
to be constructed. I understand, for instance,
that a post office was erected. Honourable
senators must bear in mind that this construction work is going on approximately 800
miles north of Edmonton, and the cost of getting in material is heavy. What we are
really doing here is making an investment in
the development of what promises to be a rich
mineral-producing area. I would say from
my personal knowledge of the whole area
that these expenditures, though apparently
high, are really necessary. In this respect
the situation here bears a similarity to the
situation during the development of new
areas down through our entire history.
Hon. A. W. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
I wish to express sympathy for the member
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar). I have
listened to him on many occasions making
marvelous speeches along democratic lines,
but I never before -found him in the position
that he has been occupying today of trying
to justify something which is the very antithesis of democracy. He did -a good jobThe Hon. the Speaker: The honourable
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
having moved the motion for second reading
and having spoken again, I think he has
closed the debate on this motion.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: With respect, Mr.
Speaker, I thought he was not making

SENATE
a speech when he rose the second time but
was simply answering a question. No warning was given that if he spoke again none of
the rest of us would be permitted to speak.
The Hon. the Speaker: I am simply stating the rule.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: If he was only answering a questionHon. Mr. Hardy: The Speaker is on his
feet.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I have a right to argue
a matter of procedure.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I suggest to His
Honour the Speaker that the fault is mine.
I should have remained in my seat until
other members who desired to speak had had
their say, but I was so eager to relieve the
anxieties of my honourable friend from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) that I rose prematurely. I hope that that fault of mine will
not deprive my honourable friend from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) of the
opportunity of making his observations.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Honourable senators, I
think the point of order taken by His Honour
the Speaker has been well taken, but may I
point out that by unanimous consent it is
always possible to give an honourable senator
leave to speak after the mover of a motion
has spoken the second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Has the honourable
gentleman from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) leave of the Senate to proceed?
Some Hon. Senalors: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I thank you, ladies and,
gentlemen,. As I said, I thought that when
my honourable friend from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) was speaking the second time
he was answering a question and not closing
the debate. However, I will not argue the
point any further. I began by expressing
sympathy for my honourable friend in his
attempt to do the job-and he did it very
well-of supporting what I thought was the
very antithesis of democracy. I would not
have mentioned this had it been anybody
but the member from Churchill, whom I
have so often heard defend democracy in
magnificent speeches.
It is true that the local government should
have the right to regulate who votes locally.
That is done in the Province of Manitoba
and in the Province of Ontario, for instance,
and it is perfectly proper that the local
government should say who should be
enfranchised to elect it. But the Yukon
Territorial Council consists of five civil servants residing in the city of Ottawa, who

are not elected, but appointed by the federal
government, and three members elected from
the locality. One can scarcely imagine any
group that could better be described as a
family compact than these five federal
appointees sitting in the city of Ottawa, not
in the local territory at all, and sitting by
courtesy, shall I say, with three elected
members. To call that a local government is
surely a misnomer.
In the initial stages of a territory like
this there are some things that can very
well be left to an appointed council. There
may be good reasons why the Council should
be composed of five civil servants and three
elected members, but it seems to me that
the very last thing of all that should be
left to a council of that kind is the power
to say who shall and who shall not vote.
My honourable friend from Churchill mentions property. That is to say, those appointed
people may say that only the rich or only
the poor may vote. He mentions Indians and
Eskimos. That is to say, ho suggests that
these appointees shall have the power to say
that people of a certain race may vote and
those of another race may not vote. Is that
a matter to be left to appointees, to civil
servants sitting behind baize doors in the
city of Ottawa? Should they have the power
to control the franchise of people thousands
of miles away? He also talks about a floating
population.
Well, honourable senators, give me these
three things that I have mentioned-a floating
rather than a permanent citizenry, the question of race-and I see no reason why religion
as well should not be included-and property
rights, and if I am inclined to be a family
compact type of man I will see that only
those who vote rightly vote at all. That is
the last thing in the world that should be
left in the hands of an appointed council.
It would be bad enough if the regulations had
to be approved by the Governor in Council
instead of by the Commissioner in Council,
and nothing short of approval by the
Governor in Council should ever be agreed
to by this house. My mind is not influenced
in the slightest by the statement that this
provision was in the Act which we are now
amending.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: This is a new section.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: But, if I understood the
mover rightly, this is not a new provision.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes, it is.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That does not make it
any better or any worse. It should never
pass this house, in my judgment, and I hope

MAY 2, 1951
that when we get into committee we shall
amend the provision by striking out "Commissioner in Council" and substituting
therefor "Governor in Council", so that at
least the responsible government of Canada
will exercise supervision over the decision as
to who may and who may not vote. That
should not be left to those who would be most
seriously affected by the voting.
I compliment the senator from Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) upon having brought this
matter to our attention.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I think that this discussion has been a very
valuable one in drawing the attention of the
Senate to certain provisions of this measure
which obviously require further explanation
in committee. I join with the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) in complimenting my honourable
friend fron Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
upon raising this point. Of course it may be
that there is an explanation which will show
that this subsection 1, which has been so
criticized, is entirely innocent. From the fact
that there are to be eight members on the
council, of whom five are to be appointed and
three elected, and the further fact that there
are a number of Indians and Eskimos resident in the Territory, I should assume that
in al probability the five nominated members
will be chosen as, in a sense, representing
those racial elements which are not directly
represented; and it may wel be that subsection 1 is designed to permit the Commissioner
in Council to extend the franchise later on
to Indians or Eskimos, as necessity may arise.
But that is all a matter of speculation; it is
quite obvious that we must get further
information.
We are indebted to the honourable senators who have taken part in the discussion
this afternoon, and I will make it my business to see that their criticisms and suggestions are brought to the attention of the
permanent officials who will appear before
us in committee to explain the bill, particularly the section which bas been objected
to.
Hon. Salter A. Hayden: Honourable rnermbers, as the discussion bas been taking place
I have been scanning the original statute,
and there is some merit in what the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) has said. I observe that section
8A of the bill, which seems to be the bone of
contention, uses the words "Commissioner
in Council". That obviously means the Commissioner functioning by and with the aid
and advice of members of the Council, which
when the proposed amendments come into
force will consist of three elected members

and five appointed members. But upon
looking at the original Act I find that the
Commissioner in Council was defined even
before there were any elected members. I
take it, therefore, that after the change is
made, the Commissioner in Council referred
to in the original statute will mean the
Commissioner, functioning by and with the
advice of these three elected and five
appointed members.
That only adds to the difficulty which the
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) pointed out. For if we look at
section 9 of the original Act, which is not
referred to at all in the amendments in the
bill, we find that, broadly speaking, the
functions of the Commissioner in Council in
relation to his legislative duties are as broad
in relation to the power that he has as are
the functions of the Governor in Council in
relation to the power which he bas. In
those circumstances, we would not be accomplishing anything by dealing only with the
amendments that are now before us. By
passing these amendments we would simply
be perpetuating an existing rule of law under
which the Commissioner in Council, with a
majority made up of non-elective persons,
could prescribe the basic qualifications of
those who should vote.
I am inclined to agree with the senator
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) and
the senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
that, so long as complete self-government
within the scope of the provincial field is
not given to the Northwest Territories, an
elective body should have the final say with
respect to the right to vote. Unless there are
explanations which have not come before us
in the hurried consideration of this matter
this afternoon, further amendments will be
involved. I think, therefore, that in committee we will have a bigger job than we now
foresee.
Hon. Vincent Dupuis: Honourable senators,
I have for many years studied the various
aspects of the Northwest Territories, especially the rights held by the Hudson's Bay
Company, and I have often asked myself
whether it was not time for the whole matter
to be reviewed. If there ever was a time
when the whole question should be thoroughly
studied, in my opinion it is now. This
country is in reality becoming a nation, and
there should not be a Crown within the
Crown.
I am quite prepared to give full credit to
the Hudson's Bay Company for what it bas
done in the past, but that organization has so
many rights and privileges which no Canadian citizen bas that I think it is time the
whole subject was reviewed.

SENATE
Honourable senators are often under the
impression that public opinion prompts this
house to show greater activity. This is an
opportunity for the members of this high
chamber to prove that something can be done
by them. I humbly suggest, therefore, that
the whole question of the rights of the
Hudson's Bay Company in the Northwest
Territories should be studied by a special
committee of this house.
Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators,
I agree with the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), who
drew our attention to the inadvisability of
conferring unrestricted and dictatorial powers
upon an administrative commission, and I
also concur in the remarks made by the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) to the effect that we could not adequately
deal with this amending bill without reference
to the basic statute the bill purports to
amend. Then, would it not be expedient to
enlarge the order of reference so as to enable
the committee properly to consider all that
is involved?
Some restrictions should be iplaced on the
powers of a commission created to administer
these far-off territories. At least, as suggested by the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity, any regulation or quasi legislation passed by the Commission should be
subject to the supervision and approval of
the Governor-General in Council.
The honourable senator from Rigaud
(Honourable Mr. Dupuis) made reference to
the century-old powers and privileges of the
Hudson's Bay Company. May I recall to the
honourable senator that the company has
rendered great services to this country. True,
we have passed the feudal stage, and we no
longer grant such powers and privileges; but
in 1905, when the provinces of Alberta and
Saskatchewan were created, parliament took
the proper course: it compensated the Hudson's Bay Company; in fact, some of the
rights of the Hudson's Bay Company had
previously been acquired by the Government
of Canada. If we ever convert the Northwest
Territories into an organized province, if any
of the vested rights of the Hudson's B-ay Company are in our way, we ought to follow the
same procedure. Nobody should be compelled
to give up private property except in the
public interest, and only after receiving adequate compensation.
The Hudson's Bay Company is a very
respectable and historic organization. It has
rendered good service in the past, and is still
serving a good purpose. If and when the time
comes that privileges granted centuries ago
should be abolished, this can be done in due

course, by expropriation, with compensation
or otherwise, by mutual agreement.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: May I ask the honourable
senator not to distort my thought, as I never
said that the Hudson's Bay Company should
be deprived of its rights without compensation. I only suggested that a committee of
this house should study the whole question
again. As regards the matter of compensation,
there has been compensation for the loss of
vested rights in other provinces. In 1854,
when seigniorial rights were abolished, the
Province of Quebec compensated the seigniors.
I assumed that the 'committee which I suggested would consider the adoption of a similar course.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I hope I have not distorted
my honourable friend's views; nothing was
further from my thoughts. However, I have
given him the occasion to clarify his statement, and he has made it clear that we
fully agree.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Would the honourable senator tell us what connection or
relationship there is between the Hudson's
Bay Company and this Council, or how this
bill touches the Hudson's Bay Company or
the company touches this bill?
Hon. Mr. Vien: I cannot see any relationship whatsoever. The honourable senator
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck)
raised the point that this territory should be
ad'ministered democratically; that the Governor in Council should supervise and curb the
powers granted to the commission by this
amending bill. I entirely agree with him.
But the honourable senator from Rigaud
(Hon. Mr. Dupuis) went further; be suggested
the abolition of the rights granted centuries
ago to the Hudson's Bay Company.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: On a point of order, I
must rise again and state that I never said,
thought or suggested, directly or indirectly,
that any rights should be taken away without compensation. I merely said that these
questions should be studied by a committee
of this house. There should be some compensation if they are entitled to it. The committee which will be formed will study the
matter.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Everything that has been
said for the last half hour is out of order.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I do not think that I stand
corrected in any way. I simply stated how,
in my opinion, the Hudson's Bay Company's
rights should be dealt with if it became
necessary to abolish them. I did not suggest
that the honourable senator from Rigaud
(Hon. Mr. Dupuis) had stated that the company's vested rights should be taken away

MAY 2, 1951
without compensation. Al I did was to draw
to the attention of the house the necessity of
proceeding in an orderly fashion.
Can we properly organize the Northwest
Territories? We should be anxious to give
these. people their civil and political rights.
Are they ready to exercise them? Are they
capable of doing so?
The honourable senator from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) has given the Senate valuable information, and is, I am sure, anxious
to give the population of these Territories all
the advantages of responsible government;
but that cannot be done before they are
found capable of exercising the political and
civil rights that we enjoy in the rest of
Canada.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: And are interested.
Hon. Mr. Vien: And are interested. It
might be useful to refer the whole matter to
a standing committee. And again, perhaps
would it be a more regular procedure for
the committee to ask for an extension of its
order of reference if, after studying this bill,
it came to the conclusion that the basic Act
should also be referred to it.
Hon. John T. Haig: I had not intended to
take any part in this debate. In a moment
of weakness I requested the honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) to
read this bill and make such representations
about it as he saw fit. I had no idea that it
would raise such a tempest in this chamber,
and I warn the house that I shall never make
the same mistake again. The Act of 1905,
as I recall it, contained all necessary provisions for conducting elections. At that time
there was a representative government in the
Northwest Territories. It was elected by
the people.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: It was just an assembly.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It was the governiment. All
one needs to do is to read the history of the
Territories prior to the Act of 1905. The
people elected their own premier and their
own government, and spent their own money.
The main issue in the Northwest Territories
at the time was how much money they
could get from the federal government to
spend.
Hon. Mr. King: The Territories including
Alberta and Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, Alberta and
Saskatchewan.
I want to congratulate the honourable
member for Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) on
having made a very skilful speech. I must
admit that, like the honourable member from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), I did
80713-24

not know how he was going to skirt around
the provision for electing three men and
appointing five. He did it well; he made a
great fight for it. His ability to do that job
indicates to me that, had he taken up the
vocation of the law, he would be one of the
country's eminent counsel. I do not think
the suggestion of the honourable member for
De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien), that the previous act also be referred to committee for
investigation and report, is a practicable one.
But what we ought to do, what is fundamental to do, is to see that the bill shall
define who can and who cannot vote for the
election of members of the Council. We
should say whether we think, for instance,
that Indians or Eskimos, non-landowners or
any other group, should have the right to
vote in these elections. After all, we pass
the laws here, and it is most unfair to put
the onus on the Council, no matter who its
members are, to decide who shall or shall not
vote. A great deal of .complaint is made
throughout this country that the members of
the Canadian Senate are not elected. We
justify our position by claiming that the men
who appoint us are themselves elected, and
thus have the right to make appointments.
I congratulate the honourable senator from
Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) for going to the
crux of this whole question: should we not
define in the Act who can vote and who can
not vote. If we find through experience that
there should be a wider franchise, well and
good.
The honourable senator from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) made a good case for his
bill, and I am willing that it be sent to committee. I must say also that I enjoyed the
speech made by the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck).
In conclusion, I would suggest that the
boundaries of the provinces of Manitoba,
Saskatchewan and Alberta be extended to
include the Northwest Territories. I do not
know whether the Prairie Provinces would
agree to this, but I think it would give the
people now living in the Northwest Territories a better form of government. Regardless of the capabilities of the civil servants
who are now appointed to the Council, I think
the provincial legislatures would be better
able to administer the affairs of these people
because they are closer to them. For instance,
the boundaries of Manitoba already extend
beyond The Pas, Flin Flon and Churchill. I
particularly offer this suggestion to the
honourable senator from Rigaud (Hon. Mr.
Dupuis). I must say that I was somewhat
hurt by his reference to the Hudson's Bay
Company. The Canadian headquarters for
this company are in Winnipeg, and I would go

SENATE

so far as to say that to my knowledge it is
the most reputable firm in Canada.
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: It has no special
privileges.
Hon. Mr. Howden: The privileges of trade
and government granted by the ancient
charter of the Hudson's Bay Company were
taken over by the Dominion of Canada many
years ago.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Quite true, and that is why
I am objecting ta the question even being
raised.
Honourable senators, if a special committee
is set up to inquire into this whole matter, I
think serious consideration should be given
to the proposal to extend the present boundaries of the three Prairie Provinces to include
the Northwest Territories.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I shall not keep the house
at any length, but I want to refer ta an interesting point raised by the honourable leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig). I think it would
be an error to define in this statute who
should have the right to vote in the Northwest Territories. It would be a case of an
outside authority dealing with a matter which
is largely one of local concern. I am sure
that a tremendous outcry would have been
raised had anyone ever suggested that the
provisions for provincial franchise be directed
by Ottawa. I admit the force of what my
honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck) has said, and I am aware of
the support his criticism has received from
other members of the house. The point
raised is a most interesting one.
This
Territorial Council is a form of local government, just as much as are the Legislatures of
Saskatchewan, Manitoba or Ontario.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Who pays the bill?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The objection is that the
majority of members of this Council are
civil servants. That has always been the
case. For many years Dr. Charles Camsell
served as Commissioner of the Northwest
Territories. I do not think there could have
been found in the whole of Canada a man
who was more trustworthy or who had a
wider knowledge of the area which he was
adýministering than Dr. Camsell. His advice
naturally carried great weight.
Honourable senators, we are engaged here
in a sort of transition period, and I hope
that before many years have passed the
Northwest Territories will have complete local
self-government, without any interference
from Ottawa. I would remind the house, however, that in the last three years the federal
government has made necessary expenditures

of over $25 million in the Northwest Territories, so it is quite understandable that the
federal authorities should wish to retain for
a time at least some measure of control over
such expenditures. Apart from the purely
theoretical question, I submit this is a
practical consideration that is entitled to be
given some weight. I can assure my honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity that my
explanation of this bill does not lessen in any
degree my faith in the democratic principle.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I am quite satisfied of
that, sir.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
Hon. Mr. Crerar moved that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
CANADIAN SHIPS IN FOREIGN TRADE
NOTICE OF INQUIRY

Hon.

Mr. Duff:

Honourable senators,

I

have been very patient in listening to my
free-trade friend from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) and others discussing this important
matter of the Northwest Territories, and now
I wish to give notice of an inquiry for Friday.
I am rising on the Orders of the Day, and I
think I am in order.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, on a
point of order, bas the honourable gentleman
permission of the house to proceed?
The Hon. the Speaker: As objection has
been taken, I must rule that unless the honourable gentleman from Lunenburg (Hon.
Mr. Duff) has leave of the Senate, he may
not proceed.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Mr. Speaker, I submit that
I am not out of order. We are on the
Orders of the Day.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, we are not.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: We are away beyond
that point.
Hon. Mr. Duff: As I said before, I have
been very patient in listening to my friend
from Churchill-and there is nobody in the
house for whom I have more respect-and
my friend from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
and others talking about the Northwest
Territories, and the Indians and their squaws
and so on, and I think I should be allowed
to give notice of this inquiry.
The Hon.

the

Speaker:

Has the honour-

able gentleman permission to proceed at this
stage?

MAY 2, 1951
Some Hon. Senators: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Duff: I could postpone the notice
of inquiry until tomorrow or next week, for
that matter, but I think it is in order for me
to present it now. My inquiry is as follows:
1. How many ships of Canadian registry are in
the foreign trade, giving name, tonnage and route?
2. How many government departments are concerned in the supervisoin of said ships?
3. What is the cost of said' organization per year?
4. What is the cost of each ship to the government?

That is a very simple inquiry, honourable
senators.
THE SENATE AND ITS WORK
MOTION-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Wednesday,
March 21, the adjourned debate on the
motion of Hon. Mr. Robertson for the
appointment of a special committee to inquire
into and report upon how in its opinion the
Senate may make its maximum contribution
to the welfare of the Canadian people.
Hon. C. J. Venioi: Honourable senators,
in venturing to take part in the present
debate, I may say immediately that it is not
my intention to weary you with a long dissertation; nor do I intend to review any of
the excellent speeches which have been made
so far. Rather, I wish to limit my remarks
to one phase of the resolution, namely, the
composition of the Senate.
Practically everything that could be said
on the merits and demerits of the Senate has
already been presented' in one form or
another, and it would serve no useful purpose
and add nothing to the discussion if I were
to examine or repeat some of the arguments
previously advanced. There remains, however, something important to be said about
the composition of the Senate.
We are all one-minded concerning the
necessity of an upper chamber as a proper
balance-wheel in the government of the
nation. We are also agreed concerning the
aims and intentions of the Fathers of Confederation when they decided upon the establishment of the Senate. The trend of discussion has also indicated that there is unanimity
upon another point, namely, that there is
at present-and there has been for some time
-an
underlying, undefined, hidden factor,
which is inspiring and inflaming unjustified
criticism against the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Quite right.
Hon. Mr. Veniot: But we are not agreed
on what this factor is, nor on what methods
should be employed to counteract this
criticism.
80713-241

I submit that it may be stated with a
reasonable amount of correctness that oe
of the chief factors In the criticism levelled
at the Senate is the fear which lurks in the
minds of a great part of the Canadian public
that the number of government supporters in
the Senate may bécome so overwheliningly
large that the opposition party may become
practically extinct. Thus, in the public mind,
the Senate would become a one-party institution, and lose entirely the spirit of fairmindedness and the judicial character which
was intended for it by the moulders of
confederation.
If you will review the c1amour for Senate
reform which has surged at certain periods
in the last fifty years you will find. that the
criticism always reached its maximum intensity when government forces, either Liberal
or Conservative were at their peak and the
opposition element was depressed (to its
lowest level.
The Fathers of Confederation never meant
the Senate to be what it is today-a onesided, top-heavy body. Macdonald, Cartier,
Brown and others never visualized a Senate
composed of 90 per cent Liberals and 10 per
cent Conservatives, or vice versa.
I admired the generosity and the magnanimity of the honourable leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) when, at the
beginning of this debate, he asserted that in
his estimation the Senate, in spite of al
criticism, continues to maintain a spirit of
impartiality and to function as a judicial body
when it considers legislation. He made that
statement as a tribute to the fair-mindedness
of his fellow senators of al political colours,,
notwithstanding the fact that he and his
followers are outnumbered nearly ten to one
by Liberal appointees.
All of us are in agreement with him on
this particular point, but nobody will ever
convince me that popular opinion throughout
Canada is of the same frame of mind. Say
what you like on this score, the public of
Canada will never be made to believe that
ninety Liberal senators will completely divest
themselves of their political affiliations and
leanings when discussing legislative measures
introduced in the Commons by a Liberal
government. The same trend of thought permeates the public mind when Conservatives
are in the driver's seat and the Liberals are
in opposition.
I therefore realize what was in the minds
of the honourable senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) and the honourable
senator from Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard)
when they suggested thal one-third of the
senators should be appointed by the provinces.

SENATE
The same thought no doubt inspired the
honourable leader of the government (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) when he suggested that a
portion of the Senate should be elected by
the people. We can all see that the gist of
their thoughts and of their planning is aimed
at restoring public confidence in the Senateby changing the political complexion or
physiognomy of the upper chamber, by
transfusing new blood into its ranks, by
having a greater variety of political representation in its make-up. They realize-and
we all should admit the fact-that in the
public mind our present Liberal top-heaviness
is not a healthy situation, and is not conducive to instilling confidence in the Senate
among the rank and file of the nation.
The public at large will continue its present attitude of mistrust of the Senate so long
as this body continues to be lopsided in its
political composition, as it is at the present
time, whether the swamping majority be
Liberal or Conservative.
I am sure that every member of this house
is convinced of the need of maintaining at
all times an opposition of sufficient numerical
strength to not only reassure the public concerning the honesty of purpose of the Senate
and the sincerity of its intentions with regard
to all legislation, but also to stimulate healthy
discussion and throw plenty of light on every
question presented to us.
The big question is, how can we remedy
the present anomalous situation? What can
we do to restore public confidence?
As a preface to the suggestion I have to
submit, may I relate an incident concerning
the appointment of a New Brunswick senator? In the latter part of July, 1935 my late
father, who was then a member of the opposition, in the House of Commons, telephoned
me one evening asking me to come to his
home to discuss with him a matter of importance which had suddenly cropped up. When
I joined him a few minutes later he handed
me a letter from the Right Honourable R. B.
Bennett, then Prime Minister of Canada, in
which the leader of the government asked
him if he would be good enough to help him
solve a dilemma which confronted him. He
wrote somewhat as follows:
As a leader among the Acadians you are in a
better position than I te judge which one of the
gentlemen whose names I submit to you is best
qualified to represent the Acadians of New Brunswick in the Senate as successor to the late Senator
Pascal Poirier, who was so highly thought of by
everybody who knew him. I shall abide by your
recommendation and make the appointment as you
suggest, well knowing your deep interest in the
welfare of your fellow Acadians and the publicspiritedness which always animates you.

It did not take long for us to make a choice
from the panel of names submitted, and a
letter was despatched that same night to the
Prime Minister recommending J. Antoine
Leger, of Moncton, who formerly had been
Secretary-Treasurer of the Province of New
Brunswick. Fifteen days later Leger was
summoned to the Senate.
I do not think many appointments to the
Senate have been made under similar circumstances. Here is the case of a Conservative
Prime Minister asking one of his bitterest
political opponents, but one whom he knew
to be a square shooter, to practically make
an appointment to the Senate for him. It is a
worthy example of two political antagonists
setting aside their partisan differences and
placing the welfare of their country first and
foremost in the selection of a man who would
best serve the nation.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Veniot: Some years later, when
I related to Senator Leger the circumstances
which surrounded and infiuenced his call to
the Senate, he said: "You know, your father
and I have always been political opponents,
but I always had for him a great regard and
deep liking. Now I know the reason why!"
I come now 'to the suggestion which bas
been in my mind for some time. I submit
that by constitution or by other arrangement
-preferably
by other arrangement, if it
could be had-the Senate should, be so cornposed that at all times not less than onefourth of its membership shall constitute an
official opposition party. I further suggest
that if and when the number of senators in
the opposition drops below the one-fourth
level, it shall be the privilege and the duty
of the official leader of the opposition in the
Senate, associated with the official leader of
the opposition in the Commons, to recommend
to the Governor General in Council-in other
words to the Prime Minister-a panel of
names of persons qualified to enter the Senate to fill the ranks of the opposition, in the
Senate so as to maintain it at the determined
level.
Furthermore, there are four senatorial
divisions, three of which are each entitled
to 24 senators; and one, the Maritimes division, which since the inclusion of Newfoundland in confederation bas been entitled to
have 30 senators. I therefore suggest that the
opposition leaders should not recommend the
appointment of more than one-fourth of the
total number of senators in any one division,
or more than one-fourth of the number of
senators in any particular province; otherwise, it might be possible to appoint the entire

MAY 2, 1951
opposition party in the Senate from one
province or from one senatorial division,
which would not be desirable
I know that in making these suggestions, I
am treading on the partisan toes of several
of my friends; but I also know that the plan
meets with the approval of men who are
broad-minded enough to place the interests of
their country foremost.
There is nothing in the constitution of the
country which prevents a Prime Minister
from asking leaders of opposition parties to
recommend to him a panel of names from the
ranks of their supporters for appointment ta
the Senate, from which panel the Prime
Minister in turn could make recommendations to the Governor General. The most
difficult problem to my mind would be to
determine what is a reasonable opposition.
Should that number be 25, or should it be 30,
out of 102 senators? That can be worked out
later.
Several proposals have been made to bring
about a change in the political complexion of
the Senate. But the suggestion I have just
submitted seems to offer the simplest and
least complicated method. It eliminates the
objections to an elective portion of the

Senate. It does away with possible new
sources of friction, which might occur
between central and provincial governments
if provinces were to make appointments to
the Senate. Finally, it preserves the original
method of appointment adopted by the
Fathers of Confederation, and prevents the
Senate from being "packed"-if I may use
the word-with appointees from any one
particular political party.
I do not pretend that the proposal is a
cure-all for the problems which confront the
Senate; I do, however, maintain that some
change along these lines is necessary if we
are to hold the confidence of the people of
Canada and make the general public feel that
the Senate is at least constituted in such a
way that it can more efficiently fulfil the task
which was assigned to it by the Fathers of
Confederation.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: Honourable senators, I
move the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

HAMILTON HARBOUR COMMISSIONERS
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. G. P. Campbell moved the second
reading of Bill 196, an Act respecting the
Hamilton Harbour Commissioners.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
amends the Hamilton Harbour Commissioners
Act of 1912. The purpose of the bill is to
extend the powers of the Harbour Commissioners, to enable them to acquire lands for
amusement purposes and to erect thereon
such facilities as may be considered necessary.
When the commission was created, in 1912,
it was granted all the general powers given
to other harbour commissions in the country,
namely, power to acquire lands and to develop
them for harbour purposes, together with the
necessary facilities. Last year 'the City of
Hamilton decided it was advisable that the
Harbour Commissioners should acquire certain lands for recreational purposes, and it
petitioned the Department of Transport to
have the Act amended so as to permit this.
After investigation and consideration the
department approved of the amendment, in
the form of the bill now before us, which
bas already been passed by the other house.
The extra ýpowers proposed to be given to
the Commissioners are clearly set out in
-clause 2 of the bill, which reads as follows:
2. The Hamilton Harbour Commissioners, hereinafter called "the Corporation," in addition to all
other powers vested in them, may conduct, on the
lands of the Corporation in the City of Hamilton
and in the township of Saltfleet, amusements,
recreation grounds, playgrounds and public bathing
beaches, or arrange with others to conduct the
same, and may charge or receive compensation for
the use of and admission to such grounds and
beaches and enjoyment of such amusements, and
may permit others to conduct and operate such
amusements, recreation grounds, playgrounds and
public bathing beaches, and to make charges therefor either wholly for themselves or partly for
themselves and partly for the Corporation, or
wholly for the Corporation, as the Corporation may
think proper.

The Hon. the Speaker: When shall these
bills be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: With leave of the Senate
now.
Hon. Mr. Duff: No, tomorrow.
Clause 3 of the bill
Hon. Mr. Haig: I would ask the honourable that is, the Harbour
senator from Lunenberg (Hon. Mr. Duif) not to spend money for

at this time. We are anxious that they be and to borrow money

subclause 2 of clause 3 makes all the provisions of the general statute passed in 1912
applicable to the powers granted under this
measure.
As the bill is so simple I would suggest
that, with leave of the Senate, it be adopted
without reference to a -committee.
Hôn. Mr. Aseltine: Can the honourable
member say how much money the commissioners intend ta spend 'under this bill?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: No estimate has been
made to date. The Harbour Commissioners,
like all other similar bodies, would have
control over the amount to be spent.

the

Hon. Mr. Campbell: It will be raised by
the City of Hamilton. The procedure followed
is the same as that followed in other cities
which have a separate Harbour Commission
charged with the administration of lands;
that is, the commission, with the approval of
the municipal corporation, issues securities
against the lands.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I ask the honourable
gentleman who explained the bill if it gives
the harbour commissioners authority to lease
these lands to some body, such as the City of
±Iamilton?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: The powers go that
far. After the lands are acquired and the
facilities erecte,
the commissioners may
operate them themselves-as I believe is
done in the City of Toronto-or they may
operate them jointly with the City of Hamilton, or with any individual selected for that
purpose. The terms of the agreement would
of course be negotiated between the representative of the Harbour Commissioners and
the poople who were entering into such a
joint arrangement for the operation of the
facilities.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I ask my honourable friend if the Hamilton harbour board is
not entirely under the jurisdiction of the
National Harbours Board, with headquarters
in Ottawa?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: No.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: As I understand it, the
position of the harbour commissions was
changed in 1935. At one time there was a
narbour commission for each harbour, but
now all are controlled by the National Harbours Board. Does that arrangement not
apply to Hamilton?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: That is not the case
so far as Hamilton and Toronto are concerned. I may say to the honourable gentleman that under the provisions of the original

Act one commissioner is appointed by
Corporation of the City of Hamilton and
commissioners are appointed by order of
Governor in Council. The majority of
commissioners come under the control of
federal authorities.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Did I understand the
honourable gentleman to say that the local
commission operates amusements, bathing
beaches, and that sort of thing, at Sunnyside
in the City of Toronto?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: The development of
the facilities at Sunnyside is vested in the
harbour commission. As far as the bathing
beaches in Toronto are concerned, they are
operated by either the City of Toronto or by
the harbour commission. The other facilities are leased out ta various individuals; but,
as I say, the development of the area is
under the jurisdiction of the Toronto Harbour Commissioners.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: In answering the senator
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) the honourable gentleman referred to a harbour commission. I should like to repeat somewhat
the same question as was asked. Is there a
harbour commission for Hamilton?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: I do not quite follow the
discussion.
The honourable senator fron
Ottawa has stated that the commissions were
abolished in 1935.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Not all of them.
Hon. Mr. Campbell:
The National Harbours Board has control over certain national
harbours, such as Montreal, Halifax, St.
John's and the coastal harbours.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: And Quebec and
Vancouver.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Under the Hamilton
Harbour Commissioners Act passed in 1912
the harbour was vested in that body. The
full powers are set forth in the Act, and the
administration has since been under the control of the Hamilton Harbour Commission,
consisting of one member appointed by the
Hamilton City Council and two members
appointed by order of the Governor in
Council.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: It is very much the same
as the City of Toronto Harbour Commission.
-ion. Mr. Campbell: The same thing.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I should like to get a
little more information.
I take it that the
corporation-that is, the Hamilton Harbour
Commission-is the creature of the federal
government; that is to say, iL owes its corporate existence to legislation passed by
parliament?

MAY 3, 1951
Hon. Mr. Campbell: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: To what extent is the
government responsible for the acts of this
board, set up under federal legislation, in
the matter of operating amusements, ball
parks and so on? Supposing, in the operation of these amusements, some accident
happens and there is loss of life, is there any
responsibility on the part of the federal
government?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: None whatever. The
Act is really an Act of incorporation, which
forms the body and gives it powers, as does
every Act of incorporation.
Hon. Mr. Crerar:
Then it is really a
private bill?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Yes. It vests the land
in the Harbour Commissioners, with full
powers to administer, borrow on, control and
operate all these lands. There is no responsibility whatever so far as the Dominion
Government is concerned.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Does the federal government appoint two of the commissioners?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Yes. Under the provisions of the act of 1912, two of the commissioners are appointed by the Governor-inCouncil.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: In case of a deficit,
where is the board to go to get it liquidated?
If some of these amusements lose money
instead of making it, will the City of
Hamilton provide the deficit, or can the
commissioners apply to the Dominion Government?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Well, they have no
recourse to the Dominion Government. I
suppose this corporation is in exactly the
same position as many others; they have to
provide for their financing by borrowing
from the public. I am not very familiar with
the type of financing that has already been
done in Hamilton, but I know the situation
as far as Toronto is concerned. There, the
commissioners do their financing by public
offerings of securities approved and endorsed
by the City of Toronto, and the City of
Toronto will provide money froni time to
time as it is required. I assume that in the
case before us the same procedure will be
followed. If a deficit results from the commission's operations, it will be defrayed from
the general revenues derived from Hamilton
harbour-from sales and leases of land, and
so forth. But there is no responsibility so far
as the Dominion Government is concerned
to meet deficits, if any arise.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: By way of information I may say that Vancouver has two

harbour boards; one, the National Harbours
Board, which took over the former Vancouver Harbour Board; and a harbour board
on the North Fraser River, which is run by
representatives of the Dominion Government. In addition, there is a harbour board
at New Westminster. These boards make
certain charges in the form of harbour dues,
and pay for the facilities from the dues they
collect and from the proceeds of leases of
land. In the case of Hamilton the administration will be by a private body, instead
of by the National Harbours Board. I will
not inquire as to which is the more desirable.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I am doubtful about
this legislation. Under this bill it is sought
to incorporate a company with powers to run
amusements, recreation grounds, playgrounds
and public bathing beaches. That is the
vital element in this bill: the purpose of the
company is to run amusements. The only
ground on which we can interest ourselves
in the Hamilton harbour is the item in the
British North America Act which places
harbours under the jurisdiction of the
Dominion Government. In this case, on the
excuse of there being a harbour and a barbour board, we are invited to go into the
amusement business and incorporate a company for that purpose. The City of Hamilton
bas always been pretty good at that kind of
thing. For some years I was a member of
the Hydro Commission, which inadvertently
became the owners of the Hamilton Street
Railway. It was wished on to the commission when that body purchased the DeCew
Falls for its power facilities. The City of
Hamilton stood aside and let us run their
street railway at a deficit year after year.
We could not get anybody to take it off our
hands. To me this bill is reminiscent of that
experience. The City of Hamilton is getting
the Dominion Government, or a -corporation
incorporated by the Dominion Government,
to run its amusements for it. Personally I do
not like the project. It may be all very
well to develop these harbour lands along
the Unes suggested by the honourable senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell), and
perhaps lease them to somebody else who
may conduct on the lands of the corporation
amusements, recreation grounds, playgrounds
and public bathing beaches; but to give to
a dominion corporation power to go into the
amusement business, with all its liabilities
and risks as well as possibilities of dividends,
does not greatly appeal to me, and I would
not approve of the passing of this bill without
reference to a committee. I think we ought
to make careful inquiry with regard to what
it is intended to do, how the corporation's
powers can be exercised, and whether,

SENATE

instead of giving them the right to conduct
an amusement establishment, we should not
limit them somewhat.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: In answer to the honourable senator from Toronto, I would point
out that there is nothing new whatever in
these proposals.

MAY 3. 1951
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. G. Turgeon moved the second reading of Bill D-8, an Act to incorporate Independent Pipe Line Company.
He said: Honourable senators, it is not
necessary for me to say that when this bill
bas been given second reading, I shall move
that it be referred to the Standing Committee
on Transport and Communications, where I
am sure it will receive careful examination.
Honourable senators, I am quite anxious to
hear the honourable member from Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis) speak this afternoon in the general debate on Senate reform,
so I shall not detain the house very long in
explaining the bill now before us. There are
one or two points, however, that I should
mention.
So far as oil is concerned, the general market in the Vancouver-New WestminsterFraser Valley area is sufficiently large to
amply justify the construction of a pipe-line
from the oil fields of Alberta to the Pacific
Coast. It is proposed that the pipe-line shall
start at Edmonton Terminal, which is twelve
miles from Edmonton, and that its over-all
length shall be approximately 720 miles. It
will run through Yellowhead Pass and Kamloops and then follow the Canadian National
and Canadian Pacific railway lines and, in
some places, the main highway to Port Mann
and Port Moody. From the Vancouver-New
Westminster area it will run south into the
northwest portion of the United States. As I
said before, the market in the part of British
Columbia concerned will justify the expenditure of the sixty odd million dollars that will
be required to build the 720 mile pipe-line,
and the company will be left with sufficient
capital to carry on its business. It is hoped
that before long new refineries will be constructed in the Vancouver and Fraser Valley
areas.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Will this company be a
common carrier?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Yes. Under the laws of
Alberta an oil-carrying company must be a
common carrier; and since this pipe-line will
cross provincial boundaries there is no doubt
whatever that it will be a common carrier,
and that its facilities to the Pacific Coast will
be available to all purchasers of oil.
Hon. Mr. Vien: What is the particular significance of the word "Independent" in the
name of the company?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: I understand that it is
merely a part of the name, and that it has
no particular significance. I hope the committee that will deal with this bill will meet

next Wednesday, and I know that the sponsors of the bill will be glad to answer any
questions at that time.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Is this company related to
any oil company or is it independent in that
respect?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: It is not independent of
any oil company because, naturally, those
who are interested in the production of oil are
those who are likely to be interested in the
transmission of oil. I may say that those
interested in the Federated 0il Company are
the ones most interested in the Independent
Pipe Line Company. To all intents and purposes this is a Canadian company with a
purely Canadian group financing the construction of the pipe-line.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Could my honourable
friend tell me whether the Independent Pipe
Line Company plans to run its line through
the same territory as that of the Trans Mountain Oil Pipe Line Company? If this is so,
will both companies use the same pipe-line as
a .common carrier?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: That is a matter on
which naturally they will have to get together.
I would imagine that at first only one
company would receive authority from the
Board of Transport Commissioners to construct a pipe-line; and as every oil pipe-line
would be a common carrier, all oil producers
would be able to use the facilities of whatever company secured the right to build. So
far as this particular company is concerned,
there is a definite provision within the bill
itself that the construction of the pipe-line
must be within Canadian territory right
through to the points indicatedi, Port Mann
and Port Moody; so under this legislation
the line would have to reach the New Westminster-Vancouver area before the company
could start to build towards any market in
the south.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Has my honourable
friend any estimate of the required volume
of oil that will pass through that line?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: As honourable members
know, the Conservation Board of Alberta
permits only a certain production-at present,
roughly 200,000 barrels daily. However, the
present market is about 150,000 barrels daily,
leaving some 50,000 barrels of oil per day
available for transmission, whichever company may happen to handle it; and besides
there will be increased production in the
future. I was an Albertan before I went to
British Columbia, and I am hopeful that
Alberta oil production will increase so greatly
in the very near future as to give this country
a great deal of relief from its present necessity of spending foreign currency. I do not

SENATE

think that there will be any difficulty in
getting from Alberta sufficient oil to supply
not only the market in British Columbia but
part of the market in the northwest portion
of the United States.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I have one question to ask
the honourable senator, but first may I say
that I think parliament never before had such
an epidemic of pipe-line bills. While of
course we welcome certain oil pipe-lines, in
my humble opinion there are going to be a
lot of "squeeze plays" among the various
companies in their eagerness for business,
because it seems evident that there will not
be room for all the pipe-lines that have been
approved by parliamen.t. My question is this:
What economic justification is there for taking
the pipe-line across from Port Mann to Port
Moody? Port Mann is growing fast at present
and may well be the hub of a great city
extending from Vancouver to the boundary,
a city the equal of Chicago, I believe.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Will it take in
Vancouver?
Hon. Mr. Reid: It will keep on growing
until it takes in Vancouver.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That is a pipe dream.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It may be, but I believe
that if you go out there and see the rapid
development you will agree with me. Port
Mann is the distributing centre at the head
of the finest fresh water port in Canada,
where ships could load oil for transport to
Vancouver and the Fraser Valley as well as
to the United States. I cannot understand
why the line should be taken from there
across to Port Moody.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: I would suggest to my
honourable friend from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid) that if he wants to induce
the government to dredge the river he had
botter get tme business at Port Mann. The
big oil tankers draw from thirty-one to
thirty-two fot of water, and with the present
depth of the chanuel they would, as sailors
say, smell the bottom. In order to enable
these large ships to enter the port the channel
would have to be dredged.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That is one more reason
why the line should end at Port Mann.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Perhaps I should add
that both Port Mann and Port Moody will
benefit through the passing of this measure.
As the honourable senator from New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) knows, there is
at present no oil refinery in New Westminster.
There are oil refineries adjacent to the city
of Vancouver itself-they are of small capaity, it is true, but still they are refineriesand the sponsors of this bill intend to pro-

vide a transmission line so that oil will be
available to existing refineries and any
others that may be constructed as a result
of the development in Alberta. I understand
that when the oil is carried by pipe-line to
Port Moody it can be supplied to the refinery
from the end of the line by gravity, at a much
lesser cost than if a pumping station had to
be built and operated.
I also understand
that, because of the lay of the land and so
on, if a refinery is established at New

Westminster it will be a very simple matter
to bring oil there from Port Mann. But if a
refinery is built at New Westminster, that

will not prevent the continued flow of oil to
Port Moody in order to supply the present
refineries in Vancouver.
As to my honourable friend's comment on
the large number of pipe-line bills, I would
point out that two or three years ago parliament passed general legislation providing
that no company could apply to the Board

of Transport Commissioners for permission
to

build

a

pipe-line

without

first

having

secured a charter from parliament.
Hon. Mr. Reid: But the purpose of that
general legislàtion was to control the number
of companies applying for charters; and we
are not controlling them.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
Hon. Mr. Turgeon moved that the bill be

referred to the Standing Committee
Transport and Communications.
The motion was agreed to.

on

THE SENATE AND ITS WORK
MOTION-DEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Robertson for the appointment of a special

committee to inquire into and report upon
hnow in its opinion the Senate may make its
maximum contribution to the welfare óf the
Canadian people.
Hon. Iva C. Fallis:

Honourable senators,

I regret very much that because of unavoidable circumstances it was not possible for
me to participate in this debate earlier.

So

many speeches have been made on the subject, from almost every conceivable angle,
that I must confess it is with some diffidence
that I rise at this late stage to make my
small contribution.

In the early stages of the debate the honourable senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Haig) gave us a very clear-cut picture of why
the Senate was first established and what

MAY 3, 1951

duties and obligations were entrusted to it by
the Fathers of Confederation. He stressed
the fact that all through the years that
followed those duties and obligations had
been faithfully discharged. With that conclusion I think all members are in agreement. But as the debate progressed it
became increasingly apparent that there is a
very sharp division of thought in this
chamber. We are not all agreed as to where
we go from here.
There are perhaps two distinct schools of
thought. The members who belong to the
first group sincerely and conscientiously
believe that if we as senators discharge our
duties in the future as conscientiously as we
have in the past, that is all that is necessary,
and we should not pay too much attention
to outside criticism. There is a second group
which reasons something like this: Times
have changed; conditions have changed in
the past few years; conditions which the
Fathers of Confederation could not have
foreseen now pertain in this chamber. They
argue that if this body is to fulfil its duty to
the country as a whole, certain changes
should be made to make it more representative of public opinion. Personally, I find
myself in agreement with the thought and
the principle advanced by the second group,
but not at all in agreement with most of
their arguments.
When I look over the chamber as it is
constituted today, in my opinion it presents
two major defects. The first is that there
are not enough women here.
Sone Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: The second is of course
that there are too few members in the opposition ranks. The honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) in the
course of a very fine speech which he made
in this debate, made the statement-which
of course is absolutely true-that it is entirely
the prerogative of the Prime Minister of
this country to make appointments to this
chamber, and that he, the honourable. senator, did not propose to give advice or make
suggestions until he was asked. Well, I arn
very grateful that the senators who followed
were not as modest as was the senator from
Toronto-Trinity, for they al immediately
began to make suggestions and to give advice,
and by so doing established a precedent for
me.
While I would not for one moment presume
to give advice to anybody in authority, I do
not see that it is at all amiss for this house or
any member of it to make suggestions. This
is being done all the time by people outside
the chamber, by individuals and by organiza-

tions; so why not by those of us inside who
would be most affected by any change that
might occur?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: As an illustration, may
I cite the recent resolution sent to the Prime
Minister by the National Council of Women,
a body which represents tens of thousands
of women from coast to coast in this country.
That resolution contains three recommendations, two of which I have already mentioned,
namely, that more women should be
appointed to this house and that the government should take some immediate steps to
strengthen the opposition in this house. As
honourable senators know, I have more than
once in this chamber referred to the valiant
battle which was waged by leaders of Canacian women in order to gain them admission
to this house. Now more than twenty years
after the decision handed down by the Privy
Council determining that women were eligible
to sit in the Senate, what is the result? We
have two women members. And probably at
this moment some honourable senator saying
softly under his breath, "And that is just
two too many". Frankly, honourable senators, I am surprised-no, I am baffled-as
to why a country like Canada, which prides
itself on being so progressive in many ways,
lags so badly in the recognition of its women.
India, the Scandinavian countries, Britain,
and nearly every European country, could
set us an example. Yet we call ourselves
progressive. That presents a question which
to me is very difficult to answer. I do not
know whether any of my male colleagues
have an answer for it or not.
As the debate progressed, some of the
speakers stressed very strongly the need
for a wider representation of all phases of
public opinion in this house. Why not start
with the women, and give them greater
representation? By doing so you would be
giving representation to a great body of
public opinion. I very freely admit that the
two of us who are here have no cause for
complaint; we have been very well treated
indeed.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: There is only one lady
member in the House of Commons.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: But we would,like to see
our membership in the Senate increased.
For years after my appointment to this
house, while speaking at 'women's organizations of various kinds I have dozens of
times been asked: "How do the two women
senators fare in the august red chamber?
Are you received on terms of equality, or
are you more or less ignored when it comes

SENATE

to the real work of the Senate"? My answer
has always been the same: "I can truthfully
say that from the day I entered the Senate"now almost sixteen years ago-"I have never
seen any signs of sex discrimination."
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: The women senators take
their place in committee work and in the
debates on the floor of the house just the
same
as
their male
colleagues,
and
like their male colleagues they must
stand or fall on their merits. When it cornes
to the real work of the Senate, most of which
is done in the committees, I am sure the
honourable senator from Rockcliffe (Hon.
Mrs. Wilson) will bear me out when I say
that the women are never overlooked.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: I recall the long session
of 1950 when I was serving on the joint
committee of both houses on the old age
security question and at the same time was
a member of nine standing committees of
this house. Many times I wished in my
heart that my leader had not been quite
so generous when he was handing out the
work. But I suppose that is really proof that
all are treated equally in this house.
The honouable senator from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. Haig) mentioned the fact that
since he came to this house 92 vacancies
have occurred; and there have been, I presume, about 80 new appointments. Those
statistics apply to me also, because I was
sworn in on the same day that he was. I
ask you frankly, honourable senators, does
it not seem passing strange that in a period
of almost sixteen years, during which time
some 80 vacancies have been filled, no place
was found in this house for even one more
woman? No one in this house, I am sure,
will deny that the women of Canada have
given a good account of themselves in the
business and professional life of the country,
in the field of education and in high administrative positions to which they have been
called by various governments; and I venture to suggest that they could make a worthwhile contribution in this chamber, if they
were given an opportunity to do so.
I now come to the second recommendation
in the resolution submitted by the National
Council of Women, and that is, that steps
should be taken immediately to strengthen
the opposition in this house. Some honourable
senators have intimated, either in speaking
in the debate or privately, that because this
is supposedly-I say supposedly-a nonpartisan body, the relative strength of the
opposition does not make any difference. I

think one honourable senator even went so
far as to intimate that it would be all to
the good of the country, or at least that it
would not make any particular difference to
it, if the entire membership consisted of
Liberals. I am definitely not in agreement
with that viewpoint, and I venture to assume
that the great majority of the people of
Canada are not in agreement with it. I know
that there are members of this house who
conscientiously hold that opinion, but I do
not think such a condition would be a healthy
one.
Remember this: as senators you are looking
at this problem from an inside vantage point.
As members, you have studied the record,
you are familiar with the history of the
Senate, you know what senators have done,
you know what they are doing in committee
work, you know they are fulfilling their
obligation. But to the people outside this
chamber these considerations do not mean
anything. They look at the Senate and say,
"There is a house of 102 members, and 11
of them are members of the opposition. It
is all one-sided; therefore it is of no use to
this country, and the sooner some change
is made, the better. If no change, why have
it at all?" I hear that argument repeatedly.
I do not think we can shrug it off, or say
that we need pay no attention to what the
outside public says. After all, the outside
taxpayers pay our indemnity, and I think
they have some right to say how this chamber
should bo constituted.
Having said that much, I should like to ask
at this point, apart from the sentiments of
the public at large, do not the majority even
of those in this chamber agree that adequate
numerical strength of opposition groups in
any governmental body makes for greater
interest and greater vitality in the functioning
of that body?
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: While to this point many
of you may agree with me, we have very
divergent views as to the remedy. As briefly
as possible I am going to run over the three
alternatives which have been suggested to
the house.
The honourable senator who is the government leader in this house (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) in introducing the motion suggested that a proportion of the membership
might be elective. There are a few senators
who believe in an elected bouse, but for
reasons stated by the honourable leader of
the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), the majority
do not. That it would lead to constant

MAY 3, 1951
political controversy with the other house is,
I think, one of the strongest objections
against such a proposal. But, outside of the
bouse, a certain section of the press and a
significant percentage of public opinion think
that this house should be elected. I am not
going to argue the issue here, before honourable members who on the whole do not
believe in an elected Senate. I should just
like to call attention in passing to one point,
because I have seen it mentioned in the press
and I have heard it over and over again in
talking to individuals. People have said to
me, "Your house should be elected, so that
it will be representative of the people. Look
,at the Senate of the United States, the most
powerful body of political opinion in that
country; consider the great influence and
prestige which it enjoys because the membership is elected"-and they begin to compare
the publicity which the Senate of the United
States receives with the publicity which we
receive. The comparison so made is, of
course, always to our disadvantage. Well, it
has always been my understanding and, I
am sure, that of other senators here that the
great prestige which the Senate of the United
States enjoys is not primarily because it is
elected, but because under the constitution
of the United States wide and sweeping
powers are placed in the hands of the Senate,
powers which in this country rest with the
Prime Minister and his government. We all
know that the Foreign Relations Committee
of the Senate is the most powerful body of
political opinion in the United States. I
venture to say that if, in these days of
international crises, the Senate of Canada
were given the wid'e and sweeping powers
which the Senate of the United States enjoys,
we too would be the more publicized' branch
of parliament-and it would not matter
whether we were elected, or appointed. On
the other handi, if the Senate of Canada were
elected without its powers being widened.
then I say we would simply become a second
and inferior House of Commons-inferior
because, although like the House of Commons
we would be elected, we would not possess
their powers, so that the whole purpose for
which we were created would be destroyed.
The second alternative suggestion was that
so ably put forth by the honourable senator
from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) and
the honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen), namely that a certain percentage of the members of the Senate should
be appointed by the provinces. These two
honourable gentlemen, are outstanding members of the legal profession, and one should
hesitate to tangle with them. But there is
an old saying that some people will rush in

where angels fear to tread., so I am going to
say that definitely I cannot go along with
them on the question of having appointments
made by the provinces.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear. Very sensible.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: And this I say for two or
three reasons. One is that the Senate is a
branch of the federal parliament, and I do
not think it was ever the intention of the
Fathers of Confederation that the Senate
should become a sounding board for all the
provincial factions across the country. The
provinces have their legislatures, and their
representatives in the House of Commons and
in the Senate if they need any further advice
or any further assistance. But, more than
that, I have most carefully examined the
speeches of the two honourable senators, and
the proposals they made, and I cannot see
that they offer any solution of our problem.
Things often sound well in theory; but let
us take a practical look at them. For the
sake of argument let us assume that the constitution bas been amended, and that the
provinces now have the right to appoint onethird of the members of this chamber. How
much difference would that make in the
house? At the present time the three Maritime Provinces and Newfoundland have provincial Liberal administrations; therefore
those provinces at the present time would
appoint Liberals to the Senate. Manitoba
and British Columbia have coalition governments, with Liberals sitting in the driver's
seat: there would be little change there. This
would mean that six provinces out of ten
would still be appointing Liberals. Well, a
Liberal is a Liberal; and whether he were
appointed by a province or by the dominion
it would not make much difference. "A rose
by any other name-"
Hon. Mr. Duff: They are all good fellows.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: We find that the governrment which has been elected by the
majority of the people In Saskatchewan is a
CCF government, and one of the main planks
in its policy is the abolition of the Senate.
I do not see how in any kind of decent
consistency that government could ever
appoint anybody to the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Haig:

Don't trust them.

Hon. Mrs. Fallis: If they did not make the
appointments, it would mean that seven
provinces would be appointing Liberals to
the Senate, because the appointments from
Saskatchewan would be referred to the
Liberal government at Ottawa. I do not
object to anybody coming to this chamber
just because he or she is not a member of the
Liberal or the Conservative party. I do

SENATE

object on other grounds. The members of
the CCF party, from the leader down, never
miss an opportunity when speaking in the
House of Commons, or anywhere in this
country, of holding the Senate up to ridicule
and abuse, and of declaring that it is an
unnecessary branch of parliament and a
needless expense to the taxpayers of Canada.
They claim that if they were ever in a position to do so they would abolish the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Cross-country fakers.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: I hold one opinion very
strongly in regard to this house. All of us
see defects in it; we see ways in which it
could be improved; but I hold that no one,
be he Liberal, Conservative, CCF or what
have you, should be a member of this house
unless he sincerely believes that the Senate
is a necessary part of the government of
Canada.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: If any member of this
house believes otherwise, be or she has no
right to be sitting here and accepting an
indemnity from the Canadian taxpayers. That
being the case, what useful purpose could be
served by bringing into this house men or
women who do not believe in it, and whose
avowed policy is to abolish the Senate at
the first opportunity; men and women whose
theme song from the beginning would be "I
come to bury Caesar, not to praise him"?
That is another reason why I think we should
be very careful in considering these proposed
changes.
The honourable senator from Inkerman
tHon. Mr. Hugessen) made the statement,
which is quite correct, that if the policy
which he advocated of appointment by the
provinces had been in effect during the last
six years it would have made a difference
in the personnel of this house of ten members,
including the CCF, the Social Credit party,
the Union Nationale and others. The official
opposition would have been strengthened by
four members over a period of six years.
Well, frankly speaking, I do not think that is
good enough. I do not think it is worth
making an amendment to the constitution
for merely that number. I know that the
honourable senator might say, "But we are
thinking of the future, and changes may
come in due time". That is quite true, but it
could change the other way. It is possible
but not probable that every province in this
country could have a government that was
of the same political stripe as the federal
government, and then where would the
amendment be? You still would have all
Conservatives-

Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.

Hon. Mrs. Fallis: -or Liberals, as the case
may be. So from a practical point of view
I do not think that the addition of four or
five or even ten members to opposition ranks
in the Senate over a period of six years
would affect our activities to any appreciable
extent. Certainly it would do nothing to meet
the mounting criticism against a one-party
Senate. That is my chief objection.
I come now to the last alternative, and
the one in which I am most interested. The
first speaker in this debate to give any clue
to this point was the honourable senator
from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris). I
should like .to quote from his speech of
February 19, and I would refer honourable
senators to these remarks which are to be
found on page 123 of Hansard:
Now what remedies should be carried out?
I
think an obvious remedy would be for the Prime
linister for the time being to declare that from
now on there shall be an entirely difTerent policy,
and that he will make his appointments regardless
cf party affiliations.

Having said that, the senator immediately
intimated that this had never been done and
that it probably never would be done. He
hastily shied away, and "passed by on the
other side". And that was that. Yesterday
the honourable senator from Gloucester (Hon.
Mr. Veniot) gave a concise and clear-cut
statement of how this could be brought into
effect. Conservatives and Liberals do not
always think -along the same lines, but what
that honourable gentleman had to say yesterday was entirely in line with my own
ideas. To my way of thinking he presented
us with a simple solution that would require
no amendments to the British North America
Act-a solution that could be adopted immediately because there are some vacancies in
this house. If his proposal were carried out
it would mean that the opposition could be
strengthened at once, and it would guarantee
a stability for both parties in the years to
come. It would ensure that never again could
the present situation arise in the history of
the Senate. I should like to commend the
honourable gentleman from Gloucester, and
tell him that I was thinking along exactly
the sarne lines. He has my wholehearted
support in his resolution. I know some people
will say, "Oh, well, you have to think about
practical politics". Well, I was a practical
politician once myself; but are we not nonpartisan in this chamber? Have we not shed
our political affiliations? There should be no
objection on that score. Personally, I cannot
see a particle of difference in principle. While

MAY 3, 1951
the honourable senator from Vancouver South
said something to the effect that it was
unlikely that any prime minister would ever
make appointments to the Senate regardless
of party affiliation, he then went on to approve
appointment by the provinces.
I said a moment ago that a Liberal was .a
Liberal, no matter whether he was appointed
by a federal or a provincial administration,
and that a Conservative is a Conservative,
whether he is appointed on the recommendation of the leader of the opposition in the
House of Commons or of the Conservative
Premier of Ontario. I cannot see how any
difference would arise. But I do think that
the solution offered by the honourable senator from Bathurst (Hon. Mr. Veniot) is practical and should have the support of every
non-partisan member of this house, which
of course includes us all.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: I have spoken longer
than I intended to, but if I sit down without
mentioning the proposal for retirement at a
certain age I would be accused of taking
advantage of a woman's privilege in avoiding the issue. Shortly after this debate
started I had a conversation in the corridor
one day with a senator who is strongly
opposed to the age retirement proposal, and
he asked me what I thought about it. I
said: "Well, it is one of the things upon
which I have no very definite opinion. I
think there is much to be said on both sides.
I agree that there is some absenteeism on
the part of older members, but if we retired
those over a certain age and replaced them
by persons of forty or forty-five who have
businesses and professions to look after, I
wonder if there would not be just as much
absenteeism as at present. It seems to me
that once again it all depends upon whether
you regard the question from the inside
vantage point or from the outside. On the
inside, I do not think that adoption of the

proposal would make a great deal of difference to the actual work and activities of the
Senate; but on the outside, it would make
a tremendous difference in public opinion."
My friend to whom I spoke in the corridor
also asked me what stand I would take if
this proposal for retirement because of age
were put to a vote. I replied that if I had
to register a vote I would vote for it, although
I have an open mind on the question. He
said: "That is all very well for you, because
you would not be affected if the proposal
were adopted." I then informed him that
I am one of the veteran members of this
house, that according to my identification
card I am No. 17 in seniority. He retorted:
"Oh, I didn't mean that. The proposed retirement age is 75, and no woman would ever
admit being 75 until she was at least 90."
Sone Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: I am definitely opposed
to the suggestion that the resolution should
be sent to a -committee. The powers that be
already have authority to bring about the
changes which I think should be made. I
cannot see that any very useful purpose
would be served by referring this question to
a committee, and on the other hand a great
deal of harm might be done.
In closing may I be allowed to revert to
my opening statement, and most respectfully
to urge that if any form of wider representation is adopted for this house, the women of
Canada should not be overlooked.
Same Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Honourable senators,

De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Gouin) I move
adjournment of the debate.

OLD AGE PENSIONS
PROPOSED
AMENDMENT
OF B.N.A.
ACTMOTION FOR ADDRESS TO HIS MAJESTY

Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I should like to have the consent of the house
to move a resolution, copies of which I think
have been circulated among and are on the
desks of all honourable members. The resolutien is as follows:
That a humble Address be presented to His
Majesty the King in the following words:
To the King's Most Excellent Majesty:
Most Gracious Sovereign:
We, Your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Senate of Canada in Parliament assembled,
humbly approach Your Majesty, praying that You
may graciously be pleased to cause a measure to be
laid before the Parliament of the United Kingdom

to be expressed as follows:
An Act te amend the British North America Act,
1867.
Whereas the Senate and Commons of Canada, in
Parliament asembled have submitted an Address to
praying that His Majesty may
His Majesty
graciously be pleased to cause a measure to be laid

Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
this resolution relates to the question of old
age pensions in Canada. Honourable senators are fully aware of the numerous
discussions on old age pensions that have
taken place over the past few years between
the authorities of the dominion and those of
the various provinces and of the work that
has been done in this parliament, notably
by last year's Joint Committee of the
The
Senate and the House of Commons.
general result of these discussions appears
to be that it is now desired to introduce a
scheme under which the dominion will take
charge of a scheme of old age pensions for
persons of seventy years and over, while the
dominion and the provinces will jointly
evolve a scheme of contributory pensions for
persons between the ages of sixty-five and
seventy years.
At the present time the British North
America Act confines to the provincial
authorities the direct jurisdiction over old
age pensions, and as matters now stand the
only way in which the dominion can take any
part in an old age pension plan is by voting
money as a contribution to the cost of

MAY 8, 1951
schemes administered by the provinces. This,
in fact, is what the dominion bas done for a
considerable period of years. To permit the
dominion itself to evolve a scheme of old age
pensions such as is now suggested for pensioners of seventy years and over, it is
necessary to apply to the Parliament of Great
Britain for an amendment to the British
North America Act, and that is the reason for
the resolution which I have just had the
honour to move.
Perhaps I should say a word in explanation
of why I have asked the house to consider
this resolution immediately. The time-table
calls for quick action. It was at half-past
eleven last Friday morning that the dominion
and the ten provinces finally agreed upon the
text of the amendment to the British North
America Act which is embodied in the resolution. On Friday afternoon the Prime Minister
gave notice in the other place of his intention
to introduce on the following Monday a resolution similar to this one. Yesterday afternoon that resolution was introduced in the
other place and was adopted with a minimum
of discussion. Today the resolution comes
before this body, and it is suggested that it
would be most helpful if it could be passed
this afternoon.
The reasons for the urgency are two. The
first is that, as I said a moment ago, action is
required from the British Parliament; and I
do not need to enlarge upon the possibility at
almost any moment of a dissolution of the
British Parliament and a general election.
It is desired to have this legislation con-

I am well aware of the great interest honourable members take in ail questions of
social security, and I am particularly conscious

of the excellent work done by the

Senate members of the Joint Committee on
Old Age Pensions which sat a year ago, and
which made a most valuable report. I am
going to suggest to honourable members,
however, that we foiow the precedent set by
the other place, and that at this stage we
refrain from extensive discussion of any
particular scheme of old age pensions. It is
to be thoroughly understood, of course, that
the adoption of this resolution will not commit any senator to any particular scheme of
old age pensions, and that all of us reserve
the fullest and freest right of discussion and
criticism when the legislation itself comes
before us.
Honourable senators, with these few words
I move the adoption of the resolution which
I read a few moments ago.
Hon. Mr. DuTremblay: Honourable senators,
I do not object to this resolution, and I think
it should be passed this afternoon; but I
should like to ask a question on the following
part of section 94A.
. . . but no law made by the Parliament of Canada

in relation to old age pensions shall affect the
cperation of any law, present or future, of a provincial legislature in relation to old age pensions.

I should like to know why this appears in
the resolution. Is it to reaffirm the provincial
law?

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I intended to say a
word about that in my original explanation,
in view of the remarks of my honouris that if the British Parliament sees fit to able friend from Repentigny (Hon. Mr.

of the Canadian Government, as announced this part of section 94A is merely included

sidered by the British Parliament before any
such contingency arises. The second reason

SENATE
Hon. W. D. Euler: I have no objection to
this resolution, but I siuald like to get some
definite information. We have now abolished
appeals to the Privy Council, and I think we
have the right to amend our own constitution.
If we are to continue the practice of appealing matters of this kind to the parliament
of another country-I am not going to say a
foreign country-then I would say that all
this talk about Canadian autonomy is just
so many words. Frankly, I do not like the
idea that the Canadian parliament, once
having declared its power to amend its own
constitution, should be prevented in any way
from carrying out that principle. I do not
like the thought that the Canadian parliament should be compelled for any reason to
go to the Parliament of Great Britain for any
powers. We ought to have these powers ourselves. If there is a dispute, or a matter in
which all the provinces are concerned, some
other means should be developed by which
we can come to an agreement. We should
not have to go to the Parliament of Great
Britain.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think the honourable
senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) bas
missed the point.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I have not.
Hon. John T. Haig: The federal and provincial governments have been trying for some
months to reach an agreement as to how our
constitution should be amended to deal with
questions on which there is joint or concurrent jurisdiction. This resolution bas been
brought forward only because agreement has
not yet been reached, and the government is
anxious that the matter of old age pensions
be dealt with at the earliest possible date.
If we have to wait until we have the power
to amend our own constitution, it may be a
matter of a year or even longer before we can
deal with the question of old age pensions.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Either my honourable
friend from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) missed
my point or I did not make myself clear.
I am not objecting to this resolution. I know
that this procedure is necessary because we
have not reached the point where we can
deal with it in any other way; but I do
think that we should find some other method
in the years to come.
Hon. Mr. Farris: It is being worked out
now.
Hon. Mr. Euler: All right; but I want to
be assured that the old method of having to
go to the British Parliament is not retained.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I thought it was well
understood' that the whole of the Parliament
of Canada is most anxious that the provinces

and the dominion should reach an agreement as to how our constitution should be
amended. I do not think there is any question about that. But I think we might as
well recognize that in scme provinces there
is a question, not only as to how the Act
should be amended but as to what method
should be used to protect their rights or
their supposed rights. My honourable friend
has had a lot of experience, and he knows
that that is a very difficult thing to work out.
However, I did not get up to speak
especially on that point. I join with the
deputy leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) in hoping that we shall be able
to adopt this resolution today, so that it
may be sent to the United Kingdorn Parliament at once for confirmation, and thus
make it possible for the provinces and the
dominion to confer at an early date in working out the details of the pension legislation
to be submitted to the various legislatures.
I understand the Prime Minister to have
announced that if this resolution is adopted
at once there is no reason why a conference
for this purpose could not be held on the
21st of May.
I have had some difficulty with a point
that was brought to my attention by the
senator from Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte).
He pointed out that about a year ago the
Senate adopted a resolution requiring that in
any future constitutional change requiring
the consent of the provinces assent should be
indicated by the legislatures. In the present
instance I do not think the Ontario Legislature has consented. The premier of that
province has said that if this resolution is
adopted by parliament he will call a session
of the legislature to ratify it. I believe that
it has been ratified by the legislature of my
own province of Manitoba, and also by the
legislatures of Saskatchewan and Alberta,
but I cannot say whether there has been
ratification by the legislatures of Quebec and
the other provinces. My recollection is that
the governments of those provinces have
approved of the resolution, but that so far
it has not been submitted to the legislatures.
I entirely agree with the point raised by the
senator from Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte),
that a year ago we were unanimously of the
opinion that whenever in future the consent
of a province was required for a constitutional
amendment, that would mean the consent of
the legislature, not merely the consent of the
provincial government. I think it is safer
and generally better to have the consent of
the legislature, for it is the official voice of
the people of the province. I cannot imagine
that any government would give consent to
a constitutional change without feeling that
it had the support of a majority in the legislature, but really the legislature itself ought

MAY 8, 1951
to go on record in these matters. However,
I agree that we should not do anything that
might interfere with provincial support of
federal policy, and therefore, although I am
wholly in sympathy with the point raised by
the senator from Ponteix, in the present
circumstances I would waive any personal
objection on that ground.
Hon. J. W. de B. Farris: Honourable
senators, of course I am not opposing this
resolution. I take it that the 'leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) is not opposing
it either.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, no.
Hon. Mr. Farris: He is merely protecting
himself as to future policy.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is it.
Hon. Mr. Farris: There is one question that
I wish to put to the deputy leader of the
government (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) about the
word "affect". It has been suggested that this
means that if a province wishes to supplement
a federal Act, it should have the power to
do so. But as I read it, I am inclined to think
that it goes a great deal further than that.
Reference has been made to the existing dual
jurisdiction in agriculture. In the courts,
judges and lawyers often use the expression
"occupancy of the field," and the present law
is that if the dominion occupies a field it
keeps the provinces out. But this proposed
amendment seems to provide for the reverse
of that. I think it means that a province, if it
wishes, may have primary occupancy of the
field and exclude a federal Act. My question
is this: If the proposed amendment to the
British North America Act is adopted and a
general Act on Old Age Pensions is passed
by parliament, what will happen if some
province wishes to escape from the provisions
of that Act and enacts legislation entirely
inconsistent with it? My understanding is
that the provincial jurisdiction would oust
the federal jurisdiction and have primary
occupancy of the field.
Hon. Arthur Marcotte: Honourable senators,
before proceeding to make a few remarks,
I wish to put a question to the deputy leader
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen). Can he state how the
consent of the provinces-which was needed
in this, case-was given; and what kind of
consent it was?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Well, to be perfectly

frank with my honourable friend, it was only
as I came into the house this afternoon that I
received the correspondence which passed
between the Minister of Justice and the
premiers of the various provinces. That correspondence terminated only last Friday, and
I do not know that anyone would have had

a chance as yet to examine it. However, it is
probably fair to say that, as remarked by
the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig), in most instances the consent obtained
was that of the provincial government. I
believe that is right in so far as my own
province, Quebec, is concerned; I do not think
the legislature has formally approved of this.
Hon Mr. Marcotte: Oh, yes.

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Has it?
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: Yes. I am going to
give some information which will help the
deputy leader (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) as well
as my own leader (Hon. Mr. Haig). It is true
that the correspondence between the federal
government and the various provinces bas
just been tabled here, but as I was anxious
to find out how many provinces had given
effect to the Senate's declaration of last year
that consent to constitutional changes should
be given by the legislature rather than by
the provincial government, I spent part of
last night in reading the correspondence. I
can tell my honourable friends that the legislatures of five provinces have passed resolutions endorsing this proposed amendment to
the British North America Act. These five
provinces are Quebec, Saskatchewan, Maýnitoba, Alberta and British Columbia. That
means that for the other five provinces the
consent to the proposed amendment has been
given, not by their legislatures, but by their
premiers. I am not going to raise any strong
objection to that at this time, for I do not
wish to do anythi-ng to delay passage of the
resolution before us, but I think provincial
governments should take warning that we
meant just what we said last year. After
all, this body, the principal branch of our
parliament, decided that a certain procedure
should be followed whenever a constitutional
amendment was required, and we have the
right to insist upon that procedure being
followed. As I say I obtained the correspondence yesterday afternoon and spent
half the night going over it. From a review
of the correspondence and from my general
knowledge of events since the conferences
were held, I know that there is consent by
the provinces. For that reason I do not
object to this resolution, although the way
in which it has been reached is not precisely
the way in which we insisted it should be
reached.
My friend from Vancouver South (Hon.
Mr. Farris) raised the important point of
concurrent jurisdiction. When a matter is
dealt with by two jurisdictions it may lead
to trouble. The provinces have not entirely
abandoned their right to legislate in the
matter of old age pensions. They have
abandoned half of their rights in the matter

SENATE
in order to give the federal government
power to pass this legislation. To my mind,
that is one of the most dangerous things that
has been done for many years. As honourable senators will recall, in speaking to my
resolution last year I pointed out that in the
past premiers had come to parliament and
said that the consent of the provinces had
been obtained when, in fact, it had not been.
The government, even in 1871, had to admit
that it had been doing wrong, and promised
to cease. Still we find the same thing happening today.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I think my honourable friend is historically inaccurate on that
point. What happened in 1871 was that the
federal government, without reference to the
federal parliament, demanded from the
British government an amendment to the
British North America Act.
Hon. Mr. Marcofte: My friend is quite
correct, and I apologize. But what I have in
mind is that the Senate itself has declared
that consent of the provinces should be
complete. We have the right therefore, in
keeping with the dignity and integrity of
this body, to insist that these things should
be done properly.
In order to protect the mover of the
resolution (Hon. Mr. Hugessen), and also my
leader on this side (Hon. Mr. Haig), I should
like to have certain parts of the correspondence tabled today incorporated in the
record of our debates this afternoon. In that
way honourable
senators will become
familiar with matters of which they may
not have knowledge.
We need not be afraid of what may be
done in England. England will not disappear,
nor will the Parliament of Canada. I will go
much further and say that this resolution is
absolutely unnecessary.
The same result
could be obtained by amending just two
clauses of the present Old Age Pensions Act.
It is perhaps not for me to say what the
procedure should be. My point is that this
house, having unanimously adopted a resolution, should insist on that resolution being
observed. A warning should be given to
the provinces that when they come to the
Dominion Parliament for something which
requires their consent, the consent given
should be a proper consent.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I should like to join with the senator
from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) in
calling the attention of the house to the
inadequacy of the phraseology of this proposed amendment. My honourable friend
pointed out certain difficulties with regard to
priorities. I call attention to the clumsiness

and uncertainty of the phraseology of the
amendment. The purpose of this clause, no
doubt is to give to the dominion the power
to legislate in this connection without affecting the validity of legislation passed by the
provinces. But it does not say that. The
amendment contains these words:
. . . but no law made by the Parliament of Canada

in relation to old age pensions shall affect the
operation of any law, present or future, of a provincial legislature . . .
The operation of a law is a physical matter, and a law passed by the dominion will
affect the operation of a law passed by a
province upon the same subject, for the law
passed by the dominion will take from the
taxpayer a certain amount of money, thereby
making the operation of the provincial law
that much more difficult. A dominion law
on the subject will affect the operation of a
provincial law on the same subject, but it
need not affect the validity of the provincial
law. It is "operation" and not "validity" that
is legislated about in this amendment. It
is all right to leave in the word "operation",
if there is added the word "validity". Two
things should be covered if this amendment
is to escape being considered by the courts.
First, it should be stated that this section
94A shall not affect the validity of a provincial law, which is quite a different matter
from saying that any law passed under this
amendment shall not affect the operation of
a provincial law. What is meant is that
this amendment to the British North America
Act shall not affect the power of the provinces to pass a law on the subject which
shall be as valid as that which they can pass
today. But the section does not say that;
in fact, this section may take away the right
of the provinces to pass such a lw.
All that
is preserved in this amendment is the operation of a law which the provinces may pass,
if they have the power to pass such a law
after the Imperial Parliament bas passed this
amendment, which is doubtful.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: Any future law.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Very true, provided
that the provinces have the right to pass a
future law, after this section has been added
to the British North America Act. This is
not made clear.
I should like to be in a
position at a later date, when this section
is considered by the Supreme Court of
Canada, as I think it undoubtedly will be,
to say "I told you so". This amendment does
not preserve the validity of provincial legislation on this subject, nor does it preserve
the power of the provinces to pass such
legislation after this section has been added
to the British North America Act.
The
amendment in a rather futile way says that
an Act of this parliament shall not affect

MAY 8, 1951
the operation of a provincial Act, which is
a physical matter and beyond legislation to
accomplish. It will affect the operation, no
matter what we say. And second, I think
that this amendment should be changed also
so that no law passed by the Dominion of
Canada shall affect the validity of provincial
legislation of the same character. Both points
should be covered; first, the amendment
itself and, second, a law passed by the Dominion parliament under authority of the amendment. Neither should be allowed to affect
the validity of provincial legislation on this
particular subject.
The section before us appears to be clumsily
drawn. To begin with, the first five words
"It is hereby declared .that" have no value
whatever, and 'could be ideleted without
changing the meaning of the amendment in
the slightest degree.
The section should
commence "The Parliament of Canada may",
etc. That matter is not important, but it
does demonstrate the sloppiness of the draftsmanship. The other things I have mentioned are of real importance. I predict
that the section will end up in the courts
for interpretation both upon the point raised
by the honourable senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) and upon the point
which I have raised, namely that the validity
of provincial legislation has not been
preserved.
I suppose it is too late to give effect to
these matters, and we must pass this legislation and send it on. We have been given no
opportunity to change the phraseology. I
am sorry that it is in such shape as it is. I
do not care whether the provincial authorities have mulled it over or not. We are as
able to read the legislation as they areperhaps a little more able. My reason for
regretting the wording is that I am -greatly
interested in this prospective legislation.
Being myself a young man of some maturity,
I look forward to it, not so much, I assure
you, for myself as for the very many other
persons who will benefit by it. We are
developing in Canada a very kindly state.
I hope that this legislation will be carried
very shortly; that it will be on a scale, both
here and in the provinces, that is comprehensive and generous enough to satisfy our
people, and that it will carry Canada forward
still -another step in the path of social kindliness and social progress.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Could you not move an
amendment?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It would be of no use.
If we adopt an amendment it will have to go
to the Commons, and, if approved there, to the
provinces, to obtain their assent. Five of

them, I understand, have consented by legislative action to the proposal before us. I
think it would be better to pass it, badly
phrased as it is, but I would not like to see it
go through the Senate without some of us,
at least, having called attention to the
inadequacy and the clumsiness of the phraseology. Then we can at least say later on,
"I told you so", although we gave it our
approval.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Do I rightly understand
the honourable senator's argument as being
this, that because the provinces are joining to
invest the federal parliament with a jurisdiction it does not now enjoy, they are, through
the form in which their agreement is conveyed, yielding up their own jurisdiction to
deal with the same subject-matter?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I do not think the
consent of the provinces has anything to do
with it. This little clause we have before us
will, through an Act of the Imperial Legislature, confer upon 'the dominion the powers
stated therein, and it will confer those powers
as part of the British North America Act. It
will have its effect quite aside from anything
we say, anything that has been said by the
legislatures or anything that has been
repeated in the Commons. It will be the interpretation of that clause which will count;
then a part of the British North America Act,
in reference to all other clauses of the Act;
and since the validity of the legislation now
.passed or which may in future be passed by
the provincial legislature has not been preserved in this section, I fear-and it is my
judgment-that such validity has been seriously interfered with. Its validity may not
remain when this clause is passed.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Must not the attorneysgeneral of the provinces have agreed to this?
Hon. Mr. Haig: They might be wrong.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I do not know that, and
if they agreed, I would not be very much
concerned. I have been an attorney-general
myself, so I may speak that way. Nor should
any other member of this house be much
concerned about the judgment of others. We
are the people who are now acting in regard
to this legislation, and it is our judgment
that is important. I look at it through my
own eyes, not through the eyes of any other
authority.
Hon. Felix P. Quinn: Honourable members, I am a layman, having no association
with the legal fraternity; but after hearing
the remarks of the honourable member for
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), I think

SENATE

that if, as he has stated, the clause is awkwardly drawn and requires revision, it would
be better to risk even a somewhat considerable delay than to expose our ignorance to
the British Government.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: The legal point, or
perhaps I should say points, raised by my
honourable colleagues from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. Farris) and Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) are a little beyond my depth, and
I offer no observations upon them. But it
does seem to me that we are engaged at
the moment on a rather important piece of
business.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: What we are doing is
asking for an amendment of the constitution of our country. It seems rather singular
that, in a matter of this importance, so great
is the haste that we have not had an opportunity to examine the correspondence which
has passed between the federal government
and the provincial governments. This correspondence was tabled only this afternoon,
and we were informed that it was concluded
as recently as the end of last week. For my
part I wish to protest against the circumstances which make this speed necessary.
Apart from the points raised by my legal
colleagues, my reading of this amendment
brought this thought to my mind. At the
present time the provinces have the sole right
constitutionally to deal with old age pensions. It is true that by virtue of a conditional agreement made some years ago
between the Dominion Government and the
various provincial governnents, the dominion
is contributing 75 per cent of the total
amount paid for old age pensions. But, as I
have intimated, payment of the grants
depended upon the terms of that agreement.
As I read this amendment, the federal
powers are to be enlarged; that is, the provinces have agreed that it shall be within our
jurisdiction to set up a system and pay old
age pensions without violation of the constitution. So, as I apprehend it, ve are going
to have this situation: the federal government will have the power, quite irrespective
of the provinces, to pay old age pensions; and
also the provinces, irrespective of the
Dominion Government, will have power to
pay old age pensions. If my conclusion is
correct, it raises a rather interesting point.
There will be two jurisdictions dealing with
one matter.
Is this change in the constitution to be
confined to the subject of old age pensions?
For instance, the provinces today have exclusive rights in the matter of property and
civil rights and in the matter of contract.
This amendment to our constitution is being

sought as a result of a meeting between
representatives of the provinces :and the
federal government-not because of a general consultation with the Canadian peopleand it may mean that the federal government
may at some future time be given the power
to deal with matters of civil icontract. I
have my doubts about the wisdom of this
method of procedure.
It is quite clear from the remarks of the
acting leader (Hon. Mr. Hugessen), that the
necessity for speed rests in the need for
getting this resolution disposed of by the
parliament at Westminster so that we .can
proceed with an old age pension under
federal authority. If the representations in
the press accurately forecast what that legislation will be, then I think before the end
of this session the Senate will be considering
a matter involving a federal expenditure of
some $250 or $300 million, and we shall be
asked to find the means of making these
payments. When this legislation is finally
adopted, I, like many others here, shall be
in the happy position of drawing an old age
pension. This pension would also go, for
instance to my honourable friend from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler)Hon. Mr. Euler: The government vould
only take it away from me.
Hon. Mr. Crerar:-or my honourable friend
from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris), who
may be receiving an income of $30,000 or
- $35,000 a year. Then we would be in the
delightful position of employing a staff of
civil servants to keep the accounts and distribute pension cheques to all people over
seventy, irrespective of their need. Then
another staff of civil servants would be kept
busy figuring out how much of that money
should be returned to the federal treasury.
This whole procedure does not strike me as
being sensible, especially when this country
is today paying out well over $1 billion
a year in the way of social security and
pension schemes at all levels of government.
It does seem that we are going about this
whole business in a very blithe fashion. I
may be old-fashioned, but it appears to me
that nothing is of greater importance than
our constitution and the changes we make to
it. We are told that this matter was only consummated a few days ago with the provinces,
and that we must hurry and get it through so
that the parliament at Westminster can deal
with it before a general election is called in
Great Britain. Well, this all strikes me as
unnecessary haste.
I have not passed any opinion on the general
subject of pensions, except to say that I do not

MAY 8, 1951
see the sense of paying pensions to people
who have utterly no need for them-probably
on the suggestion of sorne intellectual theorist
who thinks that this is the way to do it, and
because he wants to brag elsewhere that
Canada is a country where everyone who
reaches the age of seventy receives a pension.
While I shal not oppose this resolution, I
shal look forward with interest to the legislation that will come down to carry the pension
scheme into effect. I give warning that
there is not a single member in this chamber
who will escape another impost on his or
her income in order to carry this measure
through.
Hon. William Duff: Honourable senators,
I am sure that we are al interested in this
important matter; but what I cannot understand is why, in the face of all the criticism
that has been levelled at the Senate about
rushing through business, we should be
asked to deal hurriedly with one of the most
important matters that could come before
us. We are being asked to put through a
resolution this afternoon that would have
the effect of amending our constitution. I
am opposed to this haste. As my honourable
friend from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
said, I think we should have an opportunity
to study the correspondence between the
federal governnent and the provincial
representatives.
What is all the rush about? Why are we
so anxious to put this matter through? It
looks to me as though somebody is frightened
of something-unless, of course, there is
something in what the leader of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) and the
deputy leader (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) said in
their speeches about Senate reform. Perhaps
they intend to give senators an old age
pension at the age of seventy-five because
they are anxious to get us out of here. As
far as I am concerned I am going to stay
here as long as God permits, and nobody will
put me out.
I think it is a mistake to speed this
resolution through. A delay of a day or two
would not make any difference. If this
matter is so important, why was it not
introduced two or three months ago? Why
should my honourable friend from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) corme here this afternoon and say in effect, "Oh, well, it only got
the consent of the Premier of Nova Scotia
last Friday"? It has been suggested that a
delay in placing this resolution before the
British Parliament would probably have
serious results because of the possibility of
a general election in Great Britain in the near
future. Well, what if the present British
80713-25

Government did fail? The people of that
country would have a better government
under Winston Churchill, so why worry on
that account?
I think we should give careful consideration to any resolution that would result in
anending our constitution. If parliament
introduces legislation which would have the
effect of asking me and my wife to accept
$960 a year, I will tell them exactly where
to go. I am not going to take it. I am not
going to be on any pauper list. I am going
to be independent as long as I live. Nobody
is going to bamboozle me and say that when
I have reached the age of seventy-five I will
have to get out of the Senate and accept
$480 a year as an old age pension.
Honourable senators, I think we should
have -an opportunity of reading the correspondence in this matter and we should wait
until at least tomorrow afternoon before
passing this resolution.
Hon. Saller A. Hayden: Honourable
senators, at the risk of being repetitious, I
want to say one or two things about this
resolution.
The resolution itself embodies this very
simple proposition: by the process of an
Address from both houses of the Parliament
of Canada to the Imperial Parliament, the
Parliament of Canada is to acquire power to
legislate in future in the field of old age pensions. If and when the Imperial Parliament
agrees to this resolution and amends the
British North America Act accordingly, it
will then be open to the Parliament of Canada
to enact legislation establishing some scheme
of old age pensions. The provinces are not
vacating this field, but apparently they agree
that the dominion shall share jurisdiction in
it with them.
Are we to say to the provinces 'that we do
not want jurisdiction to deal directly with
old age pensions, and that therefore we refuse
to join in an Address asking the Imperial
Parliament to confer that jurisdiction upon
the Parliament of Canada? Surely, when a
bill providing for a scheme of old age pensions comes before parliament there will be
enough intelligence in the combined membership of the Senate and the House of Commons to study the measure and decide whether we should enter upon the scheme, and
if so to what extent. That will be the proper
time to consider questions relating to any
additional impost that it may be necessary
to make upon the incomes of the people. At
the moment we have no plan of old age
pensions before us; we have nothing but a
resolution which ýcould lead to the conferring
upon the federal parliament of authority to
legislate in that field.

SENATE
A question that does give me a little concern is the one that was raised by the senator
from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris). In
a number of fields the dominion and the provinces have authority to legislate. The deputy
leader (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) referred to agriculture. It is true that the province can legislate in relation to agriculture and the
dominion can legislate in relation to agriculture, but there is a special provision in
the British North America Act that when
concurrent jurisdiction in agriculture has to
be exercised, the dominion jurisdiction shall
prevail over the provincial. But let me put
this question to honourable senators. Suppose
in due course the federal parliament passes
a law providing that every person upon
reaching the age of seventy shall be entitled
to an old age pension, without submitting to a
means test. Then suppose that one of the
provinces passes a law reading something
like this: "No person resident in this province
on reaching the age of seventy shall be
entitled to receive an old age pension without
a means test." On the face of it there would
be a conflict-as lawyers say, a repugnancy.
In those circumstances which would prevail,
the provincial or the federal authority? On
my reading of this proposed amendment to
the British North America Act, I think the
last authority would be in the province; that
if provincial legislation said that a resident
of the province 'could not enjoy a certain
benefit which federal legislation gave him, the
situation would have to be resolved in favour
of the province. It seems to me the meaning
of the exception in this proposed amendment
is simply this, that where there is a repugnancy between the two jurisdictions in the
field of old age pensions, the provincial legislation shall prevail.
But at the same time there is a bigger
point. In any broad consideration of the
question of old age pensions, knowing that
there are people vitally concerned-people
who for the most part may have but a few
years to live after reaching the qualifying
age-how can we say that the question is not
an important one? And as to this proposal
to authorize the federal parliament to occupy
the old age pensions field along with the
provinces, which are already occupying it,
how can it be said that in principle it is not
a good thing to bring to bear upon the question the combined wisdom of all the legislative bodies in Canada, trusting to these
bodies to see to it that sympathy for people
who may qualify for enjoyment of a pension
does not run away with good judgment as
to what the public purse of Canada can
support? But that is a matter that can be
dealt with when we have before us a proposal
to take the second step, legislation by the

Parliament of Canada. At present we are
concerned only with the first step, the resolution, and I submit we should not confuse one
step with the other.
Hon. John J. Kinley: Honourable senators,
being a lay member of the house, I of course
approach this question with diffidence. Though
I have had some experience in a provincial
legislature as well as in both houses of parliament, I must say that this proposed new
section 94A of the British North America Act
does give me a little concern. In my opinion
it changes our constitutional relations with
the provinces in a very important manner.
The honourable gentleman who has just
spoken (Hon. Mr. Hayden) mentioned agriculture as a field in which parliament and
Section
the legislatures have jurisdiction.
95 of the British North America Act says:
In each province the legislature may make laws
in relation to agriculture in the province, and to
immigration into the province; and it is hereby
declared that the Parliament of Canada may from
time to time make laws in relation to agriculture in
all or any of the provinces, and to immigration into
all or any of the provinces; and any law of the
legislature of a province relative to agriculture or
to immigration shall have effect in and for the
province as long and as far only as it is not
repugnant to any Act of the Parliament of Canada.

That is the law with regard to legislation on
immigration and agriculture. Furthermore,
our constitution, as I understand it, gives the
federal authority the right of disallowance.
And also in certain circumstances legislation
by the Parliament of Canada prevails over
provincial legislation. But in the proposed
amendment to the British North America Act
we find this provision:
. . . no law made by the Parliament of Canada in
relation to old age pensions shall affect the operation of any law, present or future, of a provincial
legislature in relation to old age pensions.

That simply says, in effect, that if any
dominion legislation in relation to old age
conflict with provincial
pensions should
legislation on the same subject, the provincial
legislation shall prevail.
I think anyone will admit that that is a
change. It may be a change that has been
contemplated, for we are entering the provincial jurisdiction of property and civil
rights, and the provinces should prevail. We
are now entering a new field, as it were. In
an important matter of this kind I am pleased
to hear my legal friends in this house say
what was in my own mind; it gives me some
confidence in what I have said. I think we
could very well delay consideration of this
resolution until we meet in committee tomorrow morning, and continue the debate in
the house in the afternoon.

Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

MAY 8, 1951
Hon. Mr. Reid: Before the acting leader
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) closes the debate, I
should like to ask one -question. But before
doing so I wish to say that everyone in this
house this afternoon could not help being
impressed by the many speeches made, particularly those by members of the learned
profession. It is all very well to warn the
country or the government; but if there is
anything wrong with this legislation it will
soon be too late to correct it. It will not be
enough to say to the people of this country,
"I warned you".
Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I think my question to the
deputy leader should be answered, and that
he should also reply to the statements made
by the member for Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck), the senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) and, my friend from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden). My question is:
Have the various provinces had presented to
them this resolution in the form in which we
have it before us this afternoon, or have
they merely consented to an amendment to
the British North America Act?
Hon. Mr. Duff: Where is the money coming
from?
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: If no other honourable
senators desire to speak, I shall close the
debate.
In the first place, may I attempt to answer
the. question just asked by the senator from
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid)? The
whole correspondence between the Minister
of Justice and the premiers of the provinces
was printed as an appendix to the Hansard
of the other place of Friday last, May 4. It
is therefore not entirely fresh ground. I arn
unable of my knowledge to say positively
that the provinces have agreed in terms to
this particular resolution that we have before
us this afternoon, but I should think it outside
the realm of possibility that they have not
done so. After all, what they are agreeing to
is an amendment to the British North America
Act modifying their rights; and if I know
anything of the attorneys-general of the
provinces, I would think that they would have
been bound to have placed before thern this
very resolution and this very arnendment to
the British North America Act. Otherwise
they would obviously not be in a position
to know the precise extent to which the rights
of their provinces were being affected. Without any question, I think that what is before
the house this afternoon by way of this joint
resolution and the proposed amendment to
the British North America Act embodied in
80713-25à

it, is the very text of what was agreed upon
by the governments of the ten provinces.
As I said a few minutes ago, the correspondence which I tabled earlier this afternoon in this house was printed as an appendix
to the Hansardof the other place last Friday.
I am very glad to accept the suggestion of
the honourable senator from Ponteix (Hon.
Mr. Marcotte) that the correspondence should
be added as an appendix to our discussion
of this afternoon, and when this resolution
has been disposed of I shall move to that
effect.
I was most interested in what the senator
from Ponteix said in relation to his resolution which was unanimously adopted by this
house last year. I am quite certain that in
future cases of this kind all provincial
authorities will comply with the requirements
that this house laid down as a result of my
honourable friend's resolution. As he has
said, fifty per cent of thern have done so on
this occasion. He can therefore congratulate
himself that on the first occasion on which
his resolution has been put to the test it bas
been fifty per cent effective.
With regard to the suggestion made by
several honourable senators that this resolution should be referred to a committee, or
that it should be withdrawn for re-consideration, I would submit that this amendment
has been debated and agreed to between
the federal authorities and the attorneysgeneral of every single one of the ten provinces. I may say that I am not using this as
an argument why we should not consider it.
very carefully. I am simply pointing out that
if we now propose to re-consider the whole
thing, we are going to throw it all back to,
the provinces and to the dominion. That will
probably mean that there will be no resolution and no amendment to the British North,
America Act for some months to come, and I
venture to suggest to the Senate that,
although the amendment could perhaps have
been more aptly phrased, we should really
think twice before taking such a drastic step
following the months and months of discussion that have taken place.
Hon. Mr. Duff: But why, may I ask my
honourable friend, could the matter not
stand until tomorrow or the next day? Why
the hurry?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: What advantage will
there be in letting it stand until tomorrow?
I do not want to press anybody but, I ask,
can we do anything more effective tomorrow
than we can do today, assuming that we
do not want to throw the whole thing back
into the melting pot between the dominion
and the provinces?

Office of the Premier
Edmonton, March

6,

1951.

The Honourable Stuart S. Garson, K.C.,
Minister of Justice and Attorney General
of Canada,
Ottawa, Canada.
Dear Mr. Garson:
I am in receipt of your letter of the 23th ultimo
enclosing copies of the submissions made by the
Premiers of the various provinces in relation to
the proposed amendments to the British North
America Act.
I am in agreement with your first suggestion that
a new section 95a be enacted reading as follows:
"95a. In each province the Legislature may make
laws in relation to old age pensions within the
province; and it is hereby declared that the
Parliament of Canada may from time to time
make laws in relation to old age pensions in
Canada, but no law made by the parliament of
Canada in relation ta old age pensions shall affect
the opcration of any law in relation to old age
pensions made by a provincial legislature."
While there is no doubt that at the present
time the Legislature of each province bas the
power to make laws in relation to old age pensions.
nevertheless I can see no objection to repeating
the power in section 95a even though redundant,
in order that no argument can be raised that it
was intended to take this power away.
I have no further suggested amendments ta head
2 of section 92.
Yours very truly,

The Honourable Stuart Garson, K.C.,
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of
Canada,
Ottawa, Ontario.
Dear Mr. Garson:
Your letter of February 28th received.
For reasons which you have very clearly stated,
and with which we are in complete agreement,
you propose a new section 95A to be in either of
the following forms,-

"In each province the legislature may make
laws in relation to old age pensions within the
province; and it is hereby declared that the parliament of Canada may from time to time make laws
in relation to old age pensions in Canada, but no
law made by the parliament of Canada in relation
to old age pensions shall affect the operation of
any law in relation to old age pensions made by
a provincial legislature."
or
"It is hereby declared that the parliament of
Canada may from time to time make laws in
relation to old age pensions in Canada, but no
law made by the parliament of Canada in relation
ta old age pensions shall affect the operation of
any law in relation to old age pensions within any
province made by the provincial legislature of
such province."
Either one of these forms is satisfactory to us.
If, therefore, the government of Canada or any
of the provinces have a preference for one of
these forms it will be quite satisfactory to us.
We trust that the amendment will be effected as
soon as possible and the legislation proceded with
as agreed upon.
Sincerely yours,

Honourable Stuart Garson, LL.D.,
Minister of Justice and Attorney General,
Parliament Buildings,
Ottawa, Canada.
My dear Mr. Garson:
I have for acknowledgment your letter of February 28, together with enclosures relating ta the
proposed constitutional amendments dealing with
old age pensions and the indirect sales tax.
I have had our attorney-general and his officials
examine your correspondence thoroughly and we
have come to the view that the draft in respect
of old age pensions to be found on page 3 of
your communication satisfactorily deals with this
question. It is felt that it grants the necessary
power ta the parliament of Canada to make laws
in relation to old age pensions while at the same
time fully preserving provincial rights in dealing
with the sane question.
In relation ta the sales tax amendment. we are
satisfied that the amendment suggested by you is
quite sufficient for all practical purposes. This
amendment, as I gather from your correspondence,
is as follows:

MAY 8, 1951
"2. The raising of revenue for provincial purposes
by:
(a) direct taxation wthin the province, and
(b) Indirect taxation withln the province in
respect of the sale of goods (except goods sold
for shipment outside the province) to a buyer for
purposes of consumption or use and not for resale,
at a rate not exceeding three per centum of the
sale price, but not so as to discriminate between
sales of goods grown, produced or manufactWed
within the province and sales of goods grown,
produced or manufactured outside the province."
With kindest personal regards,
Yours faithfully,

Dear Mr. Garson:
Thank you for your letter of the 29th ult. with
reference to constitutional amendments in which
you enclose copies of correspondence from the
various Provincial Premiers.
I have discussed this matter with the Attorney
General and it has come before Cabinet. As far
as Newfoundland is concerned we are prepared
to accept what you refer to as your third draft (on
page three of your letter), reading"It is hereby declared that the Parliament of
Canada may from time to time make laws in
relation to old age pensions in Canada, but no law
made by the Parliament of Canada in relation to
old age pensions shall affect the operation of any
law in relation to oId age pensions within any
Province made by the Provincial Legislature of
such Province."
but if the other Provinces prefer it we would
agree to your new draft section 95A (page two of
your letter) reading as follows"In each Province the Legislature may make
laws in relation to old age pensions within the
Province; and it is hereby declared that the Parliament of Canada may from time to time make laws
in relation to old age pensions in Canada, but no
law made by the Parliament of Canada in relation
to old age pensions shall affect the operation of any
law in relation to old age pensions made by a
Provincial Legislature."
With respect to the proposed amendment of
section 92 (2) it seems to me that the point made
by Premier Macdonald may be well taken, and
that the amendment with reference to indirect
taxation might well be included in section 92 as a

delivered at my office March 2 and I was unable
to take cognizance of same before yesterday.
Thanks for the information your letter imparts to
me and for the copy of the correspondence relative to these important problems which accompanied it.
In the course of the Canadian intergovernmental
conference held at Ottawa at the beginning of
December, 1950, the federal goverment made statements and proposals to the representatives of the
provinces with reference to these constitutional
amendments and old age pensions.
The federal authorities wisn to assume the full
payment of old age pensions from age 70 and this
without the "means test", provided it be possible
for it to recoup itself for such outlays by means
of a constitutional amendment conferring on
Ottawa a jurisdiction which at the present time
is exclusively provincial. Furthermore, the federal
government undertakes to contribute, with the
provinces, in a proportion of 50 per cent, to the
payment of an old age pension of $40.00 per month,
granted with "means test", to Canadian citizens
from age 65.
For Ithe purpose of helping the provinces secure
supplementary revenues in order to meet the
additional expenses occasioned by the provincial
contribution of 50 per cent to payment of pensions
starting at age 65 and up to age 70, the federal
authorities suggested a constitutional amendment
granting the provinces a limited power of indirect
taxation.
You forwarded to me with your letter of January
2 last two federal drafts of constitutional amendments, namely: (I indicate with capital letters the
amendments in question)
"A" 1. Add a new subsection to section 95 in the
following terms:
"(2) Notwithstanding anything in this Act, the
Parliament of Canada may make laws in relation
to old age pensions."
"B" 2. Re-enact head 2 of section 92 to read as
follows:
"2. The raising of revenue for provincial purposes by
(a) direct taxation within the province, and
(b) indirect taxation within the province in
respect of the sale of goods (except goods sold for
shipment outside the province) to a buyer for purposes of consumption or use and not for resale, at
a rate not exceeding three per centum of the sale
price, but not so as to discriminate between sales
of goods grown, produced or manufactured within
the province and sales of goods grown, produced
or manufactured outside the province."
On January 20, you wrote me to make alterations
to the federal draft relative to the 3 per cent
Indirect tax.
These draft amendments were submitted to the
council of ministers and, afterwards, to the Quebec
Legislature during the session presently being held.

SENATE
We have made known on several occasions the
decision cf the present government of Quebec to
co-operate with the federal authorities in the
establishment of an improved old age pensions
system that will be as complete as possible in the
circumstances.
Actually, on many occasions, we
have expressed the desire of the government of
the province to co-operate with the federal
authorities in the establishment of just and proper
old age pensions as from age 65.
The government sought and obtained from the
Legislature the authorization to conclude a friendly
agreement with the federal authorities in respect
of these matters. We have come to the following
conclusions:We deem the first draft amendment--amendment
"A" unacceptable for numerous reasons, of which
there are two special ones: in the first place,
because it confers on Ottawa an exclusive power
in a field exclusively reserved to the provinces;
then, because the terms of Section 95 with which
this draft amendment would be linked, grant, in
certain cases, a federal priority we deem inopportune in the circumstances.
With reference to the second draft amendment
which your letter of February 28 brings us, we
believe there would be cause to alter it. This
new draft reads as follows:"C" "It is hereby declared that the parliament of
Canada nay from time to tine make laws in
relation to old age pensions in Canada, but no law
made by the parliament of Canada in relation to
old age pensions shall affect the operation of any
law in relation to old age pensions within any
province made by the provincial legislature of
such province."
It seems to us that in constitutional matters it is
necessary to proceed cautiously and in a clear
and precise manner. The Canadian constitution is
a fundamîental document the importance of which
by far transcends ordinary conventions and effects
of which have repercussions a long time in the
future.
We consider that this constitutional amendment
should mention expressly that the matter has to
do with old age pensions starting at age 65 and
over. Besides, this federal draft amendment indicates the federal power to legislate "from time to
time" and does not make this important mention
in respect of provincial legislation. This difference in the wording could give the unfortunate
impression that the provincial powers are limited
to the present provincial legislation. In our opinion, it would be proper that the expressions "from
time to time" apply to the provincial legislative
power.
Do you not thing it would be proper, to avoid
any possible doubt in the future, to indicate definitely that the matter has to do, in respect of old
age pensions starting at age 70, with pensions of
at least $40.00 per month, granted without "means
test"?
There would also be cause, in our opinion, to
consider in this amendment, the fact that the provincial taxpayers and the federal taxpayers are
the same persons so as to avoid any possible
injustice with regard to the provinces which, each
and every one, are vitally interested.
Furthermore, we consider that this constitutional
amendment should exist by itself se as to indicate
clearly its special character and that, at all events,
it should not form part of Section 95 which grants
certain priorities to the federal body, sormething we
could not reasonably accept.

With reference to the draft amendment respecting the new provincial power of indirect taxation,
amendment marked "B" in this letter:As you are aware, we have expressed the desire
and opinion on many occasions Ihat, the fiscal or
financial power being a necessary corollary to the
exercise of the administrative
and legisIative
power, the provinces have the right to possess, in
a precise, clear and definitive manner, all the
sources of revenue indispensable to the performance of their obligations as well as to the exercise
of their rights and this, not only with a view to
the present but also with a view to the future, for
te govern is to foresee.
On the other hand, as this aspect of the problem
is one of the very vast scope, and we wish to
co-operate in the rapid enactment of appropriate
and just old age pension legislation, we shall limit
our remarks, at the prescnt time, to the draft
submitted.
It follows from the correspondence that the
federal is not disposed to acknowledge te the
provinces an indirect retail sales tax exceeding
3 per cent.
As a further manifestation of our desire to
co-operate and subject to our rights and to our
suggestions in respect of the exact delimitation
of the provincial and federal fiscal and financial
powers, we will make no objection to this constitutional financial amendment provided it is
more clear, more effective and more capable of
application.
We acknowledge the expediency of
forestalling any possible discrimination between
the provinces and, in the circumstances, of subordinating the application of this power to the
retail trade.
However, it seems to us that the expression
"goods", in the suggested amendment. may open
the door to multiple conflicts of interpretation and,
in short, render illusory a good portion of the new
rights conferred by this amendment. We believe
it would be proper to grant to the provinces the
right to apply an indirect sales tax in the retail
sales field, "at the retail sale level". This expression appears to us more clear, more just and
better suited than the expression "sale of goods".
We understand the expediency of the distinction
you make with respect te goods sold at the retail
level for consumption or use in one province by a
citizen of that province.
It goes without saying that all precautions should
be taken so that the new constitutional amendment should not have the effect of calling in
question the power of the provinces of imposing
sales and education taxes, that are imposed in the
province of Quebec, to quote but one example.
In a word, you can rest assured, as we have
proven on numerous occasions, that it is the sincere
desire of the province to co-operate in a friendly
and loyal spirit, with the federal authorities in the
expeditious formulation and application of a just
and appropriate system of old age pensions, starting at age 65.
On several occasions, yourself and the Prime
Minister, the Right Honourable Mr. St. Laurent,
have acknowledged and proclaimed the bilingual
character of our country, and that is why in a
matter of this importance, we deem proper that
the opinion of the province of Quebec be conveyed in the language of the immense majority of
the population of our province.
With my sincere regards,
(sgd.) M. L. Duplessis

NOVA SCOTIA
The Premier, Halifax
March 12, 1951

Hon. Stuart Garson, P.C., M.P.,
Minister of Justice and Attorney General,
Ottawa, Canada.
Dear Mr. Garson:
Let me thank you for your letter of February
28 and for the proposed amendment to the B.N.A.
Act mentioned therein.
So far as Nova Scotia is concerned, I may say
that we think that there is agreement between
us on the purpose of amendment and generally
upon the method of amendment.
The amendment proposed in your letter used the
phrase "in
Canada" instead of the phrase at
present used in section 95 "in all or any of the
provinces". I am not sure whether the new phrase
is to be taken to mean that any dominion law
in relation to old age pensions must be uniform
in its application and operation throughout Canada.
In fact, the operation of old age pension laws
has varied. Thus I think that when Prince Edward
Island began to pay old age pensions, they fixed
the maximum monthly payment at $15 instead of
$20 which was the maximum In all or most of
the provinces. However, I believe that a great
deal can be done in such matters by regulations
agreed to jointly by the dominion and any province,
and perhaps the point which I raise in this paragraph is not of great significance.
I doubt whether the concluding clause Is essential in order to assure concurrent powers to Canada
and the provinces. I refer to the clause which
reads: "but no law made by the parliament of
Canada in relation to old age pensions shall affect
the operation of any law in relation to old age
pensions made by a provincial legislature". I
would suggest, therefore, that this clause be deleted,
but if the general desire is to have some such
clause in the amendment, I should like to suggest
the following words be used: "but no Iaw made
by the parliament of Canada In relation to old
age pensions shall detract from the legislative
competence of a provincial legislature in relation
to old age pensions".
As to the amendment with regard to the Imposition of indirect taxes by the province, I note that
your letter does not suggest any redraft of the
original proposal.
I should like, however, to repeat, what I have
already said in my memorandum which accompanied my letter of January 19. That was that the
amendment constitutes the sole source of the
provinces' power to impose an indirect tax. It
ought, therefore, to the sufficiently wide in Its
terms to authorize any tax which it is contemplated
the provinces should have a right to impose.
Yours very truly,

Hon. Stuart Garson,

Ottawa, Canada.
Dear Mr. Garson:I received in due course your letter of February
28 relating to constitutional amendments which
have been under study respecting old age pensions
and a provincial sales tax.
80713--26

This letter will deal only with the first proposed
amendment. I feel this division of the matter is
justified inasmuch, as pointed out in my letter of
February 2, the two matters are "quite distinct
one from the other and capable of separate action".
Some confusion seems to have developed In
certain quarters where an opinion or view has
developed that the sales tax amendment was part
and parcel of the old age pension plan which was
under study at the December Federal-Provincial
Conference. All governments there represented are
fully aware that there is no relation or connection
between the two and that the old age pension
plan can go forward without any sales tax amendment.
In order, however, to emphasize this point I am
referring herein only to the old age pension amendment and shall make the proposals regarding a
sales tax amendment the subject of another letter
to follow shortly.
Having in my letter to you of February 2 agreed
to the proposed amendment relating to old age
pensions originally proposed we are quite prepared
to accept either of the alternative amendments set
out in your letter of February 28. We have no
preference in the matter and either of the latest
proposals which receives the assent or concurrence
of the other provinces will have our approval.
Yours sincerely,

THE PREMIER
Fredericton
March 13, 1951
Hon. Stuart Garson, K.C.,
Minister of Justice,
Ottawa, Canada.
Dear Mr. Garson:
Yesterday I replied in part to your letter of February 28, relating to amendments to the British
North America Act, respecting old age pensions and
a provincial sales tax.
For reasons then stated I dealt only with the
first mentioned amendment. Herein I shall state our
views on the proposed taxation amendment, a matter entirely distinct and separate from the other.
Your letter of February 28 suggests that the
federal government is inclined to stand by the principles of the sales taX amendment as previously
indicated In your letter of January 2 and January
20.
As pointed out in my letter of February 2, our
interest in such a constitutional amendment rests
upon the advantage that an indirect sales tax at the
retail level is considered to possess over a consumers tax such as is now operating in several of
the provinces, which involves a direct levy on the
purchaser at the time of the retail sale.
When last year the legislature of this province
adopted a consumers' tax much of the opposition to
it centred around the features of It connected with
its collection. It was to meet the alleged objectionable features of this form of taxation that this
government has been supporting the proposal for a
change in the constitution under which our present
levy could be imposed in another form-that is as
an indirect sales tax at the retail level.
In passing it may be observed that some who were
then expressing criticism of our present tax because
of the bothersome collection methods involved
would now appear to be sympathetic to the opposi-

SENATE
tion being voiced against the constitutional amendment which bas since been proposed and which if
adopted would serve to overcome their former
objections.
While we are still interested in an amendment to
the constitution which would permit us to abolish
our present tax and replace it by an indirect sales
tax we sec no advantage for this province in the
present federal proposal.
To meet the needs of this province and its municipalities the rate of our new tax last year was fixed
at four per cent. By adopting this rate the legislature was able to provide extensive exemptions. the
most important being the complete exemption of
food and fuel. To replace this tax by an indirect
sales tax at three per cent, the maximum rate which
would be permitted under the amendment, would
doubtless mean the elimination of all exemptions.
There is reason to feel that behind this proposal
to limit in the amendment the jurisdiction of the
provinces to fix the tax rate is the thought that any
indirect sales tax imposed by a province under its
authority should be applied right across the board
to all retail sales without any provision for exemptions, even in matters as vital ta the average citizen
as food and fuel. The government of this province
is not prepared to adopt any such plan. In fact we
are defdnitely opposed to such notions.
It is difficult to regard the attitude of the federal
government on this point in any other light than a
determination to dictate to the provinces their policy
in taxation matters. We fail to sec why it should
concern the dominion whether a provincial indirect
sales tax should be two per cent, three per cent
or any other percentage. As a matter of principle
it seems to us that if the legislatures are vested with
jurisdiction in any field, large or small, they alone
should determine how their powers should be
exercised.
So on the one hand we are opposed in principle
to the amendment in the present foram.
On the
other hand we attach no value to it from the practical point of view. As stated it could have no
operation in this province unless the indirect taxation authorized by it were applied without exemptiens, a course to which as stated we are opposed.
The only other solution would be to have both
forms of taxation in use which no one would want.
Notwithstanding what has been written we will be
glad to be kept informed of the views of the other
provinces on this matter and any developments
connected therewith. If all the other provinces
agree to the constitutional amendment in the form
proposed by you we would feel very strongly constrained to agree thereto in the interest of cooperation and goodwill.
Yours sincerely,

The Hon. Stuart Garson, K.C.,
Minister of Justice and Attorney
General of Canada,

Dear Mr. Garson:
In my letter dated February 5, 1951, I stated:
"We are satisfied that the wording which you
have suggested for the two proposed constitutional
amendments will carry out the spirit and intent of
the dicisions arrived at during the Federal-Provincial Conference of last December."
As far as the proposed amendment to the British
North America Act respecting old age pensions
was concerned, we were satisfied with the suggested wording. For this reason we undertook to
submit the proposed amendment to the legislature
as soon as possible with our complete endorsation
and support.
With respect to your comments, we agree with
the opinion expressed in your letter of February
28, 1951, that the effect of the amendment originally
proposed was not to give the government of
Canada sole jurisdiction in the field of old age
pensions legislation. While we are of the opinion
that the first draft amendment with respect to old
age pensions would leave the provinces jurisdiction
to deal with old age pensions, we do not see
why either of the redrafts set out on pages two
and three of your letter would not be satisfactory.
Of the two redrafts, the second set out on page
three of your letter would be preferable as it
makes it clear that the provinces had jurisdiction
previously, and will continue to have jurisdiction
In the field of old age pensions legislation.
In view of your suggestion that the redrafts of
the proposed amendment respecting old age pensions be considered, and in view of the conclusions
we arrived at after studying your suggestions, we
decided that it would be advisable to redraft the
resolution submitted to the legislature on February
8, 1951. The resolution as redrafted appears on page
two of the votes and proceedings of the legislative
assembly of Saskatchewan, number 32, Friday,
March 16, 1951, as follows:

Ottawa, April 3, 1951
The Honourable L. M. Frost, K.C.,
Premier of Ontario,
Parliament Buildings,
Toronto, Ontario.
Dear Mr. Frost,On February 28, 1951, I wrote to you forwarding
two alternative drafts to the first old age pensions
amendment draft which I had forwarded to you
in my letter of January 2, 1951. In my said letter
of February 28, I also dealt with representations
which had been made by a number of the provincial premiers concerning the matters referred
to in my letter of January 2, 1951.
I now enclose, herewith, the replies to my said
letter of February 28, 1951, which I list as follows:

1951;
Letter from Premier Douglas, dated March 22,
1951;
Telegram fron Hon. C. Rhodes Smith, K.C.,
dated April 2, 1951.
It is to deal with the points which have been
raised in these enclosed communications, the last
of which I received only yesterday, that my present
letter, dated April 3, 1951, is being written.
The enclosed letters show that the governments
of Alberta, British
Columbia,
Ontario, New
Brunswick,
Newfoundland,
Saskatchewan
and
Manitoba have accepted either the second or third
drafts of the old age pensions amendment. The
governient of Prince Edward Island prefers either
the first or the third draft.
The governinent of Nova Scotia seems willing to
accept either the second or the third draft, subject
to their being satisfied with regard to the "but"
clause in the draft. The Honourable Mr. Macdonald
suggested that this should be revised to read:
"But no law made by the parliament of Canada
in relation to old age pensions shall detract from
the legislative competence of a provincial legislaturc in relation to old age pensions." The purpose
of this "but" clause is to make it clear that any
federal old age pensions laws would not override
any provincial old age pensions laws. We think
that if the Nova Scotia wording is adopted and if
parliament legislates in a field where the province
may also legislate, one of two results may follow:
First, parliament may oust the jurisdiction of the
province; or, second, in the event of repugnancy,
the act of parliament may override a provincial
act. Nova Scotia's proposed draft deals with the
first possibility, but leaves the second untouched.
Thus, if there is a repugnancy, the act passed by
parliament will override the provincial act-the
very thing that we are seeking to avoid. We therefore would prefer our own original language as
follows:
"But no law made by the parliament of Canada
in relation to old age pensions shall affect the
operation of any law in relation to old age pensions within any province made by the provincial
legislature of such province."
The government of Quebec rejects the first draft
of the old age pensions amendment and comments
only on the third draft. We take it from the Hon.
Mr. Duplessis' letter of March 11, 1951, that the
third draft is preferable to the Quebec government
provided certain changes in the third amendment
are made, as follows:
1. The Honourable Mr. Duplessis objects to the
fact that parliament is given power to legislate
"from time to time" whereas this phrase is not
used in the reference to provincial laws. Upon
consideration, this point seems to be well taken.
We see no objection to striking out the phrase
"from time to time" in the third draft. This would
leave parliament in the same position as the provincial legislatures in this regard.
2. The Honourable Mr. Duplessis takes the position that the old age pensions constitutional

amendment should stand by itself and should not
form part of Section 95. In this connection it will
be noticed that we have numbered the old age
pensions constitutional amendment as Section 95A,
that is, as a section quite distinct and apart from
Section 95.
We would have no objection to
emphasizing this distinction still further by having
inserted in the British North America Act a
heading "Old Age Pensions" just above the proposed new Section 95A.
3. The Honourable Mr. Duplessis thinks that the
amendment should mention that it concerns old
age pensions as from the age of 65 years and over;
and that
4. It would be advisable to point out clearly that
with regard to the old age pensions from the age
of 70, what it intended is a pension of $40.00 per
month without a means test.
The views of the other provincial premiers are
invited with reference to the Hon. Mr. Duplessis'
suggestions Nos. 3 and 4. We think that these are
two points upon which there should be concensus
of opinion before the wording in the draft constitutional amendment is amended to take care of
them.
T would accordingly submit for your approval
a redraft of the third draft to read as follows:
"Old Age Pensions
95A It is hereby declared that the parliament of
Canada may make laws in relation to old age
pensions in Canada, but no law made by the
parliament of Canada in relation to old age pensions shall affect the operation of any law in
relation to old age pensions within any province
made by the provincial legislature
of such
province".
Re: Sales Tax Amendment
The present draft amendment reads as follows:
"2. Re-enact head 2 of section 92 to read as
follows:
"2. The raising of revenue for provincial purposes
by
(a) direct taxation within the province, and
(b) indirect taxation within the province in
respect of the sale of goods (except goods sold
for shipment outside the province) to a buyer for
purposes of consumption or use and not for resale,
at a rate not exceeding three per centum of the
sale price, but not so as to discriminate between
sales of goods grown, produced or manufactured
within the province and sales of goods grown,
produced or manufactured outside the province,
and not so as to discriminate between sellers or
classes of sellers of the same class of goods".
The provinces of British Columbia, Alberta,
Saskatchewan,
Newfoundland,
Prince
Edward
Island and Manitoba have agreed. New Brunswick
still continues its objection to the fixing of the
rate at 3 per cent and still suggests 4 per cent,
but says:
"If all the other provinces agree te the constitutional amendment in the form proposed by you
we would feel very strongly constrained to agree
thereto in the interests of cooperation and goodwill".
The Honourable Mr. Macdonald of Nova Scotia
repeats the observations made earlier. They were
to the following effect:
1. That it would be preferable to leave the
present 92(2) as it stands and to add a new head
for the new taxing power. Provided it meets with
the approval of the other provincial goverlnents,
we in Ottawa would have no objection to framing

MAY
the amendment in this way and accordingly would
suggest that a new head could be added under
section 92 to read as follows:
"2A. The raising of revenue for provincial purposes by indirect taxation within the province in
respect of the sale of goods (except goods sold for
shipment outside the province) to a buyer for
purposes of consumption or use and not for resale,
at a rate not exceeding three per centum of the
sale price, but not so as to discriminate between
sales of goods grown, produced or manufactured
within the provinces and sales of goods grown,
produced or manufactured outside the province
and not so as to discriminate between sellers or
classes of sellers of the same class of goods."
2. That the exemption of goods sold for shipment
outside the province should be in the discretion
of the provincial legislature, on the ground that
if this limitation Is included no province would
then be in a position to levy a tax in respect of
interprovincial transactions. This bas been carefully considered but we feel that the exception is
necessary in order to confine the taxing power to
taxation within the province.
3. That section 121 of the British North America
Act might be enough to prevent discrimination
against goods produced or manufactured outside
the province. It may be that section 121 bas this
effect but we feel that It would be desirable to
put the matter beyond doubt.
4. That services, combinations of services and
materials and intangible things such as electricity,
are not included in the section, and that there
might be difficulty In dealing with products that
are sold at retail and then incorporated In a manufactured product that is also sold at retail. These
matters were dealt with In my letter of February
28.
The Honourable Mr. Frost of Ontario tas made
no comment.
The Honourable Mr. Duplessis comments that
Quebec would have no objection to this sales tax
amendment "provided it be made clearly more
effective and more susceptible to application"; and
that this could be done by conferring a power to
Impose an indirect sales tax in the retail sales
field at the retail sales level. Perhaps I should
say in this connection that in one of our original
drafts we did refer to a retail sales tax, but
exception was taken by one of our tax experts
concerning the use of the expression "retail". The
dictionary meaning of "retail" Is simply to sell
in small quantities, and it was not felt that this
was clear enough. We then spelled out more
specifically the type of sales to which we were
referring, namely, a sale to a buyer for the purpose
of consumption or use and not for resale. In
doing this we adopted the language which was
used in the Quebec Sales Tax Act. That act
imposes a tax on a purchaser "at the time of
making a purchase at a retail sale" but it does
not rest with the dictionary meaning of the term
"retail", but goes on to define "retail sale" as
meaning "a sale to a purchaser or user for the
purpose of consumption or use and not for resale".
We still think that the Quebec language which
we have adopted is the best suited for the purpose
of this constitutional amendment.
In conclusion may I invite your comments upon,
and I hope your agreement with
1. the latest draft of the constitutional amendment regarding old age pensions on page 3 of this
letter;
2. the latest draft re provincial Indirect retail
sales tax on page 4 of this letter.
In these two latest drafts we have tried to
incorporate the views of all provincial governments
in a manner acceptable to all provincial governments.

I
This letter Is being sent out at the earliest
possible date after I had heard from ail of the
provincial governments. I am asking all the provincial premiers to give these matters prior attention. The constitutional amendments which may
be agreed upon will have to be secured from the
parliament of the United Kingdom. There are
reasons why it is desirable to secure any wise
amendments upon which we may agree as soon
possible.

FREDERICTON
The Premier
April 10, 1951
Hon. Stuart Garson, K.C.,
Minister of Justice,
Ottawa, Canada.
Dear Mr. Garson:
I received in due course your letter of April 3
respecting the two constitutional amendments
which have been under consideration relating
respectively to old age pensions and a provincial
sales tax.
In listing the replies received to your letter of
February 28 you omitted any reference to my letter
of March 12. Copy of that letter as well as my
letter of March 13 was among the lot of correspondence containing the replies of the provincial

MAY 8, 1951
premiers to your letter of February 28 which was
forwarded ta me. I assume therefore that copies
of both letters went ta all premiers.
My purpose in writing two separate letters dealing with the two proposed amendments was
indicated by me therein. For the reasons given I
consider it most essential that the two matters be
recognized as separate and distinct. While your
letter of the third instant did not dissociate the
two amendments it is our hope that the federal
government regards them as two entirely separate
matters and shares our view that the old age
pension amendment is not contingent upon the
adoption of the other.
I am prompted ta emphasize this matter again
after reading the correspondence with the provinces forwarded by you in which will be found
passages in which the two matters are tied
together.
The government of this province would welcome
an assurance from you that so far as the federal
government is concerned the two amendments are
not inseparable; and in particular that the old age
pension amendment will not stand or fall with the
other.
Whether or not agreement can be reached on the
sales tax amendment it seems evident early agreement can be arrived at on the pensions amendment.
There can be no doubt that all provinces are one
in their desire ta see the new old age pension
plan in operation at the earliest possible moment.
On the assumption that general agreement is
arrived at with the provinces on both proposed
amendments we have another suggestion to offer.
It is that the matters should be dissociated when
laid before parliament.
In other words they
should, in our view, be made the subject of two
separate joint addresses.
Recognizing that opposition to the sales tax
amendment has become quite vocal in some
quarters and recalling the fate of a similar proposal
in the Senate a few years ago we feel that a
revised old age pension plan for this country
should not be placed in jeopardy by being presented to parliament as part of a joint amending
operation involving aise the sales tax matter,
which may again prove very controversial.
We hope, and urge, that some heed may be paid
ta this suggestion for separate treatment in the
two Houses of Parliament.
May I now refer ta the lastest proposals regarding the two amendments as advanced in your
letter of April 3?
For the old age pension amendment you suggest
a new section in the B.N.A. Act ta be numbered
95A with the caption "Old Age Pensions" and ta
read as follows,"It is hereby declared that the parliament of
Canada may make laws in relation ta old age
pensions in Canada, but no law made by the
parliament of Canada in relation to old age pensions shall affect the operation of any law in
relation ta old age pensions within any province
made
by the provincial legislature of such
province."
The government of this province approves of the
amendment in that form and language.
With respect ta the sales tax amendment we
agree with the suggestion advanced by Nova
Scotia that Head 2 of Section 92 of the B.N.A. Act
should remain untouched. Therefore the proposal
made by you that any sales tax amendment be
the subject matter of a new head, ta be numbered
2A, meets with our approval.
From that point we do not view the proposais
with the same degree of satisfaction or equanimity.
In this connection I would repeat the reasons contained in my letter of March 13.

In our view the matter bas become unduly
involved and difficult through the insistence of the
federal government on placing restrictions on the
exercise by the provincial legislatures of the
proposed new taxing powers.
I feel constrained to quote here one paragraph
in my letter of March 13 which reads as follows:
"It is difficult to regard the attitude of the
federal government on this point in any other
light than a determination to dictate to the provinces their policy in taxation matters. We fail
ta see why it should concern the dominion whether
a provincial indirect sales tax should be two per
cent, three per cent or any other percentage. As
a matter of principle it seems to us that if the
legislatures are vested with jurisdiction in any
field, large or small, they alone should determine
how their powers should be exercised."
We are at a loss ta understand why the federal
governnent should take such an arbitrary stand.
Why should it presume to dictate policy to the
provinces? There is a principle at stake here upon
which we feel the provinces should be adamant.
As further stated in my said letter this government has no practical interest in the sales tax
amendment as proposed by you. To use the
powers it would give, in order to replace our
present consumers' tax with an indirect sales tax,
would require the abandonment of all our exemptions-on food, fuel and everything else-a course
which is altogether repugnant ta us.
We would be very reluctant to consent ta the
taxation amendment as proposed. However, we will
adhere ta the undertaking given in my letter of
March 13-"If all the other provinces agree to
the constitutional amendment in the form proposed
by you we would feel very strongly constrained to
agree thereto in the interest of cooperation and
goodwill."
Yours sincerely,
(Sgd.)

SASKATCHEWAN
Premier's Office
Regina, April 13, 1951
Hon. Stuart S. Garson, K.C.,
Minister of Justice,
House of Commons,
Ottawa, Ontario.
Dear Mr. Garson:
The government of Saskatchewan là of the
opinion that the redraft of the third draft set
out on page 3 of your letter, as indicated below.
is satisfactory:
"Old Age Pensions"
"95A It is hereby declared that the parliament
of Canada may make laws in relation ta old age
pensions in Canada, but no law made by the paliament of Canada in relation ta old age pensions
shail affect the operation of any law in relation
to old age pensions within any province made by
the provincial legislature of such province."
As to the suggestion of the premier of Quebec
that the amendment should mention that it concerna
old age pensions as from the age of 65 years and
over, the government of Saskatchewan feels that
it would not be advisable ta preclude the extension of pensions ta those below age 65 without a
further amendment to the British North America
Act.
While it ls agreed that the pension that is paid
to the age group 70 and over will be $40 per
month without means test, and while It can be

SENATE
appreciated that it is desirable that this pension should at no time be reduced to a level
which will not provide at least a minimum standard
of subsistence, we are of the opinion that the
amendment should be limited to matters of principle respecting the spheres of jurisdiction of the
government of Canada and the governments of
the provinces with regard to old age pensions.
We trust that there is now sufficient agreement
on the proposed old age pensions amendment to
enable the government of Canada to prepare the
necessary legislation to provide pensions of $40 per
month without means test to all aged '0 and over,
beginning January 1, 1952, as agreed upon at the
Federal-Provincial Economic Conference in Decemner last.
Yours sincerely,

Edmonton, April 16, 1951
The Honourable Stuart S. Garson, K.C.,
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada,
Ottawa, Canada.
Dear Mr. Garson:
I am in receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant
outlining the suggestions made by the premiers of
the various provinces of Canada in relation to the
proposed amendments to the British North America
Act.
The legislature of this province by a unanimous
resolution adopted in principle the amendments outlined in your communication, and I therefore am
pleased to advise that I approve of the amendment
to section 95a as outlined on page 3 of your letter
and reading as folIows:
"95a. It is hereby declared that the parliament of
Canada may make laws in relation to old age pensions in Canada, but no law made by the parliament
of Canada in relation to old age pensions shall affect
the operation of any law in relation to old age
pensions within any province made by the provincial legislature of such province."
I also agree with the proposed amendment to
section 92 by including a new subhead 2a as set out
on page 4 of your Ietter and reading as follows:
"2a. The raising of revenue for provincial purposes by indirect taxation within the province in
respect of the sale of goods (except goods sold for
shipment outside the province) to a buyer for purposes of consumption or use and not for resale, at
a rate not exceeding three per centum of the sale
price, but not so as to discriminate between sales
of goods grown, produced or manufactured within
the provinces and sales of goods grown, produced or
manufactured outside the province and not so as to
discriminate between sellers or classes of sellers of
the same class of goods."
Yours very truly,
(sgd.) Ernest Manning
Premier
Office of the Minister of Justice
CANADA
Ottawa, April 16, 1951
The Honourable J. B. MeNair, K.C.,
Premier of New Brunswick,
Fredericton, N.B.
Dear Mr. MeNair:
Thank you for your reply of April 10 to my letter
of April 3, 1951.
As you correctly state my said letter omitted any
reference to your letter of March 12. This was a

cIerical mistake that occurred only in the letter to
yourself. The letters to all of the other provincial
premiers contain this reference; and in all of them,
including your own, there was enclosed a copy of
your letter of March 12.
So far as the federal government is concerned,
you are quite right in regarding the two constitutional amend.ments dealing with old age pensions
and a provincial sales tax as being separate and
distinct. The only reason why at each successive
stage of my correspondence with the provincial
premiers I have dealt with these two amendments in
the same letter was to place before the premiers
al! matters under discussion in the one comprehensive letter and thereby expedite matters by decreasing the number of letters which wc have to
exchange.
We have always taken the position,
however, that the adoption of the old age pensions
constitutional amendment is not contingent upon
the adoption of the sales tax constitutional amendment.
Whether some provincial governments might feel
that the extra revenue possibilities which would be
made available to them by the passage of the sales
tax amendment would affect their attitude towards
the old age pensions amiendient or the tax agreements, we obviously cannot say.
In line with the thought that these two constitutional amendments are separate and distinct, we are
quite agreeable, if the provinces wish it that way,
that these two constitutional amendments should be
made the subject of two separate joint addresses to
be presented to the parliament of Canada requesting respectively that these two constitutional
amendments should be passed by the parliament of
the United Kingdom.
With great respect I cannût agree with your complaint that the federal goveroment is seeking to
place restrictions upon the exercise by the provincial legislatures of the proposed new retail sales
taxing power. The facts, I suggest are as follows:
At the conference the provincial governments asked
for a cn.stitutionail amendment to enable them to
occupy jointly with the dominion government a
portion of the field of indirect taxation. For this
privilege the provincial governments offered, and
the foderal government has asked for, no quid pro
quo or compensation of any kind; for, as you
correctly imply, the granting of this privilege of
joint occupation by the provincial governments with
the federal government of a part of the field of
indirect taxation is not contingent upon any other
matter.
By granting to the provincial governments at their
request the right to use jointly with the federal
government a portion of the field of indirect taxation, the federal government will automatically
restrict its own exclusive use of that field. SureIy
then it is reasonable that the federal government
in making such a grant for no consideration, may
specify the limits of its grant by imposing this
3 per cent limitation. Within the limitations of the
3 per cent grant the provinces have complete
liberty to use these indirect retail sales taxing
powers in any way in which they see fit, except that
they may not use them to discriminate between
goods produced within and goods produced without
a taxing province or to discriminate between sellers
or classes of sellers of the same class of goods.
This clause against discrimination the provinces
themselves have willingly agreed to, and indeed
have helped to draft.
If by merely limiting the extent to which its
exclusive field may be shared, to a 3 per cent rate,
the fed'eral government is to be regarded as dictating policy to the provincial governments, it clearly
would be better for the fedesal government not to
share its exclusive field at all, and thus avoid
charges or suspicion that it is dictating policy to

MAY 8, 1951
If the sales tax
the provincial governments.
amendment were not proceeded with, that fact
would not necessarily disturb the old age pensions
amendment or the renewal of the dominion-provincial tax agreements.
It is important that there should be a clear
understanding that the federal government is not at
all anixious to surrender a portion of its own field
of taxation in this way. It is doing so because the
provinces have made out a strong case that they
need and would like to have the joint use of a
portion of the indirect tax field, and because the
dominion government wishes in this, as in other
matters, to co-operate to the fullest extent possible
with the provinces. If, however, any of the provinces, upon any grounds whatever, are opposed to
the provinces having the power to impose a 3 per
cent indirect sales tax, the federal government
would be quite glad to retain the whole of the
indirect tax field to itself since it obviously would
be better off if it did so.
Yours truly,
(sgd.) Stuart S. Garson
P.S. Since dictating the above I have received

PROVINCE OF QUEBEC
Prime Minister's Office
Quebec, April 18, 1951
Honourable Stuart Garson, K.C., P.C.,
Minister of Justice,
Ottawa.
Dear Mr. Garson:
On April 9th last, I received your letter dated
April 3rd, in reply to mine of March lth,
in
connection with old age pensions and with the
proposed amendment concerning an indirect provincial tax. Thank you for sending me the copies
of the letters you mention and which my colleagues
and I have read and considered with the greatest interest.
This morning, ai the meeting of the council of
ministers,
we
have
again
considered
these
important problems.
This afternoon, I received your letter dated
April 16, together with copies of the letter dated
April 10 which you received froi
Hon. Mr.
McNair and of your reply of April 16. I am much
obliged to you for this courtesy.
On several occasions, among others during the
federal-provincial conference held in Ottawa last
December, and in my letter to you of March 11
last, we have clearly stated the attitude of the
province of Quebec.
We are still in favour of an old age pensions
system, which would be fair and appropriate and
would apply from 65 years of age and over. We
believe such a system should be established as
soon as possible.
In our opinion, it would seem appropriate and
even necessary to consider as two separate matters
the problem concerning old age pensions and the
problem concerning the new tax which is proposed.
I am happy to hear, tom your letter which I have
received this afternoon, that the federal authorities
are willing to dissociate these two problems and
to consider them separately. I wish to thank the
federal authorities for I am convinced that, in the
circumstances, such a step is imperative.
We consider that the proposed indirect provincial sales tax does not meet the situation and

SENATE
would complicate rather than assist in the settlement of the important problem of old age pensions.
Such a result should be avoided.
Serious doubts exist as to the timeliness of this
new tax and we feel that clearness and precision
are always desirable in constitutional matters.
We still favour the establishment of an old age
pension for persons 65 years of age and over, and
we are willing to accept a clear and precise constitutional amendment giving the federal government a power it does not possess presently, that
is to make laws in this matter, without however
infringing upon provincial rights.
The latest amendment suggested by you reads
as follows:
"Old Age Pensions
95A It is hereby declared that the parliament of
Canada may make laws in relation to old age pensions in Canada, but no law made by the parliament of Canada in relation to old age pensions
shall affect the operation of any law in relation
to old age pensions within any province made by
the provincial legislature of such province."
As I mentioned in my letter to you dated March
11 last, we would prefer that the age be mentioned
in the amendment, but if this condition tends to
delay the coming into force of old age pensions
for persons aged 65 years and over, we will not
press the point. However, we deem it necessary
and fair to indicate fully that the new rights
granted the federal government in this matter of
old age pensions must in no way diminish provincial rights.
Consequently, to our mind, an essential amendment is called for. The words " . . . made by the
provincial legislature of such province" refer to
the past and the present but they take no account
of the future.

The wording should be: " . . . made

or to be made by the provincial legislature of
such province".
Furthermore, do you not think it would be fair
and appropriate that the address voted by the
federal parliament to be forwarded to the parliament at Westminster should be drafted both in
French and in English to mark fully, once more,
the bilingual character of our nation? This wish
seems to us a legitimate one.
With kindest regards, I beg to remain,
Yours truly,
(sgd.)

Dear Mr. Garson:
The premier just handed me a copy of a letter
from Premier MeNair to yourself dated April 11,
in regard to the proposed amendments to the

We, of course, have passed resolutions in the

course by the provincial secretary as to the contents of the resolutions.
We dealt with the two matters separately and
while there was no opposition to the resolution
regarding old age pensions, there was some opposition to the proposal involving indirect taxation
power.
It seems to me that the two matters are in no
way connected. The provinces need not resort to
an indirect sales tax in order to secure funds to
pay their share of the proposed pension payable
to needy persons between 65 and 69 years of age.
I think there is little doubt of the legality of our
tax on the consumer under our sales tax legislation. Certainly there is no doubt of such legality
in relation to the tax in its impact on sales at the
retail levels over the counter.
Our tax, of course, is wider and applies to
heavy machinery purchased by industry, but it is
clear on the authorities that a tax on the consumer such as we collect on gasoline and now
under the social security and municipal aid tax
is within the jurisdiction of a province. Therefore
the provinces could, if they saw fit, and require
further revenue to meet their share of the pension,
introduce similar legislation.
I therefore agree that if there is any doubt whatever that the House of Commons or the Senate
might refuse to approve the indirect tax, the
two matters should be kept separate.
I do not, however, agree with the argument of
Mr. McNair that the power to levy an indirect
tax should be without the limitation that it was
not to be more than 3 per cent. I would not think
that the national government would be agreeable
to grant such a power of taxation without limit
because it seems obvious to me that a provincial
government could, if so minded, upset the whole
economy of Canada if there was an unlimited
power of taxation in this respect.

The Premier
Halifax, April 21, 1951
Hon. Stuart S. Garson, P.C., K.C.,
Minister of Justice and Attorney
General of Canada,
Ottawa, Canada.
Dear Mr. Garson:
Thank you for your
which you enclosed
from the premiers of
of the 28th February

letter of the 3rd April with
copies of replies received
the provinces to your letter
last, with reference to the

MAY 8, 1951
proposed amendments to the British North America
Act respecting old age pensions and sales tax.
While I certainly have no desire to prolong
unduly discussion of the forms which the amendments should take, I believe that the considerations
which prompted the suggestions accompanying my
letter to you of the 19th January, last, are such as
to merit some further consideration.
Old Age Pensions
You are correct in your conclusion that Nova
Scotia is willing to accept elther the second or
third draft of the old age pensions amendment
subject to the "but" clause. Having reference to
your comments I would suggest that it is not
competent to parliament to oust the jurisdiction
of a province where that jurisdiction is granted
by the British North America Act. Furthermore,
I suggest that legislation passed at Ottawa has no
supremacy by reason merely of the fact that it
Conflict normally arises
is federal legislation.
between an exercise of federal powers under section
91 and an exercise of provincial powers under
section 92 and in such cases, having in mind the
express words of the initial and concluding paragraphs of section 91, federal legislation prevails.
It does so, however, only because section 91
expressly provides that it shall. I think that section
95 provides the only instance in the British North
America Act of concurrent powers and the express
words of the concluding clause of that section
were necessary to provide for the supremacy of
federal legislation in case of repugnancy. Such
supremacy might also be inferred from the use of
such a phrase as "nothwithstanding anything in
this act" as used in the original draft of the
amendment, or as used in section 101. In the
absence of any such words I suggest that there
would be no federal supremacy and for this reason
we have suggested that the "but" clause be eliminated altogether.
If, nothwithstanding what I have said, it is
considered that concurrent powers are not assured
without an additional clause, I still feel that
because of the nature of our old age pensions
legislation, both provincial and federal, "the operanecessarily
tion" of provincial legislation is
"affected" by changes in federal legislation. I say
the legislation contemplates agreethis because
ments between the dominion and a province the
terms of which necessarily vary with changes in
legislation. For this reason my suggestion was that
the clause should be "but no law made by the
old age
parliament of Canada in relation to
pensions shall detract from the legislative competence of a provincial legislature in relation to old
age pensions".
Nova Scotia is in complete agreement with the
suggestion that this amendment should take the
form of a new section 95A and that that section
should be preceded by a heading "Old Age Pensions".
Nova Scotia is also in agreement withe the
suggestion that the words "from time to time"
should either be deleted from the third draft or
inserted at the appropriate point in the second
draft.
With respect to the suggestions made by the
premier of Quebec referred to in your letter as
suggestions numbers 3 and 4, we think that it is
perhaps unusual to framne a constitutional amendment in this way. We therefore feel that while we
would not recommend the proposal, we would not
on the other hand offer any opposition to it if
the general view is favourable.

Sales Tax
With respect to the indirect taxation amendment,
Nova Scotia feels very strongly that the exemption
of goods sold for shipment outside a province
would offer wide scope for evasion. We do not
feel that this exemption is necessary in order
to confine the taxing power to taxation within a
province, as that confinement follows from the
normal territorial limits of the province's jurisdiction.
We feel that the use of the words "sale of goods"
is likely to create considerable confusion and
that, strictly construed, that phrase may limit
unnecessarily provincial taxing power. We have no
objection to the clauses aimed at the prevention
of discrimination and we suggest that the form
proposed by Nova Scotia, as set out in the comments accompanying my letter of the 19th January,
last, would overcome the difficulties I have outiined ond at the same time would confine provincial
taxation power within reasonable limits.
Yours very truly,
(Sgd.)

The Government of the
Province of New Brunswick
FRIEDERICTON
The Premier
April 24, 1951
Hon. Stuart Garson, K.C.,
Minister of Justice,
Ottawa, Canada.
Dear Mr. Garson:
I wish to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
of April 16 instant respecting the two constitutional
amendments that have been under discussion.
I appreciate and welcome your assurance that
the federal government does not regard the
adoption of the old age pensions constitutional
amendment as contingent in any way upon the
adoption of the sales tax amendment; and that it is
quite agreeable that these two proposed constitutional amendments should be made the subject of two separate and distinct joint addresses
to be presented to the parliament of Canada.
It was understood at the federal-provincial conference of December last that the old age pension
constitutional amendment would be sought at
Westminster in ample time to permit the Canadian
parliament at its 1951 session to enact the necessary
legislation to implement the pension programme
proposed by the federal government to the conference to the end that the new pension plans
would be in operation by January 1, 1952.
It is hoped that there will be no further delay in
obtaining agreement with the provinces on the
language and substance of the pension amendment
and that the appropriate joint address will shortly
be presented to the two bouses of parliament for
approval.
I have carefully read your observations regarding
the proposed sales tax amendment.
With all
respect I suggest that you have quite ignored the
real points at issue.
You state that "at the Conference the provincial
governments asked for a constitutional amendment
to enable them to occupy jointly with the dominion
government a portion of the field of indirect
taxation".
On a strained legalistic interpretation of the
matter your statement might possibly be upheld.
From a realistic and practical viewpoint it does not
interpret the situation at all.

SENATE
Under their powers of direct taxation given by
the E.N.A. Act the provinces can impose taxes on
retail transactions involving a sale of goods. Every
province in Canada is exercising that jurisdiction
through a gasoline tax. Five provinces are exercising the jurisdiction through general taxes
variously known as a purchaser's tax or consumer's
tax.
Every retail transaction involving the sale of
goods has two aspects to it. On one side it is a
sale, on the other side a purchase. Because of the
limitations imposed by the B.N.A. Act the provinces have to impose their tax in relation to the
purchase side of the transaction, in short as a
purchaser or consumer tax.
This has been thought to be a bothersome method
of collecting such a levy. In consequence the
dominion government was asked last December to
agree to put the provinces in a position unçler the
constitution whereby their taxation on retail transactions could be collected on the other aspect-the
sales side of the transaction. Because this might
give the tax the complexion of indirect taxation
the amendment was proposed.
So when one analyzes the situation it must, I
submit, be evident that the provinces are asking
from the dominion government nothing more than
a courtesy.
In your letter you stated that the federal government has asked for no quid pro quo or compensation of any kind for agreeing to the proposed
amendment. Why should it ask or think of asking
to be paid for something that amounts to nothing
more than a gesture of cooperation and goodwill?
I regret exceedingly the stand that has been
taken by the dominion governînent.
These are
days when federal-provincial cooperation should
be held precious. I doubt however if it can be
made to operate effectively over a one way street.
As stated before we will consent to any tax
amendient of the nature proposed that the other
provinces agree to even although it is quite devoid
of interest for us.
Yours sincerely,
JBM/H

SASKATCHEWAN
Premier's Office
Regina, April 25, 1951
Hon. Stuart Garson, K.C., M.P.,
Minister of Justice and
Attorney General of Canada,
House of Commons,
Ottawa, Ontario.
Dear Mr. Garson:
My colleagues and I have given careful consideratien to the latest redraft of the sales tax amendment as set out on page 4 of your letter of April 3,
1951, as follows:
"2A. The raising of revenue for provincial purposes by indirect taxation within the province in
respect of the sale of goods (except goods sold for
shipment outside the province) to a buyer for purposes of consumption or use and not for resale, at
a rate net .exceeding three per centum of the sale
price, but net so as to discriminate between sales
of goods grown, produced or manufactured within
the provinces, and sales of goods grown produced
or manufactured outside the province and net so
as to discriminate between sellers or classes of
sellers of the saie cIass of goods."

It would appear that the word "provinces" in
the tenth line of the redrafted amendment should
read "province."
The government of Saskatchewan is prepared to
accept the proposed amendment, framed as 2A of
section 92 of the British North America Act, as
satisfactory.
Our observations on comments that have been
made by other provincial governments, as well as
yourself, as set out below, are offered as our contribution to the solution of some of the differences
which apparently prevent agreement by some
provinces.
We are of the opinion that the sales tax amendment, as detailed above, will permit this province
to replace its present three per cent direct sales tax
with an indirect tax which will provide similar
revenue.
It can be appreciated, however, that
it might not be desirable to limit this indirect
tax since it n.gt
become necessary in
the
future, as it is at the present time in the
province of New Brunswick, to raise revenue
by the imposition of a sales tax at a rate exceeding
three per cent. Rising costs of government at the
provincial level may compel provinces te seek additional revenue through increasing the indirect sales
tax rate in much the same manner as the government of Canada chose to do recently to obtain additional indirect sales tax revenue by increasing the
federal sales tax. Under such circumstances, increasing the indirect sales tax rate would be
preferable and would avoid undesirable tax duplication by the imposition of a direct sales tax as well
as an indirect tax.
We concur in the general principle that the power
to levy indirect sales taxes by provincial governments ought to be confined te taxation within the
province. Hence, we are prepared to accept the
phrase "except goods sold for shipment outside the
province" as part of the proposed amendment.
It is suggested, however, that this restriction on
the power of the provinces to levy an indirect tax
on gonds sold for shipment outside the province
could be improved by inserting the words "by the
seller" immediately after the word "shipment" in
Such a
the exception appearing in parentheses.
change would eliminate any argument which might
arise by making it clear that the shipment of goods,
to be excluded from the tax, must be by the seller
in order to coae within the exclusion, as otherwise
the buyer might contend that ho is making a purchase for shipment outside the province, and it
would be difficult to check such statements of
intention.
With reference to the principle contained in the
exemption, it is clear that there would result a discrimination in favour of businesses such as mail
order concerns, which ship goods sold eat retail to
customers outside the province since such goods
would be wholly exempt from taxation by any
province.
We recognize, therefore, that there is some advantage in having the exemptions on goods sold for
shipment outside the province in the discretion of
the provincial legislatures, as advocated by the government of Nova Scotia. On the other hand, it
might be desirable to permit the province to levy
an indirect tax on mail order businesses located in
another province which sell goods at retail to
This
persons normally resident in the province.
could be accomplished by the addition of either
one of the following provisos to the redraft of
the proposed amendment:
"Provided that a tax may be levied on a person
outside the province with respect to a sale of goods
to a buyer for purposes of consumption or use
within the province, and such tax may be recovered

MAY 8, 1951
as a debt in the courts of the province where the
vendor ordinarily resides."
or
"Provided that the tax may be levied on a person
outside the province with respect to a sale to a
person ordinarily resident within the province for
consumption or use within the province or for shipment to such person within the province and such
tax may be recovered as a debt in the courts of the
province where such person is ordinarily resident."
It is suggested that such a proviso would meet
the problem raised by the government of the province of Nova Scotia.
Summary:
(1) The government of Saskatchewan is prepared
to accept the redrafted sales tax amendment as set
out on page 4 of your letter of April 3, 1951.
(2) The framing of the amendment as 2A under
section 92 of the British North America Act meets
with aur approval.
(3) The government of Saskatchewan is of the
opinion that a sales tax limited to a rate not exceeding three per cent would be satisfactory for a tax
that might replace the present Saskatchewan education and hospitalization tax, but we would be
prepared to agree to an increase in or the elimination of the limit in the amendment.
(4) The addition of the words "by the seller"
after the word "shipment" in the exception appearing in parentheses is suggested as an improvement
to the amendment.
(5) The addition of a proviso as set out above
providing for taxation of persons outside the province is suggested as a technique which might resolve
some of the difficulties that have prevented some
provinces from accepting your proposals.
The government of Saskatchewan has always
viewed the proposed sales tax amendment as quite
separate and distinct from the proposed amendment
respecting old age pensions. We would urge that
these amendments should be treated individually
and that they should be made the subject of
separate joint addresses of the Senate and House of
Commons to His Majesty requesting respectively
that these two constitutional amendments be passed
by the parliament of the United Kingdom. We
would also urge that any difference of opinion that
might delay general agreement on the proposed
sales tax amendment should neither interfere with
the amendment to the British North America Act
respecting old age pensions nor prevent the implementation of the old age pension program beginning
January 1, 1952.

purposes of this letter it does not seem necessary
to comment upon each of the points you have
raised.
In my letter to you dated April 7 I forwarded
to you a copy of the two resolutions passed by the
Manitoba legislature in connection with the proBy
these
constitutional
amendments.
posed
resolutions the legislature approved the principle
of the two amendments and authorized a member
of the Manitoba government to negotiate with the
federal government as to the most appropriate
form.
In accordance with those resolutions, I hereby
notify you that we are prepared to concur in the
two proposed amendments as submitted in your
letter of April 3. These are:
(1) The proposed amendment with respect to old
age pensions as contained on page three of your
letter which reads as follows,"95.A. It is hereby declared that the Parliament
of Canada may make laws in relation to old age
pensions in Canada, but no law made by the
parliament of Canada in relation to old age
pensions shall affect the operation of any law
in relation to old age pensions within any province made by the provincial legislature of such
province."
(2) The proposed amendment with respect to a
provincial sales tax, as suggested on pages 4 and
5 of your letter, which would add a new head
under section 92 reading as follows,"2A. The raising of revenue for provincial purposes by indirect taxation within the province in
respect of the sale of goods (except goods sold
for shipment outside the province) to a buyer for
purposes of consumption or use and not for resale,
at a rate not exceeding three per centum of the
sale price, but not so as to discriminate between
sales of goods grown, produced or manufactured
within the provinces and sales of goods grown,
produced or manufactured outside the province
and not so as to discriminate between sellers or
classes of sellers of the same class of goods."
In our opinion these new wordings are consistent
with those which we approved in the telegram sent
to you by our attorney-general, the Honourable
C. Rhodes Smith, on April 2. We are therefore prepared to concur in the wordings approved in our
telegram or the wordings quoted above.

THE LATE SENATOR PAQUET
TRIBUTES TO HIS MEMORY

Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Before the Orders of
the Day are called, it is my unhappy duty

to acquaint the bouse with the fact that one
of our colleagues, the late Honourable Eugene
Paquet, P.C., died yesterday morning at
St. Romuald, Quebec.
Senator Paquet was born in 1867, the year
of confederation, at Ste. Agapit de Lotbiniere,
in the county of Lotbiniere. He came of that
good Quebec farming stock which has produced so many of our public men from that
province.
He received his initial education at the
Seminary of Quebec, and then studied medicine at the University of Laval, where he
graduated with high honours, receiving the
M.D. degree in 1892. For a number of years he
practised his profession of medicine at the
village of St. Aubert, in the county of L'Islet,
and in the year 1904 he entered public life
from that part of the country, becoming a
member of parliament for L'Islet, a position
which he continued to occupy as a Conservative member of parliament until the year
1917. After that he moved to the county of
Bonaventure, where in the years 1921 and
1926 he unsuccessfully contested the riding
in the Conservative interest. In July of 1926
he was sworn of the Privy Council as Minister
of Soldiers' Civil Re-Establishment in the
government of the Right Honourable Mr.
Meighen, but retired a few weeks later when
that government was defeated at the polls.
In the year 1935 he was summoned to the
Senate,
representing
the
south
shore
St. Lawrence division of Lauzon. He was
constant in his attendance in the sessions
of this house, though of late years, owing
to age and infirmity, he did not take a very
prominent part in our proceedings.
Senator Paquet is survived by his widow
and one daughter, to whom we extend our
sincere sympathy in their sorrow.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
did not have the pleasure of knowing the late
Senator Paquet until he came to this house
in August, 1935, but then I came to know
him well. He was a quiet man who regularly
attended the sessions of this house, and took
an active part in the deliberations of our
committees. I always felt that he was fully
representative of the very best of our FrenchCanadian people.
A medical doctor, he gave great service to
the people of his own part of the country.
I .can say without fear of contradiction that
he was one of those men who of late years
have been disappearing from the Canadian
scene-the general practitioner in a rural
area.
Hon. Mr. King: Unfortunately.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Haig: My honourable friend from
Kootenay East (Hon. Mr. King) says "unfortunately". I certainly agree with him.
Senator Paquet was brilliant on the
hustings at the general election of 1904, and
he spoke eloquently in both languages in the
various political campaigns he fought. I felt
that appointment to the Senate was a fitting
way to honour such a man, who had given so
much to his country in his quiet, unostentatious way. As a medical doctor he had been
the friend of both the poor and rich, and I
know from speaking to people from his district just how much they loved him.
We in our group are growing fewer in
numbers, and we naturally miss our colleagues as they pass on. I would just remind
honourable senators that in the matter of
seniority I am now last among the senators
appointed by the late Mr. Bennett. I feel
rather lonely that Senator Paquet, who came
immediately behind me, has passed on. It
just seems tit
the call is that much closer
for me. I want to say to Senator Paquet's
widow and daughter that they have the
sincere sympathy of every rember of this
house.

(Translation):
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: Honourable senators, as I come from the Province of Quebec,
just as Senator Paquet did, it is my duty
to say a last word of tribute over his grave
while recalling some personal memories.
A moment ago, the leader of the opposition
mentioned that Dr. Paquet was a great orator
and debater.
Those who knew him as I remember him
a few years ago, in l'Islet county, will recall
an excellent speaker who could arouse an
extraordinary enthusiasm among the masses.
Not every one was willing to meet him on
the hustings.
Senator Paquet's great popularity was due
to the fact that he was a true country doctor,
one of what, unfortunately, is a vanishing
generation, a generation of men who were
devoted to their duty. We all remember the
country doctor of yesterday who went into
every home not only to heal bodies, but also
to look after souls. If Dr. Paquet remained
so long a representative of l'Islet county it
was because he treated practically every one
in that constituency...many of them free
of charge!
Another thing has struck me. Our leader
said a few moments ago that Senator Paquet
was born in 1867, the year of confederation.
It is indeed an honour to have come into
the world in that very year. Before confederation our country knew so many trials
that we may well say of those who came

into this world during that year that they
were born under a lucky star. This star in
fact guided the co-ordinators and creators
of a unity which is not yet perfect but
which, thanks to our good will and our efforts,
will improve before long.
At one time, Senator Paquet had a rather
alarming problem to settle. He did not want
to fail his party and at the same time he
could not deny, what he felt was right for
himself and his constituents. He gave up
his seat rather than vote for the former and
appear to betray the latter. This courageous
action, whether right or wrong, is worth
mentioning.
In the name of my colleagues from the
Province of Quebec, I wish to off er my deepest sympathies to Mrs. Paquet, to the daughter
of Dr. Paquet, and to all those who remember
him as he was-and I want to insist on this
picture-the good, true, charitable and devoted country doctor.
Here in the Senate, as in the other place,
he gave help, and we are grateful to him
for his excellent work. May his memory
live long among us!
Hon. Gustave Lacasse: Honourable senators, it is fitting perhaps under the circumstances that a member of the medical profession should rise, on his own and on behalf
of other members of his calling, to pay tribute
to the late Senator Paquet's memory.
I am not one of those who have long known
him personally, but his reputation as a great
and popular orator had reached us even
here in Ontario, and on the day he was
named to the Senate we knew that he had
well merited this honour through the services
he had rendered his party.
He was not long a member of his country's
government, but he had known hours of
triumph after many trials in the public life
of that era.
Senator Paquet was also a great Christian;
but his main characteristic, which was emphasized with a feeling and a sincerity which
are not unknown to me, was that of a
country doctor. Unanimous regrets have been
expressed on his occasion at the gradual
disappearance of this type of professional
man. Today, in these times of exaggerated
specialization, the country doctor is looked
down upon. One important fact is overlooked:
it is that somewhere, some competent and
conscientious man is needed to intelligently
direct the ailing towards the proper specialists. Someone is needed to perform this
indispensable task in the social field, and
this key man is surely the old family doctor,
the man who not only heals the body but,

MAY 9, 1951
as my colleague from Kennebec (Hon. Mr.
Vaillancourt) has pointed out, also strengthens and comforts the soul.
Honourable senators, the practice of medicine is truly a real social priesthood, a true
ministry, because a doctor treats the bodies
at the very moment when the source of life
which still animates poor worn-out human
beings is in a pitiful state of weakness and
diminished resistance. The general practitioner, who at the same time is the family
councillor, is surely the man best qualified
to create around his pitiful patient the moral
atmosphere which will be most conducive
to his return to health. And that is exactly
the noble task which our lamented colleague
so faithfully performed.
It is my duty to join with my colleagues
who have piously gathered around the
remains of this senator-doctor and to offer
to the members of his family and to all
those who lament his loss, my most sincere
condolences and deepest sympathy.

INTERNATIONAL TRADE AGREEMENTS
CONCESSIONS

NEGOTIATED AT TORQUAY,
ENGLAND

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. A. Neil McLean: Honourable senators, I should like to draw the attention of
the house for a few moments to a matter
which I think is of national importance.
Honourable members no doubt noticed in
this m.orning's newspapers the new trade
concessions negotiated at Torquay, England,
a list of which has just been tabled. Those
of us who have been interested in international trade for many years fully realize
that removal of further barriers and handicaps from our foreign trade means greater
prosperity to this country.
I should like to pay tribute to the Minister
of Trade and Commerce, and to Mr. Hector
McKinnon and his associates who carried on
so effectively the trade and tariff negotiations culminating in the Torquay agreements
announced in today's newspapers.
Mr.
McKinnon's associates who were on the
firing line in England carrying on direct
negotiations were: C. M. Isbister, Department of Trade and Commerce; W. J. Callaghan, Department of Finance; A. E. Richards,
Department of Agriculture; J. P. C. Gauthier,
A. L. Neal, B. G. Barrow, and H. V. Jarrett,
ail of the Department of Trade and Commerce; S. S. Reisman, Department of Finance;
and H. H. Wright, Department of External

Affairs. To these gentlemen I sincerely
believe the Canadian people owe a debt of
gratitude. In the limited time I have had
to look over the trade agreements made with
the United States, I have become convinced
that they will be of great benefit to this
country. Our thanks is due, therefore, to
these gentlemen who went to England, and
who after months of labouring under many
handicaps were able to negotiate agreements
which will mean more extensive trade and
greater prosperity to the Dominion of Canada.
I should not neglect to pay tribute to Mr.
Dana Wilgress, Canada's High Commissioner
in the United Kingdom, who was chairman
of the committee which functioned over
there.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. John T. Haig: Mr. Speaker, on a
point of order, may I point out that the
remarks of my honourable friend from
Southern New Brunswick (Hon. Mr. McLean)
are completely out of order. Before making
such a speech my friend should have moved
the adjournment of the house to discuss a
matter of urgent public policy. It would then
have been for Your Honour to say whether
it was such a matter. By speaking as he has,
he has placed the other members of the
house in a difficult position: there is no order
before the house on which any of us can
speak. The honourable senator from Southern
New Brunswick has been in this house long
enough to know the rules, but if he does
not know them he should ask someone who
does. I may agree entirely with what he has
said, but I repeat that it is most unfair to
proceed as he has done. I would have interrupted my friend immediately, but I felt
that such an interruption might be misunderstood. I say emphatically that in my judgment his remarks are out of order.

Bill X-9, an Act for the relief of Doris
Mary Thompson Lummis.
Bill Y-9, an Act for the relief of Estelle
Tetreau Latour.
Bill Z-9, an Act for the relief of Mona
Fern Barton Kirkman.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, it is moved by Senator Horner, seconded

by Senator Haig, that these bills be now read
a second time. Is it your pleasure to concur
in the motion?
Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators
have no doubt taken notice of what was said
yesterday in the other place about our parliamentary procedure on divorce bills.
The
time has come, I think, for us to consider
seriously the expediency of referring the
hearing of the evidence in divorce cases to
a referee.
In the Province of Quebec we object to
the recognition of the principle of divorce in
a law of general application. An individual
divorce bill coming before parliament is a
law of exception, and it confirms the view
that divorce is not, as a general rule, accepted, under the law of the land. That is the
reason why the creation of a divorce court
is unacceptable in the province whence I
come.

I fully sympathize with the honourable
senators who have to sit on divorce cases
and hear the evidence adduced. It is unreasonable to ask them to assume such a task.
But we must oppose the suggestion of establishing divorce courts in the Province of
Quebec, as a matter of principle, and furthermore, because experience teaches us that the
establishment of divorce courts in various
provinces has had the effect of tremendously

increasing the number of divorce cases. Other
factors may have contributed, but the facility with which one can approach a court of
justice and obtain a divorce is believed to
be a major cause of this increase.
For these two reasons, public opinion in
the Province of Quebec is opposed to the
establishment of divorce courts. That, however, should not necessarily result in the
intolerable situation which confronts honourable senators who have to sit on our Divorce
Committees day in and day out. I know that

they expedite the work as conscientiously
as is humanly possible, but we are aware that
our system is fraught with frauds. In a
number of cases evidence is manufactured.
A court of justice is in a better position and
has more time than a committee of parliament to fully investigate such matters.
On the question of procedure, nothing in
our constitution or in our rules would prevent the Senate from appointing one or more
referees-they could be retired judges or
lawyers of repute-who would sit during the
sessions or the recesses of parliament, receive
evidence, and make reports to the committee.
A similar procedure is followed in the
Exchequer Court and other courts of the land
-matters
are referred to a referee, who in
most cases is the registrar of the court. If
we adopted that method of receiving evidence
the parties involved would suffer no prejudice. If they were not satisfied with the
report of the referee, it would always be
subject to revision on appeal to the committee. There would be very few cases of
appeal. In most cases the referee's report
w.vould become the report of the comn-ittee,
on which a bill would be introduced. That
nethod might be the way out of our present
difficulty. I am convinced that it would work
as satisfactorily in a committee of the Senate
as it does in the Exchequer Court and, indeed,
in other courts of the land. I was prompted
to offer that suggestion when I read what
was said yesterday in another place when
objection xwas taken to passing bills of
divorce as a matter of course.
lonourable
members there as well as here have other
public duties to perform and cannot find time
to give proper attention to divorce bills.
I have implicit confidence in the members

of our Divorce Committee; but it is my duty
to

read

these

bills

and

the

supporting

evidence before making a decision.

A sena-

tor who would try to do that would have no
time left to properly consider public legislation and to attend the sittings of other
important committees of the Senate. I think
it is advisable that we should consider the
expediency of doing something to correct
the situation complained of.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I can understand that the
appointment of a referee would lighten the
work of the committee, but it would not
remove the objection made by a member in
the other house.
Hon. John T. Haig: I did not know that my

honourable friend intended to raise this
matter, but after having carefully read the
debate in the other place I had it in mind
to do so. Once every two or three years we
hear statements very similar to those which

MAY 9, 1951
were indulged in by certain members elsewhere. But debates on the subject have never
got us anywhere-the matter just dies away.
Like my honourable friend, I would not, even
though I had the power, attempt to pass a
law to establish a divorce court in Quebec
or any other province where the people do
not want it. I say that quite candidly. At
the same time I can see no purpose whatever
in certain gentlemen in the other placewhether they speak from conviction or
merely nonsensically I can never be surediscoursing on this subject as they idid yesterday. We who are or who have been
members of the Divorce Committee do not
like the job. We do it because we feel that
somebody has got to do it. I am glad that
such legal members as the honourable members for Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck),
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) and
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell), are here this
afternoon, because during this session they
have had some experience of what I have
gone through for about ten years.
My suggestion is that the acting leader of
the government in this house (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen), with one or two other senators he
may appoint, should meet and interview the
leaders in the other place-not the Prime
Minister only, but the leaders of ail partiesto obtain their assent to the appointment of
a committee of that house to meet a committee
of this house for the consideration of the
whole question of the procedure of granting
divorces, and whether it can be improved.
There is no use in us making speeches and
them making speeches: we shall end up
nowhere. I think that if we got together
we could probably reach an agreement as
to what procedure should be taken. I am
sorry that the honourable senator from
St. John's West (Hon. Mr. Pratt) is not in
the chamber, as during a trip the other day
we discussed this subject and both came to the
conclusion that it is an outrage to have ten
or twelve senators give a great part of their
time every session to about three hundred
cases, only to have someone in the other
place make such statements as, "Well, I
don't know whether we should put these bills
through or not. We have not had time to
read the evidence." If that expresses the
feelings of members of the other house, why
do they not offer to do the job? If they will
undertake to try to determine these cases,
I for one will accept their verdicts, and I
am sure that every member of the Divorce
Committees with whom I have sat in these
past years would do the same. If the House
of Commons were to appoint a committee to
hear the evidence and report on the cases

to us, I believe the members of this house
would endorse their findings with hardly
a word of objection.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Why not have a joint
committee?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I repeat, that in my opinion
we should ask the acting leader of the
government in this house, and two or three
other honourable senators whom I would
leave it to his judgment to select, to interview
the Prime Minister and the leaders in the
other house of the opposition, the C.C.F.
party and the Social Credit party, and request
them, either themselves or by their nominees,
to discuss this whole problem with a committee of this chamber, composed of, say,
four members, to see if a solution cannot be
found. That is what we ought to do. I
invite honourable senators to think over this
proposal and to communicate with me. If
the responses I receive indicate that a
majority favour the idea, I will put on the
order paper a motion to bring about consultations with the leaders in the other place.
After members of our committee have spent
weeks on these divorce hearings, sitting from
half-past ten in the morning until about one
o'clock, and sometimes ail afternoon, it is
unfair and unreasonable that someone in
the other place, who probably has not even
read any considerable portion of the evidence,
should stand up and object to some feature of
the proceedings which he does not like. I
believe that the impression in the public
mind, which more than anything else hurts
the prestige of the Senate, is that we are a
second-rate
divorce mill, grinding out
divorces. Of course, people who disapprove
in principle of divorce argue that we should
not do this work at all. Al right: if the
members in the other place do not want us
to do it, I am mighty sure that this house
will not object to being relieved of it.
If there is sufficient support for the program I have suggested, it could be put in
proper form and some action could be taken
on it before we prorogue, so that a new
system could be introduced next session.
There is no use postponing it until next year,
because we shall then be faced with a whole
new list of divorces. This is the time for
action, and I am prepared to act purely as an
individual member of this chamber.
My experience on the Divorce Committees
extends over many years. The work it performs is an unasked-for burden; and I say
candidly, and with ail respect to the nonlegal members of the committee, that while
they do a great service, the legal members do
an even greater one. A member of that
court has no time to attend properly to work

SENATE

on the other committees. This year the
government leader did something to improve
the situation by having the Divorce Committee begin its sittings in the early part
of the session. Ordinarily the deputy leader
of our party (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), a very able
lawyer, has been able to render me very
little assistance as such. When he does
assist me, he does it well; but he hardly ever
has time to do so. He is continually engaged
on divorce cases; when you see him, he is
either sitting in the Divorce Committee or
arranging about the proceedings and interviewing people who come to sec him about
the court business. This has gone on for
about ten years. I think it is unfair to him
and to us.
For all these reasons I again invite honourable senators to accept my program. If they
do, I will propose a suitable resolution. Let
us sec if we cannot make some progress im
persuading those in the other place to realize
that this work is part of their duty to
the people of this country.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. C. C. Prati: The honourable leader
of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), referred ta
a chat which we had a day or two ago, when
I brought up the subject he has been discussing. As a comparatively new member of this
chamber I have been astonished at the amount
of time and attention that honourable senators have to give to the personal affairs of
only four or five hundred citizens of Canada.
I have sat in on some committee meetings,
and have heard such remarks as, "We are
pushed for time on this". "We have not time
for that." "Our time is running out." I
think the attention of many of our members
has been too greatly taken up by the hearing
of divorce cases.
I realize the implications that are involved
in this matter, and I am aware of the reason
why legislation is enacted to give effect to applications for divorce; but I cannot understand why members of the Senate should have
to sit day after day, week after week, and
month after month, passing judgment on
these cases. Surely the suggestion made
today by my honourable friend from De
Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien) is based on sound
grounds. Under the authority of parliament
an outside body could be appointed to hear
the evidence and make recommendations,
and the divorce bills could then be either
passed or rejected by parliament, as is the
case at the present time. I know that this
procedure would not meet the objection
raised yesterday in the other place; but we
have to look at this question from our own
point of view and in the public interest.

I am a novice in parliamentary matters,
this being the first time that I have ever been
a member of a legislative body. When I was
summoned to the Senate I felt that within
the limits of my capabilities I could render a
real service ta my country, but if I were to
find myself bogged down over a period of
weeks in the hearing of divorce cases, I do not
see what service I would be doing for Canada.
I cannot find a weak spot in the suggestion
that has been made this afternoon, and if it
were carried through it would lift from the
shoulders of honourable senators the burden
of handling the detailed work involved in
handling divorce cases. I quite agree with
the last speaker (Hon. Mr. Haig) that in the
public eye the handling of divorce cases by
the Senate reflects unfavourably on the functions of this chamber more than anything else.
I would very much like to see some steps
taken to remove what I think is a fault in
the administration of this legislative assembly.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
I have served on the Divorce Committee for
some time now, and in the absence of the
honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine), who has been a member of the
committee for many years, I rise to voice
objection to the proposal to set up a referee
to hear divorce cases. As I look around the
chamber and sec the men who have served
on the Divorce Committee I am convinced
that, barring myself, nowhere in Canada
could men with more seasoned wisdom be
found to pass judgment on these cases.
I am never impressed by the debate which
takes place every now and then in the House
of Commons about parliament's handling of
divorce cases. The protest is always raised
by members who have their eyes on the
ballot box. That ýis all it amounts to, and
surely those who come here from the other
house are aware of this fact. Whenever
members of the House of Commons have
come over to listen to divorce hearings they
have gone away with the impression that the
Senate Divorce Committee is one of the finest
courts in the land. They have had no fault
ta find. This old debate crops up every now
and then when a number of divorce bills
come up at once to be put through; but as
long as the province of Quebec refuses to
handle its own divorce cases this parliament
will have ta continue to do the work.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: Before the honourable gentleman proceeds, I would point out
to the honourable senator from Winnipeg

MAY 9, 1951
(Hon. Mr. Haig) that what he has been discussing is a question of procedure. The question before the house is the motion of Honourable Senator Horner for the second reading of divorce bills.
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators,
to carry this motion?
The motion was agreed to, and the bills
were read the second time, on division.
The Hon. the Speaker: When shall these
bills be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Horner: With leave of the Senate,
next sitting.

Hon. Mr. Paterson: Honourable senators, if
we agree to take these matters into consideration at the next meeting of the committee,
could the report not be adopted now?
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
it is moved by Honourable Senator Paterson
that the committee's report be now concurred
in. In amendment it is moved by the Honourable Senator Reid, seconded by Honourable
Senator Lacasse, that the report be not now
concurred in, but that it be referred back to
the committee for further consideration.

happen to be a member of the Internal Economy Committee, I should like to make one

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. G. P. Campbell moved

the second

reading of Bill U-6, an Act to incorporate
the Champion Pipe Line Corporation Limited.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
provides for the incorporation of Champion
Pipe Line Corporation Limited, pursuant to
provisions of the general pipe-lines legislation. The powers contained in the bill are
similar to those embodied in previous bills
that have been passed here.
The sponsors of this bill, who are the first
directors named therein, are a group of
Canadians who along with their associates
have been carrying on investigations with
respect to the proposed construction of a
pipe-line to carry gas from the Alberta fields
to the Pacific coast. Preliminary studies
have been completed and the proposed route
is from Edmonton to Lethbridge, Kimberley,
Trail, Cascade, Princeton, Hope and Vancouver, and it is planned to serve these intermediary points.

Studies have also been carried on in respect
to a proposed pipe-line to carry gas from the
Alberta fields to Eastern Canada, to serve
the cities of Hamilton, Toronto and Montreal.
Final estimates of the cost of constructing
this eastern line, and studies relating to other
competitive lines now serving these communities, have not yet been completed. This proposed eastern line, which is now being
studied, would possibly meet with competition from some of the United States fields if
the program now under consideration is
carried through. That is to say, at present
the Union Gas Company is attempting to
obtain gas from the United States sources,
bring it across the border at Windsor and
store it in abandoned fields for distribution
throughout western Ontario. In fact, the
Union Gas Company already obtains considerable gas from United States sources
during the summer months and stores it in
abandoned fields for distribution during the
winter to southern and western sections of
Ontario. The Consumers' Gas Company of
Toronto also has attempted to get gas from
Buffalo for the purpose of serving the community in and about Toronto. Therefore, a
decision as to whether it is economically
sound to construct a line to Eastern Canada
from Alberta or any place in the western
provinces where gas may be available
depends largely upon economics and the
competitive features that are now being
considered.
The sponsors of this bill, as I have said,
are representative Canadians, and they have
associated with them a reputable and outstanding financial firm in the City of New
York, which has been responsible in a substantial way for the financing of some of the
United States pipe lines.
When this bill has received second reading,
I shall move that it be referred to a committee, where full information concerning the
proposed company will be made available.
Before anything can be done in the way of
construction of the pipe-line, the provisions
of the various Acts concerned will have to
be complied with. For the information of
honourable senators who may not be familiar
with the subject, I may say that after the
incorporation of the company the procedure
would be to apply to the Petroleum and
Natural Gas Conservation Board of Alberta
for permission to export gas. Honourable
members know that a number of pipe-line
companies have been formed, and that they
are seeking permission to export gas from
the Province of Alberta. My information is
that some applications are now pending
before that board. Therefore, the passage of

MAY 9, 1951
chis bill means nothing more than the incorporation of the company, which qualifies it to
make an application before the board. In
the event of permission to export gas being
received, an application would have to be
made to the Board of Transport Commissioners to determine the exact location of the
line or lines to be iconstructed.
As there is at present no suggestion that
gas be exported from Canada, compliance
with the Electricity and Fluid Exportation
Act would not be required in this case.
There is one other point to which I should
perhaps draw the attention of honourable
senators. In the last two or three bills of
this character ,considered in the other house
a clause was inserted to make it compulsory
that the lines be constructed within the
Dominion of Canada. As I have indicated,
the intention of this .company is to construct
its lines within the Dominion of Canada,
but if it is considered necessary to amend
the bill in committee to this extent, ho
objection will be raised.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Campbell moved that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications.
The motion was agreed to.
THE SENATE AND ITS WORK
MOTION-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, May 3,
the adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. Robertson for the appointment of a special
committee te inquire into and report upon
how in its opinion the Senate may make its
maximum contribution to the welfare of the
Canadian people.
Hon. L. M. Gouin: Honourable senators, I
have listened very carefully indeed to the
debate which has taken place in this house
on the motion introduced by our leader. I
wish to congratulate the honourable members
of the Senate for the attention and very
serious consideration which they have given
to the question now before us, and for the
real contributions which they have offered
to the problems of Senate reform which now
confront us. I wish in particular to congratulate those who have made constructive
suggestions in order that the Senate, in the
words of the resolution, "may make its maximum contribution te the welfare of the
Canadian people".
In rising to speak today, I wish first of all
te try to summarize the various points which
80713-27

have been discussed since the opening of this
lengthy but interesting debate, which began
on February 12 last. I think that practically
every member of this house has already
spoken but I offer this summary of the questions which have already been discussed,
with my comments in the hope that even at
this late date in the session we may be able
to reach a practical conclusion and take a
step in the right direction, even though this
accomplishment may seem rather modest. I
am anxious also to put on the record the
views of the various provincial governments.
This is not the first time, honourable senators, that reforms have been advocated for
our house. Thus, twenty-six years ago, on
March 9, 1925, there was passed by the House
of Commons, a resolution,
. . . to the effect that the Senate as at present constituted was not of the greatest advantage to
Canada, and that the question of amending the
British North America Act in respect to the powers
and constitution of the upper chamber should be
submitted to a conference.

I am quoting, honourable senators, from
page 10 of a précis of the discussions of the
Dominion-Provincial conference of Novem-

ber 3-10, 1927, King's Printer's Publication
No. 69, 1928. At the same page of the précis
which I have just mentioned, the late Mr.
Lapointe is declared te have cited
. . . the many and varied proposais which had
been made from time to time with respect to the
upper house. Among these proposais were, first,
abolition; second, the adoption of the elective
principle direct or indirect; third, a combination of
both the appointive and elective principles; fourth,
a fixed and limited term of office; fifth, an age limit
with possible superannuation; and sixth, a bringing
of relations between Canadian upper and lower
chambers into accord with the relations between
the House of Commons and the House of Lords in
Great Britain.

All these proposals, I believe, have been
commented upon or at least referred te during the present debate. As briefly as possible
I will offer my own comments on these various points, though often my remarks may
sound like the mere echo of those who have
spoken before me.
First of all, although the truth is selfevident, I will say a few words te show the
need for the existence of an upper house.
Of all forms of government which are possible
among mankind, I do not know of any which is
likely to be worse than the government of a single
omnipotent democratic chamber.

In commenting upon this statement of
the great historian W. E. H. Lecky in
Democracy and Liberty (1896, volume 1,
chapter IV), and though considering that Mr.
Lecky states the case too strongly, our own
Stephen Leacock, in his Elenents of Political

SENATE
Science, (Constable and Company, London,
1911, page 161), writes as follows:
The fact remains, however, that the unicameral
legislature bas been tried and found wanting. A
single legislative house, unchecked by the revising
power of another chamber associated with it, proves
itself rash and irresponsible; it is too much exposed
to the influence of the moment; it is swayed by
emotion, by passion, by the influence of oratory; it
is liable to a sudden access of extravagance or of
retrenchment.

With Leacock we may add that the members of an elected house "represent the
opinions of the community at a particular
moment and on particular issues. But the
lapse of time and the appearance of new
public questions may render" a single elected
legislative chamber "quite out of harmony
with public opinion long before its term has
expired."
In fact, at the present time the bicameral
system is prevalent in almost all important

countries. The division of parliament into
two chambers is very generally considered
to be the best means to secure in the work
of legislation a due amount of caution and
reflection. After so many others, may I
repeat here the classical remarks of Sir John
A. Macdonald, (Confederation Debates, 1865,
page 36), to the effect that our upper house
must be

Such is the origin of this house according
to this quotation to which attention has been
drawn several times in this debate, but which
I believe cannot be reiterated too often.
Our senator from Vancouver South (Hon.
Mr. Farris) will agree that Professor R. M.
Dawson cannot be taxed with any bias in
favour of the Senate: yet, in his Government
of Canada, page 353, Dawson admits that
Quebec-good old Quebec-still looks with
some "confidence to the Senate to protect its
position against encroachment or abuse."
I believe that is perfectly true. Dawson recognizes, (page 355), that the Senate "does furnish some additional security for Quebec."
Let us refer to an historian of quite a
different school, the great French Canadian
writer, Rev. Lionel Groulx. According to him,
equality of representation in the Senate for
Upper and Lower Canada was the express
condition of Cartier's acceptance of the principle of representation by population in the
lower house. In his book, "La Confédération
Canadienne", (1918, page 70), Canon Groulx
states-I translate:
Cartier accepted this last compromise with George
Brown only on the condition-is it not true?--of
recovering what had thus been given ("de se reprendre"), in the Senate and there to maintain for
both Canadas equal representation.

. .. a regulating body, calmly considering the legislation initiated by the popular branch and preventing any hasty and ill-considered legislation which
may come from that body.

So, honourable members, Quebec-and the
Maritimes also-entered the Canadian federation only upon being given the assurance

In other words, our Senate

house: 24 senators from Ontario, 24 from
Quebec, and 24 from the maritime group.
There would have been no confederation had
the Senate not been established on such a
basis of equality between the three regions
or sections.
Such is the uncontradicted
testimony of history. That "the attitude of
the provinces make the continuance of the
Senate a virtual necessity" is such a clear
fact that it is accepted as a certainty by one
of our most severe critics, Professor Dawson,
at page 355 of his book Government of
Canada.
There is no use labouring the point about
the necessity of the Senate, but admission of
this fact does not preclude the possibility of
the need for reform. For instance, should
the systern of appointing senators be
changed? Various proposals have been made
on this point, and what might be called the
oldest is, I think, the one that senators should
be elected. According to Reverend Lionel
Groulx, at page 69 of his La Confédératicfn
Canadienne, "the horror of the Fathers of
Confederation against democratic institutions"-and at that time democratic institutions were considered by many people as
being quite dangerous-"induced them to

. . . is intended to act as a revising and restraining
body te deal with possible errors or impulses of the
Commons.

Such, honourable gentlemen, is the general
justification for 'all second chambers. But
here in Canada a second chamber is necessary for several other reasons.
In the first place, the Senate was created
to protect the interests of the provinces. First,
the federal nature of our constitution, second,
the presence of the French Canadians, forming a third of our population, and third, the
attitude of the Maritime Provinces, made
absolutely necessary the creation of an upper
house with a system of representation based
not upon population but upon a provincial or
regional foundation. The well-known declara(Confederation
tion of George Brown,
Debates, page 88), removes any possible doubt
on this point. He said:
The very essence of our contact is that the union
shall be federal not legislative. Our Lower Canada
friends have agreed ta give us representation by
population in the lower house, on the express condition that they shall have equality in the upper
bouse.
On no other condition could we have
idvanced a step.

decide against an elective Senate," and lower,
at page 333 of his book entitled From a Colony
to a Nation, states that "most of the Fathers
were anti-democratic". Personally, I fail
to see why any well-informed democrat
should be opposed to an appointed Senate.
In fact, popular election must certainly be
ruled out if the Senate is not to be considered
as either a rival or a duplication of the
House of Commons. In the United States the
Senate has become more important than the
House of Representatives. If Canadian senators were elected by the people at large, our
Senate would either uselessly duplicate the
work of the other house or become the
predominant branch of parliament.
In 1867 it was decided to adopt the system
of having senators appointed for life by the
Governor in Council, as provi-ded in the
B.N.A. Act, sections 24 and 29.
At the Dominion-Provincial Conference of
November 3-10, 1927, to which I referred at
the beginning of my remarks, some proposals
were made for the reform of the Senate, but
no resolution was adopted to that effect. It
was decided implicitly to keep the Senate and
to leave it unchanged. I think it is quite
important that I should read to the house a
few extracts from the Precis of Discussions of
that conference. First I would read from
the beginning of page 10:
The Dominion-Provincial Conference devoted its
entire afternoon session today to an extensive and
highly diversified discussion of the subject of Senate
reform. While on the question of "abolishing" the
Senate the members of the conference were unanimous in opposition, and while there was practical
unanimity as against the principle of an elective
Senate, there was a considerable conflict of opinion
on many of the other suggestions of reform which
have been common currency in the dominion for
many years past, and which are continually cropping up in parliament and elsewhere.

Further down on page 10 it is set out:
It may be stated that the question of abolition had
not a single backer in the conference.

I come now to the fixed term of office,
which is outlined further on in the same
paragraph.
With respect to a fixed term of office, and an age
limit, there was a wide divergence of opinion, these
proposals not being generally regarded as vital
when the question of reforrm is being considered.

At the bottom of page 10 and the beginning
of page 11 of this precis we find the
following:
Throughout the discussion the right of the provinces to be consulted on such an important matter
as this was frequently emphasized. While there was
a strong body of opinion in favour of any reforms
which might strengthen the general machinery of
parliament, there was no attempt on the part of any
speaker to minimize the value of a second chamber.
80713-27j

Honourable senators, I should like now to
refer as briefly as possible to the Proceedings of the Dominion-Provincial Conference,
Second Session, which was held at Quebec
City, September 25-28, 1950. This is the
official title of a publication issued by the
King's Printer, but for the sake of brevity
I shall from now on refer to it simply as
the Proceedings. At that last conference the
question of Senate reform was not on the
agenda, and the object of the meeting was
to try and devise some purely Canadian
machinery for the amending of our constitution. But from the report which I now have
in my hands it is very clear that the general
opinion-I would say the almost unanimous
opinion-of the provincial authorities was
that some of the sections of the B.N.A. Act
concerning the Senate should not be amended
without the consent of parliament and of all
the provinces.
I am sorry to take up so much of your
time but I should like to refer to the categories which were adopted at that conference
for the various sections of the B.N.A. Act.
The categories, which will be found at
page 86 of the Proceedings, are as follows:
Category 1. Provisions which concern parliament
only;
Category 2. Provisions which concern the provincial legislatures only;
Category 3. Provisions which concern parliament
and one or more but not ail of the provincial legislatures;
Category 4. Provisions which concern parliament
and al the provincial legislatures;
Category 5. Provisions which concern fundamental
rights (as for instance, but without restriction,
education, language, solemnization of marriage.
administration of justice, provincial property in
lands, mines, and other natural resources) and the
amendment of the amending procedures;
Category 6. Provisions which should be repealed.

Now I will refer to parts in the brief of
the Government of Canada which concern
the Senate. At page 88 of the brief, under the
subtitle "Classification," we find:
Group
only.

1-Provisions

which concern parliament

References are then made to the following
sections of the British North America Act:
Section 17, which provides for the constitution of the Parliament of Canada; section 18,
which sets out the privileges of the houses
of parliament; and sections 21 to 36, which
are specifically devoted to the Senate. And
the federal brief says:
The majority of these sections deal with matters
of detail relating to the qualification of senators,
appointment, procedure, quorum, etc., and seem
clearly to belong to Group 1. The entire series of
sections concerning the Senate bas accordingly
been placed in that group. It may be that, if agreement can be reached on a general amending procedure, it will be deemed desirable to place sections
17, 21 and 22 in another group, possibly in Group 4.

400

SENATE

As honourable members will remember,
Group 4 contained the sections of the British
North America Act which concern parliament
and all the provincial legislatures.
We now know the official position that was
taken by the federal authorities, so let us
see what was the attitude of the different
provinces, and in particular of Quebec. As
stated at page 99 of the Quebec brief, the
Government of Quebec thought that at that
stage of the conference it should limit itself
to general considerations. In the very next
paragraph, under the heading "Powers of
the Federal Authorities", there are included
"the prerogatives, immunities, indemnities of
the senators and the deliberations of the
Senate", and also "the appointment of the
Speaker of the Senate." The Quebec brief
seems not to have made any other specific
reference to our body, but it must not be
taken for granted that the government of the
province would consent to any fundamental
modification of this upper house without the
previous approval of Quebec and of the other
provinces.
The traditional attitude of
Quebecers on this point is clear beyond any
doubt, and it exists irrespective of political
allegiance. In fact, this traditional attitude
is confirmed by the appendices of the report
of the Attorneys General, to which I shall
refer in a few minutes.
Let us now examine the views of the
provinces other than Quebec on the amendment of the sections of the British North
American Act which relate to the Senate.
Section 17 of that Act provides:
There shall be one parliament for Canada, consisting of the Queen, an Upper House styled the
Senate, and the House of Commons.

This section 17, which consecrates the
existence of the Senate, is classified by New
Brunswick, at page 108 of the Proceedings,
in category 5, namely, among the fundamental rights, the so-called entrenched provisions, those which are considered to have
the greatest importance, as forming the, so
to speak, cornerstone of our Canadian federation. Ontario at page 95 of the Proceedings,
Nova Scotia at page 101, and Alberta at page
126, put section 17 in Group 4, namely, among
the provisions to be amended with the consent of all the provinces.
I come now to section 21 of the British
North America Act. In the original Act of
18,67 that section fixed the number of senators
at 72; and, as we all know, in 1915 this
number was increased to 96; and in 1949, to
102. Ontario, at page 95 of the Proceedings,
Nova Scotia (page 101), British Columbia
(page 112), Prince Edward Island (page 117),
Alberta (page 126) and Newfoundland (page

129), submit that the number of senators
should not be changed without the consent
of all the provinces.
Section 22 deals with the representations
of the provinces in the Senate. It specifies
that each of the 24 senators representing
Quebec shall be appointed to one of the 24
electoral divisions of Lower Canada existing
in 1867. This peculiar system of fixed
divisions has always intrigued me; and while
preparing this address I found the explanation of it in the remarks of George Brown,
Confederation Debates, page 89, to the effect
that these old electoral divisions, with such
quaint names as De Salaberry and Grandville, for instance, were designed to protect
the separate interests of our English-speaking
minority and of our French-speaking majority
in Quebec. In that logical way the Fathers of
Confederation tried to secure a fair and adequate representation for the minority group,
which, by the way, seems to be quite happy
in the old Province of Quebec.
Concerning the question of representation
of provinces in the Senate, Ontario at page 95
of the Proceedings, Nova Scotia (page 105),
Prince Edward Island (page 117), Alberta
(page 126), and Newfoundland (page 129),
are opposed to any change in this respect
without the consent of all the provinces.
According to British Columbia (page 113),
the special system of senatorial divisions for
Quebec is a matter which concerns the provincial legislature only (Category 2).
I come now to the qualifications of senators, as provided for in section 23 of the
British North America Act. In sub-section 6
of that section we find provisions which are
applicable only to Quebec. The sub-section
reads as follows:
In the case of Quebec, he shall have his real
property qualification in the electoral division for
which he is appointed, or shall be resident in that
division.

Again, this system was adopted for the same
reason that the old electoral constituencies
were preserved; and it seems logical that the
consent of Quebec should be obtained before
there is to be a change. Nova Scotia, at
page 105 of the Proceedings, New Brunswick (page 108), and Newfoundland (page
128), state precisely that view. The view of
British Columbia (page 113), is that section
23 (6) concerns the provincial legislatures
only. For the remainder of section 23, Prince
Edward Island (page 117), and Alberta, (page
126), were of the opinion that the qualifications of senators should not be changed without the consent of parliament and of all the
provinces.

MAY 9, 1951
I come now to the remaining provisions
regarding the Senate, contained in sections 26 to 31 of the British North
America Act. Section 26 of the original act provided for the addition of
3 or 6 senators in certain cases of deadlock. In 1915 these figures were changed
from 3 or 6 to 4 or 8. Section 27 provides
for the subsequent reduction of senators to
the normal number once the crisis is over.
Section 28 eliminates any possibility of
swamping by fixing a maximum number of
senators. Under section 29 our tenure is for
life. Finally, the reasons for the disqualification of senators are set forth in section 31.
This section, by the way, was considered by
Prince Edward Island as requiring the consent of all provinces for its amendment. With
regard to sections 26 to 29, inclusive, of the
British North America Act, Alberta (Proceedings, page 126) and Newfoundland (page 128)
are of the opinion that these sections aJlso
require the consent of all provinces for their
amendment. Finally, Prince Edward Island
(page 117) considered that the life tenure
of senators should be modified only if all
the provinces approve such a change.
Hon. Mr. Duff: I am for that.
Hon. Mr. Gouin: In their briefs, Manitoba (page 108) and Saskatchewan (page
118) have, on the contrary taken the position
that the provisions of the British North
America Act which relate to the Senate concern parliament only.
I have referred to the brief of the Quebec
Government. I wish now to turn to the
report of the attorneys-general which appears
in Appendices I, II and III (Proceedings,
pages 79, 81 and 83). In those appendices
we find, first, that Quebec would consider as
concerning parliament only sections 23 (1-5),
30 and 34; second, that Quebec would classify sections 24, 29, 31 and 32 as requiring
the consent of al provincial legislatures for
their amendment. The consent of Quebec
should be obtained before amending section
23 (6), to which I have referred. Third, in
Appendix I to the report of the attorneysgeneral, Quebec puts in Categories 1 and 4-

Category 1 being sections concerning parliament only, and Category 4 being those
which concern parliament and the provincial legislatures-sections 33, 35 and 36.
It seems to me that whatever may be the
proper interpretation of Quebec's attitude,
it is clear that those sections at least in some
respect would concern al provinces.
Finally, in Appendix III, Quebec puts in
categories 5 -and 4 sections 22, 26, 27 and 28.
Category 5, as you know, is concerned with
the so-called entrenched provisions. It is
very clear that Quebec considers that these
provisions form part of the sections which
cannot be amended without the consent of
all the provinces.
The conclusion to which I want to come at
this point of my remarks-and in this I
believe I follow the opinion of our honourable colleague from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert)-is that we should not take steps
for any constitutional reform of this house
without previous consultation with the provinces. The Federal-Provincial Conference
has been adjourned; statements have been
made by all the parties concerned with
regard, in particular, to the Senate, and I
think it would be a great error to apply for
some amendment of the British North
America Act concerning the Senate while
this matter which I have just mentioned is
still before the conference. It is therefore
my intention to limit my suggestions for
reform to such changes as could be effected
without any modification of the British North
America Act.
I see by the clock that it is getting rather
late. If honourable members would prefer
it, I will adjourn the debate until tomorrow
af ternoon.
Some Hon. Senators: Adjourn.
Hon. Mr. Gouin: I move the adjournment
of the debate, and by leave of the Senate
will resume at our next session.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Gouin was agreed

TOURIST TRAFFIC
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. W. A. Buchanan presented and moved
concurrence in the second report of the
Standing Committee on Tourist Traffic.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant
as follows:
Your committee recommend that it be authorized
to print 600 copies in English and 200 copies in
French of its proceedings, and that Rule 100 be suspended in relation to the said printing.

The motion was agreed to.

morning a report of our discussions yester-

day, I find the following closing paragraph:
The divorce bills under discussion were given
second reading-approval in principle-on division
at the conclusion of the debate. The lone dissenter
was Senator William Duff.

Hon. Mr. Duff: Oh, dear!
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: I think it is necessary to correct that. The honourable senator
from Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duff) has a voice
loud enough to take the place of the voices
of many senators. When he is no longer here,
and I am, I will make myself heard.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Thank you very much.
Hon. Mr. Davis: Like the honourable senator from Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt)
and the honourable senator from Lunenburg
(Hon. Mr. Duff) I too will raise my voice "on
division" in connection with divorce bills.

THE SENATE AND ITS WORK
MOTION-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed fromn yesterday the
adjaurned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Robertson for the appaintment of a special
cammittee ta inquire into and repart upan
how in its opinion the Senate may make its
maximum contribution ta the welfare of the
Canadian people.
Hon. L. M. Gouin: Honourable senators,
yesterday I placed on record the views of the
provincial governments cancerning the Senate.
I shaîl try now, as briefly as possible, ta find
a practical answer ta some of the questions
wbicb have been raised during this debate
and previously about Senate reform.
The first point I shall discuss is whether
or not steps sbould be taken ta prevent a
conflict between the Senate andi the House
of Commons. In other words, is it necessary
in Canada ta f ollow the example of Great

Britain, and reduce the powers of the upper
chamber because of some conflict between
the two branches of parliament? I think that
ta put the question is also ta answer it. I
think aur mast severe critics wilJ. recognize
that the Senate has "neyer set itself in
oppositinn against the deliberate and understood wishes of the people." Those were the
very words used by Sir John A. Macdonald
in the Con federation Debates, at page 36,
when he was discussing the possibility of any
antagonism or apposition between the two
Fcllowing the example of aur
houses.
predecessors we have confined ourselves ta
aur functions as a revising and restraining
body. Occasionally in the past a measure
adopted by the House of Commons, and
rejected by the Senate, subsequently bas been
appraved by the people, and on being again
submitted ta this house it bas been passed.
The Senate always has considered and always
will consider itself in duty bound ta acquiesce
in the decisions of the people. We live in a
democracy; consequently we are agreeable ta
being governed by the will of the majarity.
Theref are, there is no need whatever of
curtailing the powers of the Senate. On the
contrary, I am inclined ta think that aur
sphere of activity cauld be extended with
great advantage ta the community at large.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Gouin: Sa in the field of revýising,
carrecting and impraving legisiative m-easures
submitted ta us we have, I thînk, completed
aur task patiently, 'consoientiously and effectively. Of course, most 0f aur work is done
in -corm.ittee raoms. lt is flot spectacular,
and generally speaking represenýtatives of the
press do net seem ta be especially interested
in aur work there.
I wish ta remark incideintally that we have
also conducted, particularly in recent years,
inquiries inta several -important matters, such
as, for instance, incarne ýtax, immigration and
humfan rights. We 'have also participated in
various joint coimittees of bath bouses fer
the study of, among other things, the chaice
of a national flag, human rights, aid age
security, and so an.
I suggest ta honourable senators, by the
way, 'that in the field of external ail airs aur
contribution would be *much greater indleed
if your Seniate cammittee were allowed ta
sit jointly with the icammittee of the ôther
house on variaus occasions, and in particular
when the Secretary of State for External
Affairs appears bef are that cammittee ta
present bis report. It is nat necessary for me
ta insist on the present importance of international affairs or the part which senators
bave played in that spbere in past years. The

SENATE

names of statesmen such as the late Senator
Dandurand and ex-Senator Meighen have
indeed a place of honour in the annals of our
external relations. The leader on this side
of the house (Hon. Mr. Robertson), the acting
leader (Hon. Mr. Hugessen), the leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), the senator from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert), the senator from
Rockeliffe (Hon. Mrs. Wilson), the senator
from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) and the
senator from Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon)
have at Lake Success and elsewhere accomplished with great distinction their missions
as represenitatives of Canada abroad. As we
know, in international affairs our Senate has
not been given the special jurisdiction which
the Senate of the United States has. Nevertheless, foreign affairs is a field in which
people at large, particularly our friends the
American senators, expect this house to take
a special inýterest and to perform a real
service for the protection of international

good will, and especially for the promotion
of friendly co-operation with our great neighbouring republic.
I may remark here that our debate on the
consideration of an exploratory convention
for an Atlantic union has enjoyed very
favourable publicity in the American and the
European press. The Canadian press gave
the subject much less space, but at all events,

our

colleague

from

Waterloo

(Hon.

Mr.

Euler) deserves our thanks and congratulations for having introduced his motion on that
question.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Gouin: As a matter of fact, thanks
to his initiative, some closer contacts have
been created between the members of this
house and some of our colleagues in the
American Senate, and also with other leaders
of public opinion in the United States and in

Europe who, like ourselves, are interested in
the federalist movement.

As you know, some of our critics always
complain that we in the Senate do not have

enough work to do; however, they pay very
little attention to the conditions under which
we carry on our activity. If more work does

not come to us at the beginning of the session,
it is not in any way our fault; and if many

bills reach us only in the last days of the
session, again we are not to blame.

I believe,

however, that the time has come when it is
necessary for us to assert more firmly our
right to be given reasonable time to consider
the bills that have passed the other house
and which are sent to us immediately before
prorogation. The people of Canada are

entitled, in particular, to our serious consideration of the estimates.

Last year under

the guidance of the chairman of the Standing

Committee on Finance, the senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) we performed, I
think, a very useful work. This year we are
again undertaking a study of the estimates.
A few years ago, in order that this house
might obtain more work earlier in the session,

we amended the rules of procedure in such
a way as to permit ministers of the Crown
to introduce legislation in

this house.

By

making such a change we proved very clearly
our sincerity in trying to improve our end

of the parliamentary machine.
Let us now briefly examine other questions
that have come up during this debate. There
is, for instance, the question of the appoint-

ment of the leader of the Senate. Our leader,
like his predecessors in office and all his
colleagues in the ministry, was chosen by the
Prime Minister. This well-established precedent, is in accordance with the British
practice, and I see no reason whatever why
it should be changed. Our leader's function
is to act as a connecting link between the
executive and this house.
Mention was made at one time of the
possibility of appointing a parliamentary
assistant to help our leader, for he, although
he performs his task excellently, is obliged
to answer at a moment's notice questions
concerning the various departments, and his
health may be *overtaxed. I may add that
we are all delighted to know that he is
making a good recovery from his recent illness. If there is any reason why ministers
in the other house should have parliamentary
assistants, I believe that there are many
more reasons why the leader of the government in this house, who is a minister without portfolio, should have one. He is
obliged, as I said a few minutes ago, to
answer questions and to be in a certain sense
acquainted with the affairs of every
department.
On this point, however, we must rely, so
to speak, on the action of the government,
for we cannot effect any change on our own
initiative which would involve an expenditure of public moneys-sometimes I think
it would not even be proper to make a
recommendation.
When the position and prestige of the
Senate in former times is compared with its
position and prestige today, I always think
the fact that there is now no minister with
a portfolio in this house has caused a
diminution of our influence. In the House
of Lords, for instance, the leader of the
government during the recent war, Lord
Cranbourne, was also Secretary for the
Dominions; furthermore, the Lord Chancellor
is always a member of the upper house. I
believe that this tradition, which was

MAY 10, 1951
established long ago, is -a wise one. Although
I do not expect to be able to obtain any
reversal of policy on the question of
appointing a minister with portfolio to the
Senate, I may still exercise my right to
express my views on the subject, and in
doing so I affirm my independence and that
of every member of this house.
I have just used the word "independence."
We all know that Sir John A. Macdonald
insisted that the Senate "be an independent
house, having free action of its own." Such
independence, honourable senators, is secured
for the Senate I believe-and for the
judiciary as well-by appointment for life.
Dawson, in his Government of Canada, at
page 357, states:
The most needed reform of all must be concerned
with removing the deadening effect of the life
term.

He not only suggests that our term be
shortened to eight or ten years, but that
retirement at the age of sixty-five or seventy
should be compulsory.
This question was discussed at the time
of confederation, and the answer was given
by-among others-George Brown, (Confederation Debates, page 89). He explained
that at first he was in favour of limiting the
senators' term of appointment. He said:
I thought it would be well te provide for a more
frequent change in the composition of the upper
house, and lessen the danger of the chamber being
largely composed of gentlemen whose advanced
years might forbid the punctual and vigilant discharge of their public duties. Still, the opposition
It was said,
made ta this was very strong.
"Suppose you appoint them for nine years, what
will be the effect? For the last three or four years
of their term they would be anticipating its expiring
and anxiously looking te the administration of the
day for re-appointment, and the consequence would
be that a third of the members would be under
the influence of the "Executive." The desire was to
render the upper house a thoroughly independent
body, one that would be in the best position te canvass dispassionately the measures of the other house,
and stand up for public interest in opposition to
hasty or partisan legislation.

So the Fathers of Confederation decided in
favour of a tenure for life, in order'to secure
the absolute independence of senators. They
did not set any age limit.
The suggestion has been made during this
debate that it might be wise to adopt a
system of pensions-upon a contributory
basis, I suppose. Reference was also made
to an age limit. My answer to those suggestions would be that in my opinion, the
attitude taken by the provinces would be
quite sufficient to cause those proposals for
reform to be, at least, left in suspense. It is
true that public opinion generally seems to
favour retirement, in almost any occupation,
at a certain age. Well, under some particular
circumstances-they could happen to me
80713-28

through ill health, later on-a senator might
like to have the opportunity of retiring with
some kind of a pension. But I wish to add
that nobody appreciates more than I do the
really exceptional services which have been
given in this house by grand old men, such
as, for instance, Senator Dandurand, who
worked until the very last day he was a
member of the Senate, and died when he was
more than eighty years old. It might be
possible to devise some plan under which
senators could retire in case of incapacity
or even, by reason of an age limit and by
which the exceptional qualities of certain
senators could be retained for the service of
our Canadian nation. I have in mind the
legislation which we adopted-twice I think
-in respect of a former Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court. In any event, the principle
of life tenure of senators is regarded by the
majority of the provinces as being one of
the essential conditions of confederation, and
I would go so far as to say that it would be
a stupid error for us to try to change that
situation when discussions are under way for
the framing of constitutional machinery for
amendments.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Gouin: The last point I want
to 'cover is that the broadly representative
character of our Senate is threatened with
imïpairment through the rapid diminution in
the number of opposition members. Of
course, under present circumstances I do
not advocate anything which would require
constitutional amendments; I believe that a
solution can be found without recourse to
such a proceeding. I have in mind the suggestions offered by several of the speakers
as to the stress which should be placed, on
what is sometimes called the character of
provincial representation which this louse
is said to possess.
The remarks on this subject were rather
diversified. I believe that the suggestion
that appointments should be made either by
the provincial authorities or in consultation
with them, was first made by the honourable
senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris). I shall return in a few moments to
his remarks.
The honourable senator from Grandville
(Hon. Mr. Bouffard) suggested something
more or less along the same lines, and added,
if I remember correctly, that in his opinion
a certain number of senators appointed by
the provinces, or at their request, should
have a limited term. As to this, I wish to
remark that if a certain group of senators
were appointed for a limited term, they

SENATE
would tend to consider thenselves as temporary emissaries or agents of their particular provinces, and would lose the independence which we, as appointees for life,
enjoy. I believe that the remarks made by
George Brown in the Confederation Debates,
page 89, which I quoted a few minutes ago,
are well founded, and I share absolutely his
opinion. I think it would be an error if,
say, one-quarter of the senators were
appointed for a limited term. It would
result in a Senate composed in part of members pretending to be more entitled than
others to speak on behalf of their respective
provinces.
Under the present system we are all entrusted equally with the task of protecting the
interests of the provinces as well as vested
rights in general; but we also enjoy, as I said
a few moments ago, the same independence
as the judiciary. In fact the appointments to
the Senate, as remarked by our very eloquent
colleague from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen), give some representation to religious
and racial groups in the various provinces.
The appointments also give representation to
women, and personally I regret that there are
not more lady senators. The various professions are also represented in this chamber,
and I believe it is in the interests of the
country at large to maintain and even increase
the broadly representative character of the
Senate. I also believe that it is important to
preserve the absolute independence and perfeet equality of all members of this house.
In my opinion our most urgent need is to
find some means to secure adequate representation for the opposition. I should like to
read from the remarks made by the honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson) when he
introduced his motion on February 12. I read
from Hansard at page 56:
One of our problems at the moment is that,
because of unusual conditions, the number of members of one party--appointees of a Liberal government-has exceeded in the last two or three years
any party majority which has existed since confederation. That disbalance is likely to beceme even
greater in the next few years. That problem, I
think, is one to which we should address ourselves
if we desire the Senate to maintain the appearance
of being what the Fathers of Confederation desired
it to be, an independent house.
Until about 1945 the maximum number of senators
appointed by any one government, representing
either of the two major political parties, was
sixty-three.

The recent passing of our honourable colleague from Lauzon (Hon. Mr. Paquet) has
reduced the opposition ranks to ten in numbers. It seems to me unbelievable that one
day we may face the tragic situation of there
being even fewer than ten members representing the opposition party in this house.
As honourable senators are aware, there are

102 seats in the Senate: the Liberals now
hold 79, the Progressive Conservatives 10, and
13 seats are vacant. This situation is absolutely abnormal. I believe that we are faced
with an acute crisis, and here I would again
quote the words of our leader:
I will go so far as to say that it is not a condition
which commends itself to the great body of the
Canadian people.

The senator from Vancouver South (Hon.
Mr. Farris) in his very masterly address of
February 19, referred to this situation. At
page 122 of Hansard be said:
My next suggestion, honourable senators, is that
more parties should be represented in this house.
We need wider representation.

A little further on he said:
I do not believe it is either beneficial or fair to
have too one-sided a chamber.

The honourable gentleman from Vancouver
South even foresaw the day when the entire
membership of this bouse might consist of
Liberals. He urged greater independence in
the Senate, claiming that different viewpoints
are needed. Like my honourable friend, I
believe that the clash of ideas is of the very
essence of vitality in any organization.
I
also believe that public opinion is not to be
ignored. Statements practically to the same
effect have been made in this debate by the
honourable senators from Peterborough (Hon.
Mrs. Fallis) and Gloucester (Hon. Mr. Veniot).
There are one-party chambers in several
countries in Europe at the present time, but
we do not want that kind of thing to happen
here. Our democratic system is based fundamentally upon the existence of at least two
parties. The leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) enjoys the confidence and esteem
of everyone in this house. Personally I consider him as a very dear friend, and I think
as a matter of fair play to him and his colleagues, we must endeavour to find some
means by which their ranks can be increased.
I think it would be possible to combine the
suggestions made and to give to this house a,
so to speak, more definite character of provincial representation. After all, the Senate
was created especially to protect provincial
or regional interests and minority rights.
It was suggested, I think by the senator
from Gloucester (Hon. Mr. Veniot), that the
Prime Minister could very well obtain nominations for some appointments to this chamber by consulting with the opposition leader
or leaders. Another senator suggested that
when the representation of any province in
this house was incomplete, the premier, and,
I would add, the opposition leader in that
province, as the case might be, should be
asked te recommend a panel of names from
which the Prime Minister could choose an

MAY 10, 1951
appointee, though of course not being necessarily restricted to this panel for his choice.
In any method of reform whi-ch we may
recommend, I hope there will be sufficient
elasticity. If a system of consultation with
provincial premiers or opposition leaders
worked well in practice it might be
followed until in time it became a binding
custom. Eventually it might even be written
into the constitution, though I believe that,
generally speaking, it is always wise to proceed very cautiously before introducing any
change of a permanent character into the
British North America Act.
The suggestion which has been made by
other members and which I am now making
would, I think, produce the best results if it
brought here representatives of not only the
official opposition, the Progressive Conservative Party, but also of other opposing
political groups. There is no doubt that I am
an opponent of the CCF, but I am sorry that
there is not even one voice to interpret to
the Senate the program of that political organization, which of course has a perfect right
to exist even if we do not share its beliefs.
I am not an adherent of Social Credit, but
I think it would be fair and reasonable to
have here at least one person to speak for
that group, which is especially interested in
monetary reform. In my own province I have
taken part in every campaign against the
Union Nationale, but I contend that anyone
who wishes to advocate the policies of that
organization in Quebec has a right to do so.
On the international scene there are two
worlds, the western and the eastern, and just
now it seems as if we have in Canada either
two nations-a federal and a provincial-or
a federal nation and ten different provincial
nations. I do not want -any water-tight compartment between our federal government
and the various provinces.
I think there is everything to be gained by
having here people who would likely advocate
policies to which we take strong objection.
In their discussions with us they would
receive fair play, and we would learn to
understand their point of view better. I am
convinced that many a person who entered
the peaceful and quiet atmosphere of this
chamber like a lion, as the saying goes, would,
while retaining his convictions, become in
time much more moderate. I am quite sincere
in expressing the view that this Senate is
indeed a great school for tolerance. Here we
have inter-racial friendship, and mutual
respect by persons of different religious views,
and, generally speaking, we try to give to our
fellow Canadians a good example of patriotism, wise and moderate, without any bitterness or fanaticism whatever.
80713-281

When speaking in this debate the senaltor
from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris)-I
have, as he knows, a very deep esteem for
him as a lawyer, and as a member of this
house-referred to the various political
parties in the provinces, and said quite
frankly that he would be happy to see them
represented here. I quote a few words from
my honourable friend's speech as reported
at page 122 of Hansard.
One of my Senate friends said, "Do you want to
bring one of those fellows here?" I said, "Yes, I
do. I want to have a look at him."

I think that is quite a proper attitude.
I believe that at this stage of the session
no advantage would result from a reference
of the presenit motion to a committee. I do
feel, however, that we should try to take at
least one practical step in the right direction.
As I see it, the most urgent need is to secure
for the opposition a certain minimum number
of seats, whatever it may be decided that
minimum should be. Personally, I am convinced that at least one opposition member
should be appointed to the Senate to represent
each of the ten provinces. The proper proportion of representation between different territorial sections in Canada would require a
larger number from certain provinces than
from others.
This debate has lasted for several months,
and unless a new element is to be introduced,
it seems to me that our discussions will be
only academic and we will achieve no definite
results. Under these .circumstances I intend,
by way of conclusion, to move an amendment
to the motion, as follows:
That this house recommends in the public interest
that a minimum number of seats in the Senate be
given to the opposition, that each territorial group
receive a fair proportion of such seats and that the
government be se informed.

Sorne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
I have before me the amendment of the
honourable senator from De Salaberry, but
there is no seconder for it.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I will second the motion.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, the original motion reads as follows:
That a Special Committee of the Senate be
appointed te inquire into, and report upon, whatever action in its opinion may be necessary or
expedient to enable the Senate to make its maximum contribution te the welfare of the Canadian
people.

As I understand that motion, it seeks to have
a special committee of the Senate appointed
to inquire into certain matters.
The amendment moved by the senator from
De Salaberry reads:
That this house recornmends in the public interest
that a minimum number of seats in the Senate be

408

SENATE

given to the opposition, that each territorial group
receive a fair proportion of such seats and that the
government be so informed.

The Hon. the Speaker: I am not ruling it
out of order; I am taking it under advisement.

It seems to me that amendment contains
one conclusion that a special committee
might very well come to. I do not quite
understand whether the original motion is
simply to be amended or entirely set aside.
For those reasons, I should like to take the
matter under advisement.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: May I suggest, honourable senators, that in order to enable His
Honour to reach a conclusion some honourable senator should adjourn the debate at
this time, and at the opening of the next
sitting His Honour may give his ruling as to
whether or not the amendment is in order.

Hon. Mr. Haig: In that way the honourable
senator will have time to draft an amendment
that will do what he wants it to do, and if
necessary it can be substituted for the one
now before the house.

Hon. Mr. Haig: May I be allowed to say
that the honourable senator gave me a copy
of this amendment two or three days ago,
and I did not wish to comment on it at that
time?
I do not think the amendment is
proper, but I believe it could be put into
proper form. If the debate were adjourned
until the next sitting of the house, it would
give the honourable member from De Salaberry time to consult with the Clerk of the
Senate in order to determine what amendment would be proper. I do not think any
honourable senator would object to that
procedure. Whether we will agree with the
amendment as presented is, of course, another
matter. I suggest, therefore, that the amendment be not now ruled out of order.

Hon. Mr. Paterson: Mr. Speaker, would
not the amendment first have to be referred
to the committee?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No. It does not have to go
to a committee.
The honourable senator
need only prepare a new amendment asking
that certain words in the original motion be
struck out and the proposed language substituted therefor. That would be a perfectly
good amendment. Perhaps he does not wish
to go that far.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: May I suggest that the

SENATE
INDIAN ACT

PROPOSAL FOR SPECIAL COMMITTEE
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Thomas Reid: Before the orders of
the day are called, I should like to make a
suggestion to the honourable leader (Hon.
Mr. Robertson); but before doing so, I should
like to say to him how pleased we are to see
him back in the Senate in good health.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: My suggestion is that when
the bill to amend the Indian Act comes
before the Senate, consideration should be
given to the setting up of a special committee
to deal with that legislation. If this is not
done, I would urge then that the honourable
senators who were members of the Joint
Committee on Indian Affairs, which functioned some years ago, should have the
privilege of sitting on whatever committee
may be designated to deal with the Indian
Act.
Hon. Wisharl McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, when the legislation referred to by
my honourable friend comes to this house I
shall be very happy to do anything I can ýto
facilitate a thorough examination.
I wish to thank the honourable senator and
other honourable members for the very kind
reception I have had this evening. The
enforced idleness which is incidental to an
absence such as mine affords to the absent
member the opportunity of meditating upon
his sins of omission and commission as
opposed to the virtues of those with whom he
ordinarily associates. Such meditations present quite a marked contrast to the thoughts
which sometimes flow through one's mind in
more hectic circumstances. I appear before
you tonight, therefore, the personification of
humility, and all about me I see the radiance
of the greatest virtues. If in due course,
under the pressure of conditions as they
arise, that balance should proceed to change,
honourable members will understand the
reason. I thank you very much.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Norman P. Lambert moved the second

reading of Bill A-10, an Act representing
Industrial Loan and Finance Corporation.
He said: Honourable senators, in explaining this very simple bill I need only say that
it proposes, in section 1, that the name of the
corporation known as Industrial Loan and
Finance Corporation be changed to Community Finance Corporation. The company
has been doing a short-term loan business
for a number of years, and the main reason

for the proposed change is that its name has
conflicted to a certain degree with that of
another finance company, the Industrial
Acceptance Corporation, which does a different kind of business altogether, and it is
desired to remove any confusion that may be
caused by a similarity of names.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The name also conflicts
with that of the Industrial Mortgage and
Trust Company, of Sarnia.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: The main reason given
to me for the proposed change was the
conflict with the name of the Industrial
Acceptance Corporation, which does a much
larger volume of business than the Industrial
Loan and Finance Corporation, and of a
kind that I think is known to nearly every one
here. It does the same class of business as the
Traders Finance Corporation, for instance,
whereas the company applying for this
change of name does a short-term loan business. The change would involve no relief
from liability or change of privileges in any
way.
The bill has been referred to the Superintendent of Insurance, who has found no fault
with it. If the motion for second reading is
adopted, I shall be glad to move its reference
to the Committee on Miscellaneous Private
Bills.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Lambert moved that the bill be

referred to the Standing Committee on Mis,cellaneous Private Bills.
The motion was agreed to.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. W. M. Aselline moved second reading
of Bill C-10, an Act to incorporate the
Ukrainian Catholic Episcopal Corporation of
Saskatchewan.
He said: Honourable senators, I believe that
copies of this bill have been distributed, and
are now in the desks of every honourable
senator.
As the title of the bill indicates, its purpose
is to incorporate the Ukrainian Catholic
Episcopal Corporation of Saskatchewan. The
petitioner, His Exellency Bishop Andrew
Roborecki, has recently been constituted
Ukrainian Bishop of Saskatchewan by His
Holiness the Pope. The fact that this took
place during the Easter recess of the Senate
explains why the bill is only now being proceeded with in this house.
Honourable senators will recall that three
private bills respecting other dioceses of the

MAY 15, 1951
Ukrainian Catholic Episcopal Corporation
were introduced earlier in the session. This
bill is in the same form as the previous bills,
which have been passed by the Senate.
By the measure now before us, the
petitioner requests the powers necessary to
administer the property, business and other
temporal affairs of the corporation. These
powers are the same as those customarily
granted by parliament on the incorporation
of a body of this character.
If the bill receives second reading tonight,
I shall move that it be referred to the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills
for further consideration.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the Speaker: When shall this bill
be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: Honourable senators, I move that this bill be now referred to
the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous
Private Bills for consideration.
The motion was agreed to.
QUEBEC SAVINGS BANKS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Paul H. Bouffard moved second reading of Bill D-10, an Act to amend the Quebec
Savings Banks Act.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Explain the bill.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I am quite ready to
explain the proposed measure, although I
explained the Act in some detail when it was
amended in 1948.
The Quebec Savings Banks Act covers
only two institutions in Canada, namely, a
bank in Montreal and another in Quebec
City. These banks, which are investment
houses and not commercial banks, are quite
useful in that they encourage small savings.
They accept deposits from twenty-five cents
up, and encourage savings in the schools. The
banks make no commercial loans, and even
their personal loans do not exceed $1,000.
They are limited in their reinvestment of
funds to securities such as bonds of the
dominion, the provinces,
municipalities,
schools and parishes; further, they are not
permitted to loan money on the securities in
which they invest.
These banks cannot loan on any bonds or
securities of a company unless, first, the
debenture is covered by a first mortgage;
second, the paid-up capital stock of the
company is at least $500,000; and third-and
this is the clause which by this bill it is

proposed to amend-the amount of dividends
which has been paid during the five previous
years is at least 4 per cent, where there is
par value capital stock, and at least $4 per
share where the capital stock is of no par
value. The British Insurance Companies Act
was amended in this respect in 1950, to cover
the very many cases where capital stock
having a par value is changed into capital
stock having no par value. Very often companies which for many years have paid on
their capital stock having a par value a
dividend equal to, say, 8 per cent, divide
the stock into four shares for one, and on
the new shares of no par value pay a dividend
of $2 per share, representing a dividend of
8 per cent on the aggregate subscribed capital.
This state of things was changed by
the amendment of the British Insurance
Companies Act.
The relevant amendment now before the
house is as follows:
(c) The corporation has paid a dividend, in each
year of a period of five years ended less than one
year before the date of investment, upon its common shares of at least four per centum of the
average value at which the shares were carried in
the capital stock account of the corporation during
the year in which the dividend was paid.

This is identical with the amendment to the
British Insurance Companies Act, and I think
it is desirable that it be applied to investment
banks.
The other section which it is proposed to
amend is similar to the one to which I have
just referred. The first section as amended
permits the bank to invest money in bonds
of a corporation which has paid 4 per cent
on the aggregate value of its capital stock.
The second amendment is to the same effect,
except that it is applicable to the bonds of
a corporation on which a bank is authorized
to lend money. It will be noticed that section
1 incorporates that part of the Quebec Savings
Banks Act whereby the bank can invest
money, and the second part relates to bonds
on which a bank can loan money.
The last amendment is of subsection 1 of
section 39 of the Act as amended in 1948.
At that time parliament authorized the two
banks to invest money in first mortgages up
to 5 per cent of the amount of their deposits.
In Montreal the amount of loans carried by
the Montreal City and District Savings Bank
was very small, aggregating only $60,000, but
in Quebec this type of service was extremely
welcome. As a matter of fact, the bank there
was authorized to loan $1,100,000, and in two
years it had loaned $1,080,000, while many
more applications for loans are outstanding.
Ninety per cent of these loans were made on
residential properties. This is why authorization is asked to loan up to 10 per cent of
deposits in first mortgage loans.

SENATE
I can give information of the financial
standing of the banks to indicate that no
risk of financial loss will be involved in the
passing of the amendments. As a matter of
fact the bank is liquid to the extent of 111
per cent of its deposits, including the 5 per
cent loans it made on first mortgages. The
amount of Canadian government bonds it
carries exceeds 50 per cent of all its deposits.
Small loans varying from $25 to $1,000
account for only about 10 or 15 per cent of
all loans made to the public. The service it
rendiers in this connection is highly appreciated in Quebec, where it carries on
business. As a matter of fact it cannot operate
outside the city of Quebec and the immediate
neighbourhood. It has fourteen branches, of
which twelve are situate in Quebec City and
two in the city of Levis.
The contents of the bill have been approved by the Department of Finance,
including those officials who carry on bank
inspections.
I believe this measure will
render a great service to people in Quebec
who want to borrow on first mortgages.
One other reason for this bill is that if the
banks cannot assist their depositors and
clients with loans of this kind, these people
will seek such assistance elsewhere, because
other organizations in the province which
carry on banking operations are permitted
to loan on properties to a practically
unlimited
extent.
Insurance
companies,
although more restricted, do the same kind
of business on an extensive scale. The banks
want to be able to help customers and
depositors to the extent of 10 per cent of
all deposits.

Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I am very proud of it,
too!

Hon. Mr. Vien: Do I understand the
honourable senator to say that there are only
two banks in Quebec?

THE SENATE AND ITS WORK
The Senate resumed from Thursday, May
10, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Robertson for the appointment of a
special committee to inquire into and report
upon how in its opinion the Senate may make
its maximum contribution to the welfare of
the Canadian people.
Hon. G. Lacasse: Honourable senators,
before I came into this chamber this evening
I was in some doubt as to whether I was to
address myself to a motion or to an amendment; but on the ruling of the Chair I shall
speak to the main motion. I had intended to
read the motion in order to "re-situate the
debate," if I may use that expression; because
I believe that in the course of the discussion
we more or less got away from the subject
matter of the motion. However, I do not
think it is necessary ,to read the motion, as
we have it before us. I do believe, however,
that the course taken by the discussion justified, in a large measure, the amendment proposed by the honourable gentleman from De

MAY 15, 1951
Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Gouin). I think we were
all responsible to some extent for misleading
him. However the original question before
the house was whether this chamber should
appoint a committee to study the work of the
Senate, but I do not think that has been the
real point of the argument right along. We
acted just as though we were the committee
itself.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: We were like a Committee of the Whole.
Hon. Mr. Lacasse: I do not intend to speak
at any length tonight, and I do not think I
could if I wanted to. The great handicap
faced by a man who enters a debate at this
late stage is that he takes an awful chance of
repeating what has already been said. I should
not like to bore the house by doing that. My
only purpose in rising is to emphasize two or
three points which already have been brought
up in the discussion. The whole issue has
been pretty well exhausted. All the angles
of the problem have been carefully and intelligently studied; but, as I say, there are one
or two ipoints upon which I think more
emphasis should be placed at this time.
The first is the so-called partisanship or
non-partisanship of this house. The Senate
is supposed to be a non-partisan body. But
has it functioned as such ever since confederation? I think we are "kidding" ourselves when we say it is non-partisan in the
full meaning of the word. The less partisan
it is the more dignity and more authority it
will have as it goes along. I am afraid that
we are too prone to look at things as they
should be rather than as they actually are.
I do not want to be personal in anything
I say, and far be it from me to say anything
that would hurt the feelings of any senator,
but the honourable gentleman from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) gave a section of the
public to understand that this house was
half-filled with decrepit people. He advanced
that as one of the reasons for introducing a
retirement age for senators.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Half filled with what?
Hon. Mr. Lacasse: Perhaps I have not
interpreted the thoughts of the honourable
senator from Inkerman as he expressed them.
I thought he said that a retirement age for
senators should be introduced, and that one
of the reasons for this idea was the infirmity
and advanced age of some senators. Without
being personal at all, may I be permitted to
say that every day honourable senators see
a man limping into this house; but nobody
would dare say that this man does not possess
an alertness of mind, a clarity of expression
and a soundness of judgment which has
seldom, if ever, been surpassed in this house.

I do not wish to press my point any further.
In making this statement my intention is to
pay a compliment-and only a complimentto the honourable senator from Inkerman.
Some Hon. Sena±ors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lacasse: While appreciating the
value and ability of our leader (Hon. Mr.
Robertson), whom we are all glad to see back
among us, I think in his absence his place
was splendidly filled by our colleague from
Inkerman.
Another point I wish to emphasize is the
independence that this house should have, and
which it actually does possess. Some may
misinterpret this independence of action and
argue that it is based on a certain feeling of
autocracy-which is out of date nowadaysand look at this house as more or less of an
anachronism. Some even go so far as to
say that the Senate has outlived its usefulness
and should be abolished. I just wish to
re-emphasize the importance of the independence of a chamber such as this. In
saying this I believe I am fully in line with
the thoughts of the Fathers of Confederation
-the men responsible for establishing the
Senate. The most stable institutions in Canada
and elsewhere are based on independent
appointments, and I would particularly refer
to churches and judges. We all know that
most of the judges in the country to the south
of us are elected. I am one who believes that
the dignity, efficiency and impartiality of our
Canadian court is above reproach because
of the very fact that our judges are appointed.
I do not desire to throw slurs on what is done
in other countries; but that is my feeling as
a man who believes in democracy and in
justice at one and the same time.
Honourable senators, I do not hesitate to
say that at the beginning of this debate I was
inclined to favour the appointment of a
special committee to inquire into the work
of the Senate, but as the discussion went on
I realized, as I intimated a moment ago,
that nothing more could be accomplished in
committee, because the issue had already
been exhausted. This debate has produced
better results than could have come from any
study in committee. I do not want to make
a pun, but to me it was not surprising that the
best solution of the problem came from
a doctor, and flanked by a druggist at that!
I think our colleague from Gloucester (Hon.
Mr. Veniot) has rendered an immense service
to this house and to this country-not in the
form of a motion or a proposed Act of parliament, but in the form of a humble suggestion
to the powers that be. In my opinion the
government is expecting from us nothing
more than a suggestion on this matter, and I

SENATE
feel that the senator from Gloucester has
"delivered the goods." I sincerely support his
view. I understand that the leader of the
government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) will close
the debate tonight, and it is out of respect
to him that I am not speaking at length. It
is my belief that the government will seek
to solve this problem in a way or in ways
that have been suggested in the debate, and
I humbly express the wish that those in
authority pay particular attention to the
splendid address-an address whose precision
and brevity perhaps helped: to make it
splendid-which was delivered by my honourable friend and my medical confrére from
Gloucester. I thoroughly endorse his stand,
and I support it without any reservation at
all. I think that there we have the most
sensible solution that was offered during the
whole of the debate to which we have been
listening for weeks and months.
Hon. Gordon B. Isnor: Honourable senators,
in view of the statement made by the last
speaker, that the honourable leader would
close the debate this eveningHon. Mr. Robertson: May I say, for the
information of the house, that my honourable
friend from Essex (Hon. Mr. Lacasse) was
not correctly informed. While of course I
am not in any way desirous of denying an
opportunity to anyone who might still wish
to discuss this resolution, I should appreciate
it if those who intend to speak would
endeavour to do so this week, in order that
I may be in a position to close the debate
early next week. However, even then I
would, if necessary, accommodate any honourable senator. It would help if anyone who
wishes to speak would notify the Government Whip (Hon. Mr. Beaubien).
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Unless someone else
wishes to speak at this time, I would move
adjournment of the debate.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Honourable senators, I
wished to make a few remarks. Perhaps I
could go on now.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Yes, go on.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Honourable members, I
was interested in the -comment of the last
speaker (Hon. Mr. Lacasse) to the effect that
in this debate up to the present we have not
stuck very closely to the motion, but that we
have had some very informative and instructive addresses on reform of the Senate. I
would, however, like to deal briefly with the
motion itself, and then perhaps touch on one
or two matters arising out of what I feel
might be brought about if the motion did go
to a committee.
So as to refresh the minds of honourable
members, I am going to read the motion on

which in due course we shall have to vote.
The honourable leader of the Senate (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) proposes:
That a special committee on the Senate be
appointed to inquire into, and report upon, whatever
action in its opinion may be necessary or expedient
to enable the Senate to make its maximum contribution to the welfare of the Canadian people.

It seems to me that the leader had something very definite and constructive in mind
when he proposed that motion. Whether we
accept it or not, there is in it meat for con-

sideration. If we paraphrase it or break it
down, we find that it can be put under some
seven headings. In the first place, the motion
asks for the appointment of a committee.
Well, that is not unusual at all. The other
house and this house have often appointed
special committees to deal with subjects of
one kind or another.
The second proposal is that the committee,
if appointed, inquire into certain things. Well,
I think we are all willing at any time to
inquire into matters of importance to the
country, or to parts of it, and therefore I
think that this proposal is a reasonable one
to make to a body like this.
The third proposal is that the committee,
after having made an inquiry, report its
findings to this house. That is a customary
and most reasonable thing to do.
The next heading, as I have it in my notes,
is "whatever action"-that is, what the cornmittee may do. The committee might include
in its report a recommendation to the government that certain changes be made in the
Senate, and give reasons therefor. Or it
might express satisfaction that the Senate
as now constituted is doing what it was
intended to do under the scheme of confederation. In any event, if the committee's
report were adopted by this house, the leader
here (Hon. Mr. Robertson) would no doubt
carry our wishes to the government and ask
that they be considered. I may say that
there are one or two suggestions which I
might wish to make, not for reforming the
Senate but for expediting its business.
The fifth heading or subdivision of this
motion is that the committee report upon
whatever action "in its opinion may be necessary". Surely there is no member of this
house who does not feel that some action
should be recommended by a committee.
It seems to me that the debate itself has so
far contained many good suggestions for
making the Senate more effective.
The sixth proposal in the motion is -contained in the words "or expedient"-that is,
that the committee report upon "whatever

MAY 15, 1951
action in its opinion may be necessary or
expedient". This subdivision is of course
linked up with the previous one.
The final proposal is that all these things
be done-that is, that a special committee be
appointed, that it make an inquiry, that it
report to this house, and ,so on, "to enable the
Senate to make its maximum contribution to
the welfare of the Canadian people." After
all, the Senate was set up by the Fathers
of Confederation, to look after the interests
of the people, to take care of minorities and
safeguard the smaller provinces. We are all
familiar with the composition of the Senate
in the early days. In 1867 it was divided into
three territorial groups of twenty-four members each-the Maritimes, Quebec and
Ontario-making a total of seventy-two menbers. As the country expanded westward the
number of senators was increased to ninetysix; and finally, with the entry of Newfoundland, the membership was brought up to the
present total of 102. Surely we in this house
can recommend some changes that will bring
about greater efficiency.
Honourable senators are all familiar with
the picture entitled Fathers of Confederation,
that hangs in the Railway Committee Room
of the House of Commons. The original painting, by Robert Harris, was commenced in 1883
and finished the following year, when it was
presented to the Minister of Public Works. It
was of course destroyed by fire in 1916, and
the replica that hangs in the committee room
today is a charcoal etching which Mr. Harris,
who was then of an advanced age, happened
to have on hand.
I looked into the background of that picture
because we hear so much about what wonderful men the Fathers of Confederation were.
They must have been able men to have given
us the British North America Act, a constitution which down through the years has had
few amendments. But it occurs to me that
these were ordinary men, such as those I see
around me in this chamber. One notes that
some of those in the painting wear beards,
and one is apt to take it for granted that they
were elderly men. The information which I
have gathered about their background indicates that of the 34 men, only two were over
the age of 60 years, while 11 were between
50 and 60, and 21 were from 30 to 40 years
old. It would seem therefore, honourable
senators, that they were just an ordinary
group of menHon. Mr. Grant: Without razors.
Hon. Mr. Isnor:-such as I see around me
this evening, anxious to do their best for
Canada.
As these men looked out of the windows
at Quebec, I am sure they visualized a

wonderful country-a country such as we
have today; but one could scarcely expect
them to produce a perfect constitution for
these modern times. For instance, I do not
think they visualized the radio, which gives
us news from the world over in a matter
of seconds; nor did they foresee travel by
air from Halifax to Vancouver in a matter
of hours. Although they did not visualize
such modern trends. nevertheless they made
a good job of our constitution. But the fact
that the Fathers of Confederation may have
missed some points suggests to me one reason that might have been in the mind
of the honourable leader of the government
when he moved his resolution calling for the
appointment of a committee to recommend in
what way this house can better serve the
people of Canada.
I was rather surprised to hear some of
the suggestions made during the current
debate, for they seemed to be more properly
work for the committee. However, I am
sure that further suggestions will be forthcoming when the matter is considered in
committee, and that a full report will be
presented to the government.
Even though my remarks may not add
much to this debate, honourable senators, I
was anxious to participate in it for the
reason that I was perhaps one of those who
spoke out of turn on this subject when I
made some statements outside this chamber
a few months ago. Had I been more experienced I would have waited until I came here
and mellowed a little. But I was not content
to wait for that mellowing process to set in.
Perhaps the thought crossed my mind that if
I waited until after I came and sat with the
wise men from aIll parts of the country I might
consider my thoughts too immature, and that
because of my lack of experience I would
hesitate to express myself.
While I make no apologies for the remarks
I made outside this chamber, I want to
explain how I came to make them.
I
expressed myself long before the honourable
leader presented his resolution, and of course
I would not be so presumptuous as to think
that I prompted him to act as he did. Whether
I was right or wrong in my sentiments, my
words received wide publicity, some favourable and some less favourable.
I nay
say that after my speech the atmosphere in
this section of the country changed somewhat. I come from Nova Scotia where it is
pleasant, but on arrival here I found it
rather chilly. It occurred to me that I
should perhaps go back to my native province and enjoy the January weather which,
though cool, was nothing compared with the
reception I received in certain quarters in

SENATE
Ottawa. I make that observation in the
most friendly manner, having first said that
I showed immaturity of judgment in some
of the remarks I made.
Hon. Mr. Vien: But you are still a Maritimer, I hope.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I am today. I shall die a
good Canadian, but I am still a Nova Scotian.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Is there no hope?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I hold in my hand, honourable senators, a luncheon notice issued by the
Progressive Service Club in the City of Halifax, which bears my name as the guest speaker, and the subject to be discussed. Because
there has been some misunderstanding, I
will read the title of the subject as it appears
on this card: "The function of the Senate
in Canadian Government". I chose that subject after having been invited by the club
to speak on either "Senate Reform" or "The
function of the Senate in Canadian Government". It occurred to me that the second
subject had been fairly well covered by other
speakers and was a matter of record. But
like many senators who have taken part in
this debate, I got away from my subject,
and upon being asked questions I rather
extended myself and entered the field of
Senate reform. I had to fall back on what
had been said by some of the members of this
house, and I naturally took it for granted
that statements made by such experienced
gentlemen as the leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig), who was recently quoted in the
Financial Post, could be relied upon. I also
relied on statements made by the honourable
senator from Kitchener.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Waterloo!
Hon. Mr. Isnor: He and I seemed to agree,
but I made my statement at a service club
luncheon, and it received a lot of publicity; his
remarks got only four or five inches in the
Financial Post, and we have not heard anything further here. If I recall correctly, he
supported the idea that the Senate should
be elective.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I have done it in this house
before.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Have you? Now we have
confirmation. So I felt I was on fairly safe
ground. Not only did I suggest this at the
time, but I indicated how it could be carried
out without too much disruption so far as
the workings of the Senate are concerned. I
am ready to make what is called, I believe,
an "open confession" of doubt as to whether
- was right in advocating an elective Senate.
That is a frank admission, and I hope that
hereafter a somewhat chilly atmosphere may

thaw at least a little, and that I shall enjoy
an occasional friendly greeting in quarters
which formerly I was a little afraid to
approach.
"I have at all times tried to teach myself
that to get a true appraisement of a question
it is necessary to be in a position to honestly
criticize not only another's opinion but one's
own. In this way, I believe, one arrives at
a more sound understanding and decision.
That is what I am endeavouring to do in this
case." I was careful to put that statement in
writing-it is the only part of my speech
which I am reading-and I set it down
because it expresses exactly my frame of
mind with regard to this question.
. I do not want to mention this evening any
particular senators-all their speeches were
good-except to say that the remarks made
by the honourable senator from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) impressed me, and the
manner in which he presented his arguments,
his reasonable approach, and his summing up,
convinced me that this question is one which
His
should receive further consideration.
suggestion that "we old fellows", like myself,
should be retired at seventy-five, seems to
me a reasonable recommendation, and one
which appeals to the man on the street. I
say that with all kind thoughts towards those
of my colleagues who have reached that age.
Some of our outstanding men are able ýat the
age of seventy-five or beyond to think in a
broader way and to express themselves in a
much more intelligent manner than I can,
and because of the part they have played in
our public life, they are a credit to this body
and to Canada. Nevertheless, I agree with
the views on this matter of the honourable
senator from Inkerman. I feel that his suggestion is sound, and that it has met with a
very favourable reception from the ordinary
citizen, the person with no particular axe to
grind, who is sincerely interested in the
welfare of our country.
I was impressed with the suggestion of our
lady senator from Peterborough (Hon. Mrs.
Fallis) that our membership should include
more women. I do not know how such a
change can be brought about, and I have no
proposal to make in this connection, except
that in connection with future appointments
regard should be had to the valuable sources
of information which would be available to
this house if it included a few more women
senators. I believe they would add greatly
to the value of our debates. From my brief
experience as a member of this body, and
the manner in which the two lady members
have participated in our affairs, I am sure

MAY 15, 1951
they have demonstrated that women can take
a worthy part in all the work carried on in
this place.
So, honourable senators, I believe we should
not discount the recommendations made by
the various speakers; and the best way to
take them into consideration is to have them
compiled and placed before the committee
which, I hope, will be set up. It bas been
intimated elsewhere that the honourable
government leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson) will
withdraw this motion. I do not know whether
there is any truth in the rumour, and I do
not intend to make any statement unless
I have some ground for it; but I hope the
motion will not be withdrawn, because, if it
were, the average thinking Canadian would
be moved to ask why it had ever been
introduced. Is it not a good resolution? Is
there not something to it? Is it not sound?
Should not a committee be set up, in connection with this or any other matter, to bring
about something that may be beneficial to
our country? So it is my intention, if the
motion should go to a vote, to support it.
Without making any specific recommendations in respect to reform along lines which
have already been covered-namely, retirement, period of tenure, age, and source of
recommendations of appointments-I feel that
we should consider a change which would
affect the work of the Senate as now carried
on. Being somewhat new to the chamber,
I hesitate to offer suggestions, but in the other
place I found it very helpful, when an
important bill was before us, to have it dealt
with in Committee of the Whole. Looking
around the membership of this body, I notice
about thirty-five senators who sat with me
for a period of years in the other house. I
believe all of them will agree with me that
much good results from a discussion right
on the floor of the bouse, in Committee of the
Whole, of any important piece of legislation.
Following a suggestion made by one member,
someone else submits another, and the discussion goes on until there is formulated
something definite and constructive which
may change the entire principle of the proposed legislation. That has happened on
more than one occasion. I feel that this
suggestion deserves very serious thought by
a committee.
I do not know whether the leader of the
government would welcome another idea in
this connection which has occurred to me. I
feel that our leader, in sponsoring a bill, is
under some handicap in replying to questions.
We do ask questions, even though we may not
always be in order, and all sponsors are
very willing to give information. But I

believe that the leader, as a minister of the
government, should have a parliamentary
assistant, and also should be enabled to bring
to this chamber a deputy minister or any other
departmental official whom be requires to
give him expert advice about any particular
section or question which may arise during
the discussion of legislation.
These two suggestions are directed not to
a reform of the Senate but rather to the
common-sense handling of legislative matters
or procedures which come directly within
our jurisdiction.
On another matter my views may be
immature and, perhaps, subject to change.
But having reflected on the work of the
Divorce Committee, and the time taken, even
during the past ten days, on divorce bills
here and in the other place; and having
regard to the careful consideration given by
members of the committee to the petitions, and
their painstaking attempts to get all the evidence and present it to us with their recommendations, I believe they could very well
act as the final court in connection with
divorce. It might be said that this suggestion
would require an amendment to the British
North America Act. I notice the honourable
senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen)
nodding his head in agreement. Well, even
at that, consideration of it might be well
worth while. If that could not be done, then
some understanding should- be rea-chedj with
the House of Commons, whereby all divorce
bills would be individually passed and given
final reading here, and then simply receive
approval in block in the other place. Those
are the three suggestions which I think
should be given consideration by this special
committee.
I agree with those members who have
taken the stand that the Senate is not a place
in which legislation should be introduced to
any great extent. I think it should be introduced in the other place and then sent to this
chamber. I am in accord with that thought
because I believe it carries out the ideas of
the Fathers of Confeder.ation. The same idea
has been expressed by many of our bestthinking senators.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Would the honourable
gentleman permit a question at this time?
Does he not agree that the committee proposed by the motion before us would hardly
have time to properly consider this question
during the current session, and that at the
opening of the next session it would be in
a better position to thoroughly investigate
the matter and report upon it.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: In reply to my honourable
friend from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien), I

SENATE
may say that during my forty years in business life I have always made it a point to.
clean up my desk during the day if possible.
If I am unable to do that, then I start the
following day with what has been left over.
It is my opinion that we should go as far
as possible to clean up this situation now. If
we are unable to conclude our work at this
session, then we could complete it next year.
I hope that answers my honourable friend's
question.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Perhaps I should not
repeat what has been better s.aid by others,
but I would like to stress the idea that the
Senate Divorce Committee act as a final
court. In my research I came across a statement made by a former senator and Prime
Minister of Canada, the Right Honourable
Arthur Meighen. Dealing with the principal
function of the Senate, he said it was-to see that those great principles upon which the
dominion has reposed, are carefully reflected in its
statutes, to design legislation so as to meet the
realities of business, to review and temper proposals of the other house, so as not unnecessarily to
discourage enterprise or restrict the area of employment; to oppose the ravages of partisanship from
whatever source they come, and at least to give
public opinion time and opportunity to be deliberate
and to be understood; to be governed not so much

by emotional appeal or fleeting spasms of popular
fancy but to listen to the accountant, the operator,
the employer, the employee, and the unemployed,
and to make sure that legislation when finally
passed will work with fairness and facility.-For
this function the Senate was created, and this
function it must with thoroughness and fearlessness
perform.

Honourable senators, I think those remarks
cover the situation more thoroughly and concisely than any other statement I have read,
and I subscribe to it wholeheartedly.
I should just like to say one thing more
about the Progressive Service Club. Last
January this club was looking around for
what it considered to be a live topic, and it
chose "Reform of the Senate." I believe that
not only members of the service clubs, but
citizens in general throughout this dominion
of ours, will be keenly disappointed if this
house does not appoint a committee to inquire
into the work of the Senate and bring in a
finding of some kind.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Honourable senators,
I move the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

THIRD READINGS
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable sena-

tors, when shall these bills be read the third

Hon. Mr. Aselline: Honourable senators, in
view of the delay that bas arisen in another
place in connection with divorce bills, I
think it is advisable that these bills should

moment. Therefore, with leave of the Senate,
I move that these bills be read a third time
now.

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. Mr. Aseltine moved the second read-

ing of Bill B-10, an Act to incorporate the
Baptist Union of Western Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a bill
to incorporate the Baptist Union of Western
Canada.
Hon. Mr. Euler: You are quite a churchman.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: At the present time the
Baýptist Union of Western Canada is incorporated in each of the provinces of Manitoba,
Saskatchewan and Alberta, and has an extraprovincial company licence to carry on its
activities in the province of British Columbia.
I think it unnecessary to supply the dates of
each of the incorporating statutes in the
provinces I have mentioned, although the
information is available if required.
The purpose of the bill is to incorporate the
Union federally under the Dominion Companies Act. I have gone over the details of
the bill very carefully with the Law Clerk of
the Senate, and we have made certain changes
and amendments to comply with suggestions
made in the other place with respect to bills
of a similar nature. The bill as is now
printed is as nearly as we can tell in line with
other bills passed by this chamber incorporating religious institutions.
If this measure receives second reading, I
intend to ask that it be referred to the appropriate committee for further consideration.
The motion was agreed ta, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the Speaker: When shall this bill
be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Honourable senators,
I move that this bill be referred to the
Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private
Bills for consideration.
The motion was agreed to.

THE SENATE AND ITS WORK
MOTION-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Robertson for the appointment of a special
committee to inquire into and report upon
how in its opinion the Senate may make its
maximum contribution to the welfare of the
Canadian people.
Hon. S. S. McKeen: Honourable senators,
before adding my few remarks to this debate,
may I be allowed to congratulate one of the
members of this chamber, the senator from
Mille Isles (Hon. Mr. Daigle), on having
reached another milestone in his young life?
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: In delaying my remarks
in this debate as I have, I was hopeful that
the thoughts I had in mind would be
expressed by some other senator, and that I
would not be obliged to speak; however, one
or two aspects of this question have not yet
been dealt with. In view of the fact that the
participants in the debate have brought forth
suggestions which could perhaps more properly have come from the proposed committee, as was pointed out yesterday by the
senator from Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon Mr.
Isnor), perhaps I may be allowed to outline
the changes that to my mind ought to be
made.
There is considerable criticism of the
number of appointees coming to this house
from the other chamber. As I understand
the constitution of the Senate, its function
is to initiate and to pass upon legislation
coming to it from the other house. Parliament, under the British North America
Act, consists of the Queen-now the Kingrepresented by the Governor General, the
Senate and the House of Commons, and no
proposed legislation can become law unless
passed by all three. If the Senate is, as is
sometimes stated, a chamber of sober second
thought, who should constitute the membership of this house? Should it be comprised
of eminent scientists, great artists and professional men, who have had no contact
True,
whatever with legislative matters?
such men have keen mental faculties and
great ability, but they lack legislative experience, I do not think their training fits them
to fulfil the function of senators. If my
reasoning is correct, then where are we to
find the men best suited to perform the work
of this chamber?
In my opinion senators should be drawn
from the ranks of municipal councils, provincial governments and the House of Commons. I do not mean to say that scientists

MAY 16, 1951
or professional men would not make good
senators, for we have in this chamber some
of the most able professional men in this
country, but I would point out that these men
are here, not because of their professional
standing but because of their capacity for
and interest in political life, as well as their
close association with the consideration of
legislation.
In British Columbia, the province from
which I come, there are men who, in my
opinion, are well qualified to take part in
the discussions in this chamber, and the
senators from that province have been
appointed because of their high qualifications.
Our senior senator from that province, the
honourable member from Kootenay East (Hon.
Mr. King), began his political career a good
many years ago. As far back as 1903 he
represented Cranbrook in the provincial
legislature, and after many years in that
house he was appointed provincial Minister of
Public Works. Later he came to Ottawa,
where he held the portfolio of Public Works,
and later became Minister in charge of the
Department of Health and Soldiers Re-establishment. His record in political life is a
long and honourable one. Next in order of
seniority is our honourable colleague from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.. Farris), who
served in the provincial house as Attorney
General and Minister of Labour, and later was
appointed to the Senate. Another of British
Columbia's representatives is the honourable
senator from Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon), a
former member of the Alberta Legislature
who subsequently sait for two terms in the
House of Commons for a British Columbia
riding. Our junior member, the honourable
senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid), served for two years as councillor of his
local municipality, seven years as reeve, and
in 1930, when the fortunes of Liberalism were
at a low ebb, was elected to the other place
and sat there continuously until he took his
seat in this chamber. So all have records in
the political life of their own province.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask the honourable
gentleman a question? I presume he has had
no political experience at all?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: I was four years in the
provincial house. I did not mention it.
An Hon. Senator: Too modest!
Hon. Mr. McKeen: It was an oversight.
Going eastward, we have the honourable
senator from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan),
who has served his country well .in many
capacities and is, I believe, well equipped to
give opinions on the legislation which comes
before this chamber. Also, representing the
provinces which most of you term "the West,"

but which we in British Columbia look upon
as the East, namely Saskatchewan and
Alberta, we have men of the standing of the
honourable senators from Saltcoats (Hon.
Mr. Calder), Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) and
Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine).
Hon. Mr. Euler: You overlooked the honourable senator from Edmonton (Hon. Mr.
MacKinnon).
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Well, he is one of the
newer appointees, although his term in the
lower house, both as private member and as
a member of the Cabinet, was longer than
that of some of the others I have mentioned.
I think that criticisms of the appointment of
members of the House of Commons to the
Senate are made without sufficient consideration of their background. In my opinion the
Senate, besides being a chamber of sober
second thought, represents a delayed action
of the vote of the people. If the people of
this country have so much confidence in the
Liberal government, or any other government, that they elect to the House of Commons, time after time, those who support the
Liberal party, they are in fact training more
material for this chamber, and also providing
more opportunities of appointment; therefore by their votes they in effect send here a
larger representation of that particular party.
In looking over the records of the house I
find that in 1896, at the time of the Seventh
Parliament, just before the turn of the
century, this house contained only ten
Liberals to sixty-three Conservatives. It is
my opinion that if Canada could survive the
disaster of so small a membership of Liberals
blow which, incidentally, the Liberal
-a
party has survived-probably it can get along
when the reverse is true, and there are only
ten Conservatives in this house. I believe,
however, that those ten are the equal of any
Conservatives in this country. I will go
further; I will say they are the equal of any
people in this country, for though not very
numerous, their quality, as reflected in the
character of their service, is very high.
This is not supposed to be a partisan body,
and in most cases we do not follow partisan
lines. The Senate has at times turned down
legislation brought from the other house, but
I could find no record of the Senate, even
when the majority here was against the
government, turning down legislation introduced as the result of a plank in the election
platform of the party in power. On the
contrary, the records show that this chamber
passed government bills even when a large
majority of senators were opposition members. Further, I could find no record of any
government having placed the matter before

SENATE
the people for their decision when one of
its bills had been turned down by the Senate.
In other words, such governments agreed that
what the Senate had done was probably right.
There were several outstanding cases of
this kind. I would refer particularly to the
Naval Bill which was brought down as a
major part of government policy in 1913. As
honourable senators will recall, the idea
behind the Naval Bill was that Canada
should contribute money to the expansion of
the British navy rather than build a navy of
her own. When the Senate blocked the
passage of the bill, the government did not
appeal to the people, but merely carried on;
and I think that everyone, including the
government of that day, was glad that the
Senate took the action it did.
Honourable senators, this chamber may be
likened to a safety valve on a boiler or an
emergency brake on a car. You do not
remove the safety valve from a boiler or the
brake from a machine simply because it has
not been used for four or five years. As a
matter of fact, you are probably just as glad
that they were never needed.
I have heard many criticisms about the
Senate being used as a rubber stamp for the
purpose of rushing important legislation
through in a matter of a day or two. In reply
to that criticism I would point out that the
minute any bill is placed before the House
of Commons for consideration, a copy of that
bill is made available to honourable senators.
So, from that time on, members of this bouse
have an opportunity to study that piece of
legislation. If we find anything wrong with
it, then it is our privilege and duty to make
sure that we are prepared to state our views
on it as soon as it comes before this house.
It is not a case of senators being kept in the
dark as to what is going on in the other place.
When you are driving a car you do not always
need to use your emergency brake. As a matter of fact, if your car is travelling between
fifty and sixty miles an hour you might get
into serious difficulties if you were to suddenly apply the emergency brake. On the
other hand, if the brake is required, you are
grateful for having it in your car. As long
as we see that the legislation coming to this
chamber is sound and wise, there is no reason
why we should try to stop its progress.
By the very nature of the set-up of the
Senate, the members here are older than
the members of the House of Commons. No
senator can be appointed until he is thirty

years of age, whereas the age limit in the
House of Commons is twenty-one years. We
all know that youth is more aggressive and
possibly a little more wild in action. It has
been said that -perhaps too much of the zeal
of youth is wasted on the young; but I
believe that there is a place for youthful
energetic action.
I think that when the
experience of the members of this chamiber is
joined with the youthful aggressiveness and
initiative found in the other chamber, it
results in the best form of government.
If the people of Canada feel that the party
representation in the Senate is so unbalanced
that a change should be made in the present
policy of appointing senators, they have the
remedy in their own hands. I think the
Fathers of Confederation thoroughly considered the idea of an elected Senate. They
had an elective assembly before this
appointive Senate. In 1935 there was only
one Conservative in the Legislative Council
in Quebec.
When Mr. Duplessis came to
power there was a large opposition majority
in that body, but he did not complain about
that, because he is a strong advocate of an
appointed Legislative Council. He never once
suggested that the council shbuld be abolished
or be made an elective body. If we think the
Senate should be an elective chamber, it is
not for us who were appointed to the Senate
to say that this change should be made. That
is a matter for the people to decide.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: If there are any senators who sincerely feel that the opposition
members in this house are too few and thal
the opposition should enjoy greater representation here, they should go to the Prime
Minister and say "I do not think there are
enough Conservatives in the Senate, so I
will resign my seat to let them come in".
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: I do not think it is good
enough to say that nobody else should come
to the Senate after me except from the other
house. There are thirteen vacancies in the
Senate today, but are we going to recommend
that these seats be filled by Conservatives?
I do not see why Liberals should be considered
less favourably than Conservatives in the
matter of appointment to the Senate. There
are certainly more Liberals in the country,
and the average here should run that way.
Honourable senators, I just wanted to add
these few thoughts to this debate and to
suggest that the main worry about reform of
the Senate is not in the country but right
in this body itself.

OFFICIAL REPORT

Category 4. Provisions which concern parliament
and all the provincial legislatures;

At page 399 of our Hansard of May 9 I
quoted exactly in those terms that Category 4,
but afterwards I am reported as having referred to the provisions contained in Group 4, or
Category 4, as requiring for their amendment
the consent of all provinces. The provisions
contained in Category 4, as they concern all
the provinces, should not in my opinion be
amended at the present time without the
consent of all provinces. They will continue,
I think, to require such unanimous consent
until an agreement has been reached as to
how large a majority of the provinces is
required for the adoption of any constitutional
amendment. But I wish to state very clearly
that in September last the provinces merely
decided to put in Category 4 the .provisions
which concern iparliament and all the provinces. I do not want my interpretation of
the attitude of the provinces to give rise to
any confusion concerning the proper description of such Category 4.

JUVENILE DELINQUENTS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. W. A. Buchanan moved second reading
of Bill D-11, an Act to amend the Juvenile
Delinquents Act, 1929.

SENATE

He said: Honourable senators, this bill is to
amend the Juvenile Delinquents Act, which
was first passed in 1929. Its purpose is to
make separate provisions for juvenile delinquents. The creation of juvenile courts and
other special provisions relating to the care
of juvenile delinquents is left fairly well to
the provinces, and one of the purposes of the
statute is to empower the provinces to adopt
special measures for the care and treatment
of juvenile delinquents.
The amendment proposed by the bill before
us deals with one small point, namely, the
definition of a "child". Under the present Act
a "child" means a boy or girl under the age
of sixteen. However, the Governor in Council,
by proclamation, may provide that in any
province the age limit for a child shall be
eighteen instead of sixteen. Such proclamations have been issued for several of the
provinces, but one of these provinces now
wishes to have the age lowered again from
eighteen to sixteen, and it has been found
that the Act does not give power to issue
proclamations lowering the age limit. The
purpose of this amendment, therefore, is to
provide that the Governor in Council may,
within the range of sixteen to eighteen, raise
or lower the age limit in any province.
The province requesting this change is
Alberta. All other provinces have been circularized, and none have objected to the
amendment; most have concurred in it. It
has been made clear to the provinces, of
course, that the Governor in Council would
only issue proclamations raising or lowering
the age limit upon the request of the province
concerned.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Buchanan: If it is felt necessary
that this bill should be referred to committee
I am prepared to so move, but just what
committee it should go to I do not know. As a
matter of fact, I doubt whether any additional
enlightenment could be given on the bill in
committee.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: Honourable senators,
I think this bill should be referred to a committee for further study. It involves an
important principle, and to my mind we
should be given a little more information.
There is now before the Privy Council
awaiting decision a case dealing with the
delegation of power from one government to
another, as from the federal government to
a provincial government, or from a provincial
government to the federal. Further, it seems
to me that this bill is in effect an amendment
to the Criminal Code, and I feel that it should
not be passed without further consideration.
I am not seeking to raise any obstacle to
passage of the bill at all; I am simply pointing
out that I think there is involved a question
which requires additional study.
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: Honourable senators,
I am quite agreeable that the bill should go
to a committee if that is desired, and I
would move that it be referred to the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned

Why is the Hamilton harbour board getting
these rights, or why is the city of Hamilton
so anxious that the Hamilton harbour board
should go into the amusement business? I

answered the other day, after the committee
meeting, when one of the city fathers of
Hamilton said to me "Well, you know Senator
Reid, it is very difficult for the city council
to do anything along these lines, because its
members are always liable to criticism. They
are liable to be defeated at the polls if they
do something the people do not like". That
was a frank admission, and I think it bit the
nail on the head. Once this bill is passed
the Hamilton Harbour Commissioners, who
are appointed, and not subject to the will of
the people, will be able to do what they like
in the matter of setting up amusements. I
rise in protest against the principle of allowing a board of Harbour Board Commissioners
to deviate from their duties as such and
enter the amusement field. This is not
the responsibility of any harbour board in
Canada.
As I said at the outset, I know that my
protest will be overruled by the majority;
nevertheless I have no apology to offer for
rising this evening and voicing my protest
against the granting of these rights.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, I hesitate to rise and to take from
my friend from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) the luxury of protesting alone. There
will be at least two votes against this bill,
so that be will not need to call upon the
courage required to stand unsupported in this
matter.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I too realize that the
bill, having been given second reading and
having been passed by a committee of the
Senate, will in all probability be passed at
this sitting of the bouse. Nevertheless, I
think it is my duty, as my friend thought it
his, to protest against legislation of this kind.
It bas been said in defence of this bill that
similar powers are being exercised by the
Harbour Commissioners of the City of
Toronto. I have spent some little time in
reading the Toronto Harbour Commissioners
Act and all the amendments that have been
made to it from the time it was passed, in
1911, to the present, and I challenge anybody
to find in that legislation any reference
whatever to powers granted to the commissioners to run amusement stands and
bathing beaches, or to conduct activities of
that nature. The Act, on the other hand,
does give the Toronto harbour board the right

to lease its land; and the board, having been
given that right, is, I suppose, granting concessions to private individuals for the conduct
of amusement activities; but it is not itself
taking part in the very precarious, doubtful
and rather dangerous occupation of providing
amusement.
I should like to call the attention of the
house to Chapter 24 of the Statutes of 1939,
which contains the amendments to the
Toronto Harbour Commissioners Act that
were assented to on the 2nd of May of that
year. They gave the commissioners power
to construct and operate certain airportsand here is what section 2 of the Act says:
The Toronto Harbour Commissioners shall have
power, for and at the expense of the Corporation of
the City cf Toronto and upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon with the said City, to
establish, construct, develop, extend, equip, maintain, operate and· administer an airport now in
course of construction ...

Were the bill before us phrased in these
terms, and the Hamilton Harbour Commissioners given powers to carry on their
amusement activities at the expense of the
Corporation of the City of Hamilton, I would
not object so much, although I still should
not like the bill, because I feel that the
carrying on of amusement activities is not
a proper function of a Harbour Board, whose
main purpose is, as my friend from New
Westminster has said, the providing of
harbour facilities for shipping.
Further, I think that we are going far
beyond our constitutional powers, or what
our constitutional powers should be. The
British North America Act gives to parliament the right to control the harbours of
Canada-for of course they are national
in character-and the various harbour commissions are empowered to do the things
which are incidental and necessary to the
activities involved in the provision and
management of harbours. I submit that the
operation of amusement stands and bathing
beaches and the conduct of the activities of
that kind is not incidental to the provision
and management of a harbour.
In recent times I have heard a good many
protests about encroachments by provincial
governments upon the autonomy of our
towns and cities. It is said that the legislatures, owing to their greater legislative
powers, are gradually encroaching upon the
powers of the municipalites, and it is feared
that if this trend continues the municipalities
will in time become mere nonentities doing
the will of the legislatures.

MAY 21, 1951
By this measure the Dominion Parliament
is encroaching upon the powers of a municipal council. True, it is with the consent of
the council, but that does not help us in the
least so far as the principle is concerned.
The fact that the municipal council is prepared to sell its birthright for a mess of
pottage, and hand over to the harbour board
part of the privileges and rights which
naturally belong to the city-namely, of
providing amusements for its people-is no
justification whatsoever
for parliament
taking part in the abdicating of those
privileges and rights by a municipal council.
As I say, I arm sure this bill will carry, but
it will not carry unanimously. The time may
come when other harbour boards ask parliament for extraordinary and fantastic legislation, and if it does, at least we shall be
able to say that this bill did net carry
unanimously, that there was vigorous and
serious objection to it.
I was in Hamilton at a court proceeding
last Monday, while there one of the court
officials accused me of preventing the City
of Hamilton from having its amusement
beach. Time did not permit me to stop and
argue the question, but I assured him that
I was doing nothing of the kind. I am as
anxious as anybody outside the City of
Hamilton to see that the people of that city,
and particularly those who are employed in
new industries, have all possible facilities for
pleasure; but I am not prepared to take part
in a move by which powers which naturally
belong to the municipality are being
surrendered to a harbour board. Further,
I am opposed to harbour commissioners
being allowed to usurp an authority which is
not properly theirs.
I register my protest against this legislation. I shall vote against it, and I shall
regret to see it carried by this house.
Hon. Mr. Vien:
WiU the honourable
senator allow me ta ask a question before he
resumes his seat? Was this aspect of the
question
fully
discussed
before
the
committee?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Unfortunately, I could
not be at that committee meeting.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Nor could I.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I explained that my
absence was beyond my control, and my
friend from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid)
carried the debate along the line that I have
now taken. When I spoke on second reading of this bill, I asked whether the Hamilton
harbour board could not carry on with such
powers as are enjoyed by the Toronto commission, namely to lease concessions, if you
80713-29

like, but not to operate them. Those views
were before the committee when it met. I
think, therefore, the subject was fully discussed.
Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators,
I too was unavoidably absent from the meeting of the committee at which this bill was
considered, but I am extremely impressed
by the remarks of the two honourable
senators who have just spoken.
I do not think it proper that parliament
should pass a bill dealing with civil and
municipal rights, both of which are
exclusively within provincial jurisdiction. As
the senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) has aptly said, we have the power
to create harbour commissions and to legislate as to both their fundamental and
ancillary powers, but these ancillary powers
must be incidental to the main object for
which the harbour commissions are created.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Amusements within the
City of Hamilton are municipal in character,
and cannot possibly be linked up as ancillary
functions of the harbour commissioners. The
harbour board should have the power to
lease its property and to grant concessions
to persons and institutions approved by the
municipal authorities; but, I do not think it
should have such powers as are sought in
this bill. There may be some reason why
the Municipal Council of the City of H-amilton does not wish to exercise its authority
with respect to amusements. That being so,
it should create an independent municipal
commission of some kind to look after its
parks and amusement places. At any rate,
it is not within the power of this parliament to determine how Hamilton, or any
other city, should conduct its amusements.
Such matters should be left to the provincial
authorities, who have the right to determine
the powers of municipal corporations.
I would suggest that it might be well to
adjourn the debate on this measure until the
sponsor (Hon. Mr. Campbell) is back in his
seat, for tonight, in the light of what has
been said by the two previous speakers, I
would feel compelled to vote against it. The
sponsor of the bill may be able to throw
some additional light on the subject, and
thus we would be able to amend the bill or
send it back to the committee for further
consideration.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
unlike the two honourable gentlemen who
have just spoken, I was present at the meeting of the committee at which this bill was
discussed, and where we heard. unanimous

SENATE
representations in its favour from a delegation from the City of Hamilton headed by
the mayor. I hope that honourable senators
who were not at the committee meeting will
not conclude from the speeches made this
evening that this bill constitutes some grave
encroachment upon municipal rights or
infringement of the liberties of the subject.
Having listened to the arguments put before
us, it seems to me that there is no very substantial principle involved in the bill. This
is the position: The Hamilton Harbour Commission was set up a number of years ago by
a federal Act, with the primary object of
developing the harbour facilities of the City
of Hamilton. That commission is an appointive body, two of its members being appointed
by the federal government, and one member
being appointed every three years by the City
Council of Hamilton. In effect, what the
Board of Harbour Commissioners of Hamilton does is to operate the harbour properties
of the City of Hamilton on behalf of the city.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Not as a financial
liability of the City of Hamilton.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: There is no financial
liability on the dominion: that much, at least,
is quite certain. According to the explanations given to us, a great part of the harbourfront property which formerly was used for
bathing beaches has been befouled as a result
of the industrialization of the city. There is
another section of the beach belonging to the
harbour commissioners which is not used for
harbour purposes at all, but which may be
so used, and which no doubt is held by the
commissioners with a view to its ultimate
development for harbour purposes. It is in
an industrial section of the city where few
amusements or amenities are available to the
children. In the meantime it is available, and
it is well adapted to the purposes of a bathing
beach. All that this bill does is to permit
the harbour board, either of itself or by
means of licences to operators of amusements, to use this beach for recreational purposes. The representatives of the City of
Hamilton who were before us stated that
they regarded the Hamilton Harbour Commissioners as the body which controls and
regulates their harbour properties on their
behalf, and for the purpose they had in view
they considered that under the circumstances
it was wise to have the commissioners control
this particular beach. They begged us to
pass the bill. They told us that the situation
In that part of the city is desperate, that
within a very considerable distance there is
no other beach available where this industrial
population can enjoy the advantages of
swimming in the summer. The whole purpose
of this bill is to make the beach available to
these people.

For the life of me I cannot detect any
encroachment upon the rights of the city or of
the province. Neither can I see that in
giving the Hamilton Harbour Commissioners
-one of whom represents the city, and is
reappointed every three years-the right to
make this beach available for purposes of
public amusement until such time as it is
needed for the primary purpose of a harbour
there, is any infringement of the liberties of
the subject.
As I have said, this bill is proposed by the
City of Hamilton itself. City representatives,
headed by the mayor, and representatives of
the harbour commissioners, appeared before
us and advanced the reasons I have set out,
and strongly urged us to pass the bill in the
interests of the children of the industrial
sections of the city.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: My friend has said that
there is no liability under this bill.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: In the dominion.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes. Will my friend
say that the property transferred to the
harbour board by the dominion authority,
aind the harbour itself, which is under
dominion authority, are not liable?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: It is not under dominion
authority. The harbour of Hamilton is not
a national harbour.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I would like to ask the
honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) where he finds power in the federal parliament to deal with amusements in
any of our Canadian cities.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That is a good question.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen. The answer is very
simple. This is a body set up by the Dominion
Parliament. The Hamilton Harbour Commission is a body incorporated by special Act
of the Dominion Parliament; and the federal
authority, if it sees fit, can invest the commission with any power incidental to its main
objects.
Hon. Mr. Vien: But is the right to deal
with amusements in the City of Hamilton
ancillary to the purposes of the Hamilton
Harbour Board? How can we link the main
object for which the board was created with
the management of amusement parks or
beaches? I cannot find that the powers provided by this bill are ancillary to the main
functions of the harbour board.
Hon. Mr. Reid: They are not.
Hon. Mr. Vien: And unless they are, I am
of the opinion that this provision is ultra vires
of parliament.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I attempted to explain
that point. Of course these lands are held

MAY 21, 1951
primarily for the purposes of a harbour.
There is no question about that. But so
long 'as they are not being used for that purpose, there is no reason why they should not
be temporarily devoted to the use of the
people of Hamilton.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I ask my honourable
friend from Inkerman a question? What disturbs me is this. A corporation whose present powers have to do with the operation and
development of the harbour is to be granted
additional powers to expend money for building, developing and maintaining amusement
places, to borrow money for defraying the
expenses thereof, and to make bylaws governing the operation. It seems clear that
that section envisages the expenditure of
money. Presumably, when this power is
given, the commissioners will endeavour to
find funds, and perhaps will borrow money
from the bank, issue debentures or bonds,
or something of the kind. If they do, upon
what assets can they borrow, other than the
property which is under their control as a
harbour board? And if the operation of these
amusement parks resulits in losses, what will
happen to the property of the harbour
commissioners?
The original Act clearly contemplated the
development of the necessary harbour facilities adjacent to the City of Hamilton. The
harbour board was set up under the statute
of 1912 for that purpose. While I have every
sympathy with the desire of the City of
Hamilton to get proper bathing beaches for
their young people and children, I think we
should be fairly clear in our minds as to the
implications of this legislation. If money
is raised on the security of the property of the
harbour board, and a default follows because
the amusement schemes do not provide the
revenue necessary to meet the charges, what
will be the situation then? I would be glad
if the honourable senator from Inkerman
would enlighten us on that point.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Honourable senatorsHon. Mr. Haig: I rise on a question of
privilege, to state, in case there should be any
misunderstanding, that the other morning
when I was coming into the building the honourable member from Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck) told me that he could not be
at the committee meeting; and I so informed
the committee as soon as the meeting opened.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Thank you.
Evidently my honourable friend from
Inkerman is not going to answer the question.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I was waiting until
the honourable senator from Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor) had spoken.
80713-29j

Hon. Gordon B. Isnor: Honourable senators,
coming as I do from a section of the country
which can lay claim to one of the finest
harbours in the world, I am concerned about
this bill from a different angle. I am wondering what might happen if, in the spirit of
competition, the cities of Toronto and
Hamilton were permitted to borrow large
amounts of money to advertise their ports.
It appears to me that this would be an act
of discrimination.
The seven national
harbour ports operate under the National
Harbours Board, whose policy is not to canvass for the business of any particular port
at the expense of another. It has no money
for that purpose anyway. If this bill is
passed, I can visualize two. ports on the
Pacific Coast, say-New Westminster and
Vancouver-vying
with each other for
amusement trade, one operating in a restricted manner under the National Harbours Act
and the other operating freely under a special
Act such as Toronto and Hamilton enjoy. I
can also visualize the same thing happening
on the Atlantic Coast. This is one of the
reasons I am concerned about the powers
which this Act would give to the Hamilton
Harbour Commissioners.
At first I was not greatly concerned about
this bill, but after listening to the honourable
member from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) I began to wonder what effect it might
have on the port of Halifax, and naturally I
want to be sure of my ground before voting
for a measure which might have an adverse
effect on the great Atlantic port from which
I come. I am in agreement with those who
have expressed the wish that further consideration be given to this bill.
We cannot overlook the case of the Hamilton Harbour Commissioners, which was so
capably presented by the honourable senator
from Inkerman. I should like, however, to
stress the fact that there is a very marked
difference between the operation of ports
under the jurisdiction of the National
Harbours Board and the operation of ports
under special Acts such as this.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Honourable senators, I
thought this bill was a rather strange one to
be presented to parliament, but in committee the mayor of Hamilton and the city
solicitor were unanimous in urging its passage.
The honourable senator from Inkerman
said something about the Hamilton Harbour
Commissioners owning certain land. As I
understand it, this land belongs to the City
of Hamilton, and it is the wish of the
Hamilton civic authorities that it be turned
over to the Harbour Commissioners for
amusement purposes, and playgrounds and
public bathing beaches.

SENATE
I think the honourable senators from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) and New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) should bear in
mind the policy adopted by many government departments of passing the buck to
some board or other. The people seeking to
get this bill passed by parliament have simply
followed the example set by the federal
government. Take the Board of Transport
Commissioners. Why should parliament forsake its right to direct, for instance, where
certain pipe-lines should run, and turn the
whole matter over to the Board of Transport
Commissioners? Just because somebody is
afraid of his vote being affected. There is
nothing more ridiculous. To be consistent,
the honourable gentlemen from Toronto and
New Westminster should insist that, in these
other matters which I have in mind, parliament should not transfer it authority to any
board.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I now ask the
question which has been waiting for so long?
I should like to know whether the honourable gentleman who sponsored this bill can
give us any precedent in which the parlia-ment of Canada empowered one of its
corporations to carry on an amusement
business?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators
will appreciate that I am not the sponsor of
this bill. I only intervened in the discussion
after hearing three speeches in opposition to
it. It seemed to me that the case for this
legislation was amply made in committee,
and I did not want the members of the Senate
who were not in the comimittee to get the
impression that this house was being asked
to pass a bill involving any encroachment
upon local rights or infringement upon the
liberties of the public.
The honourable gentleman from De
Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien) suggested that we
adjourn the debate until the return of the
honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Campbel), who sponsored the bill. I do not
know that I should take any further responsibility for ýanswering questions that should
be asked of the sponsor.
Hon. Mr. Reid: You are doing very well.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: If I may answer the
honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar), all that we do when we empower a
corporation to borrow money is what the
Parliament of Canada does directly, when it
incorporates a -company by statute, or
indirectly, when a company is incorporated
by letters patent under the Companies Act.
All these companies are empowered to borrow money under certain conditions. The
Dominion Parliament is not concerned with
the security that is given for the money so

borrowed, or the use that is made of this
money when it is obtained. All that we do
here is to give the power to borrow money
for these purposes, just as we have given
power to innumerable corporations to borrow
money for their respective purposes. I just
want to say to my honourable friend from
Churchill that surely we can leave to the
good judgment of the city authorities of
Hamilton and the Hamilton Harbour Commissioners the question of borrowing money for
these purposes and the manner in which
it is spent.
In answer to the honourable senator from
Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor), I would
say that there is a marked difference between
the national harbours-which are operated
by the National Harbours Board under the
direct .control of the dominion-whose borrowings have to be made under guarantee
from the dominion, and local harbour boards
-such as those of Hamilton and Torontowhere there is no financial responsibility of
any kind -on the part of the dominion. I do
not think the City of Hamilton or, for that
matter, the City of Toronto, would be in a
financial position to spend such vast amounts
of money in their respective harbours as to
challenge the supremacy of the harbour of
Halifax.
As to the question asked by the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck), I suppose that there have been a
hundred or more companies organized under
the Dominion Companies Act for the purpose
of carrying on an amusement business of one
kind or another.
Hon. Mr. Reid: In view of the fact that
the City of Hamilton owns these beach lands,
why is it not developing them for amusement purposes itself?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: As far as I could
gather from the remarks made in committee
by the representatives of the City of Hamilton,
the greater portion of the beach property in that city is already owned and operated by the Harbour Commissioners, and
the city wishes to add this property to what
is already under the commission's control.
In other words, the city wishes to treat the
Harbour Commissioners as the operating
body for all the harbour and beach
facilities in the municipality.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Honourable senators,
perhaps I am out of order, but may I suggest
to my honourable friend from Inkerman
that the matter could have been very easily
resolved by the City of Hamilton leasing from
the Harbour Commissioners for such time
as was thought wise these particular beaches
that it wishes to develop.

MAY 21, 1951
The Hon. the Speaker: I am sorry, but I
have to remind the honourable senator that
he has already spoken on the measure.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I did not intend to take part in this debate,
and I have no interest one way or another in
the bill. As we all know, no citizen of Hamilton is a member of this chamber, so there is
no one present to speak on behalf of the city
itself.
I have listened to the arguments of the
senators from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid), Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck),
De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien) and Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen). The land referred to
in this bill is just a small piece of property.
The fact is that working people in Hamilton
have moved out beyond this area and there
is no place for their children to swim and
play in the water; and the municipal council
Commissioners to
wishes the Harbour
develop a beach so that the kids will have a
safe place to swim. That is al it amounts to.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Maybe my friends from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) and De
Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien) are constitutionally
correct, and that it would be legally wrong
to give the Harbour Commissioners the
powers asked for in this bill; but so far as I
am concerned I do not want some legal technicality about a constitutional issue to prevent
the Harbour Commissioners f rom doing a little
work with the view to providing a safe place
for workingmen's children to swim and play.
The lands in ques.tion originally belonged to
the City of Hamilton and, presuming that this
measure would be passed, the city transferred
them to the Harbour Commissioners. At
some time in the future, perhaps ten or
twenty years from now, the land may be
used for harbour extension purposes, but in
the meantime workingmen's kids will make
use of this convenient swimming place.
Hoi. Mr. Reid: How do you know?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Anyone who has or has
had youngsters knows how important it is
that there should be a safe place for them
to swim.
If the time comes when this land is needed
for harbour extension purposes the city
council, however sincerely convinced of that
need, might find it difficult to do away with
a children's bathing beach. I have had as
much to do with elections as most members
of this house, and I know what difficulties a
council could face on a matter of this kind.
But with the Harbour Commissioners in
control of the land, as they now are, there
would likely be much less opposition to any

general feeling would probably be that
would not want to make a change unless
felt it was in the interests of the people
whole.

Hon. Mr. Vien: Will my honourable friend
answer a question?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I will answer it when I
have finished. The Private Bills Committee
was prepared to report this bill after the
first hearing on it, but senators who were
present will recall that I said I thought the
mayor of Hamilton and the city solicitor
ought to come and tell us why they wanted
the bill. Somebody said that would put the
city to a good deal of expense, but I
persisted in my view that we should have
an explanation by the municipal authorities. The senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Campbell) sponsored and explained the bill
in committee, and although I have every
respect for him, I still felt that we should
hear the mayor and the city solicitor.
They came before the committee and I was
entirely convinced. The mayor, who struck
me as an able and genuine man, said he
thought that the bill was in the interest of
the industrial workers who live out past the
lands affected by the bill, and that it was
desirable to have the bathing beach and
playgrounds handled by the Harbour Commissioners.
As I said before, the senators from
Toronto-Trinity and De Lorimier may be
constitutionally right and those of us who
support this bill may be constitutionally
wrong. I recall that in my province somebody once said to a Judge of the King's
Bench that he had made a wrong decision,
and the Judge replied "Well, there is a
higher court, and you can go and get its
opinion."
So I say that if we are
constitutionally wrong, there is not far away
a Supreme Court which, if appealed to, will
put us right. That is what the court is paid
to do. But nobody in Hamilton will object
to this legislation.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Haig: The mayor told us that
the municipal council wanted the harbour
commissioners to make these developments.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: He said it was anxious
to have them made.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I have an interest in the
youngsters of this country, and I want to
help the workingmen's children in that new
section of Hamilton to get a place to swim.
Now I am ready for my honourable friend's
question.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Vien: Does the honourable senator
believe that it is our function to determine
whether a municipality or its harbour commissioners should have control of the beaches?
And if, as he has admitted, we may not have
the constitutional right to make this amendment, does he think we should assume that
right?
Hon. Mr. Haig: My answer is this. The
Municipal Council of Hamilton and the
Harbour Commission of Hamilton want this
bill passed, and they are the only two bodies
affected. I am sure that if we had in this
chamber a senator from Hamilton he would
have spoken in favour of the bill much better
than I have done. I come from a province
that has a fine harbour. In fact, Manitoba
has such a good harbour that members of
parliament visit it twice a session. We
have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
on that harbour and I have not heard a word
of protest by the senator from HalifaxDartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor).
We have
expended about $60 million in getting to
that beautiful harbour.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: But no use is being made
of it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is because we have
not advertised it enough.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Are there any amusement stands there?
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed, on division.

CONSUMER

CREDIT (TEMPORARY

PROVISIONS) BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. J. Kinley moved the second reading of Bill 195, an Act to amend the Consumer Credit (Temporary Provisions) Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill,
which comes to us from the House of Commons, is to amend the Consumer Credit
(Temporary Provisions) Act passed at the
last session of parliament. The proposed
amendments, which are not extensive, are
to close loopholes which through experience
have become apparent, and to control instalment buying of goods designated as consumer goods.
The first amendment contained in paragraph (c) of section 1 of the bill, has to do
with conditional sale contracts. It reads as
follows:
"(c) 'conditional sale contract' means any agreement other than a charge account, under the terms
of which a buyer is to obtain possession of any
goods without paying the price thereof in full at or
before the time of delivery, whether or not the
seller retains any property, interest or lien in
respect of the goods, and includes"--

The purpose of this amendment is to make
clear that a conditional sale contract, as
defined, includes a contract of sale under
which the seller retains no interest in the
goods, as well as a contract of sale under
which an interest is retained. Generally
speaking, under a conditional sale contract
the seller retains some interest or lien in
respect of the goods which he has sold. The
definition in the Act did not make the point
clear, and as it is desirable to cover all instalment sales of consumer goods under the
regulations, whether or not the interest or
lien is retained, the definition of conditional
sale contract is accordingly enlarged.
Section 2 (1) of the bill would amend
section 3 of the Act by adding the following
paragraphs:
"(d) payment under a contract for the hire of
consumer goods,

MAY 21, 1951
(e) payment under a contract for work and
iabcur where consumer goods are supplied by the
person who contracts to furnish the work and
labour,"

Paragraph (d) is necessary because certain enterprising people in business conceived the idea of using a continuous rental
agreement at a price which in a year would
about cover the cost of the article, following which the rental price would be $1 a
year, thus circumventing the regulations.
This practice, which originated in the United
States, has not yet become extensive in
Canada, but it is felt that it would seriously
confiict with the working of the Act.
Paragraph (e), to which I have referred,
has to do with payments under a contract
which is partly for labour and partly for
material. For instance, when a new engine
is installed in an automobile there is the
cost of the material and the labour for
installing it. In such circumstances the two
items must be charged separately: the labour
can be charged for and collected on whatever terms are lagreed upon, but the material
comes under the regulations under this Act,
and must be sold in accordance with them.
By a further amendment the bill would
repeal :paragraph (b) of subsection 2 of section 3 of the Act, and substitute the following:
"(b) requiring any person who
(i) sells goods at retail on credit,
(ii) engages in the business or makes a practice
of lending money,
(iii) has an interest in a conditional sale contract,
or
(iv) enters into any of the contracts mentioned in
paragraphs (d) and (e) of subsection one, to keep
such records and books and to furnish such information as the Governor in Council may prescribe."

The bill would further amend the Act by
adding thereto a new section 3A, which
would permit persons who are authorized to
examine goods, books or records to take
them away for use in court proceedings; but
if such proceedings are not instituted within
ninety days after the seizure of the goods,
books or records, they must be returned, to
the person or the premises from which they
were taken.
As I have said, the amendments, which are
of a minor nature, are to close the loopholes
and make for better administration of the
Act. They are largely of an enabling character, under which the government must
make regulations to carry out the objects
of the legislation.
I am informed that the regulations are
of a mildly restrictive character, and that
the sale of goods has increased rather than
decreased; however, the volume of goods
sold on what might be called conditional
sale contracts has decreased. In anticipation
of the budget, buying was stimulated to some

extent, and for that reason the figures available are not a good indication of the trend.
The regulations which came into force
on November 1, 1950, affected automobiles,
on which a purchaser paid one-third down
and the balance in eighteen months. On
certain other designated consumer goods the
down payment was 20 per cent, with eighteen
months to pay the balance. On March 19
last the regulations affecting automobiles
were extended, requiring a down payment of
50 per cent -and payment of the balance in
twelve months; on other consumer goods a
down payment of one-third was required,
with twelve months to pay the balance;
minimum payments of $10 monthly and $2.50
weekly were allowed.
The Act gives an arbitrary definition of
what are consumer goods under the regulations. Generally, we divide goods into two
classes: consumer goods, which are goods
that are consumed; and capital goods, which
are for production purposes. I find the line
between the two classes is very narrow, but
the regulations set out exactly what must
be regarded as consumer goods.
In a transaction for the purchase of art
automobile, the vehicle being traded in is
considered part of the down payment; in
the case of other articles, such as furniture,
their value is subtracted from the cost price
of the new merchandise. A person may sell
his automobile personally, provided he has
owned it for six months.
I may say that ordinary credit sales are
not affected by this bill. The power to control credit has not been used up to the present
time. Loan value is controlled with respect
to the articles contained in Schedule B, the
maximum loan value being 50 per cent in
Group 1, and 66 2/3 per cent in the other
groups.
The amendments contained in the bill have
been drawn on the assumption that as a
result of our large defence program a great
deal of purchasing power will be distributed,
and that the public are likely to use this
purchasing power to buy consumer goods
whose manufacture will require a large
amount of labour and material. This would
create difficulties and cause confusion in the
financial affairs of the country. I do not think
I can do better than to recite the preamble
of the Act which was passed last session:
Whereas in the preamble to The Essential Materials
(Defence) Act it is recited that in order to avert

of normal trade and commerce and to prevent

preparations may De expected to expand purchasing
power and the demand for consumer goods, and at
the same time limit the quantity of consumer goods

it may therefore be necessary, as a further measure
to counteract possible adverse effects of these
developments upon such defence preparations,
normal trade and commerce and the economie life
of the nation, to take steps to restrain the expansion of purchasing power and the demand for
consumer goods by preventing inflationary expansion of currency and credit; and it is therefore

If some government agent comes along and
reasonably believes that an offence has been
committed against the regulations, he may
take away with him all the books and
records. If the agent does not institute court
proceedings within ninety days the books
and records are then returned to the rightful owner. This seems to me to be an
extraordinary provision.
This section may be satisfactorily explained
when the bill is before committee, but I do
not like this constant extension of arbitrary
powers which enable government agents to
interfere with the ordinary business operations of individual, citizens. Certainly if a
government agent seizes these records or
books he should be able to determine within
a week or ten days whether or not he has any
80713-30

evidence to support his suspicions. The idea
of taking these records away and locking
them up for as long a period as three months
is something which should be closely inquired
into in committee.
Hon. P. H. Bouffard: I agree with the
honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar). I think the departmental officials
should be asked to provide our committee
with a reasonable explanation for the necessity of section 3A. I shall go further than
my colleague from Churchill. This section
does not merely involve a three-month delay
in the returning of confiscated records; once
the department institutes court proceedings,
the books or records are held until the
termination of the case. This may involve a
matter of six months or even a year, and
during all this time the owner is without his
books or records. There is no better way to
ruin a man's business than to do a thing
like that.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is, right.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: What if the information
given to the agent of the department is supplied by a competitor? There would be no
easier way for a man to completely ruin his
competitor; and if the courts rule that no
offence has been committed, the owner cannot take action against the department or the
government agent.
Hon. Gordon B. Isnor: Before the sponsor
of this bill closes the debate, I should like to
say that I am in agreement with the general
principle of this legislation because I think
its purpose is to combat inflation. Certain
loopholes were found in the present Act, and
the purpose of these amendments is to plug
those loopholes.
It is generally recognized by the retail trade
that the credit regulations were of immense
value both to merchants and to the buying
public. The purchasers were enabled to buy
goods which otherwise they would have had
to do without, and by taking in additional
cash the merchants were able to take advantage of a discount by paying their bills when
they came due. There was a general, easy
flow of money from the consumer to the
retailer and from the retailer to the manufacturer. But some furniture companies, for
instance, have got around one of these credit
regulations. No doubt the sponsor of this
bill is familiar with the so-called revolving
credit system and the rental system. An
article valued at, say, $600 may be rented to
a consumer at $1 a month over a long period,
until in time the consumer is given a bill of
sale and becomes the owner. This revolving

SENATE

credit system and this so-called rental
system are two features which I do not feel
are helping retailers to carry on business.
I wonder if the sponsor of the bill would be
good enough to explain to us just how he
proposes to curb these things?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Honourable senators, the
purpose of the proposed new section 3A is
ýto give persons who are authorized to examine books and goods the right to take
them away and keep them so long as they
are needed for court proceedings. I have no
brief for that. The department will have its
representatives in committee to justify this
section. I think, though, there should be
provision for making sure that people generally will keep the law. I say that because
the selling of automobiles and other goods
on credit is a business in which great ingenuity is used from time to time. The purchaser
of an automobile will have to pay a deposit
of half the value, and purchasers of other
designated classes of consumer goods will
have to put down at least thirty-five per cent
of the value. The question at the moment is
whether credit buying should be restricted to
that degree.
The revolving credit system mentioned by
my honourable friend from Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor) was introduced in
the United States, and is now used by many
department stores in this country. It works
something like this. The credit manager
in a department might give a purchaser a
credit of, say, $240 over a period of six
months. The purchaser would pay in $40 the
first month, and if he made no purchase that
month he would not need to pay in anything
next month. However, he could make several purchases, to a 'total of $240, without
the obligation of entering into a separate
contract in each case. That provided a loophole, in that the down payment was only
one-sixth instead of one-third, but the loophole was not large and the matter has been
taken care of in the regulations.
As to rentals, some dealers in radio and
television sets have made rental agreements
under which persons pay so much a month.
In a year a customer who gets a set on those
terms pays in its full sale value. After that
a new agreement is made to rent the machine
for, say, one dollar a year. Agreements to
rent furniture for summer cottages and other
honest rental agreements are not affected
by this bill. The purpose of the bill is to
prevent people from using their ingenuity
to get through loopholes.
If the bill is given second reading, I shall
move ithat it be referred to the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce, where

officers of the Department of Finance will
appear to give any further explanations
required.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Kinley moved that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES
COMPENSATION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. F. W. Gershaw moved the second
reading of Bill 291, an Act to amend the
Government Employees Compensation Act,
1947.
He said: Honourable senators, everybody
nowadays realizes the benefit of workmen's
compensation Acts. If in the course of his
employment a workman is injured or contracts an industrial disease, he gets compensation, and if the accident or disease proves
fatal, his dependents are looked after.
The purpose of this bill is to give better
compensation benefits to people working for
the federal government or for corporations
doing government work in the far north, in
the Yukon and the Northwest Territories. At
present these people are under the Yukon
Ordinance, and this bill places them under a
law which is exactly the same as the Alberta
law with respect to workmen's compensation.
The proposed changes in the law are underlined in the bill. The first change is in the
definition of "Minister," which now means
the Minister of Labour instead of the Minister
of Transport. This is because the functions
of the Minister of Transport under the Act
were transferred to the Minister of Labour
by Order in Council P.C. 6470 of December
22, 1949.
The second change groups the Yukon
Territory and the Northwest Territories for
purposes of the operation of the Act. There
are not many cases of compensation involved.
For instance, last year there were 1,270 in
British Columbia, but only 35 in these two
northern districts.
The third change is simply to make the
wording of subsection 2 of section 2 of the
Act conform with changes in terminology in
the National Defence Act.
Then there is an amendment providing that
if, in case of an accident, the federal authorities request the compensation board of a
province to make an investigation and adjudication, the Minister of Finance may make an
accountable advance to the board to cover the
expenses incurred in the case.

MAY 21, 1951
Finally, section 3 of the bill repeals sections
5, 6, 7 and 8 of the Act and substitutes therefor four new sections. Section 5 is the
important one. It provides that if in the
course of his employment a worker in the
Yukon or the Northwest Territories suff ers
an accident or contracts an industrial disease,
the accident or disease shall for the purposes
of the Act be deemed to have occurred or
been contracted in the province of Alberta.
In other words, the amendment simply gives
the workers all the benefits of the Alberta
Act. It may be asked why the Act of Alberta
has been selected. One reason is that Alberta
is adjacent territory. Probably another reason is that recently Alberta made a thorough
amendment of its Workmen's Compensation
Act. A committee held sittings in various
parts of the province, heard evidence and
prepared a new Act.
In my opinion the people employed in
these northern sections were quite right in
demanding better terms, and I think they
are getting them under this measure. According to the Yukon Ordinance, a workman
who suffers an industrial accident or contracts a disease in the course of his employment is paid a lump sum; and if the accident

80713 -30.

or disease proves fatal, his widow and
children are paid a lump sum. In Alberta,
and no doubt in other provinces, the person
involved receives so much a month, and in
addition he gets medical attention, hospital
and nursing, and everything possible is done
to restore him to perfect health.
The one amendment in this bill, as I see
it, is to bring the people concerned within
the workmen's compensation laws of the
Province of Alberta.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

LAURIER HOUSE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Norman P. Lambert moved the
second reading of Bill 289, an Act respecting
Laurier House.
He said: Honourable senators, I am sure
that one cannot but be conscious of the
historical precedent that is being set in this
country by the presentation of this bill and
Bill 290, an Act respecting Kingsmere Park,
which is to follow. In so far as I have been
able to ascertain, these bills represent the
only case in the annals of this dominion of
such bequests of property to the state. It
seems to mark a conscious effort to express
in some concrete forn an historical and
cultural aspect of Canadian life. The fact
that these particular bequests apply to the
capital city of Ottawa and the federal district

MAY 22, 1951

surrounding it serves only to emphasize the
existence of a growing spirit of Canadianism
throughout this land. This example in all
probability will be followed by others In
different localities in Canada, and the
pattern set in this legislation will be a basis
for future policy and action.
We have three or four agencies of government through which the duties connected
with the administration of beq'uests of this
kind can be exercised. First, there is the
Federal District Commission; then, the
National Parks Branch of the Department of
Resources and Development; and, thirdly, the
National Sites and Monuments Commission.
The recent Massey Commission had within
the scope of its inquiry consideration of such
subjects as historic sites and monuments, and
when its report comes to be discussed there
might emerge some new organization combining the functions of the three that I have
mentioned into something similar to the
National Trust that exists in England. That
institution receives estates from people who
wish to bestow them upon, or return them
to, the country in which they have lived, or
from owners of estates who are unable to
pay death duties, which are now becoming so
increasingly high. In England, of course,
during the past forty or fifty years, there
have been innumerable examples of bequests
by very ancient families who, unaible to meet
death duties and other taxes charged against
them, have turned over properties to the
public for administration by the National
Trust.
It is interesting to note that that organization was incorporated in England in 1907
under the name "The National Trust for
Places of Historic Interest or Natural
Beauty."
The incorporating statute was
enlarged in 1937, and again in 1939, in order
to enable the Trust to purchase properties
as well as to receive them from donors. I
understand that at present about 160,000
acres of land and more than 1,000 buildings
of various kinds-old manor houses and so
on-are under the administration of the
Trust. Anyone wishing to obtain information on the purpose and operations of the
National Trust in the Old, Country wil find
it interesting to read the bulletins that are
issued about the work of this organization
by the Home Office.
As an example, one of these bulletins
stated that on May 17 the Lord Chancellor,
Viscount Jowitt, re-opened
the Iveagh
Bequest, Kenwood, Hampstead Heath, which
had been closed since the outbreak of war.
The mansion of Kenwood, with its collection
of pictures and the surrounding grounds, was
left to the nation by the Earl of Iveagh in

1927. The park was handed over in trust to
the London County Council, and the house
to private trustees; however, the fund left
by Lord Iveagh for the maintenance of the
house had proved inadequate to meet the
rising costs, and the London County Council
agreed last year to become responsible for
the house as well as the park.
I mention that by way of comment upon
the fact that in England, contrary to general
impressions, there is a growing volume of
opinion in favour of the preservation and
appreciation of old established houses, with
their beautiful types of architecture. In a
word, there is a decided trend in favour of the
preservation of these things that stand for
the culture and beauty of a thousand years of
civilization in England. Recently in Chelsea,
in the famous quarter known as Cheyne Row,
with which the memory of Carlyle is so closely
identified, 14,000 petitioners were successful in
resisting an effort to raze the area for the
purpose of erecting some modern apartment
houses overlooking the Thames. So, that
very rare spot in London will be preserved,
without any possibility of depredation.
To return to the bills before us, we have
only to consider the terms under which the
people of Canada, through the federal
government and parliament, are asked to
accept the properties referred to under the
clauses of the last will and testament of the
late Mr. Mackenzie King, as set out in the
schedule to each of these two bills.
Laurier House is for the time being to be
used as an annex to the Public Archiveswith the exception of the dining room and
the Mackenzie King library room on the
third floor, which are to remain unchanged.
Each of the other rooms is to be arranged
in the form of a joint museum and library.
Enough historic souvenirs have been accumulated over the past fifty years by the two
prime ministers who lived in that house to
provide interesting furnishings for a museum
and library in each room. It is expected
that through the Archives students will be
given facilities in Laurier House to follow
any study or research in which they may be
engaged. It is well known that at the
present time the Public Archives, like the
Library of Parliament, suffers from a shortage of space, and the increasing demands
being made upon that branch of government
activity is such that the use of Laurier House
as an annex to the Archives is a very
welcome development.
A foundation of some $225,000 was
bequeathed by the late Prime Minister as a
contribution to the upkeep of the house. This
sum, however, will provide for little more
than the salary and stenographic help of the

SENATE
curator of the house. The physical upkeep
of Laurier House will be a charge on the
Department of Public Works, and the grounds
will be maintained by the Federal District
Commission. While no definite estimate of
the amount required to maintain Laurier
House in this way was mentioned in the
other place, I understand that it will not
exceed $12,000 per annum.
As I have mentioned, at the present time
the Public Archives is pressed for space, and
the added facilities at Laurier House will
afford a useful annex for its activities. Later,
when the government of the country feels
that it can build and establish a new National
Library where the Public Archives can be
suitably pla.ced, some other use may be found
for Laurier House. At any rate there is
nothing binding in the detail of this legislation, as there was nothing binding in these
particular provisions of the late Prime Minister's will.
The whole proposal regarding Laurier
House-and also Kingsmere, which is the
subject of a later bill-must, I think, be
viewed in the broadest possible way and
connected with the future status of this
country. There are many evidences here
and there in various cultural ways of an
articulate Canadianism, and there has been
in this particular district a latent pressure
behind the activities of the Federal District
Commission, supplemented lately by the
Greber plan, for the establishment in Canada
of a capital that will be worthy of the
achievements and the aspirations of the
people of this country. In approaching the
revision of the Federal District Commission
Act in 1944, the late Prime Minister made
the statement that he hoped that plans could
be laid down for the establishment of a
capital city and a federal district area surrounding it that would be worthy of the
great efforts that had been put forth by our
armed forces overseas during the past war
and by those who had helped to support them
so valiantly in the industrial life of this
country during that period. I think that
these bills are the final concrete expression
of that aspiration.
In -conclusion one may refer appropriately,
I think, to the memorable words of the Honourable Joseph Howe, who, incidentally, in
Nova Scotia bore a vital relationship to the
establishment of responsible government in
this country, as did William Lyon Mackenzie
in Upper Canada. Howe said:
"A wise nation gathers up its records, preserves
its muniments, decorates the tombs of illustrious
dead, restores its great public structures, and fosters
national pride and love of country by perpetual
reference to the sacrifices and glories of the past."

Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Lambert: I think these words
have been quoted before in this house, but
I make no apology for using them again
now, because I submit that they are a most
appropriate background for these bills. It
is in the spirit of that admonition of Howe's
that I would sincerely move the second reading of this bill.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lacasse: May I appeal to the
usual indulgence of the Chair, and inject an
observation which is not directly connected
with the subject-matter before us? I take

in Montreal a most solidly constructed old
building has been torn down. I suppose
this has been done in pursuance of a general
plan; but on the face of it, I think it is a
disgrace to tear down a building of such
substantial character, and relatively new,

which could have been converted into offices
or applied to some other useful purpose. I
just want to pass that remark, without insisting unduly on its significance. Recalling that
material is becoming scarcer and scarcer
every day, I think it is not irrelevant to
what the honourable senator from Ottawa
has said, and that we should hesitate a little
more before demolishing such substantial
structures, whatever the purpose may be.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
I have not studied the bill in its detail, nor
the situation particularly, but the content
of the measure seems to be satisfactory. No
doubt it has been very carefully considered.
I would like to pay a compliment to the sponsor of the bill on the honour which has
come to him in presenting this measure to
the house. As I heard him speaking, I could
not but think of Marc Antony when, in
telling the Roman people of the will of Julius
Caesar, he said:
It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.
This bequest of the late Mr. King is but
another of his generous acts, which were so
numerous; another of his public services,
which extended over so many years and
were of such great value to this country.

will arouse the sentiments of our people and
will be an inspiration to the national life
of Canada.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
I rise to ask a question and to make a suggestion. But first may I say that all members
of the Senate, I am sure, are happy to endorse
the statements made this afternoon about
the two gifts that have been bestowed upon
our nation.
In making my suggestion I do so as one
who on numerous occasions has had the
privilege of being a guest of the late Mr.
Mackenzie King at Kingsmere. As everyone
knows, Kingsmere was a great place of
retreat for the late prime minister. One has
only to visit there to realize the spiritual
quietude that he could obtain by walking
through the woods with no one around but
those who occupied the houses at Kingsmere.
The late Mr. King, in his will, used these
words:
Believing that my successors in the office of Prime
Minister may find, as I have found, a renewal of
strength in this quiet place, as well as exceptional
opportunities for conference on national and international affairs,-

With those words in mind, I make the suggestion that if the area is to become a park,
and be open to visitors, those whose responsibility it is to carry out the project should
leave sufficient land surrounding the home at
Kingsmere so that the Prime Minister, when
he chooses to leave the city of Ottawa, may
enjoy the quietude of which Mr. King spoke.
I would not have the temerity to suggest
the extent of the land to be reserved, but it
should be adequate to provide an atmosphere
of solitude.
I should like to ask the mover a question
about subsection 4 of section 2 of the bill,
which has to do with the demolition of buildings in Kingsmere Park. First, I draw his
attention to section 4 of the bill which uses
these words:
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Act,
the Minister of Public Works and the Federal
District Commission shall comply ...

and so forth. I am wondering why the
Federal District Commission is not given
some responsibility regarding the demolition
of buildings. If the area is to be part of the
National Capital, why does subsection 4 of
section 2 omit any mention of the Federal
District Commission?
I take it that the
demolition of buildings comes within the
jurisdiction of the commission in the planning of the National Capital, and it is with
that thought in mind that I ask the question.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I do not think that
anything has been definitely decided upon
with reference to the demolition of buildings
at the present time. The responsibility for

the maintenance of the Kingsmere property
is divided between the Department of Public
Works and the Federal District Commission.
The
officers
of the
commission
will
undoubtedly be responsible for the protection
of the property from public abuse. I believe
that the visitors in that area will be casual
persons who come there and travel through
the grounds in the summer time. At any time
when the prime minister of this country
feels like making use of "Moorecroft", the
summer house, or the present more permanent dwelling, as a place of residence
during the summer or fall, or even the winter,
he is quite free to do so. There is nothing
binding in the bequest at all. It is my understanding that when the Department of Public
Works attends to anything at Kingsmere
they will be such jobs as painting the house,
repairing a worn out floor or fixing a
verandah step.
Hon. Mr. Reid: But what about the demolition of buildings?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I will refer to that. I
think that the subsection of the bill to which
my friend referred has to do with some very
old cottages located on the right-hand side of
the road going down to Kingsmere Lake.
Those cottages are not now occupied to any
extent. They are of frame construction, with
latticework, which has a tendency to
deteriorate and be a fire hazard to this area
of virgin forest. The bill would give to the
proper authority the right to safeguard the
rest of the area by removing those buildings
when the proper time comes; but there is no
immediate suggestion of doing so.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators, it
is quite evident to me from the lack of
criticism that no one can possibly do otherwise than approve of the passage of these
two bills today. I appreciate as much as
anyone the generosity of the late Mr. King, in
giving these properties to the Dominion of
Canada, but this is not the time to pronounce
any eulogy upon him. That has been done
before by others much more capable than I.
As the senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) said, history will make a correct
appraisal of the merits, accomplishments and
patriotism of the late Mackenzie King.
Perhaps I knew Mr. King better than anyone else in this chamber, for he was born
in the riding which I had the honour to
represent in the House of Commons for more
years than I like to recall. He was elected
for North Waterloo in, I think, 1909. There
was an interval of time when one of the
friends of the leader opposite represented
the riding, after which I had the honour to
be its elected member and to continue as
such until I entered this chamber.

SENATE

The late Mr. King was born in what was
then the town of Berlin, where he remained
with his father and mother until he left to
attend university. He and I attended the
Berlin High School at the same time. Later
he had the honour of representing the same
riding as I did. I had the honour of serving
as you know, in his government, as did my
friend from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar).
I said that I did not wish to pronounce a
eulogy on Mr. King, but I should like to
make reference to his birthplace in North
Waterloo, in the town of Berlin. The strong
purpose which Mr. King always had in mind
was to preserve and promote the unity of
races in this country of ours. It occurs to me
now, although I have thought of it before,
that perhaps that strong purpose or desire of
his came largely firom his knowledge and
observation of the fact that in the very district in which he was born there were people
of foreign origin, and he knew their merits.
North Waterloo is the home of the descendants
of people who came from a country which has
been our enemy in two great wars-the
German people. I am not here to make any
apologies for them or to extol their virtues,
but I think Mr. King realized that he was
living amongst an ind'ustrious and, orderly
people who made the best kind of citizens in
Canada. I make this observation in the
hope that in time we may forget the enmities
that have been created among the nations of
the world, and in future may live together in
harmony as .good citizens in the country to
which we belong.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
(Translation):

Hon. Cyrille Vaillancourt: Honourable
senators, in closing this debate, I want to
add a few words in French. The bequest to
Canada of Laurier House and! of Kingsmere
Park gives expression once more to the
ardent wish of our lamented Mr. King to
promote the good will, peace and unity, which
are so necessary to the prosperity of the
nation.
In bequeathing to the country Laurier
House, which is located in the province of
Ontario, and Kingsmere, which is in the
province of Quebec, he illustrated this feeling
very aptly.
This action, to my mind, symbolizes what
his whole life ýstood for: union, harmony and
co-operation between the two great races of
Canada, the French-speaking Canadians and
the English-speaking Canadians.

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. A. MacKinnon moved the second
reading of Bill C-11, an Act respecting The
Canadian Pacifie Railway Company.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to enable the Canadian Pacifie
Railway Company to carry out the terms of
an agreement with Alberta Coal Company,
Limited, which provides for the purchase by
the railway company of fourteen miles of
railroad recently constructed by the coal
company.
The Canadian Pacific is incorporated by
Act of the Dominion Parliament, and of
course comes under the provisions of the
Dominion Railway Act. The Railway Act
requires that a railway company, before it
can purchase or lease the railway and undertaking of another company, must obtain the
approval of parliament. The object of the bill
is to accord this power to the railway
company.
Section 151 of the Railway Act specifies
that any such agreement must be approved at
an annual general meeting or a special general
meeting of the shareholders of the railway
company, called for the purpose of considering such agreement, where the holders of
at least two-thirds in value of the capital stock
of the company are present or represented by
proxy. It is practically impossible to ensure
the presence or representation by proxy of
shareholders representing two-thirds in value
of the capital stock. Under the circumstances,
the petitioner requests permission to have the
proposed transaction approved by two-thirds
of the votes of the shareholders present or
represented rather than two-thirds of the
value of the capital stock.
The line which the company will acquire,
if authorized by parliament, is a spur recently
constructed by Alberta Coal Company
Limited, which connects with the line of the
Canadian Pacifie at Halkirk, in the Province
of Alberta. The sole purpose of the spur is
to enable the coal company to get its coal
out by rail.
The agreement whereby the Canadian
Pacifie will acquire this spur is very much
in the interests of the coal company and of

THE SENATE AND ITS WORK
MOTION-DEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from May 16, 1951,
the adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. Robertson for the appointment of a
special committee to inquire into and report
upon how in its opinion the Senate may make
its maximum contribution to the welfare of
the Canadian people.
Hon. George H. Barbour: Honourable
senators, in the debate on this motion moved
by the honourable leader of the Senate (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) we have listened to a number
of able speeches. We have been told the
reason for setting up the Senate, or second
chamber of government, and that since confederation the Senate has carried out the
duties assigned to it both well and faithfully.
Since confederation this nation has been
led by two political parties, the Conservatives
and the Liberals. Surely they can be justly
proud of their achievements. If anyone
wants further proof of the work done by both
houses of parliament since confederation, I
would ask them to take a look at Canada.
Our country stretches from Newfoundland in
the east to Victoria in the west. Our lakes,
rivers and seas teem with fish, and our
forests are the greatest in the world. Our
water power is harnessed to provide electric
power and light, and our railways span the
continent. Our agriculture provides food
for the nation, and its surpluses go to other
continents. For a nation of 13 million people
our manufacturing industries represent an

wealth is great, and we have lived at peace
with our neighbours for more than one
hundred years.
Hon. Mr. Duff:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Barbour: Canada is the greatest
country in the world. Surely since confederation the House of Commons and the
Senate have given us good stable govermnent

at all times, and I believe that they will continue to give the Canadian people sound and
stable government in the future.
As a newcomer to this chamber, looking
around and seeing my colleagues on al sides,
not forgetting His Honour the Speaker, the
leader of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) and the leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig)-senators who have spent years
here-I feel that I am not qualified to make

called I read an article in the press crediting
the senator from Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon.
Mr. Isnor) with being in favour of an elected
Senate. After some four months the senator
from Halifax-Dartmouth, speaking in this
chamber, said in referring to what he had
said some months earlier-and I quote from
page 416 of Hansard:
I am ready to make what is called an open confession of doubt as to whether I was right in
advocating an elective Senate.

We always regard confessions as something
belonging to the finer acts in life. I was
reminded of a confession the senator from
Montague (Hon. Mr. Grant) told me about.
It seems that a man went to confession and
confessed among his other shortcomings that
he had stolen a short piece of rope. The
clergyman remarked that this was not a very
grievous sin, to which the man replied, "Yes,
but there was a cow on the other end of the
rope."
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: That was not the case
of the senator from Halifax-Dartmouth. He
made a complete confession.
Hon. Mr. Duff: He had the bull by the
tail.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: I think there are some
things which we as senators can do in the
places where we live during recess as well as
in this chamber during sessions of parliament. Inflation is a cloud over the nation
at the present time. The cause of inflation
is the international tension and the large
expenditures for war materials, which result
in high taxes. Manufacturing companies and
labour unions add their bit to inflation.
Statistics show that the average wage in
Canadian manufacturing rose from $42.68 on
February 1, 1950 to $47.28 on February 1,
1951, an increase of slightly more than
10.7 per cent. During the same period,
February 1, 1950 to February 1, 1951, the
average weekly hours worked increased by
less than one and one half per cent, and
the cost of living index rose by 8.4 per cent.

MAY 22, 1951
Higher wages without an increase in production bring about higher manufacturing
costs and lead to inflation.
The effect of high wages and short hours
is reflected in the high price of beef and the
growing scarcity of dairy products.
The Hon. the Speaker: I must call the
attention of the honourable senator to the
rule that the debate must be kept within the
limits of the motion before the house. The
motion is:
That a special committee of the Senate be
appointed to inquire into, and report upon, whatever action in its opinion may be necessary or expedient to enable the Senate to make its maximum
contribution to the welfare of the Canadian people.

I am wondering whether the honourable
senator's remarks come within the subjectmatter of this motion.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: Well, Mr. Speaker, I
understood the motion was intended to cause
us to consider how we as senators could make
our maximum contribution of service to the
welfare of the Canadian people, and it occurred to me that one of the ways in which we
might do this was by giving some thought to
inflation, which is one of the problems facing
this country. If I am out of order, of course
I will not proceed.
The Hon. the Speaker: I am sorry to be
obliged to tell the honourable senator that
unless he has leave of the Senate he cannot
continue to discuss the question of inflation
under the motion now before the house.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that the honourable gentleman be
allowed to proceed.
The Hon. the Speaker: If the honourable
senator has leave of the Senate, he may
proceed.
Sone Hon. Senators: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: I was speaking about
inflation and the things that have been causing it, and I had just referred to the effect
of high wages and short hours on the price
of beef and the growing scarcity of dairy
products.
For some time I have been alarmed at the
large number of calves being sold for veal
The Montreal Gazette of
in Montreal.
today, May 22, in its livestock reports from
the Federal Department of Agriculture, states
that Monday's receipts on the two local
markets consisted of 750 cattle, 100 sheep,
500 hogs and 900 calves. If our heifer calves
continue to be sold by the thousands we can
expect to have less and less dairy products,
and at higher prices. I am referring to this
as just another matter that leads to inflation.

A black spot in Canada is the continued
heavy death toll on our highways. This is
something that all senators could consider in
the next recess, and perhaps when we come
here another year we may be able to make
some helpful suggestions. We might, for
example, be able to suggest what class of
people are the principal offenders. It may
be that we are licensing people at too young
an age to drive cars. I have here some figures from the Canada Year Book for 1950,
showing deaths from motor vehicle accidents
in the varlous provinces in 1948. However,
perhaps it would be out of order to present
these figures at present.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: By way of reminding
the house of the heavy death toll on our
highways I would like to read these figures:

You will see honourable senators, that
Prince Edward Island is the safest province
in which to spend your vacation.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: In 1947-the last year
for which I could get the official records-the
number of motor vehicle accidents in Canada
was 74,738; the number of persons injured in
these accidents was 32,682, and the property
damage caused amounted to $10,468,939.
Those figures should cause us to give consideration to working out some means of
reducing the heavy toll that we are paying
in human lives and in money for highway
accidents.
Two or three days ago some other senators
and I were driving on Highway 16. When
we were about ten miles from Ottawa and
travelling at from 35 to 50 miles an hour we
were passed by a truck which was loaded with

SENATE

six new motor cars. We continued at a speed
up to 50 miles an hour, but the truck soon
got so far ahead of us that we lost sight of
it altogether. Surely the laws of Ontario do

not allow trucks with such a heavy load to
travel so fast. My opinion is that trucks are
responsible for a great many accidents.
An Hon. Senator: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: Honourable members, I
ask your indulgence for having strayed so
far from the subject-matter of the motion.
However, I think that the things I have

mentioned are disturbing this nation and, as
I said before, it seems to me that we might
be able to give some thought to them during
our recess.
Hon. Donald MacLennan:
Honourable
senators, I would rather go whale fishing at
any time than make a speech or endeavour
to make one, but I wish to say a few words
on the motion now before us. There is a
story-perhaps I have told it here beforethat once upon a time the President of Yale
University, having discovered that students
did not attend divine service in such numbers as was desirable, resorted to the expedient of getting very famous preachers to
occupy the pulpit. One of these was an
eminent gentleman from New Jersey, by the
name of Abbott, and before the service began
he asked the President, "How long am I
supposed to preach?" The President replied:
"You may speak as long as you wish, but

there is a tradition at Yale that no souls are
saved after the first twenty minutes." I do
not propose to take more than twenty minutes,

if I take that.
It will be eleven years on the 16th of this
month since I had the honour of being intro-

duced into the Senate.

In every year during

that time, without exception, one or other
of the senators got up and started to talk

about himself so, to my knowledge, we have
been talking about ourselves for the last
eleven years, and this year there has been a

spate of eloquence about ourselves. If, as we
are told, the world is in a very unsettled
condition,

and that consequently the Gov-

ernment of Canada is to spend some $5,000
million in the next few years for defence purposes, one would think that these subjects
would be sufficient to occupy the minds of the

senators. But it has become a tradition that
every year we talk about ourselves.
The honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson) introduced a resolution which the hon-

ourable lady member from Rockcliffe (Hon.
Mrs. Wilson) pronounced as an innocent
motion. Well, if it is innocent, it, nevertheless, has brought forth many speeches. The
honourable

leader

had scarcely

taken

his

seat in the Senate when he interviewed the

then Prime Minister, Mr. Mackenzie King,
about the reform of the Senate. That eminent statesman, to whom the leader opposite
has referred as a wise man, told our leader
to go ahead and reform the Senate. In effect,
he said: I promise you nothing, but I will
agree with you. You reform it. That was in
1945, and ever since then this subject has
weighed heavily on the mind of our leader.
The mountain laboured and gave forth a
mouse-this resolution.
Let us look at the set-up of the Senate as
described by our leader. In this connection
I should perhaps not refer to him as "our
leader", but as "the senator from Shelburne",
for he said he did not introduce the resolution as leader of the Senate or a member of
the government. Consequently, I must conclude that he introduced it as the senator
from Shelburne. His position reminds me of
a quotation which I read from history so
many years ago that I may not be able to
recount it accurately. It seems that one of
the early kings of England wanted to arrest
a cardinal. This cardinal also happened to
be the Bishop of York, and the king said
"I am not arresting you as cardinal, but as
the Bishop of York".
Sone Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: The leader of the
government has introduced this motion not
as a cardinal-the leader of the government
-but as the Bishop of York-the member
from Shelburne.
I shall refer to what the leader said about
the Senate; and if we believe him there is
little roorn for improvement in this house.
First, may I call your attention to the fact
that the burden of the speeches by the various
senators who talked about themselves was
that there was not sufficient work for the
Senate to do? In this session that subject
bas been alluded to only casually, but there
bas been added a new complaint, namely,
that there are not enough Tories in the
Senate. I say to my friends opposite: "Don't
let them pull your leg". It is remarkable
that two years ago every mother's son of us,
including myself, tried his very best to keep
the Tories out of the other house, and now
we are anxious to get thern into this bouse.
I come now to the words of the leader in
this house, and I am sure no one will deny
them. He said that to be a member of the
Senate
... gives one an opportunity to render outstanding
service to one's country, particularly at a time when
it is in need of outstanding service.
I suppose

that

their innate modesty

will

allow my friends to say "Amen" to that.
The leader continues:
May I say also that I have been delighted ta be
associated with the men and women who are mem-

another doctor, the late senator from Lauzon
(Hon. Mr. Paquet). These three outstanding
gentlemen are absent from the Senate these
days, but have honourable senators seen any
improvement in the work of the Senate? On
this basis I could reform the Senate in five
minutes by simply asking a few senators who
are over seventy-five to remain absent for a
week or two until we could determine how
it would affect the work of the Senate. I
think you would have to use a microscope to
find any improvement.
Sorne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: And what about
this idea of appointing Tories to the Senate?
I have absolutely nothing against Tories myself. I got along pretty well with them
during the seven elections in which I took
part-although I must say I got along with
thern best when I was defeating them.
Some Hon. Senators:

Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. MacLennan:
If this body is
going to be a semi-judicial institution, why
disturb the present set-up? Why should we
make this a partisan body? Somebody suggested that one-third of the mermbership of
the Senate should be made up of opposition
members. That may be all well and good,
but are senators supposed to be partisan
when they come here? If not, why are they
brought here?
Of all the proposed reforms that I have
listened to, there has only been one that I
thought ought to be considered. I refer to
the suggestion that a more equitable distribution of work should be made between the
Senate and the House of Commons. I think
this is desirable because heretofore, as I have
already said, every year the burden of our
complaint has been that we have not had
enough work to do. If we can get the power
to amend our own constitution it is possible
that this situation could be remedied. I for
one think that it would be. In the meantime I take the wise advice of the senator
frorn St. John's (Hon. Mr. Baird), to the
effect that we should forget this talk about
reforrn and attend to our business.
Most of the proposals that have been made
in this debate would bring about some
change, but not necessarily reform. Reform
connotes improvement, and nobody knows
whether some of the suggested changes
would lead to improvement or not.
I sometimes think that we in the Senate
are a little too proud to fight. Last November,
I suppose as a consequence of some of our

talk in the Senate, a lady-I use that term
simply to designate sex-went to the microphone and said that the Senate was costing
the people of Canada millions of dollars every
year, and that the attendance of members
was so small that twelve senators present
at a sitting was a crowd. She evidently did
not know that the Senate does not cost
several millions of dollars a year, nor that
the Senate could not function et all if there
were only twelve members present at a
sitting. But by now, especially after what
was said some weeks ago by the senator
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert), she must
know that what she said was false. If when
she spoke she did not know that her statements were untrue, there may possibly be
some excuse for her, although anyone who
speaks in public ought to make sure of his
or her facts. But if she did know what she
was spreading around the country was false,
then a dirty little word of three letters is
applicable. I hope she is not the woman
who, we are informed, is coming here. I
have received, as I suppose all senators have,
a notice from a "Radio Bureau". One paragraph of the notice reads:
We are told that the constitution of the Parliamentary Press Gallery does not provide for radio
correspondents.

Another one says this:

Mrs.

I wonder if that is the same person. Well,
if she cornes to my diggings she will get
very short shrift.
It is remarkable, honourable senators, that
many people who in a drawing room conduct
themselves as ladies and gentlemen will, as
soon as they get access to a magazine or
newspaper or microphone, become rude,
impudent and altogether insulting. It is
strange to me that they do not carry their
good manners to the press and to the microphone. Judging by the broadcast that Mrs.
Baldwin made last November, it would appear
that as soon as some people get in front of
a microphone they give loose rein to their
tongues and have little regard for accuracy
of statement. There is a gentleman who
brags about having been around Parliament
Hill for twenty years. Well, if he has been
around here that long the whole place should
be fumigated. He is troubled with oxyuris
fiolirum-I think the honourable senator
facing me (Hon. Mr. Lacasse), who is a doctor,
will understand what I mean by that. It is a
great pity that when this newspaper man takes
his pen in hand he does not stop chewing
green gooseberries. I am told by those who
know him best that the more that is said
about him, good or bad, the better he likes it.
Consequently, I will drop the subject.

General Conference of the International Labour
Organization at its 22nd session at Geneva on the
24th day of October, 1936, as modified by the Final
Articles Revision Convention, 1946, and that this
hou-e do approve of the same.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
the senator who is to speak to this motion
cannot be present until Tuesday next; therefore, I would ask that it be set down on
the order paper for that day.
INDIAN BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Thomas Reid moved the second reading of Bill 79, an Act respecting Indians.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
marks a forward step in legislation affecting
some 136,407 Indians living throughout the
various nine provinces of Canada. Before I
give a brief outline of some of the main
sections of the bill, perhaps I may be allowed
to review the legislation affecting Indians
from the time they were taken over in
Canada.

The first Indian legislation was passed in
the old Province of Canada in the year 1857,
some 94 years ago. It was referred to as an
Act for- the Civilization and Enfranchisement
of Indians. The Canadian Parliament later
This
passed its first Indian Act in 1869.
act was entitled "An Act for the Gradual
Between the
Enfranchisement of Indians."
years 1869 and 1880 this Act was amended
only twice, and the first general revision took
place in 1880. Since then there have been
only fourteen amendments, and the present
bill represents the first major attempt to
revise the Indian Act in seventy-one years.
For the first time in our history, Indians have
sat down with a minister of the government
to discuss legislation affecting them.
The problems of the Indians are rather
complex and not easy of solution. There are
great differences between Indians residing
in the nine various provinces. For instance,
the Indians of British Columbia differ greatly
from those of the prairies, of Ontario, of
Quebec or of the Maritimes. These differences
were apparent in the representations made by
the Indians in conrection with the present
bill. For instance, some tribes located in
British Columbia wanted no change whatever in the Act, but tribal representatives
from other provinces requested that the Act
be repealed, and asserted that the Indians,
were a sovereign power, had never been
defeated ii battle, and should have title to
the lands on which they lived. Spokesmen of
other Indian tribes requested many changes
in the law. Some of the changes asked for
were contentious, including questions relating to the liquor problem-a very troublesome one for the committee and the government. Other matters of considerable difficulty
included education, taxation of income, and

treaties had been made with the Indiians, the
reprcenations made to the government were
different from those prosented by Indians in
other provinces
whb
, it was claimed,
treaties had been signedi and violated.
Bill No. 79 is the culmination of a fiveyear effort. It began in 1946, when a special
joint committee of parliament, consisting of
members of the Senate and the House of
Commons, began its deliberations on Indian
affairs, which were continued in 1947 and
1948. In the first two years the committee's
recommendations related in the main to
administrative changes, and it was not until
the year 1948 that a special report was completed and presented to parliament. In its
final report the committee recommended that
the Indian Act should be revised when parliament assembled in 1949. This suggestion
would have been implemented at that time,
but because a general election intervened the

MAY 23, 1951
revision was postponed until 1950. When
Bill 267 was introduced in that year there
was considerable objection to it. The correspondence between the Indians, certain
organizations and the minister was very
voluminous, and so it was deemed inadvisable to proceed with the measure.
Between 1950 and the introduction of the
bill now before the house, the honourable
the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration
visited many Indian reserves throughout
Canada and discussed with the Indians their
many complaints and suggestions. He went
further. Before the bill was introduced to
parliament he called to Ottawa for consultation a representative group of Indians from
all the provinces. This group consisted of
eighteen Indians and one man described as
a "white man". This delegation was augmented by seventeen other Indians who came
along to give their support.
It is worthy of note that at the conferences held between the minister and the
Indians, the minister read each and every
clause of the proposed bill. It is also noteworthy that out of the 124 sections contained
in the bill, 103 were unanimously supported.
There was opposition to fifteen sections, but
only six of these were opposed by a majority
of the delegattes, and only two were disapproved unanimously. Under the old Indian
Act the minister had power to take action
under seventy-eight of the sections. In the
bill presented last year this number was
red-uced to fifty-eight. Under the present
bill the number of sections giving powers to
the minister have been reduced, to twentysix, representing quite a curtailment of the
powers he enjoyed under the old Act. As
already mentioned, the bill before us is the
culmination of five years of study and effort,
and directly affects 136,407 Indians in nine
of the provinces of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I interrupt to ask a
question at this time? Do I understand that
there are no Indians in Newfoundland?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Newfoundland adopted a
policy which the other nine provinces might
have been well advised to adopt: the Indians
there are looked upon as Newfoundlanders.
Although there are in Newfoundland some
500 men who belong to the Micmac Tribe,
they are regarded as Newfoundlanders and
Canadians.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That is why I said that the
bill affects 136,407 Indians in nine provinces.
At the present time the Indians in Newfoundland do not come under the administration
of the Indian Act.

Honourable senators, it is my intention to
deal briefly with only a few of the important
sections of the bill, because at the close of
my remarks today I shall move to refer
the bill to committee. One of the important sections is the one dealing with the definition of an Indian. The bill sets out specifically the requirements for determining who
is or who is not entitled to be registered as
such. It will be noted that quarter-bloodsdefined in the bill as persons whose mother
and father's mother are not entitled to be
registered, and born of a marriage entered
into after the coming into force of the new
Act-shall not be entitled to be registered,
as it is thought that persons who have
only a small proportion of Indian blood in
their veins should not be given the legal
status of an Indian. The children affected,
however, may remain on the reserve until
the age of twenty-one. This will not in any
way alter the status of persons who are now
recognized members of bands, and will not,
in any event, become operative for about
half a century, as two generations by consecutive marriages to non-Indians would be
involved.
Sections 18-41 deal with Indian reserves
and surrenders, and .they have been simplified and clarified. New procedures have been
provided to meet problems of administering
reserves and surrendered lands. Provision
is made for the setting up of a reserve land
register, in which shall be registered certificates of possession and occupation. This
provision is set out in section 21 of the bill.
The restrictions on the sale or barter by
Indians, without permission, of produce from
reserves in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and
Alberta, have been liberalized by providing
that the minister may exempt any band
from the necessity of obtaining a permit
before produce may be sold.
The provision in the present Act for the
involuntary removal of Indians from a
reserve adjacent to or within a municipality
having a population of not less than 8,000,
has not been carried forward into the bill.
The minister, in moving second reading of
the bill in the House of Commons on March
16, indicated that it was considered that such
a provision was "discriminatory and should
have no place in the legislation of Canada".
Sections 42 to 52 deal with the descent of
property, wills and intestacy. The provisions
for the administration of estates have been
completely revised and brought more into
line with established practice in the
provinces.
Sections 53 to 60 deal with the management of -reserves and surrendered lands. In
keeping with the recommendation of the

SENATE
Special Joint Committee of the Senate and
House of Commons on Indian Affairs, provision is made for granting greater responsibility and authority to the bands-through
their band councils-in the conduct and
management of their reserves.
Sections 61 to 68 deal with the management of Indian moneys. The present sections
of the Act dealing with the management of
Indian moneys have been simplified and
broadened, after consultation with financial
advisers, and greater scope has been given to
the Indians, through their band councils,
with respect to the expenditure of band
funds.
Section 69 deals with loans to Indians. As
in the present Act, provision is made for
loans to bands, groups of Indians or individual Indians, for the purpose of purchasing
farm machinery, livestock, fishing equipment, seed grain and so forth; and new
purposes have been added, namely, the purchase of motor vehicles, fencing materials
and other equipment, gas and oil, repairs
and wages. This is designed to encourage
and assist Ind'ians in utilizing the resources
of the reserves by establishing revenueproducing projects.
Sections 72 to 85 have to do with the
elections and powers of band councils. The
election provisions have been revised to
provide .uniform methods and procedure for
elections, and are designed to meet present
and future requirements of Indian communities. The right to vote in band elections and
other votes under the Act has been extended
to all members of the band who are twentyone years of age and over, and who are not
otherwise disqualified. Formerly only males
could vote. Secrecy of voting has been provided for. Those bands who are not under
the elective system may choose their chief
and councillors according to band custom,
as under the present Act. The powers of the
council are broadened to bring them more
into line with those ordinarily exercised by
municipal authorities, in order that the
Indians may become more self-reliant and
have greater power of governing themselves
and the reserves upon which they reside.
One of the most contentious questions
raised by the Indians is that of taxation. This
is covered by section 86. The exemption
from taxation and legal process of real and
personal property held by Indians on
reserves has been retained and is more
clearly stated. This is subject, however, to
the provision that the exemption on personal
property shall not apply to Indians-other
than veterans of World War I and World
War II, and their wives-who execute a
waiver of exemption from taxation pursuant

to the Dominion Elections Act, 1938, as
amended in 1950. In my opinion the only
Indians who really had a laim to tax exemption under the present Act were the ones of
British Columbia. I say that because when
the British crown colony of British Columbia
signed the agreement to come into confederation -it was specifically stipulated on behalf
of the colony that the Indians of British
Columbia were to be treated as liberally by
the dominon as they had been by the colony,
and the Indians contend that at that time
they were not subject to taxation.
The legal rights of the Indians are dealt
with in sections 87 to 89 of the bill. Provincial laws of general application are made
applicable to Indians; subject, however, to
the terms of any treaty, the Indian Act, and
any other Act of the Parliament of Canada.
As in the present Act, Indian real and
personal property held on a reserve is not
subject to seizure or hypothecation of any
kind, except on suit by another Indian.
Intoxicants are dealt with in sections 93
to 98. Senators who were members of the
joint committee will remember how very
contentious the liquor question was when
we were discussing Indian problems. The
sections dealing with intoxicants have been
rearranged and modified to suit present-day
conditions. From early times the use of
intoxicating liquor by Indians and the supplying of it to them has been prohibited. In the
bill there has been a departure from complete
prohibition, and an Indian may purchase and
consume intoxicants upon licensed premises
where such consumption is lawful under the
laws of the province; subject, however, to
request by the Lieutenant Governor in
Council of the province concerned and
proclamation by the Governor in Council.
As in the present Act, the sale, manufacture
and possession of liquor on Indian reserves
will still be prohibited, and Indians will not
be allowed to possess package goods, whether
on or off reserves.
Another important and contentious question, enfranchisement, is dealt with in sections
108 to 112. Under the present Act, Indians
who wish to be removed from the provisions
of the Act may obtain that result by
enfranchisement on their own application.
The enfranchisement sections of the bill have
been revised for the purpose of facilitating
enfranchisement of Indians. As under the
present Act, provision is made for enfranchising individuals and entire bands, and there
is a new provision which would allow the
department to enter into arrangements with
any province or municipality to furnish such

financial assistance as may be necessary to
implement the wishes of a band applying

MAY 23, 1951
for enfranchisement. Provision for enfranchisement without consent in certain circumstances has been continued.
May I take just a minute to say that I am
one of those who contend that it is high time
we gave the franchise to all Indians. It may
interest honourable senators to know that
British Columbia has shown leadership in
this respect, in giving the vote to Indians, and
that at the present time one of the electoral
districts on the coast is represented in the
legislature by a full-blooded Indian. I have
long contended that once we give the vote
to Indians every candidate for election to
public office-to a school board, municipal
council, provincial legislature or to parliament-especially if running in a district
which embraces an Indian reserve, will seek
to get as many Indian votes as possible, and
therefore will pay more attention to the life
and welfare of the Indians.
When that
reform comes about the Indians will no doubt
have a voice in parliament, and I feel that
they will then receive far more considerate
treatment than they have had in the past.
As I said at the beginning, I am touching
only upon certain sections of the bill, those
that I believe will be of special interest to
members of the Senate. The next sections
that I wish to mention are 113 to 122, which
deal with schools.
The provisions with
respect to the education of Indians have been
revised and amplified to meet new requirements and needs. Provision is made for the
establishment of schools for children of
Indians working and living off reserves, and
the entering into agreements with provinces
and territories, local school boards, and
religious and charitable institutions, to provide for the education of Indian children in
association with other children. And as in
the present Act, the rights of religious minorities have been provided for.
May I again express a personal opinion?
This strikes me as an important step towards
making the Indians into, shall I say, true
Canadians. In British Columbia we had a
striking example of the good results of nonsegregation of children. People of many
races came to live in our province, -and their
children attended the public schools and
grew up as Canadians. That policy tended to
unity and to the making of better citizens.
I am one of those who believe that when
you send children to separate schools you
cause a division that remains, to at least
some degree, even after the children have
grown up, and that this is not a good thing
for a country. I realize that there are people
who hold a different view, but I am frank to
say that that is how I feel about the matter.
In British Columbia there are a thousand

Indian children attending public schools,
running around and playing with other
children, and I say that that makes for
unity. In my opinion, any other system
makes for disunity.
Hon. Mr. Euler:
Does my honourable
friend apply that to the Japanese children
born in Canada?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I know my honourable
friend would be the last to dispute the fact
that many of the Japanese were good citizens.
In answer to his question, I say that I would
apply that policy to many children born in
this country of Jaipanese parents.
Hon. Mr. McIntyre: Does the honourable
gentleman know if the federal government
pays $20 for each Indian pupil going to
school in British Columbia?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I am not clear on that, but
an answer can be obtained when the bill
goes to committee.
Hon. Mr. McIntyre: That sum is paid for
each Indian pupil in Prince Edward Island.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I should imagine that the
Indians of British Columbia are treated as
liberally as those of Prince Edward Island,
but in any event I shall see that the question
is answered in committee.
I have touched on the sections which I
think are of greatest interest to honourable
members. The bill contains 124 operative
sections, and an additional section providing
that the Act shall come into force on a day
fixed by proclamation.
Honourable senators, in conclusion I wish
to make a few general remarks. The Indian
has been a problem ever since Canada was
taken over by the French, and later by the
British. We now realize that segregation
was a mistake. But of course hindsight is
much better than foresight, and one must
remember that conditions in Canada one
hundred years or more ago were vastly different from those of today. The placing of
Indians on reservations might have looked
like a good solution in those far-off times,
but it was a mistake; and like most mistakes,
it cannot be readily remedied over night.
To my mind the Indians are little different
from other human beings, and they are acting
in very much the saie way the rest of us
would act if we were to be made wards
of the state, treated like .children or worse,
and placed in compounds or reservations,
separate and apart from all others. After all,
it should not be forgotten that they were
here first. Something similar to the view of
affairs taken by many Indians is today
evident in the refugee camps of Europe,
where one of the problems of the welfare
organizations of the United Nations has been

SENATE
the great n'umbers who, after having been
fed and clothed and their general wants
looked after, refuse to leave these camps
and assume some responsibility for their
own welfare.
The granting of the full franchise to our
Indian population will in time no doubt bring
about a further betterment in their condition, but I do not believe its full extent will
be realized for at least another generation.
The mistake committed by us in segregating
the Indians on the various reservations and
treating them as children or something
inferior had, however, one redeeming feature:
it protected them against exploitation and
prevented them from being robbed of their
land-as happened in the United States-by
the ruthless adventurers of that day. The
United States chose to survey certain portions of land for the Indians, and to allow
them to dispose of it as they wished. It was
not long before ruthless real estate agents
had taken the liand from the Indians, who
soon were sitting destitute on the doorstep
of the government. So, what at this time may
appear to have been a mistake was of some
good, in that it prevented the Indians of
Canada from exploitation.
May I at this point su:ggest that the various
provinces be encouraged to assume responsibility for the Indian population within their
boundaries. and that the federal government
should undertake to make the necessary provision to allow the provinces to do so. British
Columbia is, I believe, the first province to
show leadership in this field, in authorizing
and setting-up by statute a provincial
advisory committee on Indian affairs. The
provinces are well equipped to look after
the health, welfare, education and other
interests of Indians in the various localities.
I suggested in the -committee, and I repeat
now, that the federal government should
give some thought to .co-operating with those
provinces which are willing to assume
responsibility for the Indians. As I say,
British Columbia is willing to take over and
look after the Indians, as it did when it
was a Crown colony.
I have one more thought that I think I
should express. There is a great deal of
commendation and credit due to the Honourable Minister of Citizenship and Immigration
for the work he has done.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I dou'bt if we have ever had
a minister who was so sympathetic towards
the Indians, or who has given as much time
and thought to their welfare as has the
Honourable Mr. Harris. I take this opportunity of complimenting him highly, and in
doing so I am sure I voice the sentiments of
all members of the Senate.

Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
I should like first of all to congratulate the
honourable senator from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid) on his able presentation of
this measure. Bill 79 is really a treaty with
the Indians, and as such will become part
of the record of the transactions between
those early occupants of this country and
ourselves.
Speaking more particularly for the central
West, I may say that for two long centuries
before confederation the Company of Gentlemen Adventurers trading in the region of
Hudson's Bay had control of that vast
territory. Then in 1869, just two years after
confederation, an agreement was concluded
by which they gave up their charter to the
Imperial G'overnment; and in 1870, by Royal
Proclamation, the country between Ontario
and British Columbia became part of the
Dominion of Canada.
In that vast region stretching 900 miles
westward from Winnipeg there were a
number of half-breed settlements, a few
white settlers and some white traders around
the Hudson's Bay forts; also, there were
some very brave and heroic christian
missionaries, plus some 30,000 Indians, living
a wild nomadic life and frequently engaging
in tribal warfare. There was, unfortunately,
also an overflow of lawless men from the
south, who repeated amongst these primitive
people the exploitations which made Montana
infamous. These lawless men would trade a
small rusty tin cup of whiskey for a good
buffalo robe. When trading of this character
had gone on for some time, the drink-crazed
Indians would commit almost any crime.
There was no law enforcement, and consewere
quently debauchery and murder
common. This culminated in the Cypress
Hills massacre, which so shocked the people
of the Dominion of Canada that some 300
young men were recruited in the East and
went to the West. They were the originals
of the Northwest Mounted Police. They
made an amazing march across the continent
to the foothills of the Rockies, and there
made a great record for themselves in the
enforcement of law and order and the protection of the lives and property of the
people who lived there.
When this great territory became part of
the dominion, many problems presented
themselves to the government. First, they
had to secure title of the property from the
Indians. They also had to survey the land
and establish some means of communication,
and most important of all, they had to
establish a rule of law in that district where
savages had roamed for so long.

MAY 23, 1951
Several of these problems had to be deait
with at once. There were, for instance, a
good many squatters on the land in that
country, and the government made it known
that bona fide settiers would have their rights
respected. There are stili squatters on the
lands of Western Canada, and their rights
are stili being respected. There was also the
half-breed population, and because of their
relationship to the Indians, it was feit that
something should be done for them, so about
1,400,000 acres of land was set aside for
their use. Unfortunately, scrip was issued;
each scrip being good for 160 acres of land,
and a settier could lo-cate on any section
that was opened up for settiement. As this
scrip was transferable, it became at once
a subject of speculation. These half-breeds,
either because of their bad habits or-at
times-their dire poverty, would exchange
the scrip for liquor or for trinkets or general
supplies which were of very littie value. So
although the government from time to time
set aside additional lands for the half-breeds,
they got very littie out of it, but trading in
the scrip was the foundation of some great
fortunes.
It was necessary to deal with the Indians
in a very different way. The tribes roaming
in any district were regarded as having the
Indian rîght or the Indian title for that district.
Consequently the officers of the
Crown had to deal separately with the tribes
in -these various districts, and they did so, by
making a number of treaties,-eight in ail.
The first two resulted in the turning over to
the Crown 0f a large part of Manitoba; by the
third, a part of Saskatchewan was disposed of;
by the fourth, a district around Lake Winnipeg; later, northern Saskatchewan and
southern Alberta were included; and in 1899
the final treaty was made, relating to the Peace
River country. The ternis of these treaties
were flot all alike, although the records seem
to be a littie indefinite on the exact provisions
they contained. Speaking generally, it may
be said that apart fromn the reserves the
Indians turned over to the governmýent the
titie to, the great areas which they had
occupied for ages, and promised to keep the
ternis of the treaties and to obey Canadian
laws. Fire-water was not to be sold on the
reserves. In return for these concessions,
each Indian was given an initial payment of
$12, and it was provided that each man,
woman and child on the reserves would
receive an annuity of $5 "as long as the sun
shines, the winds blow, and the streams run
down to, the sea". The chief of each tribe
was allowed $25 annually, and each of the
councillors or head men got $15 a year. Also,
each of these ranking officers received a suit
of clothes every three years. Schools were
80713-31

to be established, and an annual grant made
for ammunition, fish-nets, twine and things
of that kind. But the chief thing that the
Indians received was the reservation of land
for each tribe, on the basis of 640 acres for
each famlly of the tribe. Also, once and for
all the government agreed to give the Indians
f arm implements, cattie and horses.. It was
flot then contemplated that these supplies
would be repeated; but since then, of -course,
they have been renewed at different times.
The officers of the Crown had to be
extremely tactful in making these treaties,
because the Indians were apprehensive. They
were alarmed at the sight of surveyors
engaged in dividing up their territory into
townships, sections and s0 on, and they did
not want to have trains disturbing the solitude which had been theirs for so, long.
Treaty No. 7 was signed on September 22,
1877 with great pomp and dignity. Thousands
of Indians gathered at the Blackfoot crossing
in southern Alberta. Each tribe was assigned
a special place on a meadow, where they
erectecl their brightly-painted tents, and
danced and sang, and the children cried and
laughed, and the dogs barked and the merchants hawked their goodis, while on the
distant hiils the sbaggy buffalo, could be seen
grazing. About eighty Mounted Police were
there, brilliantly dressed in their uniforms of
scarlet and gold.
That was the situation when the Queen's
representatives came to make the treaty. But
progress was very slow. The chiefs got into
a huddle time and time again, and could not
agree; day after day passed without any
progress being made. At last the chief of
-chiefs, Crowfoot, announced his intention to
mark his "X" on the paper, and hils exýample
was quickly followed by the other fifty-two
chief s. "I will be the first to sign", hie said,
"and I will be the last to break my bond".
This chief, who was really a great man, was
then at the height of his career. His was an
imposing presence. Like Saul of old, he stood
head and shoulders above his people and
he was a great leader. We all recail how in
the darkest days of the war Winston Churchill
stîrred the very souls of the people by
saying, "We shafl fight on the beaches, we
shahl fight on the landing grounds, we shal
fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall
fight in the hiils; we shall neyer surrender".
Crowfoot, away back in those days, when
faced with similar circumstances,
said
"'Though our enemies be as strong as the sun
and as numerous as the stars of heaven, yet
wiil we defend our laws". He and his like
were among the striking men who emerged
from those very primitive conditions.

SENATE
The transfer of this property from the
Indians to the white people came about with
very little in the way of clashes or bloodshed. It is true that some three thousand
Sioux Indians, under Chief Sitting Bull came
from the northern States into Canada and
offered the Canadian Indians blankets and
ponies and other things if they would join
thern in wiping out our Mounted Police, and
then cross the border and help them to
But
exterminate the American forces.
Crowfoot's advice prevailed. He wished to
remain loyal to the reigning monarch, Queen
Victoria, and he persuaded his warriors not
to join the Sioux. He liked the Mounted
Police. He said, "They come to protect us,
as feathers protect the birds from the frosts
of winter." Later, Louis Riel drew up a bill
of rights-and a very good bill of rights it
was-and sent it to Ottawa: as it did not get
attention there as quickly as he thought it
should, he staged the Rebellion of 1?85. But
apart from that outbreak, all the transfers
were made peacefully.
Since then, the government and the people
of Canada have realized that the land thus
transferred to them was worth much more
than they paid for it. It has proved a great
boon to our people. On the other hand, we
on our part have given the Indians much
more than was provided for in the treaties.
For instance, agricultural units operated by
qualified officers have been established on
the reserves; much has been done to promote
the education and the health of the Indians,
and Indian mothers, of course, get the family
allowance. Assistance has also been given
to build up the funds of the Indian bands.
For instance, the Blackfoot Indians, finding
that they did not need 640 acres for each
family of five, in 1910 sold 115,000 acres for
$1,600,000. This money was earmarked as
follows: $50,000 for horses, cattle and feed;
$350,000 for homes, roads, fences on the
reserves, and things of that kind; the interest
on the balance to be applied to the maintenance of old and infirm Indians.
So today we have this treaty, which will
be added to the others on the records.
As the honourable member for New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) explained, it
seems certain that this treaty was thought
Dut with great care. We in Canada have
perhaps the highest standard of living of any
country in the world exýcept the United
States, and when this bill is put into operation it will be a recognition of our debt to
the Indians. It will give them an opportunity to improve their standard of living
and to become a part of the Canadian community. In that way they will enjoy the

benefits of our laws and assume some of the
responsibilities of Canadian citizenship.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. A. Buchanan: Honourable senators, I am not going to attempt to discuss the
provisions of this bill, because they have
already been adequately explained by the
honourable senator from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid); but may I say that as a
fellow senator from Alberta I am proud of
the eloquence of my colleague from Medicine
Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw).
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: I am proud also of
the wide knowledge he possesses of our
Indian tribes in Western Canada.
In rising this afternoon it is not my purpose to try and enlighten the house with
respect to our Indians; my purpose is to try
to impress upon my colleagues the possibilities that exist amongst our Indian citizens
if they are given the opportunities which
this Act, among other things, can provide.
My memory goes back a long time to a
night in the City of Toronto when, as a
newspaper reporter, I was assigned to cover
a meeting in Massey Hall. Booker T. Washington, famous American negro, was the
principal speaker, and assembled with him
on the platform were some very distinguished
men. The most striking memory of that
evening is that these men, eminent in their
particular fields, represented different colours
and races. I remember that at the conclusion
of the address by Booker T. Washington a
prominent Canadian Indian moved the vote
of thanks: I suppose most members of the
Senate are familiar with his nameOronhyatekha. He was a graduate in medicine, and at that time was the head of a
fraternal order which I think is still in
The motion of thanks was
existence.
seconded by a negro by the name of
Hubbard, who at that time was a member
of the Toronto Board of Control. That
meeting left a lasting impression on me,
because it gave evidence of the equality of
the races in Canada, and the equality of
opportunity for all colours and races that
should exist everywhere t'hroughout our
dominion.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: That is the thought I
am trying to impress upon honourable senators in dealing with this measure today.
I have known the Indians of Alberta for a
long time and I have noted their advancement. Although not rapid, it has been steady.
The Blood Indian Reserve, one of the largest

MAY 23, 1951
Indian reserves I suppose in al Canada, is
located close to my city. While ail Indians
are not competent farmers there are some
who have been very successful. I remember
only a few years ago reading about the
estate of an Indian living on a reserve
amounting to over $100,000. How was he
able to amass that amount of money? It was
because he was successful in the raising of
livestock. That is an illustration of the possibilities that exist for Indians. There is being
cultivated today on the Blood Indian Reserve
the largest area of wheat land in al of
Canada. I admit that it is not being cultivated by the Indians, but the example is
being set for them, and after a certain period
of time they will take over this land and
carry on its cultivation. In the meanwhile
the Indians are receiving a considerable
share from the proceeds of the crops that
are raised there.
May I say something else about the Indian
tribes in the West, and particularly about
those with which I am most intimately
acquainted? Our Indians answered Canada's
call to arms in the first two World Wars,
and they are enlisting now as a result of our
country's most recent call to arms. In both
World Wars some of our Indians attained
the rank of commissioned officers, showing
that they possessed qualities of leadership,
bravery and initiative. This also is an illustration of their deep devotion to Canada and
appreciation of what this country has endeavoured to do for them throughout the years.
In August of this year His Excellency,
Viscount Alexander, will visit Southern
Alberta to be made an honorary chief of the
Blood Tribe of Indians. I am afraid that
honorary chiefships are being distributed
almost as freely these days as honorary
university degrees, although I must confess
that I myself have been honoured by receiving one of them.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: The honorary chiefs
of the Blood Tribe have been brought
together to form an organization to co-operate with the Indians and assist them in solving their many problems. If necessary, this
organization will bring these problems to the
attention of the appropriate departments in
Ottawa. More than that, the honorary chiefs
propose to create scholarships to enable our
Indian students to move into higher institutions of learning, and to provide equipment
for manual training and domestic science
training in their existing schools. I know
this evidence of good will on the part of
those who have been made honorary chiefs
is bringing a striking response from the
Indians themselves.
80713-31J

In the past, I am afraid, we have looked
down upon these descendants of the original
settlers of Canada; but from this time forward we must regard them differently. If
we help to develop their latent possibilities,
the Indians can become full-fledged and
useful citizens of this country; and that
should be the aim of all legislation such as
we now have before us. It seems to me that
if in any case they have moved backwardand in some cases they have-the fault is
not theirs, but ours, for whatever weaknesses
they may have are due almost wholly to the
bad example set them through the years by
their white neighbours.
I rose, inspired principally with this
thought: Today we find nations divided on
the questions of race and colour. I do hope
that in Canada our minds and our legislation
will be broad enough to treat the Indians as
fellow citizens, and that we shall not be
satisfied until we have ensured ta them the
same opportunities as are accorded to the
rest of us. I believe they have potentialities
that are not generally recognized, potentialities that could bring some of them to be
leaders amongst us. When I read lists of
successful students in university examinations I do not find exclusively Anglo-Saxon
names; I find as well names that have been
brought here from Central and Northern
Europe, from Asia and elsewhere. Some of
the most brilliant students in our schools, at
least in my city, are those of the Japanese
and Chinese races. Now, in considering the
bill before us today we are thinking in terms
of people who are native to this country,
whose ancestors were here long before our
own came. We are trying to do something
to help them, to promote their welfare. It
is a good cause, and I am entirely in sympathy
with it. And I trust that from now on we
shall keep in mind the broader aspect of
equality for people of all races who come
here to live and who obey our laws and try
to be good citizens of Canada.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
(Translation):
Hon. Aristide Blais: Honourable senators,
if I take the liberty of expressing myself in
French on this occasion, it is because French
is the first foreign language whieh the
Indians heard in this country.
The bill of which the senator from New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) and the senator
from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw) have
spoken is the result of the discussions which
took place between the Minister of Indian
Affairs, the special parliamentary committee
on Indians, and the delegates of the various
Indian tribes which were invited to Ottawa
to attend these discussions and to make

SENATE

representations. 1 do flot intend to go into
the details of the measure for our colleagues
have just done so.
The Indian Act was closely examined and
a new Act, so to speak, bas been substituted
to the first one which had given rise to such
severe criticism and to reforms of ail kinds.
It is needless for me to attempt to discuss
the bil in detail. Those of my colleagues who
spoke before me have deait with ail the
angles of the measure.
If I rise to spoak today, it is because I
want to take advantýage of this opportunity
to express rny bappiness and my satisfaction
at the efforts made during the last few years
to iirove
the lot of our Indian brothers
and t0 prepare them to enjoy later on all
privileges whjch are the right of any Canadian citizen.
How times have charged in the last fifty
years, but how slow we have been to look
into the sufloring of a people whom civilization and, it must ho admitted, even the lust
for "oI, have pusheci back, like the prairie
buffalo, into the reserves where they did
not faro so \vell. However, thanks to God
and to a better administration this is no
longer the case, and today the Indians are

treated with the consideration which is due
to every citizen.

Little by little, as they take

advantage of the educational facilities which
are increasing in their midst, the Indians xviii
corne to hold an enviable place in our
community. Several of them have already
reached the top of varlous professions and
in the field of domestic arts. Before long,
because they are talented and assimilate
knowledge easily, they will become our
serious rivais.
Our friend from Margaree-Forks (Hon. Mr.
MacLeninan) tolci us yesterday that senators
had the unfortunate habit of taiking about
themselves more often than they should. I
admit that it is unxvise and often in bad
taste to do so but, as a matter of fact, are
we not always speaking of ourselves, even
when we seemn to ho dealing with other
matters?
Personally, I arn forced to draw upon
memories of fifty years ago when I speak
of a people I have always loved 'because of
its native ease, its love of freedom, its kindnoss and its gratitude for the slightest good
turn.
My very first patients at St. Albert were
Indians and, from the start, we were good
friends. I arn one of the few doctors wbo
have been called in to attend an Indian
woman at child-birth and I arn very proud
of it. Ordinarily, the mid-wife-thanks to
the gymnastics to which she subi ected her

patient, and which often included a short
ride on horseback-was most successful even
when the delivery was expected to be
difficult. It was only when the mid-wife had
exhausted ail ber means and the patient was
no longer in -condition to belp herself,
that the doctor xvas called in.
The city of Edmonton is surrounded with
Indian reservations ahl situated near attractive lakes and small streams and where
hunting and fishing gave plentiful yield in
the biessed years of 1900 and 1901. These
lakes had not yet been spoilt, I might say,
by civilization, and it was a fine sight to see

In 1902 the Exhibition xvas held below the
town, near the Saskatchewan River. Indians
camped nearby and I noticeci that there
stood arnong the tents a very large one which
seemed to ho u'sec by the chieftains for their

pow-wow.
Before 1900 Indians usually diverted themselves with games and dances; arnong the
latter boing the "sun dance" which was a
great attraction. Due to certain abuses, il had
been forbidden some years before my arrivai.
I was acquainted with a half-breed, a Mrs.
Page, to whomn I had rendered some services.
One afternoon she bold me that in a few
moments, a "sun dance" wouid take place
in the big tent-in camera however-to
bonour the ýchicftains before a big pow-wow
which was to be heid shortly. Ail tbis was
to take place in the greatest secrecy. She
said: "If yýou care to ho present, I wiil mInroduce you to the Chief and will recommend
you as a doctor to the Indians". I accepîed
wiîb pleasure.
Inside the lent, Indian
women were seated in a circle behind the
chief s, wbo were conversing among Ihemselves. After having been duiy introduced
and recommended by Mrs. Page, my presence

MAY 23, 1951
did not seem to bother them in the least.
Suddenly, I saw emerging from an adjacent
tent a crowd of young Indians, all painted
in showy colours and very lightly clad.
Instantly they started dancing furiously, with
alternating voice and foot accompaniment,
and gestures addressed to the chiefs. After
each dance, young Indian girls threw on the
ground presents which consisted of necklaces
or embroidered belts. This went on, until
one by one the dancers became completely
exhausted. They were dripping with perspiration and the paint which covered them
made a sort of multicoloured coat.
The Big Chief, who had precedence over
the others and who presided at the meeting,
then rose with dignity and welcomed all the
other chiefs, and the pipe of peace passed
from one to the other until everyone had
had a good smoke.
Then the floor was given to each one of
the tribal chiefs, who rose in turn to thank
the Big Chief and to honour him.
Among those tribal chiefs there was one
by the name of Alexander, whom I will long
remember.
He came from the Calihoo
Reserve: a man of about fifty, well set and
determined looking. He rose and drew an
idyllic picture of times gone past, when their
forefathers were free to roam the plains,
hunting buffalo, fishing in the rivers and
pitching their tents wherever they pleased.
The tribes moved with the seasons. Those
were the happy days. But the white man
appeared and gradually drove the Indians
from their territory until they were confined
to the reserves chosen beforehand by the
government. They had no choice but to
submit to the conditions imposed upon them,
and thereafter a sad life started for them,
deprived as they were of all freedom, often
lacking care and proper food, and increasingly exposed to disease. All this he said
eloquently and sometimes with the violence
which comes of a deep feeling.
This speech having been interpreted for
me by Mrs. Page, I was strongly impressed.
I understood that all was not well on Indian
reservations and that some clauses of the
treaties were not always respected.
If I have mentioned the gist of the Chief's
speech it is to show that conditions were far
from satisfactory for the Indians in those
days.
How times have changed! Due to progress, and due also to a healthier administration and to more frequent visits from officials of the Indian Affairs Branch, conditions
have greatly improved in later years. I

should mention as well the religious institutions which have built convents, schools and
even hospitals, along the Mackenzie and in
certain reservations, from Chippeyan to Aklavik. There you will find teaching and religious orders who have devoted themselves
for the last hundred years to the education
and care of Indians. All this is done with the
patience, the self-denial and the charity
which characterizes all those orders. I cannot praise too highly those apostles who,
without any remuneration, we might say,
lead a hard and often dangerous life for the
Indian's benefit.
Already a huge step has been made. I
trust that in time to come a revision of this
treaty may be made so that our Indians may
benefit from living conditions which vary
from day to day.

CANADIAN COMMERCIAL
CORPORATION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Gordon B. Isnor moved the second
reading of Bill 284, an Act to amend the
Canadian Commercial Corporation Act.
He said: Honourable senators, I do not
know why I have been chosen to explain this
bill when there are so many keen legal minds
in this chamber, unless it is that on many
occasions I have been rather critical of the
Canadian Commercial Corporation for the
lack of contracts awarded in the Maritimes.
I am afraid that I will not be able to give
as interesting a background for this measure
as the previous speakers gave for the Indian
Bill. Without mentioning any particular
senator, I may say that the speeches on that
measure were most informative and provided
a colourful background of the subject under
discussion.
The Canadian Commercial Corporation
Bill was passed by the House of Commons on
May 18, 1951. In making my explanation,
I wish to refer to the connecting bill, which
provides some background for this measure.
It will be recalled that on April 1 of this
year a new department, known as the Department of Defence Production, was established.
At that time the purchase of defence supplies

MAY 23, 1951
Hon. Mr. Reid: The change to make it
permanent?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I think the corporation
was first set up for three years, and by an
amendment in 1949 the temporary feature
was eliminated.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: That is so.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That is how these things
are done. The other house and the Senate
are invited to set up Crown corporations to
carry on for the time being; then, before
people are aware of the change, and with
very little protest from their representatives
in either place, these companies are made
permanent. I ask honourable senators to
give some attention to the wider powers they
are asked to confer on this corporation. I
speak as a layman; perhaps I have not full
information. In the second note on section
3 it is stated that the paragraphs are added
"to resolve the legal doubt raised as to
whether the corporation may exercise a
power not included among its specified purBy the amendments before us,
poses."
powers and functions vested in the minister
are to be exercised by the Canadian Commercial Corporation itself. With that, of
course, I do not agree.
My question to the honourable senator who
introduced the bill has to do with the granting of superannuation to employees who, I
take it, have been with the corporation since
1949. Is it intended that when the Superannuation Act is made applicable to them,
money will be taken from the treasury to
augment or meet back paymentsHon. Mr. Haig: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Reid: -for the years in which
they have been in the service? I see nothing
either in the Commercial Corporation Act or
in the present bill which would prohibit the
corporation from going that, because the
framing of regulations regarding superannuation is left entirely to them. Does the
honourable senator from Halifax-Dartmouth
know whether the treasury is to be charged
with the back payments on superannuation
for the few civil servants, either in the
medium or the higher brackets, who have
been engaged by the corporation since 1949?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I do not recall that I
looked into that particular matter, but I
know from experience, as many honourable
senators do, that it is not unusual to transfer
employees from one department to another
after a lengthy period of service. I would
point out that the great majority of the
employees affected by this legislation were
engaged, not in 1949, but in 1946. At one

time there were-if my figures are correctToday the
as many as 660 employees.
number is only about 35; and because of
their past services, extending over five years
or more, and the manner in which they have
carried out their duties-as I believe, very
helpfully to this country-it was felt that
it would be only fair to allow them this
benefit.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I point out that I am
not referring to civil servants who were in
other departments and have been transferred.
To provide for them in this way is only
natural and right. I was speaking of civil
servants engaged, not under the Civil Service
Act but by the Canadian Commercial Corporation, and who when this bill goes
through, although they have not contributed
to superannuation, will be entitled to the
benefits of the Superannuation Act.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I think it is reasonable to
suppose that of the sum required to bring
their contributions up to date part will be
paid by the employees themselves and part
by the government. Certainly the principle
of employer-contribution is common in
private enterprise. As a businessman I might
inaugurate a pension scheme-I have done
so-and I might decide that it was good
business to pay the whole amount rather
than require any of it from the employees.
And I might not limit my contribution to
1947 and subsequent years, but extend it
over a period which would provide a satisfactory allowance upon retirement at the age
of 65. I think the same reasoning applies
to governments.

Hon. John T. Haig: From the very beginning I have been opposed to legislation of this
kind. I was not in favour of it before and
I am not in favour of it now. It puts power
in the hands of a few civil servants, as though
they were some outside corporation under
government control, to buy goods for the
government. But protest is useless. This is
part of the program submitted to the people
of Canada in 1949, and the government was
returned to power. My honourable friend
the senator from Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon.
Mr. Isnor) made quite a story out of his
explanation of the bill; but if I remember
correctly the corporation now has only about
thirty-five employees.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Yes-now.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not know why the
Department of Defence Production has seen
fit to perpetuate this organization. It is just
another of those agencies which adds to the
costs of government. As an honourable
senator pointed out very clearly this morning
in committee, the maintenance of these

SENATE
boards and commissions and similar organizations is multiplying the numbers of civil
servants who have to find something to do
to occupy their time. The result, as I have
said, is that costs are increasing.
Some honourable members may say that in
1949, by a large majority, the people voted
for the return of a government which is
responsible for acts of this kind. You may
say that in three or four weeks several
by-elections will be held and that the people
will again vote for that government. That
may be truc, but it does not alter the hard
fact that our cost of living is today higher
than it ever has been, and I do not see how
legislation of this kind is going to reduce it.
I was in agreement with the honourable
gentleman from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) when he inquired whether certain
civil servants will be assisted by the treasury
in having arrears of charges paid by the
government to bring their superannuation
payments up to date. Last March this house
put through a special vote of $75 million to
help meet the shortage in the Superannuation
Fund. At that time the minister said he
was not sure whether this sum would cover
the shortage, or words to that effect. I will
not go any further in interpreting his remarks,
but I am persuaded that this is the sort of
thing that contributes to the deficiency of
the superannuation account. It is no bookkeeping matter. If any honourable senator
had to pay the taxes himself in a private
business ho would be very much concerned
about it.
Let me tell the house about the school
board in the City of Winnipeg. A superannuation fund for teachers was started in
that city in 1905. At first the teachers were
required to pay in $5 a year, and then the payment was increased to $10 and later to $25.
These small payments may have seemed
sufficient at the time, but by 1930 some of
these teachers were on superannuation and
the fund was woefully short. As a result
the City of Winnipeg had to come through
with a large sum of money to make up the
deficit. It is still paying into the fund, and
for another twenty years will be making
payments that originally should have been
made by the teachers. We are doing the same
kind of thing here. We should not extend
superannuation benefits to people who originally could not qualify for them, if thereby
we jeopardize the rights of civil servants
who have been obliged to make contributions
to the fund over many years. I do not think
what was said by the honourable gentleman
fron Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor)
will come about.

Hon. Mr. Isnor: What was that?

Hon. Mr. Haig:

That they will be able

to catch up with what should have been paid
in before. That is not the history of the
way these things work; it is just the reverse.

I have said several times before, and I
repeat now, that it is bad business to place
Acts such as this on our statute books.
Ultimately we shall have to pay for these
mistakes.
This sort of thing drives the
country into controlling the business of indi-

viduals, and there is not a single socialist
organizer or campaigner in Canada who would

not admit that this is what he wants. Well,
if this is what is wanted, let us face the
matter squarely and admit that our aim is
to become a Socialist state wherein the government controls everything.
One of the
jokes about the socialist state is this. The

Labour

government

has

indicated that it is in favour of socialism, and
it is socializing industry and everything else
in that country. "But," you say "the British
Government pays its people for the goods it
takes away from them". Pays them in what?

In pieces of paper signed by the government,
which may or may not be worth something.
The British Government is kicking now
because the Iranian Government wants to
nationalize the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company
by unilateral action. Well, what is the fundamental difference in principle? There is none
at all. Canada has been built into a great
country by private enterprise, but every time
we do something like this we make it more
difficult to carry on in the future.

When goods are required for defence purposes why are tenders not called for on a
national basis, so that the merchants of Hali-

fax, Winnipeg and Vancouver may have the
same rights as the merchants of Ontario or

Quebec to get these contracts?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Tenders are asked for.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That may be, but this corporation bas full control over who gets the
contracts.

Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Would the honourable
leader

have done away with

the

Department of Munitions and Supply during
the last war?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not know about that.
I do know that we carried on without that

department during the first World War, and
we only added about $2 billion to the public
debt of the country; but when we carried on
with

somewhere, but I do not know where.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Why didn't the Department
of National Defence handle this rather than
the Department of Munitions and Supply?

MAY 23, 1951
Hon. Mr. Haig: It always did in the past.
But that is not the point involved here. There
were no military operations in 1946 when this
legislation was first passed.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: There is now.
Hon. Mr. Haig: There is no rpilitary operation yet.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: A billion dollars' worth
a year.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is something else
altogether. There is no urgency to have this
legislation passed today or tomorrow or the
next day, but a state of urgency existed in
1914 and again in 1939.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I would draw my honourable friend's attention to the fact that this
corporation is the responsibility of the Minister of Defence Production, and its main
function is the purchase of defence production and supplies.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Then why was the number
of employees decreased from approximately
1,000 to 35? We are merely going through
the motions in passing this legislation. I do
not see that it will do one single thing to
reduce the terrific burden of taxation on our
people. Prosperity may exist in certain European and other countries as long as the
American people are willing to lend money,
but net a minute longer. There was a financial collapse the minute the United States
stopped lending money to Germany in 1929.
I am afraid the same thing will occur here.
The people of Canada can carry the burden
imposed by these things only as long as the
world is in its present state of inflation; but
we are piling up future liabilities. It is true
that our national debt is about $18 billion.
I think my honourable friend, the deputy
(Hon. Mr.
leader of the government
Hugessen), will agree with that.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The gross debt is about
$16 billion.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, that is a tremendous
debt to pay, unless we can control the value
of money in this country.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That is just the federal
debt.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes.
It is no answer to say that only thirty-five
persons are employed by the corporation. I
am opposed to the setting up of these companies. If I were a C.C.F. candidate and
thought that party would be successful at the
next election, and that the Senate might be
hostile to the party's legislation, I would
delight to have a measure like this on the
statute books of this country.
80713-32

Hon. Mr. Duff: Don't join that party.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I have expressed my personal view. I will not oppose the bill, but I
do not like legislation of this kind.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I have always had a very great deal of
admiration for my honourable friend the
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), but
I think that admiration is even higher at this
particular moment than at any previous time,
because never before have I known that he
possessed the ability to make an enormous
mountain out of such a tiny molehill as this
particular bill happens to be. After all, what
is the purpose of this bill? The Canadian
Commercial Corporation was set up in, I
think, the year 1946Hon. Mr. Haig: Correct.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: -as the successor of
the old Department of Munitions and, Supply.
At that time it was hoped that the corporation would be needed for only a short time,
and it was given a life of three years. However, the unfortunate development of affairs
has been such that we now have to consider
the possibility of again needing something in
the nature of a Department of Munitions and
Supply, and the purpose of this very innocent
amendment is to substitute the Minister of
Defence Production for the Minister of Trade
and Commerce as the one whose responsibility it will be to administer this corporation,
which may or may not become vitally necessary at some time in the future. That is
really all that the bill involves.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Does the bill not increase
the corporation's powers?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Oh, no. Section 3,
which deals with powers, simply provides
that the minister may delegate to this corporation under his control certain functions
which are conferred upon him by other Acts
of parliament, and also that the corporation
may exercise any powers which are conferred
upon it by other Acts of parliament.
I was really astonished to find my honourable friend the leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) using this small bill as a peg upon
which to hang a severe attack upon the government's policy of setting up and operating
the Canadian Commercial Corporation and,
where necessary, taking over the economy of
the country from private hands. That, I
submit, has really nothing whatever to do
with the bill. The bill merely continues in
the hands of the minister-hereafter the
Minister of Defence Production instead of the
Minister of Traide and Commerce-a stand-by
power which proved to be vitally important
in the interests of this country during the

that there will be a definite limitation to the

Hon. Mr. Haig: That is what I am getting at.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That matter can better
be dealt with in committee.
I now come to the other amendment. Since
1910, under the provisions of the Act, participating policyholders have been entitled
to have set aside for their account 90 per
cent of the profits set aside for distribution
to shareholders and participating policyholders. That provision may have been all
right in 1910, but as the companies grew
they found, as a matter of sound business
policy, that it was better voluntarily to
set aside a larger percentage than 90
per cent for the account of participating
policyholders. This practice has been so
regular over a period of time as almost to
amount to a rule of law. The percentage
set aside varies in such amounts as 92k per
cent and 95 per cent, and in a great many
cases it is higher than the statutory requirement of 90 per cent.
The government has taken the position
as a matter of policy, supported by the life
insurance companies, that now is the time to
put into statutory form the practice that has
been recognized by the companies over a
period of years. In other words, such a change
would remove the element of doubt, or the
possibility of exploitation of the interests of
the participating policyholder in the conpany. Such exploitation might take the
form of a reduction. For instance, a company
may for years have followed the practice
of setting aside 924 per cent or 951 per cent
of the profits to be credited to the participating policyholders' account. But in some year
the company might decide to increase the
amount to be credited to the shareholders'
account and reduce to the statutory limit of
90 per cent the amount to be aside for the
participating policyholders' account.
The
practice of setting aside more than 90 per
cent has, as I have said, become so common
that it is now considered the proper time to
give it statutory effect.
For that purpose the bill grades the percentages, with a floor 90 per cent. A lifc
80713-321

insurance company which has a volume of
business in relation to participating policies
of not more than $250 million, shall set
aside 90 per cent of the profits resulting
therefrom, te be credited to the participating
policyholders' account. A company with a
volume of between $250 million and $500
million in any one year shall set aside 92à
per cent for that purpose; if the volume is
between $500 million and $1 billion per year,
95 per cent must be set aside; and when the
volume is more than-$1 billion, the company
must set aside 97Î per cent of its profits.
In passing I may say that the establishment
of these grades of percentage does not mean
that any life insurance company will have to
contribute more by virtue of the proposed
regulation than it is today contributing voluntarily. I may say further that in relation
to some of the companies in the larger brackets the contribution to the participating
policyholders' account bas been, and I am
sure will continue to be, in excess of the
percentage that will be required by statute.
In short, conditions changed to such an
extent between 1910 and 1951 that it was
thought that 90 per cent should be made the
floor instead of being the only percentage
required by law. There has been a tremendous increase in the volume of business of
life insurance companies since 1910. It is
by reason of that trend that this amendment
is being sought.
If the bill is given second reading, I
intend to move that it be referred to
committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are proceeded
with I should like to say for the information
of the house that while at the moment I am
not at all sure how much legislation will be
before us at the first of next week, there is
now, and will be next week, a considerable
amount of work in committees. Therefore it
is my intention, when we adjourn this afternoon, to move that we stand adjourned until
Monday evening next at 8 o'clock.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I was hopeful, honourable
senators, that the leader would see fit to
adjourn the house until Tuesday afternoon,
so that some of us might attend the opening
of the Canadian International Trade Fair in
Toronto on Monday next. This is a very
important event in the life of Canada, and
even in the international business world of
today. If it is necessary that the house meet
Monday night, some of us will have to be
absent.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: The fair will be on
for two weeks.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But there is a desire to
have distinguished Canadians present for the
opening.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

The motion was agreed to, and the bills
were read the second time, on division.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall these bils be read the third

Hon. Mr. Horner: Next sitting.
INDIAN BILL
SECOND READING-DEBATE CONTINUED

Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
the problem of a native population is one
that is not peculiar to Canada alone. Many
countries of the world have been taken over
by a white population, and in almost every
case difficult problems have developed in
dealing with the natives.
In the United
States, for instance, the Indian problem has
been a troublesome one. The treatment of the
native population in South Africa is today
discussed widely in the international press.
New Zealand is, I think, the only country
which has been fortunate in its dealings with
its natives, the Maori.
The change of attitude by the public
generally towards the Indians in Canada is
significant. It is perhaps fair to say that
75 years 'ago the consensus of opinion of the
public generally was that the problem of the
Indians would ultimately solve itself by the
extinction of these people. It was a harsh
view, but we looked at things somewhat
differently in those days. Today there is an
awareness on the part of the Canadian
people that there is an obligation to the
native Indian population, because in centuries
past we took their country from them, and
later, as the white population spread, segregated the Indians upon reserves and felt
that we had discharged our duties to them.
That old conception led, of course, to a weak

SENATE

administration of native Indian affairs. It
is within the recollection of many who are
listening to me today that in the period I
speak of, sixty to seventy-five years ago,
Indian agents were appointed by the political
party in power. It is not unfair to say that
in many cases, quite irrespective of which
party held office, these agents received their
appointments as a reward for party service.
The qualifications required for the delicate
task of supervising the Indians under their
charge was almost wholly ignored. At that
time, prior to the turn of the century, there
was no regard on the part of the government for the health of the Indians, and epidemics frequently decimated whole tribes.
They got the white man's diseases, and they
had not the immunity to those diseases
which the white population had built up
over decades and even centuries. Diphtheria
and measles swept away scores and sometimes hundreds of children over large areas
of the country. The adult population was
ravaged by smallpox, and-probably the
greatest scourge of all-tuberculosis.
I said a moment ago that a new concepion and a keener sense of our responsibility
to the Indian population have arisen, and I
would like to sketch very briefly some of
the forward steps which have been taken in
recent years. When, at the end of 1935, I
took a place in the government, one of the

divisions of public administration confided
to my supervision was the Indian Affairs
Branch, as it was then called; and for years
I possessed the very dignified and highsounding title of "Superintendent-General of
Indian Affairs in Canada." I confess that
when I assumed this responsibility my knowledge of the Indian problem was of the most
But I endeavoured to
superficial kind.
acquaint myself with the obligations I had
undertaken in respect of the Indians.
A short time after I was put in charge
of this administration I was visited by a
delegation of doctors, who came from nearly
every province in Canada. In their respective provinces these doctors had the supervision of the eradication of tuberculosis
amongst the white population. I recall very
well their interview with me. Prior to that
time the matter had been mentioned to me
by the late Dr. David Stewart, Superintendent of the Ninette Sanatorium in Manitoba.
During his lifetime Dr. Stewart was probably
the outstanding Canadian authority on
tuberculosis.
This delegation urged upon me the vast
importance of the Indian Affairs Branch
doing something to arrest the spread of
Quite
tuberculosis amongst the Indians.
apart from the humanitarian aspect of the
question, they put before me an argument

that I thought was wholly unanswerable.
They said that every Indian reserve in
Canada was a centre of infection for the
spread of tuberculosis, and that they could
never eradicate this dread disease from the
white population until it was controlled
amongst the Indians. That struck me as a
valid argument. They gave me instance
after instance of the toll that tuberculosis
was taking among the Indians. I said to
them: "Very wel, gentlemen, I want you to
confer together and submit a recommendation to me as to how the Indian Affairs
Branch can make a start towards controlling
this disease."
They held a meeting, and
their first recormmendation to me was that
we conduct that year, which was 1936, an
x-ray survey of Indian schools. They assured
me of their co-operation in the supply of
equipment for this purpose. I had no money
for the carrying on of this work, so when

our estimates were under consideration I
had to put this proposal to the then Minister
of Finance, the Honourable Mr. Dunning.
After some discussion I was successful in
obtaining a grant of $50,000 to begin with,
and the survey of many Indian schools was
undertaken and a report presented to the
department.
I am bound to say that the survey revealed
a shocking state of affairs.
There was
scarcely an Indian school, as I recall nownot one-that did not have among the children within its walls one or more cases of
active T.B. And of course that was a danger
not only to the children in the schools but
to those who were ministering to their needs.
From that experiment there was developed
the idea of having T.B. hospitals for Indians.
The first such hospital put into operation
was in the province of Manitoba. The Anglican Church had a school about twenty-five
miles north of Winnipeg on the Red River,
a school which many years before had been
in the midst of -the reserve known as the
Peguis Indian Reserve. Some members of
this house will remember the rather animated
debates which took place almost fifty years
ago over the disposition of that reserve. The
land there was fertile and excellent in every
way, and white settlers were going in, and
as a result the Indians agreed to move to
a new location about 150 miles distant. Thus
there was no longer any need for the Indian
school that I mentioned. We bought the
school from the Anglican Church for, as I
recall, about $8,000 or $9,000, and we spent
an additional $9,000 or $10,000 in converting
the building into a hospital of forty beds.
At that time I decided that the proper thing
to do was to put the administration of this
hospital under 'the Manitoba Sanatorium

MAY 24, 1951
Board, which had the necessary equipment
and experienced men for supervision; and
this was done. It was arranged that the
board would render its accounts to the federal government, which would audit and
pay them as they became due. I understand
that arrangement with the province of Manitoba is still in effect.
Later on another Indian school that had
come into disuse in British Columbia-a
large Indian school at Sardis, near Chilliwack, some sixty miles or so from Vancouver
-was taken over by the department and
remodelled into a T.B. hospital. And before
I left the department we had taken steps
to secure the Air Force Hospital at The Pas.
That afterwards came under the administration of the Indian Affairs Branch, and has
been enlarged since; and today a considerable number of Indian patients afflicted
with T.B. are being cared for there. Of
course since then several other hospitals
have been acquired. One is at Sioux Lookout, for the Indians in that part of Ontario;
and a large hospital was built, I think, at
James Bay. The building of others I understand, is under consideration.
I am quite certain that by giving this
medical ýcare, and without any very great
expense, we can make a definite reduction
in the incidence of T.B. among the Indians.
I remember that the late Dr. Stewart, whose
name I mentioned a moment ago, told me he
thought the wisest plan would be to have
comparatively small hospitals near where
the Indians reside. He had observed the
Indians who occasionally had been sent to
the Ninette Sanatorium, and he said that in
the strange environment, separated from
their friends, they fretted to a degree that
definitely retarded their recovery.
The chief economic difficulty in this problem arises from the Indians in the northern
parts of the western provinces and Quebec
and Ontario. According to the information
given yesterday by the senator from New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) the total Indian
population today is approximately 136,000.
Roughly one-third of the total Indian population lives in these northern areas. Some
of the Indians get intermittent jobs with
companies fishing the northern lakes, but
their main source of revenue in these areas
is from trapping.
And here a problem arose. When the
natural resources were transferred to the
Prairie Provinces there was a complete lack
of vision on the part of those charged with
the administration, in that ample provision
was not made for the protection of the Indian
trappers in the north. The trapping then was
open to competition by whites, half-breeds

and Indians, with the result that there was no
conservation and the population of furbearing animals went steadily down. About
fifty years ago, when that country was still
virgin wilderness, the numbers of muskrat
pelts shipped from The Pas in northern Manitoba were around 400,000 annually. Fortyfive years later this number had dropped to
around 20,000 and the muskrats appeared to
be headed for ultimate extinction in this
area. This created a problem in the Indians
Branch because of the considerable cost of
maintaining these people. It was a problem
also for the provinces, particularly Manitoba.
So in 1936 I approached Mr. Bracken, then
Premier of Manitoba, with a suggestion for
the development of a fur area on the Saskatchewan River east of The Pas. The idea
was not original with me. A local trader,
located about seventy-five miles east of The
Pas, had a few years before got a lease of
50,000 acres from the provincial government and proceeded to develop the muskrat
population in that area. He demonstrated
beyond any question of doubt that under
favourable conditions the rat population
would be restored. With that experiment in
mind, and having in view also the needs of
those Indians and the practical certainty that
the Manitoba government was interested in
taking off relief the half-breeds and poor
white trappers in that area, we reached an
agreement with the Manitoba Government
whereby that entire area was set aside for
joint development by the federal and provincial governments, and no trapping was
allowed there for several years. I shall presently give the figures of the return from that
development, but first I wish to say that we
initiated similar developments in the northern part of Saskatchewan and in the province of Quebec. And here I wish to say
that at all times during my period of administration, and I believe since, the department
in dealing with this problem has had full
and complete co-operation from the Quebec
Provincial authorities. Later, certain steps
were taken in British Columbia.
In dealing with this question I wish to give
a few figures which will indicate the success
which attended the scheme. I do so for the
reason that, as far as my knowledge and
observation go, this is the only method by
which we can satisfactorily provide for the
Indians located in remote regions where there
is no agriculture, and where for generations
they have been dependent upon trapping.
Speaking first of the Summerberry area,
which is east of The Pas, and to which I
referred a moment ago as having been

SENATE
developed by the Manitoba Government and
the federal authorities, I have this note:
The cost of this development to the federal
treasury in the period from 1938 to 1941 was
$187,598.

That cost was due, I may say, to the building of certain dams and canals to bring the
water on the ranches to a proper level.
The note continues:
The federal contribution to the development ended
in 1941, at which time the area came into production
and the province assumed all the costs of development and administration. In the period from 1941
to 1949, inclusive, $2,103,023 was paid to trappers on
the project, of whom approximately 60 per cent
were treaty Indians. Indians still participate and
will continue to participate in the benefits of this
project in spite of the fact that no flnancial contribution has been made since 1941.

If the Indians comprised 60 per cent of the
trappers, a hasty calculation will indicate
that they got three-fifths of the income, or a
total of $1,275,000 over a period of eight years.
The result was that more than a hundred
Indian families were taken off relief, and they
have remained off it from that day te this.
In discussing the bill I shall refer later to
certain Indian characteristics, but in the
meantime I would say that in this case we
provided that the fur trapped by the Indians
was to be sold under the supervision of the
department. There were two reasons for
this arrangement: first, that the Indian did
not know the value of his furs on the market,
and if he sold on his own account unscrupulous traders would take advantage of him;
and second, that if he sold the fur and got
all the money in his pocket at one time be
would probably provide for his needs in the
way of flour, tea and sugar for the next few
weeks, and then go out and squander the
balance. So we arranged that each Indian
should be credited with the amount brought
by his furs, and that he be paid so much a
month throughout the year for himself and
his family. That is why these families which
I mentioned a moment ago were taken off
relief.
I now come to Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think the honourable
gentleman may have forgotten a point. Was
there not a provision as to how much trapping could be done?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Yes. I will come to that
in a moment.
In the province of Saskatchewan equally
good results accrued. There was a possibility
of bringing back the beaver population in
that area, and I have this note on the point:
Beaver production on a sustained yield basis rose
from 1,600 pelts in 1946 to 8,328 valued at $157,399 in
1949.

And that will expand as the program
develops.
Now I wish to say a word about Quebec,
and it will conclude the three instances which
I will give. I may say that similar work is
in hand in the Province of Ontario and in
the Northwest Territories, but in Quebec
there is full co-operation by the provincial
government.

We secured

three areas-and

I think another one or two have been added
since I left the department. The results
are worthy of note. I have here the figures
on the trapping of beaver. In the James Bay
country, where there are about 5,000 Indians,
the beaver had practically disappeared and
the muskrats were on the way out. This
resulted from the conditions which I described
earlier as existing in Manitoba, namely,
all-over trapping by half-breeds, whites and
Indians all scrambling to see how much
they could get, and no thought being given
to conservation.
In 1949 I find that there were four areas in
production in the northern part of Quebec
and one in the St. Johns country. The total
beaver taken was 6,950, at a value of $142,254.
In the following year 10,500 beaver were
taken, with a total value of $275,000. I am
told by the officers in the Indian Affairs
Branch that this program is developing,
and they look forward ultimately to the
time when these Indians will bo selfsupporting by reason of this steady revenue
from fur trade.
In my record as Minister of the Department
of Mines and Resources I perhaps have not
much to be proud of, but I have no hesitation
in saying to this honourable house that this
is one development of which I am really
proud.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I want to pay tribute here
to the officers of the department of that
time. In the initial years of the operation of
the Department of Mines and Resources we
were fortunate to have Dr. Charles Camsell
as deputy minister. There was no one in
this country who understood the problems
of the north and of the Indians better than
Dr. Camsell. We were equally fortunate in
having Mr. Hoey, who has since retired, as
the Director of Administration. He was succeeded by a very excellent man. Major
MacKay, who .came here from Vancouver, and
who, I may say to the glory of my friend from
Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon), who introduced
him to me, has proved a very competent
official.
That, honourable senators, covers the little

story I have to tell about some of the background of this bill.

MAY 24, 1951
I come now to the bill itself. Yesterday
the honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) stated that there
had been practically no revision of the Indian
Act since 1869, save the revision in 1880.
That fact indicates the rather widespread
indifference to the Indian problem which
prevailed during the first half of this nation's
story. The genesis of this bill lies in the
excellent work done by a joint committee of
the Commons and the Senate over a period
of some three years. While the bill does not
incorporate all the recommendations which
were made by that committee, those who prepared it had the advantage of the study which
the committee made, and the legislation
which they have produced is, in my judgment, a vast improvement on the old Indian
Act. As a matter of fact, but for the war
the Indian Act would have been before
parliament for revision in 1941, or even a
year earlier.
The main principle of the bill-and I have
read all the sections-is the maintenance by
the government of what I may describe as
"wardship". In other words, the Indians are
wards of the state. That relationship, which
existed from early days, is continued almost
in its entirety, and I think very wisely. This
is necessary, as it appears to me, mainly for
one reason.
Certain characteristics are
common to all Indians wherever you find
them, the most notable being the inability
of the individual Indian to discipline himself for his ordinary day-by-day needs. This
fact was noted centuries ago when the early
explorers went through this country. At
that time, of coun e, the Indians were very
much better off. They could hunt the buffalo
on the prairies, they could shoot deer in the
forests, they could take fish from the lakes
and streams; and in these ways they secured
not only much of their food, but materials
for their clothing and their habitations. With
the extension of white settlement and the
placing of the Indians on reservations, these
opportunities naturally disappearedý. But the
inability of the Indian to provide for more
than the needs of the moment and to exercise, in the larger sense, self-discipline, must
be, I think, a governing consideration in the
handling of the Indian problem. Some people,
moved by the best of intentions, believe that
the right way to help the Indian is to try to
make him a white man overnight. There
never was a greater fallacy. The principle
which runs through the bill and which I
have described, as wardship, the realization
that the Indians are wards of the state, is a
wise one.
The provisions of the bill relating to
reservations, administration of resources,

property, intestacy, and the like, strike me
as admirable; indced I would say the same of
the bill as a whole.
Take the question of education. Without
doubt the process of building the Indian to
a point-it may be a long distance down the
years-where he can take his place as an
ordinary citizen of Canada, discharging all
the responsibilities of citizenship, depends
very largely for its success on the kind of
education he receives. I do not wish to be
critical of the past. It is interesting to look
for a moment at the development of the idea
of education as far as the Indians are concerned. I would say it had its beginnings
when Christian missionaries of all the
churches went into the remote parts of the
country to carry the gospel to those who at
that time were pagans. The idea developed
that if the Indian children were taken from
the reserves and put into residential schools
they could be taught what may be briefly
described as the white man's ways. That was
a commendable intention, but it was not
without one weakness which I shall presently
point out. Indian children at the age of six
years were taken to a residential school,
where they remained almost continuously
until they became sixteen years old. They
then graduated and left the school. For
ninety-nine out of every hundred there was
no place to go but back to the reserve, to
parents and relatives whom they had left
ten years before. The girls had learned the
art of making themselves attractive; the boys
had been taught manners and how to read
and write. But when they returned to the
reserve, in many cases they went back to
the teepee; and the transformation was
altogether too great. I recall that when I
held this grandiose title of "SuperintendentGeneral of Indian Affairs", I was visited at
The Pas on one occasion by an old Indian
chief from a reserve in northern Manitoba
who protested against the children of the
tribe being taken to residential schools. He
said "When they come home again, the boy,
who should have been with his father learning to trap, knows nothing about it; the girl,
who should have been learning useful needlework, has no idea how to make furs into
garments." There was a good deal of truth
in that. I realize that perhaps it is not yet
possible to eliminate the residential school,
but the day school should be brought to the
Indian community to enable the children to
spend their evenings with their parents. This
has an excellent influence on the parents as
well as on the children, and there is no
doubt that this system would help to elevate
the whole standard of these people.

SENATE
I think that on the whole the enfranchisement provisions are wise ones. There are
some who believe that the Indians should
be given the franchise on a wide scale; but
that mistake has not been made in this bill.
It is necessary to keep clearly in mind the
distinction between the status of the Indian
and that of the ordinary citizen. Under the
old Act an Indian who so wished could be
enfranchised, and every year a number of
Indians received the franchise. In other
words they ceased to be Indians under our
laws, and became ordinary ,citizens. This is
the road along which we must travel to
reach our ultimate goal. The sections dealing
with the franchise provide that individual
Indians may, with the approval of the
minister, seek and secure it. They also provide that groups of Indians may, by a
majority vote, seek and secure enfranchisement.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: Do they lose anything by being enfranchised?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Yes, they lose certain
rights, such as some exemption from taxation,
which they enjoy on their reserves.
We should also examine in committee the
provisions dealing with intoxicants and the
sale of liquor to Indians. In general these
provisions are satisifalctory, but there is a
curious provision to the effect that upon
the request of a province the Governor in
Couincil may allow Indians to purchase liquor
in public places in that particular province.
In other words, they may frequent beer
parlours. There is some doubt in my mind
about the wisdom of this provision.
There is only one section dealing with
health; it provides that the government
may make regulations. The health of the
Indians now comes under the Department of
Health and Welfare. I doubt whether it was
wise to make this transfer from the Indian
Affairs Branch, because two departments
have to deal with what is essentially one
problem.
Honourable senators, I have just about
concluded my remarks, and I dare say you
are all thankful. If you are not, you should
be.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: It has been very
interesting.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: In closing I wish to
stress the seriousness of the problem we are
facing. The Indian population is increasing
at the rate of about one or one and a half
per cent a year. There are now 136,000
Indians in Canada. We are constantly improving their living and nutritional standards,
and providing them with better health services. All this results in the acceleration
of the rate of increase of their population.

So before many years we can look forward
to the time when the Indian population will
reach, say, 150,000-and it will continue to
increase as the years pass by. If we are not
to annually increase the burden on the
Treasury to maintain these people, it is
absolutely vital that as far as possible the
Indians be brought to a state where they are
self-supporting. The fur development program is helping that class of Indians who
live in the northern parts of our provinces,
and the development of farming methods is
assisting the Indians in the agricultural areas.
We must clearly realize that only through
wisdom, patience and sympathetic understanding on the part of other Canadians, can
we achieve the ultimate goal of enabling the
Indians to stand on their own feet and not
be a charge upon the rest of the community.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I would remind the honourable gentleman from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) that I asked him a question, and he
said he would answer it later in his speech.
The question was: What conservation provisions were made as to trapping on these
reserves?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I may say that there is
nothing I dislike more than to weary the
house, and perhaps I missed some points I
might otherwise have covered.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think this is important.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Trap lines have been
assigned to Indians in Manitoba and boards
have been set up in each province to supervise fur development. The Manitoba board,
which is typical of the others, consists of
three members; two of these represent the
provincial government and one represents the
Indian Affairs Branch of the federal government. That is the point I overlooked
explaining to my honourable friend, and I
apologize to him for it.
Hon. Mr. Haig:
Thank you for the
information.
Hon. Mr. King: Honourable senators, I
move the adjournment of the debate.
THE SENATE AND ITS WORK
MOTION WITHDRAWN

The Senate resumed from Tuesday, May
22, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Robertson for the appointment of a
special committee to inquire into and report
upon how in its opinion the Senate may
make its maximum contribution to the welfare of the Canadian people.
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, the honourable gentleman from St.
Jean Baptiste (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) adjourned

MAY 24, 1951
the debate on my behalf, I having intimated
that as soon as it became clear that no other
member of the house wished to discuss this
resolution, which has been standing on the
Order Paper for some time, I would close the
debate. As it now appears that no one else
desires to say anything on the resolution, I
will begin by stating-as I intimated when
I introduced it-that it would be agreeable
to me, if honourable senators so desired,
that it should be withdrawn. However, I
am bound to say that originally I intended,
if the resolution was withdrawn-provided
the views expressed in the debate seemed to
warrant this course-to substitute for it a
more specific one, authorizing the establishment of a committee, naming its personnel
and setting out the terms of reference which
might have appeared to commend themselves to a majority of the Senate. It may
be recalled that when I spoke to the resolution I asked the honourable senators to
regard whatever suggestions I might make as
being put forward merely for the purpose
of opening the debate, and that I reserved
the right to change my suggestions in the
light of comments by honourable senators.
Had the general feeling been that a committee should be set up, and had I been
asked for my opinion as to what matters
might be usefully referred to it, I probably
would have changed a number of my original
suggestions, not necessarily because my own
views had changed, but for reasons of
propriety, perhaps, or other reasons. On the
other hand, during the course of the debate
questions arose which had never occurred
to me when I moved the resolution, and if I
had had an opportunity of suggesting the
terms of reference for a committee I would
have included those questions.
A majority of those who spoke to the
resolution felt that certain matters relating
to the future of the Senate might be usefully discussed.
But there were sharp
differences of opinion at to what those matters
were and as to the medium through which
they might best be considered, if considered
at all.
I wish to thank honourable senators who
participated in the debate for the time and
thought they gave to the subject-matter. I
invited the greatest possible participation:
I said I feared criticism less than indifference.
It bas been said that perhaps I should
have consulted some of the senators about the
bringing in of the resolution. My answer is
this. It was my feeling that to ask any of my
colleagues to share the responsibility with
me would be unfair to them; so I decided to
take it upon myself alone. Consequently,
when I introduced the resolution no other
senator was committed in any way, shape or

form as to the position that he or she might
take with respect to it. That includes the
senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen),
who very kindly consented to second the
motion, simply for the purpose of having it
brought before the bouse. In the result we
had, as a distinguished colleague said to me,
what might be called a discussion in Committee of the Whole.
In other circumstances, and especially
because of what I said originally, I would
endeavour to reconcile the conflicting viewpoints and substitute for this resolution an
order of a specific nature, provided I could
secure for it the support of a majority. It
goes without saying, of course, that no committee dealing with a matter of this kind
would be of any value unless it had the support of a very considerable majority of senators. However, for reasons that I need not
elaborate I do not feel equal to undertaking
this responsibility at the present moment. If
nothing else develops in the meantime, and
if sufficient support is in evidence next session I shall try to prepare a proposal that
would reconcile the conflicting viewpoints
and commend itself to a majority of the
members of the Senate.
I realize notwithstanding what I intimated
when introducing the resolution, that in asking that it be now withdrawn and not proposing its replacement by a more specific
one, I may be causing disappointment to
some senators, junior and senior, who are
interested in the question of Senate reform
and who over quite a period of time urged
me to do something in the matter. However,
I suggest, there is no need for them to be
unduly depressed or disappointed. After all,
our parliamentary institutions are the product of a very long period of time, and their
best features have been developed gradually
from year to year-indeed, in the Ol
Country, from generation to generation. It
is only natural that any proposal to change
these institutions, however slightly, should
be so questioned as to give the appearance
for the moment of being strongly opposed.
Established practices are never changed without a good deal of consideration. That has
been true in the past, it is true today, and it
will undoubtedly remain true in the future.
I do not apologize for having introduced
the motion; for while those who spoke on it
expressed a wide difference of opinion as to
details, the majority felt that some changes
in our present practices might usefully be
adopted. I may say that it was brought
forward as a result of my personal convictions and some active urging, not only by
junior senators but by some of the veteran
members of this house.

SENATE

mean that I now know which provinces have
invoked the provisions of the Act in order
to obtain permission by order in council
either to raise or to reduce the age limit. But
the manner in which this has been provided
for is objectionable in the light of the principle which was discussed last year, namely,
that a government, whether federal or provincial, has the right to administer the Act
but has not the right to legislate-which in
effect is what this amendment permits.
I am not going to raise any objection to this
bill, which has been askedi for by the province of Alberta. All it does is to make the
law in that province the same as the law in
some of the other provinces. The -present provision has been in effect for 22 years, but there
is no reason in the world why a boy of sixteen
should be tried under the Criminal Code just
because he happens to live in a particular
province. There are other ways of dealing
with him. The Criminal Code is a federal
law and should apply to all ýcitizens of
Canada in the same manner. As I say, I am
not going to object to the bill, but I should
like to give notice to the leader of the government that at the next session of · arliap
ment I am going to ask for the institution of
an inquiry basedý on the principles that were
discussed at the last session of parliament,
and on which we unanimously agreed. Such
an inquiry would be of great value and
assistance not only to the youth of this
country but to the people generally.

The motion was agreed to, and the bill was

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck moved the second

reading of Bill 0-11, an Act respecting
Canadian Slovak Benefit Society.
He said: Honourable senators, this is purely
a technical bill. The society was incorporated
in 1945 under the name of the Canadian
Slovak Benefit Society. Under the Canadian
and British Insurance Companies Act-there
is a provision that a certificate entitling the
society to commence business must be taken
out within a period of two years; otherwise,
the incorporation lapses, except for the purposes of winding-up the society's business.
In this instance the certificate was not taken
out in time, and in 1948 I moved for the
passage of a bill extending the period for
two years. The bill was passed, but again
the time expired, and this is the second
occasion on which I have asked for an extension of time to allow this society to commence
business.
The explanation is that the Canadian
Slovak Benefit Society proposes to take over
the business conducted by the National
Slovak Benefit Society, an unincorporated
body, and apparently a good deal of difficulty

Canadians. To me that is a very important
step in the emancipation of the Indian
population.
Although there is little left for me to say
on this subject, because of my interest in
Indians I have made some inquiries of the
department as to the part the Indians have
played in the military life of Canada. In
reply to an inquiry about the number of
enlistments by the Canadian Indians in the
First and Second Great Wars, I have been
informed as follows:

they have undergone vaccination with what
is known as B.C.G., which acts as a preventive and an immunizer against tuberculosis.
This treatment is not new. It was developed
by two French scientists, and for a considerable time was not much in use; but of late
years, particularly in European countries, it
has been employed very extensively. It is
essential that the subject to be vaccinated is
free of tuberculosis. Some three or four years
ago, when a joint parliamenta-ry committee on
health was sitting, a distinguished professor,
from the University of Montreal, I believe,
explained to us how effective this treatment
had proved in the province of Quebec.
Parents are urged, almost compelled, to bring
children to the clinic to receive this treatment within a few days of their birth and
before there is a possibility of contamination.
As the honourable senator from Medicine Hat
(Hon. Mr. Gershaw) knows, the same course
has been followed in Alberta.
I am informed that probably nowhere bas
immunization been made more effective, and
more extensive records kept on the subject,
than in Sweden. I believe that this vaccine
will do much to elim.inate tuberculosis from
our Indian people. It is being administered
also to our white babies. We have reason to
hope that an effective means has been found
to eradicate one of the greatest and most
virulent diseases that our people, and particularly the Indians, have suffered from.
An interesting branch of ethnology, and
one of which I wish I knew more, deals with
the movement of races over various parts of
the world. I suppose the greatest migration that ever took place was from Eastern
Asia, probably over the Behring Straits, to
the North American continent. The land was
desolate and uninhabited, but these immigrants
somehow
crossed the northern
waters and spread themselves over the area
from the Arctic Circle to at least as far south
as the Mexican border. This movement
must have gone on for centuries. It will be
recalled that when Columbus and Cabot discovered this continent they found the land
frorn the far north to the Gulf of Mexico
occupied by Indians who, under most primitive conditions, had established their home
life and their tribal systems over all that
vast territory. One has but to think of this
achievement to realize that these people
possess great qualities, for Nature is pitiless
to those who have not the means, the knowledge and the courage to cope with her.
Were the history of the Indian settlements of
North America known to us, it would be
an inspiring story; but unfortunately these
people had not learned how to record their

achievements, and all we have are the stories
which they handed down from generation to
generation.
The honourable senator from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) has reminded us that we in
Canada have been busily engaged in attempting to protect fur-bearing animals, to conserve the great fisheries of the Fraser river,
and to foster the halibut industry. Is it not
wise and fitting that at this time we should
aid and perpetuate the people who came to
this country and established themselves so
long ago, and who are well worth preserving?
I think this bill might be regarded as a
partial emancipation, and I feel that every
white Canadian bas something to give in
order that our Indian population may enjoy
the same advantages that we give to those
people who come here from Asia and from
Europe.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. King: I am satisfied that there
will be great improvement under this bill.
I am also satisfied that if we educate the
young Indian and give him opportunity
to enjoy the higher standard of living which
is ours today, he will co-operate with us and
play a part in our Canadian life. I have
known a certain lumberman for many years.
During the war when he was short of labour
he went up to James Bay and brought down
a number of Indians and built homes for
them. He bas told me that they are good
workmen in the bush as well as in the sawmill and around the lumber yard. I am sure
that with education and encouragement these
people will become a useful factor in the
development of our great country.
Honourable senators, I am pleased to be
present tonight to endorse the principles
embodied in this bill. I think we should
commend the minister for the great thought
and care he has given to this matter. It was
only after many consultations with the
officers of the department and the Indians
themselves that he introduced this bill; and,
although it may not satisfy everyone, it is a
great step forward in the development and
assimilation of our Indian people. Honourable senators, I think we should abolish the
words "squaw" and "papoose" from our
vocabulary.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.

Vaillancourt:

Honourable

senators, it seems fitting that I should, on
behalf of my fellow citizens of Quebec, join

with my honourable colleagues who spoke
before me in support of our brothers and
predecessors, the Indians.

MAY 28, 1951

It has been said of them that the world
was their kingdom. Well, we have taken
away from them most of that kingdom, so
that anything we can do now to improve the
lot of these first inhabitants of our great
country is sure to be appreciated by all
Canadians.
The record shows that the Indians belong
to a chivalrous race. Our esteemed colleague
from Kootenay East (Hon. James H. King)
told us a moment ago that the valiant Indians
of Canada did not fail their country in its
hour of need. Indeed, during the last war,
approximately 35 per cent of them enlisted
in our armed forces.
Let us continue to protect our Indians. It is
sometimes cl:aimed that they act like overgrown children. Ail the more reason, then,
to look after them. Let us ipay particular
attention to their needs; and inasmuch as it
is the Indians who started to develop our
great country, let us show them that we are
grateful. Since it is they who allowed us to
build this new world and possibly to bestow
upon it the benefits of Christian civilization,
let us recognize our debt and ensure their
proper security. Let us consider this question, and if we can possibly improve their
status, so much the better! Let us take up
the task with constructiveness and with a
spirit of brotherly love: tomorrow, our
Indians will be so grateful to us that they
will no longer harbour any resentment
against us for having conquered them. They
will become, if that is possible, better and
more useful citizens, not only to their own
race but to their country, which is also ours.

Hon. Mr. Robertson:
I have asked the
honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck), who, as I stated last
night, is going to move this motion on my

Hon. C. B. Howard moved the second reading of Bill E-12, an Act to incorporate the
Missisquoi and Rouville Insurance Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
standard bill, exactly the same in its wording
as several bills which have been before us
on previous occasions. It is to legalize the
machinery necessary to transfer from provincial to federal jurisdiction a company which
has been in existence many years. The bill
has been examined by and is perfectly satisfactory to the Superintendent of Insurance.
If it should receive second reading, I shall
move that it be referred to the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills, so that
it may be discussed and examined and its
contents compared with other bills of a
similar nature.

Company bas been in operation in the province of Quebec, with its head office in

company in Canada. Besides doing business
in the two counties of Missisquoi and Rouville, it has operated all over the province of

this purpose, of course, it seeks a federal
charter, and will be subject to federal
jurisdiction.
It is necessary in order to form the new
company, and to include certain provisions

EMPLOYMENT OF CHILDREN AT SEA
MOTION FOR APPROVAL
I.L.O. CONVENTION

OF

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck moved:
That it is expedient that the Houses of Parliament do approve of Convention No. 58, fixing the
minimum age for the admission of children to
employment at sea (revised 1936) adopted by the
General Conference of the International Labour
Organization at its 22nd Session at Geneva on the
24th day of October, 1936, as modified by the Final
Articles Revision Convention, 1946, and that this
Bouse do approve of the same.

He said: Honourable senators, I am privileged and honoured, through the courtesy of
the leader of the government, in having the
opportunity of ex'plaining this resolution.
Although the resolution is a simple one, it
raises questions of considerable interest. The
first is as to the protection of childhood, which
always appeals to the young men of this
chamber.
Some Hon. Senalors: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Parental instincts are
touched whenever children are mentioned.
There is reason too, so far as the sea is concerned, for taking good care of young people
employed aboard ship. After all the world
is large; the sea extends all the way around
it, and masters of ships have traditionally
been high-handed and it is known that great
brutality has at times existed on the sea.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Tut, tut! Nonsense!
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The "Admiral" bas
never observed it, and I am certain that no
brutalities or high-handed methods were ever

MAY 30, 1953
practised on a ship of any description of
which he was in command. Stil I think there
is plenty of substantiation of my statement
that there has been 'brutality on ships at sea.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Certainly there has.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I am sure honourable
senators will agree with me that the protection of very young people at sea is something
that interests and concerns this house and
the public at large.
The motion is interesting also because of
the glamour of the sea. Anything that has ta
do with the sea seems to appeal to people of
our race, who for many centuries have been
living beside the sea.
For many years the International Labour
office has been struggling with the problem of
the employment of very young peoplewhom we may call children-at sea. They
have adopted a succession of conventions. The
explaining of this motion is not without difficulty because, in the first instance, it
involves a clear understanding of the law of
Canada as it now exists, and in the second
instance, an understanding of the convention
which we are asking the Parliament of
Canada to approve, prior to its ratification by
the Government of Canada, and its implementation, if required.
The basic law with regard to children at
sea is to be found in the Canada Shipping
Act, in the Statutes of 1934. It must be
remembered that I am trying now to describe
the law as it stands in Canada and not as the
resolution may affect it. You will find in
section 279 of the Canada Shipping Act, this
provision:
(1) No child, being a person under fourteen
years of age shall be employed in any vessel except
ta the extent ta which and in the circumstances
in which such employment is permitted under the
Convention set out in Part I of the First Schedule
hereto.

Observe that this refers to children under
fourteen years of age.
(2) This section shall not apply ta a vessel in
which only members of one family are employed.
(3) No young person nat being a child and
being a person under eighteen years of age shall
be employed or work as a trimmer or stoker in
any vessel except
(a) in a school ship or training ship where the
work is of a kind approved by the minister, and is
carried on subject ta such supervision as the
minister may approve;
(b) in a vessel which is mainly propelled otherwise than by means of stean; . . .

Then jumping to subsection (6):
No young person under eighteen years of age
shall be employed in any capacity in any vessel
unless there has been delivered ta the master of the
vessel a certificate granted by a duly qualified
medical practitioner certifying that such person is
fit ta be employed in that capacity.

The convention:, which become schedules
to the Act, and the relevant sections, are
iprinted with the Act but add little to it.
Article 2 provides:
Children under the age of fourteen years shall
nat be employed or work on vessels other than
vessels upon which only members of the same
family are employed.

This is already covered by the Act.
Article 3 reads:
The provisions of Article 2 shall not apply ta
work done by children on school-ships or trainingships, provided that such work is approved and
supervised by public authority.

This provision is even more drastic in the
Act than it is in the convention.
Article 4 reads:
In order to facilitate the enforcement of the provisions of this convention, every shipmaster shall be
required ta keep a register of ail persons under the
age of sixteen years employed on board his vessel,
or a iist of them in the articles of agreement, and
of the dates of their births.

In Part III-the draft convention fixing
the minimum age for the admission of young
persons to employment as trimmers or
stokers-Article 3 reads:
The provisions of Article 2 shail not apply:
(a) to work done by young persons on schoolships or training-ships, provided that such work is
approved and supervised by public authority;
(b) ta the employment of young persons on
vessels mainly propelled by other means than
steam; . . .

That was the law in 1934, and I can assure
you that it was in full compliance with the
international conventions of that date.
In 1948 Canada passed an amendment to
the Canada Shipping Act, which reads as
follows:
Subsection one of section two hundred and
seventy-nine is repealed and the following substituted therefor:
No child, who for the purposes of this section is
a person under fifteen years of age,-

Observe that it is fifteen years, not fourteen.
-shall be employed in any vessel except ta the
extent ta which and in the circumstances in which
such employment is permitted under the Convention set out in Part I of the First Schedule hereto.

That is the schedule which I have already
read.
So the law was changed in 1948 by raising
the age limit from fourteen to fifteen years.
At that time some teeth were put into the
legislation by adding as subsection 11 to the
above section, the following:
Every person who violates this section is guilty
of an offence and is liable ta a fine not exceeding
one hundred dollars or ta imprisonment for a
terin not exceeding three months or ta both fine
and imprisonment.

That is the law as it stands today.

SENATE
We corne now to the convention, of the
International Labour Organization, to which
I referred. I should make clear the fact that
a convention of this kind, even though it is
approved by this house and ratified by
parliament, does not by such action only
become the law of Canada. It merely obligates
Canada to implement the provisions of the
convention, by legislation. That is to say,
the legislation need not necessarily use the
words of the convention or adopt all the
exceptions that it provides, but it must live
up to the spirit of the general provisions.
That is my understanding of the effect of
documents of this kind.
May I now lay before the house Convention
No. 58, the convention in question? It is as
follows:
Convention fixing the minimum age for the
admission of children to employment at sea
(Revised 1936).
The Gerneral Conference of the International
Labeur Organization,
Hav ng been convened at Geneva by the governing body of the International Labour Office, and
having met in its twenty-second session on 22
Jctober 1936, and
Having decided upon the adoption of certain
proposals with regard to the partial revision of the
2onvention fixing the minimum age for admission
:f children to employment at sea adopted by the
conference at its second session, the question
orming the agenda of the present session, and
Considering that these proposals must take the
form of an international convention, adopts this
twenty-fourth day of October of the year one
thousand nine hundred and thirty-six the following convention, which may be cited as the
Minimum Age (Sea) Convention (Revised), 1936:
Article 1
For the purpose of this convention, the term
"vessel" includes all ships and boats, of any nature
navigation,
maritime
in
engaged
whatsoever,
whether publicly or privately owned; it excludes
ships of war.
Article 2
1. Children under the age of fifteen years shall
not be employed or work on vessels, other than
vessels upon which only members of the same
family are employed.
2. provided that national laws or regulations may
provide for the issue in respect of children of not
less than fourteen years of age of certificates permitting them to be employed in cases in which an
educational or other appropriate authority designated by such laws or regulations is satisfied, after
having due regard to the health and physical condition of the child and to the prospective as well
as to the immediate benefit to the child of the
employment proposed, that such employment will
be beneficial to the child.

Honourable senators will observe that that
exception is not provided for in the law of
Canada, as I have read it. Other than the
proposed change that the minimum age be
fifteen instead of fourteen years, section 2 of
Article 2 contains the major change provided
by the convention which we are now asked
to approve.

The convention continues:
Article 3
The provisions of Article 2 shall not apply to work
done by children on school-ships or training-ships,
provided that such work is approved and supervised by public authority.
Article 4
In order to facilitate the enforcement of the
provisions of this convention, every shipmaster shall
be required to keep a register of all persons under
the age of sixteen years employed on board his
vessel, or a list of thern in the articles of agreement,
and of the dates of their births.
Article 5
This convention shall net corne into force until
after the adoption by the International Labour
Conference of a convention revising the convention
fixing the minimum age for admission of children
to industrial employment, 1919, and a convention
revising the convention ccncerning the age for
admission of children to non-industrial employment,
1932.

That has been done.
Continuing:
Article 6
The formal ratifications of this convention shall be
communicated to the Director-Geineral of the International Labour Office for registration.
Article 7
1. This convention shall be binding only upon
those members of the International Labour Organization whose ratifications have been registered
with the Director-General.
2. Subject to the provisions of Article 5 above it
shall corne into force twelve months after the date
on which the ratifications of two members have
been registered with the Director-General
3. Thereafter, this convention shall corne into
force for any member twelve months after the date
on which its ratification has been registered.
Article 8
As soon as the ratifications of two members of
the International Labour Organization have been
registered, the Director-General of the International
Labour Office shall so notify all the members of the
International Labour Organization. He shall likewise notify them of the registration of ratifications
which may be communicated subsequently by other
members of the organization
Article 9
1. A member which has ratified this convention
may denounce it after the expiration of ten years
from the date on which the convention first comes
into force, by an act communicated to the DirectorGeneral of the International Labour Office for
registration Such denunciation shall not take effect
until one year after the date on which it is
registered.
2. Each member which has ratified this convention and which does not, within the year following
the expiration of the period of ten years mentioned
in the preceding paragraph, exercise the right of
denunciation provided for in this Article, will be
bound for another period of ten years and, thereafter, may denounce this convention at the expiration of each period of ten years under the terms
provided for in this Article.
Article 10
At the expiration of each period of ten years after
the coming into force of this convention, the governing body of the International Labour Office shall

MAY 30, 1951
present to the General Conference a report on the
working of this convention 'and shall consider the
desirability of placing on the agenda of the conference the question of its revision in whole or in
part.
Article 11
1. Should the conference adopt a new convention
revising this convention in whole or in part, then,
unless the new convention otherwise provides,
(a) the ratification by a member of the new
revising convention shall ipso jure involve the
immediate denunciation of this convention, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 9 above, if
and when the new revising convention shall have
come into force;
(b) as from the date when the new revising
convention comes into force this convention shall
cease to be open to ratification by the members.
2. This convention shall in any case remain in
force in its actual form and content for those members which have ratified it but have not ratified the
revising convention.
Article 12
The French and English texts of this convention
shal both be authentic.
The foregoing is the authentic text of the Minimum Age (Sea) Convention (Revised), 1936, as
modified by the Final Articles Revision Convention,
1946.
The original text of the convention was authenticated on 5 December, 1936, by the signatures of
Paal Berg, President of the Conference, and Iarold
Butler, Director of the International Labour Office.
The convention first came into force on 11 April,
1939.

That, gentlemen, is the convention that we
are asked to approve. It provides that no
child under the age of fifteen years be
employed aboard ship, with the exception-if
I may repeat-that:
. . . national laws or regulations may provide
for the issue in respect of children of not less
than fourteen years of age of certificates permitting them to be employed in cases in which an
edfucational or other appropriate authority designated by such laws or regulations is satisfied, after
having due regard to the health and physical
condition of the child and to the prospective as
well as to the immediate benefit to the child of the
employment proposed. that such employment will
be beneficial to the child.

I submit to honourable senators that
Canada has already complied with the terms
of this convention. In 1948 the minimum age
was raised to fifteen years, but we have not
adopted the exception to which I have just
referred. It seems obvious to me that an
exception is not necessarily taken advantage
of; in other words, we have gone further than
the convention provides, and I should hope
that we will not take advantage of the exception. It has been pointed out elsewhere that
it would open the door to the exploitation of
children between the ages of fourteen and
fifteen years; and as far as Canada is concerned its adoption is unnecessary.
There is in the Canadian law a proviso
with respect to employment when a whole
family takes part in the operation of a ship.
My general knowledge in this regard is not

sufficient to tell the house whether such
operations take place in Canada, but I know
it is the custom in some parts of the world,
in the carrying trade between ports, for a
whole family, as a family, to take over a
junk and operate it, so that from babyhood
the members of the family live on a ship,
and as soon as they can perform any useful
work in connection with the operation of the
ship, they do so. When the international
convention was under discussion it was
thought inappropriate that we should interfere with that state of things. There could
be no real objection to it. I do not know that
it exists in Canada. The provision is in our
laws as well as in the convention, but at the
moment it is not a matter of great interest.
Upon ratification of the convention by the
government, after approval by the two houses
of Parliament, these will be our obligations:
1. To communicate ratification to the
Director of the International Labour Office.
2. To take such action as is necessary to
give effect, by legislation or otherwise, to
the provisions of the convention, if that has
not been done.
3. To make periodic reports to the International Labour Office on the measures taken
to give effect to the provisions of the
convention.
You will have observed that the obligation
is a continuing one, and that the ,conventions
when ratified last for a period of ten years;
that unless some action is then taken, they
are renewed from time to time for ten year
periods.
So far as the fifteen-year age limit is
concerned, it is very moderate compared with
similar provisions in other laws. For instance,
our Family Allowances Act requires, under
penalty of cessation of the allowance, that
the child shall attend school until the age
of sixteen.
Honourable members will note that the
convention came into effect upon ratification
by two members. That took :place in the
year 1939. The question, of course, bas been
asked 'why is it only now that we have
undertaken to ratify a convention which
others ratified in 1939 and which -came into
effect in 1936? The answer is that usually
there is a delay of anywhere from two to
four years in the ratification of conventions
because of the necessity of detailed study by
governments and statesmen of the countries
affected, and that was the -case in connection with this undertaking. As honourable
senators know, the Second Great War broke
out in 1939, and nothing was done with the
International Labour Organization during
the hectic war years until 1945.
Then

SENATE
Canada tuok action, and in 1946 the statute
was amended, in the form that I have read,
to raise the age from fourteen to fifteen
years.
Hon. Mr. Vien:

Was that in 1946, or 1948?

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I thank the honourable
senator. It was in 1948 that we made the
change. Now, having complied substantially
with the terms of the convention, we are
ready to ask the approval of parliament and
then to ratify the convention. Thereafter, if
the government sees fit, it may bring in
legislation to introduce the exception to
which I have referred, and to which I object;
but I do not think it is likely to do so. I
believe we have now gone as far as is
necessary to fully implement the convention.
Will the honourable
Hon. Mr. Vien:
senator allow a question? What benefit can
accrue from ratification at this time, since
we have already-in 1948-implemented by
special legislation the main objects of the
convention?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Well, we are members
of the International Labour Organization;
we took part in their deliberations; and it
seems, te me at least, courtesy as well as
good business to join others in the ratification of conventions which we are actually
assuming.
Hon. Mr. Vien: My point is this: Why is it
necessary to do that, when in 1948 we passed
legislation which practically covers, and
indeed improves, the convention itself?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Why is it necessary to
ratify?
Hon. Mr. Vien:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Observe, gentlemen,
that already ten countries have ratified the
convention and bound themselves, each one
to the others, to carry it out. Why would we
not ratify such a convention, which we are
asking other countries to adopt?
Hon. Mr. Paterson: We already have done
so.

The countries that have already ratified
this convention are: Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, France, Iraq, the Netherlands, New
Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and the United
States of America. The United Kingdom is
in the same position as we are: it bas not

recently it passed the required legislation,
and I have no doubt it will ratify the convention in due season, and endeavour to get
others to ratify this and other conventions of
a similar humanitarian character, so that the
law may become as standard, as uniform and
as widely applied as possible. That, I think,
is the real purpose of these proceedings.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Will the honourable senator
allow me to put my question a little
differently?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Vien: In passing the legislation
in 1948, when this convention, dated 1936,
was before us, why was not the convention
ratified concurrently with that legislation?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That question I 'cannot
answer. The delay from 1948 to the present
moment is not great.

Hon. Mr. Vien: I am trying to find what
benefit can accrue from our present action,
when we have already implemented by
specific legisliation the purposes of the convention. Why was not this convention ratifled
when the legislation was before parliament
in 1948?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I cannot answer that
question; but the delay, as I have pointed out,
meant nothing. It is true that we could have
ratified the convention immediately following the passing of the Act. Perhaps some
officials have been negligent in the matter.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I wonder if the honourable senator has any knowledge of what
advantage the other member countries of this
convention have taken, if any, of the age

the proposed revision might result in discrimination
against the shipping industry in Canada.

I also have before me the record of proceedings of the International Labour Conference, twenty-first session and twentysecond session, Geneva, 1936. I thought it
might be interesting to point out the paragraph relating to Canada:

of boys between the ages of fourteen and
fifteen without a complete medical examination. I should like to see the government
pass such legislation. It takes a person a
long time to learn the shipping business.
Hon. Mr. Duff: What!
Hon. Mr. Horner: An amazing number of
crimes are being committed across our
country by boys around fourteen years of
age. Idleness is perhaps one of the main
reasons for these crimes, and I certainly
think that these boys could be well employed
aboard ship. I hope that if we pass this
convention there will be some way to make it
possible for healthy young boys to be engaged
in at least part-time work on the sea. My
experience has been that if you are not
taught how to work when you are young the
chances are that you will never become
efficient.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Quite right. Put them to
work early.
The motion was agreed to.

These two eminent statesmen who took
part in the framing of this legislation in
1936 have passed away, but I have no doubt
that if they are looking on now they will be
pleased to see their work approved by the
Parliament of Canada and the convention

This bill provides that the standard be the

Paris. This bar, the most invariable of all
measuring bars to be found in the United
Kingdom, the United States, France, or
Canada, is measured with *a wave-length of

are taken. Only a technician could tell you.
You may ask the difference between the
present Canadian standard of length and
mass and the proposed standjards. For the
present, the Canadian pound and the one
proposed in this bill are similar. As to the
yard, it differs slightly, by less than one part
of one million, from the forner Canadian
basic standard. The difference is so slight
that it has no importance.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: Will the honourable
senator permit a question? How many feet,
or how many inches, will there be in one
yard?
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: Look at the bill:
The standard unit of length for Canada is the
yard which is nine thousand one hundred and
forty-four ten-thousandths of the international
metre.

Hon. Mr. Marcotte: That does not tell me
anything. I would like to know how many
feet or how many inches are in a yard. That
is a very plain question. The honourable
senator says that it is some part of something we do not know anything about; and
as a Canadian I would like to know how
many inches or feet there are to a yard. I
don't know.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Ask Mr. Einstein.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It will be three feet.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: I am as well able to
read as some other honourable senators.
What I am told does not give me an answer.
I ignore it.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: The bill will be
referred to a committee.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I take it that the yard and
the pound will still be used.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The bill will not in any
way commit us to the use of the metre.

80713-33J

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The honourable senator
for Kennebec (Hon Mr. Vaillancourt) has told
us that this bill is going to change the
Canadian yard and the Canadian pound by
so many thousandths or millionths of a
metre or a kilogramme, but he has not told
us whether we shall weigh more or weigh
less, or whether we shall measure more or
measure less.
Hon. Mr. Euler: It will be inflationary,
you may be sure!
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The government in
its wisdom will see that each of us weighs

One would judge from this explanatory
note that this amendment is all the bill contains. Are there other amendments in this

APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 3
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill 353, an Act for granting
to His Majesty certain sums of money for the
public service of the financial year ending
the 31st March, 1952.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
request for further interim supply for the
public service of the present financial year.
The bill provides for the usual one-twelfth
of all items to be voted in the main estimates
for the fiscal year 1951-52, excluding iterms
62, 121, 204, and 470, eleven-twelfths of
which, as honourable senators may recall,
was granted by a previous supply bill. The
general proportion of one-twelfth for all
services is intended to provide for ordinary
requirements to the end of June. The total
of that individual item, honourable senators
is $206,696,711.58. An additional one-twelfth
is required for fourteen special items.
Honourable senators will recall that circumstances sometimes make it necessary to
request special amounts to meet certain
seasonal expenses, or in cases where the
heaviest expenditure is more likely to be
incurred in the early part of the fiscal year
than to be evenly distributed over the entire
year. These special amounts, as was the case
in previous interim supply bills, are required
for such items as quality premiums on highgrade hog carcasses, general administration
costs, and certain obligations of the Department of Mines and Technical Surveys and of
the Department of Resources and Development, with respect to which the heavier part
of the expenditure must be made early in
the year.
Honourable senators, the first item in this
special group is under the general heading
of Agriculture, where an additional onetwelfth of the original vote of $5,536,000 is
required.
A further one-twelfth is required by the
Department of External Affairs to adequately
finance the various missions abroad, and to
cover expenditures abroad on behalf of other
government departments, pending recovery
from the particular departments concerned.
Requirements abroad are heavier this year
than normally.
In the Department of Justice an additional
one-twelfth of $15,000, is required immediately for the payment of gratuities to the

SENATE
widows and other dependants of judges who
died while in office. I am advised that only
a small portion of the present supply of
funds remains unexpended.
A further group of special items appear
under the heading of Department of Mines
and Technical Surveys. Honourable senators
realize that many surveys are carried on by
this department; and, in order to take advantage of as long a season as possible, they
should be under way now.
An additional one-twelfth of $263,473 is
required for the Public Archives. I am
advised that this amount is needed to meet an
overdue payment on a contract for the
purchase of the Levis Papers from Sotheby
Company, London, England, and of papers
belonging to the same collection from an
individual in the United States. These paynAents were due in April.
The amount required for the Department
of Resources and Development is one twelfth
of $381,095.
My information is that this
item has to do with studies and surveys on
the Columbia River watershed in Canada,
and is to enable the department to provide
for the early equipping of survey parties,
and their despatch to the field to take
advantage of as long a season as possible.
The next item has to do with the Canadian
Government Travel Bureau, for which an
is
additional one-twelfth of $1,503,197,
required. This is to cover heavy expenditures
for tourist advertising and publicity in the
early months of the year, and which must be
paid immediately to take advantage of discounts offered for prompt payment.
The final item in this special category is
under the Department of Trade and Commerce, and has to do with the Canadian
International Trade Fair, being held in
Toronto from May 28 to June 9, 1951.
Because of the early date at which the fair
is being held, a large proportion of the
expenditure under this item is necessary at
this time.
The bill provides for a total sum of
$208,274,991.25, of which slightly more than
$1,500,000 represents the additional onetwelfth on the fourteen special and seasonal
items.
I may point out that in form the bill is
exactly the same as the one passed this time
last year, and bills passed in previous years.
Its passage will in no way prejudice the
rights and privileges of honourable senators
to criticize and discuss any item in the
estimates which may come up for consideration from time to time throughout the
remainder of the session; and the usual
undertaking is given that such rights and

privileges will be respected, and will not be
curtailed or restricted in any way as a
result of this measure having been passed.
Hon. John T. Haig: I should like to ask
the honourable leader a question about the
item under External Affairs. Is there any
special reason for the item being increased
this year?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I have no specific
information on that point. The amount of
the original estimate was $4,492,816.
It
seems to me that the amount is somewhat
less than last year. Perhaps some of the
members of the Finance Committee could
advise me on this.
An additional onetwelfth is now required for various expenditures abroad on behalf of other government
departments, pending recovery from the
particular departments concerned. These
have made the immediate requirements
heavier than in other years. I would commend the details of the item to the alert
and efficient Finance Committee which we
have set up.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Thank you.
I should like to refer briefly to the last
item in the special category which the leader
mentioned, that of the Canadian International Trade Fair which opened in Toronto
on Monday last. I attended the fair that
day, and I must say I was disappointed in
not seeing more senators there.
The
distinguished senators from Margaree Forks
(Hon. Mr. MacLennan) and Blaine Lake (Hon.
Mr. Horner) were there, but I saw no others.
In my opinion this Trade Fair is making
a worth-while contribution, and I think
senators should attend. I do not think that
in future this house should sit on the opening
day of the fair. Its members should attend
the fair.
I am not an expert on exhibits, but I do
think that by attending such an exhibition
one learns something of the progress that is
being made in other parts of the world.
There was a fine display of industrial
machinery at the fair, and Japan and
Germany were well represented. It struck
me, however, that there should have been
a larger exhibit of Canadian manufactures.
I think the government, and particularly the
Minister of Trade and Commerce, deserve
great credit for the stimulus they gave to
the organization of this fair. It is performing
a real service for our country. The chief
speaker at the opening was Sir Robert
Sinclair. His address was very notable, but
admirable though it was, I was less
impressed by it than by his remark that
Canada is doing something for the world
and at the same time helping herself. I
would not under-rate the work done by our

MAY 31, 1951
embassies and trade agents in various
countries. Doubtless they do a lot of good.
But an exhibition of this kind is of striking
importance, for it brings people from all
parts of the world to see our country and
what it can produce.
On the opening day the weather was
lovely. Although it rained in Ottawa, the
weather man knew that some distinguished
senators had arranged to visit Toronto and
determined to give us a fine time, so he kept
the rain way. We were all delighted with
our reception at the fair. I am sure that every
senator received an invitation from the promoters; and I suggest that next year we all
make it our business to attend the fair, and
get an idea of what Canada can do and
how trade -can be promoted outside of the
usual channels.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I am very glad to hear
the commendation by the leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) of the great fair
that is being held in Toronto. But why, I
ask, should we postpone our visit till next
year? The fair is -continuing all this week
and, I understand, all next week, and even
though the train service may be none of the
best, it will -carry us to Toronto and back at
a minimum of expense. I am sure the promoters would be very glad to see all honourable senators over the week-end.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: To dispel any misunderstanding which may have arisen as
to the delegation which attended the fair,
I might observe that what it lacked in
numbers it made up in quality.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

Canada whom they represent, wish to own
and operate their own insurance society on
a mutual, non-profit basis.
As indicated in the bill, the guarantees
required before the proposed company can
begin operations will be provided.
In the past the Dominion Government has
seen fit to incorporate companies similar to
the proposed General Insurance Co-operative; in fact this bill is similar to one recently
sponsored by the honourable senator from
Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine). Other organizations which have been similarly incorporated are the Co-operative Life Insurance
Company and the Wheat Pool Insurance
Company, the latter being owned by the three
western wheat pools.
The solicitors for the petitioners, through
personal interviews and exchange of letters
with the Superintendent of Insurance, have
clarified all the essential features.
If the bill receives second reading, I shall
move that it be referred to the Standing
Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills,
where the representatives of the sponsors of
the measure will be in attendance to supply
any further information that is required.

THE LATE SENATORS MORAUD
GLADSTONE

AND

TRIBUTES TO THEIR MEMORY

Hon. Wishar McL. Roberison: Honourable

senators, I regret to have to officially inform
this house of the death of one of our senior
colleagues, the Honourable Lucien Moraud,
K.C., LL.D., who for more than seventeen
years was a representative of the Quebec
division of LaSalle.
Senator Moraud was born in 1885 at
Lotbiniere, Quebec, and was educated at the
Quebec Seminary and Laval University,
graduating with high honours. His distinguished legal career began with his admission
to the Bar in 1909; in 1922 he was created a
King's Counsel; and in 1936 he was named
Bâtonnier général of the Quebec Bar. He
first practised law for a short time in the firm
of Premier Taschereau of Quebec, and at the
time of his death was a member of Moraud,
Alleyn, Grenier and Lemay, a firm established more than forty years ago. Throughout his life our late colleague maintained a
close relationship with his old university. He
was a member of the Law Faculty and of the
Board of Governors of Laval, and in 1949
he was made a Commander of the Order of
St. Gregory the Great in recognition of his
services as co-chairman of the 1948 fund
campaign in aid of Laval.
When named to the Senate in 1933, our late
colleague brought to the councils of the
nation a wide experience in public affairs as
well as academic distinction. At various
times throughout his career he served as
president of the Lake Edward Sanatorium,
director of the Bank of Montreal, of the

Canadian National Railways and of the
Beauharnois Power Corporation, and as
secretary of the Progressive Conservative
Party. He was a delegate to the United
Nations Conference in San Francisco in 1945,
and he represented Canada at the Interparliamentary Conference in London two
years ago.
Senator Moraud is survived by three
brothers and two sisters, to whom we extend
our deepest sympathy.
I need scarcely remind members of this
house of the prominent part played by our
late colleague in our deliberations. Until quite
recently he was a very regular attendant of
the sittings of the Senate and its committees.
His wide experience and the general regard
in which he was held earned general respect
for his opinion by all who came in contact
with him. I personally enjoyed the happiest
relations with him. He will be greatly
missed.
Honourable senators will have been
apprised by now of the sudden passing early
last Friday of our colleague from Wellington
South, the Honourable Robert William
Gladstone.
Senator Gladstone was born in Orford
Township, in Ontario's Kent County in 1879.
He received his education at Ridgetown
Collegiate and the Chatham Model School.
After teaching school for several years he
moved to the West, returning to Guelph in
1908 to establish the Canada Ingot Iron
Company, which he developed into one of the
city's leading industries.
Senator Gladstone's political career commenced in 1935, when be was elected to the
House of Commons for Wellington South. He
was re-elected in 1940 and in 1945, and before
the general election of 1949 announced his
resignation from politics and in September of
that year was summoned to the Senate.
Our late esteemed colleague is survived by
his widow, the former Elizabeth Lyons, and
by a son, John Kenneth, to whom we extend
our deepest sympathy.
Senator Gladstone's passing will be profoundly regretted by all those with whom he
was so long and so closely associated in a
wide variety of humanitarian and charitable
endeavours in his own community. Although
Senator Gladstone had been a member of the
Senate for less than two years, he brought
to his duties here the same diligence and
sense of public duty which characterized his
period of service in the House of Commons,
and indeed his whole life. Up to the day
before his sudden passing he was attending
to his duties in the Senate as usual. Though
some of us had not known him before he
came into the Senate, and had not had the

JUNE 5, 1951
same opportunity of appreciating his many
qualities of heart and mind as those who
had known him longer, all will agree that in
his passing we have lost a sincere, capable
and conscientious public figure.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I find it very difficult to speak tonight about
the late Senator Moraud. He had the peculiar
faculty of being able to draw all men to him:
once you came into contact with him you
immediately became his friend and he became
yours. I feel that I miss Senator Moraud
more than I miss any other man who has
passed from our midst. He possessed something that a man likes to find in another
man-a genuineness that perhaps could be
equalled but not surpassed. He was a great
help to me in carrying on my work as leader
of this side of the house. I could always trust
his judgment. I always knew that what he
told me about conditions in the Province of
Quebec, in business circles or any other
sphere of activity there, was his solid, considered, sane opinion.
Canada is one of the great bilingual nations
of the world, and Senator Moraud was a truly
bilingual son. He loved his mother tongue,
but he loved Canada even more. He recognized that those of us whose mother tongue
is English are just as anxious as those whose
mother tongue is French that our country
should progress.
He loved the Englishspeaking people of Canada as he loved his
own people. Certainly no man who ever
crossed my path has made a greater contribution than he towards the unity of the two
great races in this country. He taught me to
realize that this Canada of ours can only
become a great country if we face all the
problems that confront us in a spirit of unity
and common purpose.
Senator Moraud was a churchman; he loved
his church, and I revere him for it. He loved
his native tongue, he loved his home, he
loved his brothers and sisters, and he loved
his province. He was devoted to the profession of law, of which he was a distinguished
member, and he added lustre to it. He was
also a keen businessman. After the funeral
on Friday the head of one of the institutions
of which our late colleague was a director
said to me, "Well, senator, it will be a long
time before I shall be able to find another
man so familiar with the ideals of the people
I
of Quebec as Senator Moraud was."
entirely agree with that sentiment.
Senator Moraud was one of those men who
have done much to build this Canada of which
we are so proud. He was not, perhaps, the
head of any large institution, but in his life
he exemplified a spirit which, if it becomes
widespread, will make Canada a great nation.
80713-341

I know I speak on behalf of all members
of this house when I express to Senator
Moraud's brothers and sisters and other
relatives, and to his partners and many
friends, our sincere sympathy. I want them
to know that while Lucien Moraud has
received the last call and passed to the Great
Beyond, he leaves behind him a memory that
will be sacred to us as long as we live. His
career will be a splendid example to the
young men and women of his own province.
Born on a farm and raised in humble
circumstances, he rose by his own energy and
ability to positions of eminence in his
province and country, and he served
both well. He was one of the great senators
from the Province of Quebec. I ask his
relatives and friends to remember these things
in the sorrow that they naturally feel at
his passing.
I suppose that I knew the late Senator
Gladstone for a longer period than any
other member of this house. I was first
acquainted with him in 1904, when he lived
in the city of Winnipeg; and, of course,
after he came to Ottawa about sixteen years
ago we renewed old associations. When he
was a young man in business in our city
he showed energy and enterprise; and from
my more recent observation, he was a very
keen student of parliamentary affairs. He
was in this chamber such a short time that
few of us had much opportunity to get to
know him as a senator, therefore I cannot
speak of him in that capacity with the same
degree of intimacy.
To his wife and son I express my very
sincere sympathy. I believe that Mrs. Gladstone was greatly interested in her husband's work here. It was our hope that
he would be spared for some years to devote
his qualities of energy and humanity to the
matters that come before us.
Hon. L. M. Gouin: Honourable senators:
"Here lies a perfect gentleman." Such are
the words which I think should be engraved
on the tombstone of the late Lucien Moraud.
I wish first to pay my sincere respects to
the late Senator Moraud as a lawyer. Our
late colleague, who was admitted to the Bar
of Quebec more than forty years ago, was a
very prominent member of that fraternity,
and in 1936 was Bdtonnier général for the
province. We remember well his qualities
as a jurist in the committees of this house,
where he was always active and played a
very useful part.
The late senator was a most excellent
citizen. The leader of the government (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) mentioned that he was a
professor at his alma mater, Laval University, and that later he was a governor of that
ancient and noble institution of learning; the

SENATE

leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) enumerated
with emotion the roles which he played in
the promotion of national unity. Lucien
Moraud was indeed a good Canadian with a
feeling of brotherhood for everybody, regardless of distinctions of race, creed, class or
political affiliation. He was a good christian,
and was exceedingly generous towards
appeals to his sense of charity or
philanthropy.
Our late -colleague, in addition to his other
attainments, was a successful businessman.
As a Canadian of French origin, I am always
pleased when one of us distinguishes himself
in the world of finance in such a way that
he becomes, like our late colleague, a director
of the Bank of Montreal and a director of
that great insuance company the Les
Prévoyants du Canada. From 1930 to 1933
Senator Moraud was a member of the
executive of the Canadian National Railways.
Finally, Senator Moraud played an interesting part in international affairs. In 1949
he attended the Interparliamentary Conference and in 1945 he was one of the Canadian
representatives at the San Francisco Conference. I remember well the time I spent
with him at the convention of the InterAmerican Bar, held in Washington, in 1942.
There, as in this house and everywhere, his
friendly smile and kindly heart won the
immediate friendship of almost everyone.
Lucien Moraud was a man of great
distinction, an excellent representative of
good old Quebec. With his passing there
disappears from the scene a very distinguished Quebecer. We will remember him
always for his kindness, his remarkable
intelligence and sound
judgment.
To
everyone he was indeed a dear friend. To
his family I extend my most sincere
sympathy.
Hon. W. H. Golding: Honourable senators,
I should like to join with the leader of the
government and the others who have paid
tribute to our two departed colleagues.
I did not meet Senator Moraud until I
became a member of this chamber, but then
I learned to appreciate and admire his
ability. He was a kindly man, a gentleman
in every sense of the word, and well qualified to fill the position he held here. I think
he was a credit to his party and to this
assembly, and I know that we shall all miss
him very much.
I had known our late friend, Mr. Gladstone, since 1935, when he became a member
of the other place, and having been associated with him for many years, both in
the other chamber and in the Senate, I can
speak of him more particularly. The late

Senator Gladstone was one who as a member
of parliament did his utmost for everyone
in his constituency, irrespective of party,
religion or any other affiliations. He was
kind-hearted; and few public men were
more devoted to duty. He was very seldom
absent from the house, or from the sittings
of any committee of which he was a member.
Though for some years he was far from
well, the record discloses how faithfully he
attended to his duties in the other placeand in the Senate since he was appointed
to this body.
It was, I think, a great shock to us all
when, on Friday morning, we learned that
our good friend had passed away. Shortly
after 5 o'clock the previous afternoon, having
heard that he was not well, I went to his
room, and said, "You are not feeling well
today, Bob?" He replied, "I am going out
to the hospital this evening, and I may be
there a week or so, but I think, that after
a rest I will be all right." He did not seem
to be disturbed or upset, and I had no idea
that there was anything seriously the matter
with him.
I want to join with others in extending
to his wife and his son our sympathy. His
death must have come as a great shock to
Mrs. Gladstone, as it did to all of us.
Hon. Iva C. Fallis: Honourable senators, I
should like to associate myself with the
previous speakers in the tributes which they
have paid to both of our late senators.
I would just like to say a word of personal
tribute to the late Senator Moraud, who for
many years was my deskmate and my very
good friend. He was always so kindly and
so genial, so full of the joy of living, that
the Senate seemed to me a brighter place
when he was here. I shall miss him very
much.
I join with those who have already spoken
in extending my very sincere sympathy to
the families of both our late senators.
Hon. Thomas Reid: As the deskmate of the
late Senator Gladstone, it is but fitting that I
should join in the expressions of sorrow at
his sudden passing. I would also associate
myself with those who have referred to the
late Senator Moraud, though I did not have
the honour and privilege of knowing him
well.

intimately. I might mention one characteristic which reveals something of his character. I doubt whether any member of this
chamber other than myseif knew how unwell
he was. In speaking to various senators 1
found that they were surprised to learn that
Senator Gladstone was forbidden to speak in
this chamber because of the danger of a
heart seizure; and I do flot believe he
revealed his weakness or illness to any senator other than myseif. I visited him. in his
room a number of times and he visited me;
it was only in this way that I learn-ed of his
serious condition. The sense of loss we feel
at his passing will be shared by those whom
he represented so worthily.
It is sometimes said that none o! us will
be missed. I believe that statement is untrue,
or at least exaggerated, for there are always
those who miss the friends who are gone,
and I feel sure that ail honourable senators
will feel a sense of loss at the passing of our
two colleagues. I j oin those who have paid
tribute to them, and 1 would express my
sympathy to their bereaved families.

Honourable senators, Lucien Moraud's
name will long be rememberedý. His passing
leaves a breach which will be difficuit to

of my deep respect and true friendship.

I did not know Senator Gladstone too well,
because he only came to the Senate in recent
years, but he impressed me as being an
extremely kind man. I wish to extend to his
family an expression of deep sympathy on
behaif of myseif and ail those from the province of Quebec.

relations between the Crown and the subject.
What it does, in essence, is to abolish the
necessity of obtaining the consent of the
Crown before a subject can take legal proceedings against the Crown in the right of
the Dominion of Canada.
As honourable senators know, actions
against the Crown in the right of Canada
are begun by a document called a petition
of right, and they are commenced in the
Exchequer Court of Canada. As matters stand
today, and as they have stood from time beyond which the memory of man runneth not,
a petitioner cannot proceed any further with
his petition of right unless and until he
obtains the consent of the Crown to his proceeding against it. That consent is given in
the form of a document called a fiat, the
purport of which is to say, "Let right be
done".
The present section of the Petition of Right
Act which deals with this is section 4, which
says:

JUNE 5, 1951
Section 19 enumerates ten other classes of
actions which can be taken by the subject
against the Crown in the Exchequer Court,
including this very important one:
Every claim against the Crown arising out of any
death or injury to the person or to property resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of
the Crown while acting within the scope of his
duties or employment.

I think it is safe to say that the whole
tendency in modern times has been gradually
to assimilate the Crown to the ordinary litigant, the subject who has a claim against a
fellow-subject, and step by step to remove
the various privileges which the Crown
originally possessed, and make the Crown
liable like any other litigant for wrongs
which it may have committed. This bill is
one more step in that process.
I am quite sure that the bill will be welcome to honourable senators. Perhaps the
house will remember another step which was
taken in the same direction in the Statute
Law Amendment Act of 1950, which I had
the honour to explain to the house. That Act,
it will be recalled, places virtually all Crown
corporations in the position of being amenable to the jurisdiction of the courts in the
same way as ordinary corporations. If I
remember rightly, upon the discussion of that
bill several honourable senators expressed
the view that the issue of a fiat upon a petition of right should be abolished. This point
was made particularly, I believe, by the
honourable member from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck). I said at that time that
perhaps half a loaf was better than no bread.
Well, we got half the loaf at that time, and
we have at least another slice now.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: A small slice.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: A small slice, yes, but
a slice. I recommend .this bill to the serious
consideration of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I move the adjournment
of the debate.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Why adjourn the
debate?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Before I speak I should
like to review what the honourable senator
from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) has said.

Hon. Mr. Buchanan moved concurrence in

The motion was agreed to.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved the third reading of the bill.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
after sitting on the committee which considered this bill, and listening to the speeches
which have been made in connection with it,
I feel it my duty to say that I am not at all
satisfied with this legislation. I am afraid it
will turn out to be very confusing in many
respects.
Although the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) made a very
fine speech on this subject, I do not agree
with his remark that the Indian never takes
thought for the morrow. I would have liked
better a bill to entirely emancipate the
Indian and put him in a position to engage
freely in enterprise. In this way he might
have become an example to save us from the
fate which seems to be looming ahead of
us, namely, that all of us will become wards
of the government. I doubt whether we,
under the same circumstances that the
Indian had to meet, would have done any
better than he did.
I have lived in northern Saskatchewan for
forty-five years. I remember when I first
went there how interesting it was to meet
members of the Indian tribes and listen to
their stories of how they had faced and
survived the difficulties of existence when
they had the country to themselves.
The estimate made by the honourable
senator from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr.
Gershaw) of the size of the Indian population in former days is, I suggest, no more
than a guess. There is no way of computing
the number of Indians on the North
American continent before the coming of the
white man, though we know something of
the ills and misfortunes they suffered as a
consequence.
Some time ago I was visiting Kansas City,
the centre of a great and fertile country in
which the Indians have become quite
prosperous, mainly through the growing of
corn. In the 'city park stands a beautiful
monument, erected by the citizens, depicting
a lone Indian scout seated on a horse. It
seems to me that we in Canada would do
well to erect some public memorial of this
kind to honour the memory of the great
Indians portrayed in Canadian history, and
the record of the Indian race.
In the early days, some ninety years or so
ago, many Scotsmen who left their native
land to man Hudson's Bay posts in the north
country married pure-blooded Indian worm.en.

The honourable senator from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) was somewhat concerned
about the provisions dealing with intoxicants
and the sale of liquor to Indians. Upon the
request of a province the Governor in Council
may permit Indians to buy liquor in cocktail
bars, beverage rooms and beer parlours in
that particular province, but the Indians may
not purchase liquor or beer to be consumed

refer briefiy to some of the things mentioned
by the honourable senator from Inkerman.
The present law on this subject is contained in chapter 158, Revised Statutes of
Canada, 1927, as amended, and is kncwn as
the Petition of Right Act. The Act contains
three definitions which in my opinion are
quite important. "Court" is defined as the
Exchequer Court of Canada, which has
exclusive jurisdiction in this matter; "judge"
is defined as a judge of that court; and
"relief" includes every species of relief over
which the Exchequer Court, under the
Exchequer Court Act, chapter 34, R.S.O.,
1927, has jurisdiction.
That juriediction,
honourable senators, is more or less limited.
It goes far enough in some respects, and in
at least in one respect, which was briefly
mentioned yesterday by the senator from
Inkerman-I refer to section 19 (c) of the
Exchequer Court Act, with which I will deal
later on-it goes too far. The honourable
senator stated very clearly that before
any action can be commenced a fiat of the
Governor General is required, and that in

any event only such actions as are enumerated in the Exchequer Court Act can be
instituted against the Crown. The nature of
these actions was outlined fully in the other

on the Prime Minister, because he is now,
I understand, in favour of these amendments.
In his speech yesterday the honourable
senator from Inkerman briefiy sketched
some of the historical background of the
right to proceed against the Crown. He
stated, I think, that all our courts were
King's Courts, and that they were established
by the Crown for the purpose of trials
between subject and subject. But it was
established as long ago as the thirteenth
century that the King could not be tried in
any matter whatsoever in his own court.
The ruling doctrine was embodied in a
maxim cited yesterday by the sponsor of
this bill, that "the King can do no wrong".
If the King can do no wrong, no action can
be taken against him, even though the Crown
were to commit some offence against a subject whereby that subject was damaged.
But in the sixteenth century some advance
was made. It was then decided that in
matters of contract suits could be brought
against the King, with his permission, which
of course was accorded through petition of
right. Thereafter actions of this kind were
allowed to be heard upon the issue of a fiat
which directed that justice be done. Honourable senators will realize, however, that no
action was allowed against the Crown for
a tort of .any kind.
Hon. Mr. Euler: What is a tort?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: A tort is a wrong
committed by someone, which in most cases
gives the offended party a right of action for
damages. It is a term that is usedHon. Mr. Euler: Among the lawyers?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: -in the legal profession.
Hon. Mr. Haig: As opposed to contracts.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Yes, as opposed to
action on the performance of a contract or
something of that kind.
In 1947 a bill dealing with this subject was
passed in the British House of Lords. It was
known as the Crown Proceedings Bill. However, before dealing with that I wish to say
that there was a very fine debate on this
subject in the other house last Monday, and
I hope that bonourable senators who have not
read that debate will do so. Among the
fine speeches made, was one by my friend, the
member for Lake Centre, Saskatchewan. I
am indebted to him for the inspiration for
some of the remarks which I am about to
make in connection with the Crown Proceedings Bill and other matters. I hope that
honourable senators will bear with me if my
remarks seem to be more or less a repetition
of the debate that took place in the other
house.

I have in my hand the Parhiamentary
Debates of the House of Lords, covering a
period of a little more than a month during
March and April of 1947. This report contains the whole history of the Crown Proceedings Bill, which was originated in the House
of Lords by the Lord Chancellor of that day.
I was surprised to find that the House of
Lords does so much work.
I was pleased yesterday that before moving
second reading, the sponsor of the bill now
before us informed this honourable chamber
that the Governor General had given his consent to the measure being passed. In my
opinion that was the proper time and place to
make such an announcement because when
second reading of the Crown Proceedings
Bill was moved in the British House of Lords,
the Lord Chancellor, Viscount Jowitt, had this
to say:
My Lords, in moving the second reading of this
bili, I have it in command to acquaint the house
that His Majesty the King, having been informed
of the contents of the Crown Proceedings Bill, is
prepared to place the interests of the Crown at the
disposai of parliament in connexion with the bill

That is exactly what the honourable senator
from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) did
yesterday, and I think he was quite in order
in doing so. As a matter of fact, I doubt very
much whether the bill could be legally passed
if that consent had not been given.
The honourable gentleman from Inkerman
did not say so, but for centuries this granting
of a fiat has been one of the prerogatives of
the Crown; and before a prerogative can be
taken away from the Crown by a legislature
or by a parliament such as ours, the consent
of the Crown must be obtained in some form
or other, either directly or through the
Governor General-as in this case-and the
house rnust be adivised to that effect.
Prior to the passing of the Crown Proceedings Bill in England a subject was only able
to sue the Crown in matters of contract. That
bill, however, applied to torts of all kinds as
well. The whole subject has been one of
great importance in Britain for many years,
and I should like to read a few words from
the speech of the Lord Chancellor:
It was in 1921-that is more than twenty-five years
ago-that the then Lord Chancellor, the Earl of
Birkenhead; obviously thinking that steps should
be taken to make the Crown liable alike in contract and in tort, set up a committee. That committee originally consisted of twenty-four people,
and it was indeed an au-star cast. There never
has been a stronger committee appointed, and they
started their work in 1921. I see In front of me my
noble friend Lord Schuster. He was Chairman of
the sub-committee of the committee, and everybod'y
who knows that noble Lord, and knows his eagerness and his energy, is aware that he was not
designed by nature to drive fat oxen. Yet, my
Lords, that committee sat through the years 1921.
1922, and 1923, until in 1924 Lord Haldane had

SENATE
become Lord Chancellor.
Lord Haldane said:
"Never mind about considering whether it is desirable that the Crown should become liable alike in
contract and in tort; assume it to be desirable and
feasible, and prepare a bill for me."

Honourable senators will note that this
important matter had been under consideration by the British Parliament for quite a
number of years.
The Lord Chancellor then goes on to say
this:
Here was the most distinguished committee ever
appointed; it sat for nearly six years, and then
produced a bill which I am bound to say was not
a very satisfactory bill. Yet any single one of that
committee, had they devoted themselves to this
question for six months, would have been able to
produce a far more satisfactory bill. There the
matter was left. Some two years later I became
Attorney-General, and I found this bill.
I was
advised by the then parliamentary draftsmen that
the bill in the 1927 form was not satisfactory, and
I suspect that all my predecessors in this office have
received the same advice. I further found there
were great misgivings about the bill on the part of
the service departments.

That would be the army, navy and air force.
I found, too, that amongst some very distinguished
lawyers on the opposition side of the house there
were even greater misgivings. We were able to do
nothing then, and it is a fact that from that date
to this nothing has been done in the way of introducing or carrying forward any bill dealing comprehensively with this subject.

I found that very interesting, so I looked
up Lord Tennyson's poem, The Charge of the
Light Brigade, where I find these words in
stanza No. 2:
"Forward, the Light Brigade!"
Was there a man dismayed?
Not tho' the soldier knew
Some one had blunder'd:
Their's not to make reply,
Their's not to reason why,
Their's but to do and die:
Into the valley of Death
Rode the six hundred.

History seems to indicate that somebody
blundered; that the order was not to charge
the Russian guns but to move forward, or
something of that kind.
It is interesting to note from the next page
of this report that the present Lord Raglan,
a descendant of the Lord Raglan who was
at the battle of Balaclava, raised a question
as to whether or not his great-grandfather
had blundered. He said:
The noble and learned viscount having referred
to my great grandfather by name, I would just like
to say that his responsibility for the charge of the
Light Brigade is not regarded by historians as by
any means so certain as the noble and learned
viscount suggested.

Here is another example given by the Lord
Chancellor:

Lord Raglan (I think it was), to recover damages under section 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court
Act, which was read yesterday by the senator
on the ground that Lord Raglan had blundered?

JUNE 6, 1951
from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen), the
Exchequer Court has just announced judgment to the effect that in spite of the compensation payable to a soldier's relatives by
way of pension, or otherwise, the Crown is
liable for some $20,000 damages to the relatives of a man who was killed as a result of
negligence of his officer, who drove a car into
a train somewhere near the city of Montreal.
That decision was handed down on about the
17th of May, and I believe that the Department of Justice is considering appealing it.
If the decision goes against the government
I presume that parliament will be asked to
amend the statute so that it will not cover
matters of that kind. In my opinion our Act
shouldi make all types of actions against the
Crown possible, except actions in connection
with the army, navy and air force.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Perhaps the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police also should be
excepted.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Yes, in the same way
exactly.
Honourable senators will see that the
English Act, which provides for all forms
of actions except the two I have mentionedagainst the Post Office for wrongdoing in
transmission of messages, and against the
army, navy and air force in certain types of
cases-is much wider in scope than our
Exchequer Court Act. The English Act
covers actions for such torts as trespass,
assault, false arrest, false imprisonment,
malicious prosecution, libel and slander and
so on. It is questionable whether we should
not remodel our Exchequer Court Act with
a view to making its scope as wide as that
of the British Act. But, as I say, I would
exempt the Crown from liability so far as
the army, navy and air force are concerned.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask my honourable friend a question? I am not a lawyer,
and I am interested to know just how far this
bill goes. I gather that even if we made our
Exchequer Court Act as wide as the British
Act, any actions against the Crown would
still have to be brought in the Exchequer
Court. I take it that you would like to have
the law amended so that a subject could
take action against the Crown in an ordinary
court.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I am coming to that.
In my opinion our Act should be broadened
so as to make possible all types of actions
against the Crown, except actions arising
in connection with the army, navy and air
force. I think that section 19 (c) of the
Exchequer Court Act should be amended
to this effect. I suggest also that we should

be allowed to .proceed against the Crown
in any Canadian court.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aselfine: The Crown bas the
privilege of proceeding against the subject
in any court, but my understanding of the
law is that when it proceeds in a court
other than the Exchequer Court of Canada
the subject has no right to counterclaim, and
is therefore at a disadvantage.
Some of
the lawyer members of this house who have
had more experience in this field than I
have, will no doubt correct me if I am
wrong. If my understanding is right, the
Crown could proceed against the subject in
the Court of King's Bench, a district court
or the supreme court of a province; but the
subject having no right to counterclaim, and
thereby raise all the defences open to him,
would be at a disadvantage.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Previously he had to
get a fiat, but under this bill he will be able
to proceed without one.
But a subject can
Hon. Mr. Aseltine:
only sue in the Exchequer Court.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is true.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I am talking about a
case in which the Crown takes action against
a subject in a court other than the Exchequer
Court, as it has the right to do.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Then he will need a
fiat.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No, without a fiat.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: A fiat is still required.
The king does not
Hon. Mr. Aseltine:
need a fiat to sue.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The subject will require
a fiat to counterclaim.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I understand that the
subject does not have the right to counterclaim unless the action is in the Exchequer
Court. However, my point is that I should
like to see the jurisdiction of the Exchequer
Court abolished altogether in suits against
the Crown, so that such actions could be
taken in the ordinary courts with which we
are all more familiar.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Another matter which
I should like to mention briefly is the production of documents. From my reading on the
subject, it appears to me that there are cases
in which the Crown, or a minister of the
Crown, has claimed that certain documents
were privileged, and that it was not in the
public interest to disclose them on the hearing of the case. The court on many occasions

SENATE

has upheld this view. In other cases the
documents have been ordered produced, and
the judge has taken upon himself the
responsibility of deciding whether or not they
were privileged. In my opinion, this whole
matter should be cleared up either by way of
amendment to the Exchequer Court Act or
by the insertion of a rule of procedure to
allow for the adequate production of
documents.
This legislation has become necessary, in
my opinion, because of the growing tendency'
to set up Crown corporations. We have
Crown corporations and government boards
here, there and everywhere, and the rights
of the individual are being encroached upon.
As was mentioned yesterday, the Statute Law
Amendment Act of last year was a step in the
right direction; I hope that it will be
extended. With the increase of Crown activities, the old principles and immunities have
gone by the board, and if the subject is to
be able to defend himself or to take action
for damages, whether for tort or anything of
that kind, he must not have his hands tied.
Those, honourable senators, are all the
remarks I have to make on this subject.
Needless to say, I am very much in favour of
the bill but I should like to see it go a
step further on the question of exclusive
jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court. However, the reform embodied in the bill before
us, is a very important one, and one which I
have advocated for many years.

Hon. Mr. Hardy: It is based on the same
old tradition, because when there is garnishee,
the government is brought in as a party, and
in that way a fiat would be required. I am
quite sure the Governor General could issue
a fiat in the case of a garnishee, if he chose,
but unless the general law were changed it
would be impracticable.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: As I say, no fiat is
required in the Province of Saskatchewan. I
know that there are miany unsatisfied claims
against federal employees and that they never
will be satisfied because there is no way of
attaching money that is owing to these
people by the Crown.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: On account of this 700year-old law.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: On account of the fact

that we have no law regarding such garnishee
proceedings.
Hon. A. W. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
I have very little to say on this subject,

except to remark that long years of advocacy
have come to a successful head in this bill,
and to express my entire approval of the
bill and my intense satisfaction in seeing
these ancient cobwebs swept away.
I should like to congratulate the last
speaker (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) on his erudite and
interesting address on this subject. We are
indebted to him for the investigation he bas
made and for the fine thoughts he expressed.
I go along with him in his desire for an

present law as to the responsibility of an
officer to his man in the event of -a mistake,
or of one soldier to another, or of a soldier
against the department, or of an individual
against the department, it should be made
by a change of the substantive law; but if
the party has a right, access to the court to
maintain that right should not be denied.
The production of documents is, of course,
a matter of great difficulty. In parliament
an application for the Crown to produce a
document is not sustained by the Speaker
if a minister of the Crown informs the house
that it is not in the interests of the nation
to produce the document. Surely in court
procedure the same right and confidence
should be placed in the minister. It is simply
impossible to allow any individual who
chooses to bring an action to force the production, merely on the strength of the action,
of Crown documents which ministers assure
us it is not in the interests of the nation to
produce. That would bring about a condition in the management of departments
which might lead to the concealing of documents, and that would be highly undesirable.
Se we must leave it either to the judge or te
the minister of the Crown to determine
without the consent of the litigants whether
or not a document may be produced, and rely
upon his bona fides to produce it when it
should be produced, and! te refuse to produce
it when it shduld not be produced.
Of course I arn delighted with this bill,
because it sweeps away what may be termed
ancient superstitions, cobwebs of the past,
all traditions and shibboleths such as "the
King can do no wrong." Well the King can
do no wrong now. That principle is as alive
today as it was in the time of King George
the Third, but the immunity does net extend
today to the servants of the Crown. That is
the point. Today the Crown stands on a
pedestal. In the person of the sovereign it
is not criticized, it is not attacked. But the
King's servants may be attacked, and they
have no
right, by invoking ancient
shibboleths, te hide in a coward's castle and
refuse te submit te the jurisdiction of the
King's own courts. It is to abolish that kind
of thing that we are about to pass this bill.
Let nobody think that the granting of a
fiat was a mere matter of procedure, a formality. Someone has said that for the past
number of years a fiat has never been refused
in the city of Ottawa. I do not know that this
is a fact, but I will accept it as such if somebody who is informed tells me se. But I
have some experience of my own in connection with the granting of a fiat. I remember
that a client of my own law office, a woman,
while stepping off a curb was struck by a
motorcycle, ridden by an army sergeant, and

was thrown down and injured. On the principle of respondeat superior,we applied for a
fiat to sue the soldier's employer. A very long
time passed before we got that fiat. Meanwhile, the time allowed by the Highways
Act for the bringing of an action had expired;
and I remember that I wrote to the minister
in charge and said that, in view of the fact
that the time had been expended by the
Crown itself in deciding whether it would
give a fiat, I assumed he would net plead the
Statute of Limitations when the case came
to trial. The answer I received was that
the Crown would stand upon all its defences.
So the action was never brought.
Obstacles of that kind, which perhaps are
outmoded and outdated, and looked upon as
mere forms, had better be cleared away.
If they are no good, then they are evil. If
they are not serving a good purpose, usually
they serve a bad purpose. So, while this evil
of obstruction may have been moderated by
the wisdom of those administering the law,
it is better out of the way. The very words
of the fiat, "Let right be done" seem te my
mind to imply the opposite, "Let wrong be
done", when a fiat is refused. The. very
necessity of asking a litigant whether a
plaintiff may sue, se making it difficult te
enter the courts, is an evil. There should
be an open door to our courts, and no one
doing business in our community should
enjoy any special privileges or immunities.
Al should stand up and take their medicine
like men. I am glad that the Department
of Justice has taken its courage in its hands
by consenting te submit the rights of the
Crown to the courts, in the same way as the
rights of the individual are submitted. We
live by the rule of law, and no one should be
more ready te submit te the rule of law
than he who makes the law.
Once again may I express my congratulations te the honourable senator who presented this bill. I envy him the responsibility which he bas carried, and the distinction
which comes te any member of parliament
in piloting a bill of this kind through our
house.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators,
there is an old saying that certain people rush
in where angels fear te tread. Net being a
lawyer I am perhaps presumptuous in saying
a word or two about this bill.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Net at all.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I am net approaching the
matter from the specialized point of view of
the lawyer, but from the point of view of
plain, ordinary common sense. We have
been told that this is a step in the direction
of putting servants of the Crown, in actions

SENATE

which are brought against them in an official
capacity, in the same position as though
action were brought by one private citizen
against another. I am absolutely in favour of
that. But while this may be a step in the
right direction, why in the world do we not
finish the journey and take all the steps that
are necessary to bring about the thing at
which we are aiming? We are making two
bites of a cherry. I think most of us believe
that any man who feels that he has been
wronged by a servant of the Crown should
be able to bring action against that servant,
just as he can against any other person.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: This polite or ancient fiction that the king can do no wrong is entirely
out of place today, if it ever had a place.
Certainly the subjects of the king-whether
they are employees of any government of the
Crown or not-can do wrong, because they
are human. If they can do wrong, then why
should they not be placed in the same position
as anyone else? Citizens should not have to
go to the Exchequer Court of Canada to take
action against servants of the Crown; they
ought to have access to any court in the land.
I wanted to draw attention to another thing
that is based on the sarne "principle", I
suppose you would call it, that the king can
do no wrong. Take a man of modest means
who is charged with a serious crime, it may
even be murder. He may be found not
guilty; but even so, he is ruined financially
because, as is natural for anyone, he has
spent his last cent in defending himself
against a charge that should not have been
laid or of which be was not guilty. There
may be reasons why a man in that position
should not be compensated, but I believe be
should be. If it is argued that it is in the
public interest to bring these charges, then
the government or those in charge of public
interests ought to pay the shot. It seems to
me unfair that a man should be impoverished
by defending himself against a charge of
which he is not guilty, and then have no
redress whatsoever. I wish this Senate would
show that it is not the out-dated body it is
sometimes accused of being, by seeing that
this legislation makes it possible for citizens
of Canada to take action in our courts against
servants of the Crown as well as against
ordinary people.
Hon. John T. Haig: I cannot add anything
to the able remarks of my colleague, the
honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine). I congratulate him upon his fine
address. I would congratulate, too, the deputy
leader of the government (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) on his speech of yesterday.

When the honourable member from Rosetown suggested, in reply to a question by the
honourable gentleman from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler), that he thought it should be
possible to bring these actions in any court
of the land, I know that he was not in any
way criticizing the Exchequer Court.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: No.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I happen to have known
the president of the Exchequer Court since
he was a small boy. I have read his judgments from time to time with great interest,
and I know that under no stretch of the
imagination could it be said that he is proCrown; in fact, I have frequently thought
that he has been anti-Crown. There were
several actions over the expropriation of a
post office site in my own home city, and I
have not heard one word of criticism about
the judgments that he gave. There has been
some complaint that the Exchequer Court
soaks the Crown pretty hard, but I think the
honourable member from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) made a slip in referring
to that court. I do not believe that he
intended to criticize the Exchequer Court,
and if he did, I for one would absolutely disassociate myself from his remarks in that
regard. Apart from that I particularly
appreciated what the honourable senator
said, because I am nearly always opposed
to him. I think the law should be such that
no government official by postponing a decision, can force a case out of court. That
happened once or twice in Manitoba when an
action had to be brought within a year, and
before we could get satisfactory evidence
from the government the year had elapsed
and it was too late to take action.
I really rose to draw attention to the
remarks of the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity. I am sure that he did not
intend to suggest that the judges of the
Exchequer Court are not absolutely fair.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Would the house extend
to me the courtesy of permitting me to say
a word in reply to my honourable friend
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig)? Of course
I had no intention of criticizing the
Exchequer Court or the fairness of its judges.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is what I thought.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: What I did say was that
I thought the impression was growing in the
land that the Exchequer Court was on the
side of the Exchequer. I am sorry if anybody
drew the inference that I was criticizing the
judges of that court. I, too, know them. I sat
in the House of Commons with the present
president, and I have pleaded cases before
him and hope to do so again. If my words

JUNE S, 1951
carried any such implication as the honourable senator from Winnipeg seems to think,
I thank him for having drawn the matter to
my attention, and I also thank the house for
giving me this opportunity of saying that I
meant nothing of the kind.
Hon. G. P. Burchill: I agree with the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) that it is somewhat hazardous for a
layman to offer any remarks on a subject
such as the house is now discussing.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: Not at all.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I just rose to say that
I agree with every word the honourable
senator from Waterloo has said about making
it possible for a citizen to have access to
any court of the land. It is quite simple for
a corporation or a person of financial means
to institute an action in the Exchequer Court
against a servant of the Crown, or a commission or board, and so on, but it is an
entirely different matter in the case of a
person who is not well off. Such a case is
pending at the present time in my own constituency. The man in question feels that he
has been seriously wronged by the Crown,
and he has been almost ruined. He is simply
not in -a position financially to take action
in the Exchequer Court against -the Crown.
I think we should consider some means of
making it possible for any citizen who has
a ground of action against the Crown to take
his action in the ordinary courts rather than
in the Exchequer Court.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators, I
rise particularly to ask a question. But first
let me say that although I am a layman I
am not going to follow the example of other
senators who have spoken and apologize for
speaking on this bill which has to do with
some legal points. After al, it is the laymen
who pay the shot. It is all very well for
lawyer members to speak enthusiastically
about this bill: they are the ones who will
eventually draw good fees if the bill is
passed. I can quite well understand the
remarks of the senator from RosetownBiggarHon. Mr. Aseltine: Rosetown.
Hon. Mr. Reid: . . . who said all lawyers

are agreeable to this proposed change. Why
should they not be? If the bill is passed
there will be more, law cases, and therefore
more work for the lawyers.
I agree with the senator frorn Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) that citizens should be able
to bring actions against the Crown not only
in the Exchequer Court but in other courts.
I am thinking of my own people in British
Columbia. Out there we are a long way from
the Exchequer Court. The farmer or ordinary individual in British Columbia does not

know what a fiat is, and he would be
frightened at the thought of having to bring
an action in the Exchequer Court. I do not
think I can be successfully contradicted when
I say that anyone who brings a case in the
Exchequer Court should hire the best legal
talent procurable, and that that would entail
considerable expense.
I should like to see the bill go further than
it does. I do not altogether agree with the
suggestion of the senator from Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) that the armed services
should be exempted frorn legal actions. Let
me give an illustration of something that
effects the life and well-being of people who
are in the mink or fox ranching business in
the part of the country from which I come.
I have had cases drawn to my attention of
planes in practice flights swooping low just
at a time when the animals were giving birth
to their young. Anyone who knows the first
thing about mink and fox farming will realize
that the noise of a number of planes flying
within two or three hundred feet of the
ground would terrorize the animals. I know
of instances where men were put completely
out of business because of the losses they
suffered through noise caused in this way. I
agree that there have to be some safeguards
for personnel of the army, navy and air force
who are acting in the course of their duty,
but I do not think the safeguards should
apply in cases such as I have mentioned,
especially when the air force officers were
notified of the damage that was being done
and persisted in carrying out flights at low
altitude, not close to the airport at all but
near the seashore perhaps fourteen of fifteen
miles away. It seems to me very unjust that
men whose businesses have been ruined by
acts of that kind should be denied recourse
against the Crown in the courts.
Here is my question. I wish to ask the
senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen),
who moved second reading of this bill, if
after the bill is passed it will be possible to
garnishee the salaries or wages of servants of
the Crown. If he says this will not be
possible, can he tell us under what law civil
servants are protected against garnishee proceedings? Is it an ancient law or just a
regulation. If it is a regulation, I think it is
high time that it was done away with. Why
should a servant of the Crown be given a
protection which is not extended to other
people, a protection which enables him to
incur debts and to say to the person to whom
be owes the money, "You cannot garnishee
my wages, so I won't pay you." While we
are amending the Petition of Right Act I
think we should go further and provide that
the wages and salaries of civil servants shall
no longer be protected against garnishment.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: In answer to the
specific question of the senator from New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid), I think the
reason why the salaries of civil servants cannot be garnisheed bas nothing to do with the
liability of these people as judgment debtors.
In other words, they can be sued and judgment can be obtained against them.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The position simply is
that the Crown will not recognize any seizure
upon the salaries which it pays to its own
employees.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Is that done by regulation
or by law?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I am afraid I am unable
to answer that. Perhaps some senator who
knows more about the law on that point can
give an answer.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There is no one here
who knows more about the law than the
honourable senator himself does.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It is important to know
whether civil servants are protected by
regulation or by law.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: If it is a regulation it must
have the force of law, otherwise it would
not be effective.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: If I might interject, I
would point out that the matter is dealt with
not by regulation, but by ancient law. There
is no machinery by which you can attach the
salary of a civil servant.
Hon. Mr. Ross: Honourable senators, may
I say just a word on this? In Alberta we
get around the matter in this way. When the
courts give a judgment against a civil servant
they appoint a receiver, and the Crown will
recognize that receiver as having authority to
receive money in satisfaction of the judgment. The Crown will turn money from
the civil servant's salary over to the receiver.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That applies to provincial
civil servants?
Hon. Mr. Ross: To federal civil servants
as well.
Hon. Mr. Horner: The government will
of course keep back a certain proportion of
the salary for the civil servant. That is,
there is a basic exemption.
Hon. Mr. Ross: Yes, the exemption allowed
by law.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I should like to ask a
question of the senator from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler). He suggested that the government should pay the costs of all citizens who
are successful in defending themselves
against actions brought by the Crown. Would

not a policy of that kind be too great a
temptation to our good friends of the legal
profession to charge high fees in such cases?
Some Hon. Senalors: Question.
Honourable
The Hon. the Speaker:
senators, the question is on the motion of
the honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) for the second reading of this
billHon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
if no one else wishes to speak, I should
perhaps close the debate with a few words.
It has been a most interesting discussion,
and I am grateful to all who have taken
part in it. I am particularly grateful to my
honourable friend from Rosetown (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) for the research which he has
obviously made into the most interesting
details that he placed before us.
I think I can say that everyone who has
spoken so far bas been completely in favour
of the bill, and the only criticism is that it
should go further and cover more territory.
Admittedly what is proposed is only a short
step forward; but it is a step. I suggest to
my honourable friends that the extract which
the senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) read from Lord Jowitt's statement
in 1947 about the history of this matter in
England shows how slowly and carefully one
must go in matters of this kind. According
to Lord Jowitt, a strong and able committee
was appointed by the British parliament in
1921, and notwithstanding the report of that
committee and various tentative measures
which were introduced, the matter could not
finally be determined until 1947. Furthermore, honourable senators will recall the
various hypothetical cases propounded by
Lord Jowitt as to the liability of the government to a soldier in the case of orders
wrongly given in battle, and that sort of
thing. The problem is not an easy one to
solve, but I think we should congratulate
ourselves on having taken this one step
forward.
The principal suggestion put forward in
the course of this debate was that it should
be possible to take action against the Crown
in any court in the land, not only in the
Exchequer Court. Personally, I have a good
deal of sympathy with that view; but I want
to draw the attention of honourable senators
to the fact that the amending bill now before
us provides for simplification of procedure
in the Exchequer Court. Subsection 4 of
section 5 of the bill provides:
A suppliant shal not be required to have an
address for service in Ottawa and the judges of the
Exchequer Court shall make such general rules and
orders as they consider advisable to permit service

JUNE 6, 1951
of pleadings, notices and other documents in petition of right proceedings by registered mail in lieu
of personal service.

In effect, the judges of the Exchequer Court
will make rules whereby people living outside Ottawa will be able to prepare material
and serve it as the rules provide, without
having to employ Ottawa counsel, as is now
the case.
I would point out to my honourable friends
that the Exchequer Court is not centralized
in Ottawa but is a peripatetie court. I have
some details on that subject which I am sure
will interest the members who raised the
question. The number of judges of the
court has now been increased to four, so as
to enable it to travel about the country. The
court makes two circuits to the West and one
to the Maritimes each year; it sits in
Montreal once a month, in Toronto once every
two months, and elsewhere, including Ottawa,
by special order. In its circuits its sittings
are not confined to the larger cities in the
country. The court seems to have developed
a practice of sitting wherever a case arises
which calls for its determination, and where
it will meet the convenience of the parties
and the witnesses. If honourable senators
will look at the list of places where the court
has sat within the past few years, they will
see that it sat in such smaller cities as
Brandon,
Chicoutimi, Brantford,
Prince
Rupert, Kingston, Saskatoon, London and
Windsor. It is apparent, therefore, that the
difficulty and expense of taking proceedings
in the Exchequer Court are not as substantial
as they sometimes appear to be. One of the
amendments in the bill now before us would
further reduce the costs of such proceedings.
Several honourable senators, including the
senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine),
suggested that the Exchequer Court Act
might be widened to allow cases other than
negligence cases to be brought against the
Crown. It may be that such a change will
become advisable, but I repeat that that
would bring before us the problems involving
the military forces and police forces, which
constitute quite a difficult subject. Certainly,
it is not one that can be settled in a moment.
My friend from Rosetown (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) discussed the question of discovery
of documents, and the senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) also referred to
it. There is, of course, one prerogative which
I think must be fully and comnpletely retained
in any minister of the Crown who is called
upon to produce a document in court namely,
that he reserve to himself the absolute right
to say, "No, I refuse to produce that document
because its production would be prejudicial

to the state". I do not think we can get away
from that universally recognized practice.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: But an action might
fail because a certain document was not
produced.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The only suggestion I
have heard for modifying that practice is
that a rule should be adopted under which
the minister could submit a. document to the
judge and let him determine whether or not
it should be withheld in the interest of public
safety. But that is simply transferring the
ultimate liability from the minister, who is
primarily responsible, to the judge.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I see the difficulty.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I do not think there
is any method of getting away from it.
As I say, honourable senators, this has
been a most interesting discussion, and the
only criticism I have heard of the bill is that
in several respects it does not go far enough.
In attempting to reply to that criticism there
comes to my mind the old familiar hymn,
"Lead Kindly Light", which contains these
words:
Keep thou my teet; I do not ask to see
The distant scene; one step enough for me.

Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, the motion is for the second reading of
this bill.

The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall the bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: If any honourable
senator wishes the bill to go to committee,
I shall be glad to ask that it be referred.
Some Hon. Senators: No.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: With the unanimous
consent of the bouse, I move third reading
now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.

had imported a similar class of goods, unless
they had previously taken some step to
protect their position. So long as due notice
is provided for, I do not suppose one can
complain too much about the cutting down
of the time.
The next section I want to deal with is
No. 11. It, too, is in accord with modern
progress and development.
As the Act
stands, railways cars may move under seal
through a frontier port-which is a port
'along the boundary of the -country-to some
inland point which is called a "sufferance
warehouse", at which point the entry and
the assessment of customs duties is to be
made. This section extends the application
of sufferance warehouses to highway and
air transport, and I think its immediate
application would be in relation to truck
transport. The justification for this section
is that there is a great congestion of truck
traffic at frontier ports. If the goods can be
manifested and a report made, the customs
seals can then be affixed to the trucks and
they can move to a sufferance warehouse
which has been established at some inland
port 'by the Governor in Council. This will
result in a quicker dispatch of goods and a
faster clearing of frontier ports. At the
same time there is no loss of eustoms revenue
because the proprietor of the sufferance warehouse is liable for ail duties payable on the
importation of the goods in those trucks,
unless he can show that the goods have
been duly entered or lawfully released from
storage.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Is the keeper of a sufferance warehouse licensed in a similar manner
to a custom-house broker?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I do not know whether
I can definitely say yes to that question.
The Governor in Council has the authority
to make regulations for the appointment of
sufferance warehouses. In other words, a
group of truckers moving in a certain area
into Canada might represent to the minister
that it would expedite the movement of
goods if, at their expense, they could locate
warehouses with customs facilities at certain
inland points. The revenues of the Crown
would be amply protected by reason of the
goods being manifested at the border as they
enter Canada, and the proprietor would be
liable for the payment of any customs duty.
The purpose of section 1 of the bill is to
make doubly sure that governments and
their officers comply with all the provisions

in the Customs Act with respect to the
reporting inwards and outwards of vessels,
vehicles, and persons.
Section 10 provides a discretionary power
so that in any case or class of cases-for
instance, in an emergency-the reporting of
a warship or something of that nature may
be dispensed with. In other words, the
statute provides that all governrnent-owned
vessels, vehicles and personnel shall be
amenable to customs control, but at certain
times there may be cases when it is not
expedient to enforce all the requirements of
the Act.
Sections 3 and 7 go together. Section 3
deals with goods otherwise exempt being
dutiable in certain cases. Under various
tariff items some goods come into Canada
free of duty or at a rate of duty lower than
that to which they would otherwise be liable.
This is by virtue of diplomatic immunity or
because they are military goods or are to
be used by a person who by law is so entitled
to import them. For instance, under a specific
tariff item you might find that a generator
for use on a farm is allowed to come in duty
free. Now, this section of the statute goes
on to provide that if such goods are sold or
otherwise disposed of to a person not entitled
to any exemption, or are put to a use other
than that for which they were imported, the
regular rates of duty shall apply. A person
not entitled to any exemption who purchases
or otherwise acquires any of these goods is
then responsible for reporting this fact to
the nearest collector of customs, and to pay
the necessary duties. Likewise, any person
who diverts these goods to a use other than
that for which they were imported shall also
report to the nearest collector, and pay the
required duties. This seems to be a reasonable provision.
Section 7 is simply an amplification of
section 3. For example, a tourist might come
into Canada with an outboard motor. When
he is leaving the country he may feel that
because he has had such a good time on his
holidays he wants to make a present of the
outboard motor to the people with whom
he was staying. While the tourist may have
been allowed to bring that outboard motor
into Canada free of duty, the moment it
passes into unauthorized hands the proper
duties must be paid.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Is there not a time limit
as to this?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No.
Hon. Mr. Euler: What if two or three years
elapse before the matter is discovered?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: A violation of diplomatic
immunity may go undiscovered for a certain

SENATE

period, but should not the proper customs
tariff be imposed when the violation is
ultimately disclosed?
Hon. Mr. Reid: This is something new in
the Act. Supposing someone is given a pet
dog. He brings it into Canada and declares
it, and then he wants to give it to a relative
as a gift?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: This is not the type of
case I am talking about. I am speaking of
goods brought into Canada duty free or at a
lower rate of duty because of the status of
the person who brings them in, or because
of the use to which they are going to be put.
Sections 3 and 7 merely iprovide that once
these conditions change the goods become
subject to the regular customs duties. As I
said before, this seems to be a reasonable proThe case which the honourable

senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) referred to is one in which somebody
from Canada goes to the United States, and
while there he is presented with a horse or
pet animal. If he succeeds in getting personal property of that kind through the
customs without paying duty on it, I suppose
he would not be checked up about the matter
later on, unless the customs authorities
decided for some reason to get after him on
the ground that he should have paid duty.
I now come to section 6, which deals
with the power to conduct inquiries under
the Act. This repeals the present section
134A of the Act and substitutes therefor a
new section with the same number. The
section to be repealed is set out in the
explanatory note opposite page 2 of the bill.
It is a brief section, ýgiving the deputy
minister or any other officer designated by
the minister power to conduct an inquiry or
investigation, and conferring upon him
for the purpose of such inquiry or
investigation all the powers and authority of
a commissioner appointed under Part I of the
Inquiries Act. In the new section 134A the
procedure for compelling the attendance of
witnesses is spelled out. In the first place,
from the practical point of view I think it is
much better that a section which makes
persons compellable witnesses should itself
make the obligations of witnesses clear, as
this new section does, rather than rely for
these details upon a section in another Act.
Secondly, if the new section is passed, I think
that a person designated to -conduct an
inquiry will not have as much power as a
commissioner appointed under Part I of the
Inquiries' Act, which gives a commissioner
all the powers of a judge of a court of record.
The power that the new section gives for the
imposition of penalties is more in line with
that given unler Part II of the Inquiries Act.

If a person called as a witness before an
inquiry instituted under this new section
refused to answer a question on the ground
that the answer might tend to incriminate
him, he could be directed to answer the
question, but he could claim, and be given,
immunity from prosecution for -any offence
other than perjury. If the witness persisted
in his refusal to answer, and if the person
conducting the inquiry had the power of a
commissioner under Part I of the Inquiries
Act, the witness could be committed for
contempt. Under this new section the refusal
to answer any proper question would become
an offence punishable, on summary conviction, by a fine not exceeding $400 and not
less than $20. The distinction is that under
the present section 134A the person conducting the inquiry functions in such an instance
as judge and jury. That is, he can say to a
witness, "I direct you to answer this question,
and if you do not answer it I will commit
you for contempt". In Toronto a few years
ago a lawyer was committed by a commissioner for contempt, because of refusal to
answer questions, and spent thirty days in
jail. Under this new section the issue of
whether or not a particular question is a
proper one would become a matter of defence
in the prosecution by summary procedure. The
new section will be much fairer to any person
who appears as a witness before an inquiry
or investigation in matters relating to the
customs.
I also wish to refer to section 5, on page 2
of the bill. This provides a penalty for any
person who practises as a custom-house
broker without a licence. There are and have
been for some time provisions in the Act and
departmental regulations governing the way
in which brokers may carry on their business,
and all that this section does is to provide
a penalty for an unlicensed person who transacts or attempts to transact the business of
a broker.
Section 8 of the bill is also of interest. The
present Act provides for forfeiture of goods,
vehicles and vessels in case of non-compliance with the Act or any regulation thereunder. This amendment simply makes this
penalty applicable in the case of an attempted
violation of the Act or of any regulation. For
instance, the operators of empty trucks lined
up on one side of the boundary and of loaded
trucks lined up on the other side might
become aware that they had been spotted by
a customs officer, and drive away without
committing any actual offence under the
present Act. In such a case a charge of
attempted violation could be brought under
this amendment, and if a conviction was
secured the court could order forfeiture.

JUNE 6, 1951
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: Things are getting
tougher on this side of the border.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I suppose they are get:ing tougher on the other side too.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: If an officer comes
upon a truck that he suspects is preparing
to commit a violation of the Act, why should
he not wait until the offence is committed?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is one point of
view. All that I am attempting to do here
is to explain the amendment. I take it that
those who formulate the policy have decided
the amendment is necessary.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Do you yourself think
it is a fair amendment?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes, I do.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Really?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes, I do. In my opinion
it is fairer than a good many other amendments that I have seen passed here.
Section 9 substitutes a new section for the
present section 246 of the Act, which is what
I would call an n.o.p. section. That is, it provides a penalty for violation of the Act in all
cases'where a penalty is not otherwise provided. The only amendment is the addition
of a penalty for attempted contravention.
The last section to which I wish to refer is
section 2. This is intended to cover a peculiar situation. A number of Acts that are not
administered by customs officers prohibit the
importation of certain kinds of goods, and
although these Acts direct customs officers
to prohibit the entry, the fact is that the
Customs Act itself authorizes the release of
goods immediately upon the payment of
duty. Suppose, for example, that there
arrives for entry a shipment of dates which
do not conform in quality with the requirements of the Food and Drugs Act. Although
the entry is prohibited under that statute, the
Customs Act as it now stands entitles the
importer to immediate delivery of the goods
upon payment of duty. In such a case the
customs officer, if he suspected that the
dates were, say, wormy, would have to
exercise his ingenuity and hold up the
articles for appraisal or examination by an
inspector under the Food and Drugs Act to
ban the import.
The purpose of the amendment in section
2 of the bill is to authorize the customs officer
to detain any goods the entry of which is
prohibited by any Act of Parliament. This
often works to the advantage of the importer, for while a customs officer detains goods
the importer does not have to lay out his
money for them. In some cases he may even
find that he is not getting what he thought
be was going to get. But for this information
80713-35

he might have paid out his money, and might
have had to wait a long time to recover any
refund to which he is entitled. In any event,
this is an authority which is required under
the Customs Act in order that there may be
proper co-ordination between the provisions
of that Act and controls and regulations
under the health laws, contagious diseases
laws, and so forth. This section in effect provides some co-ordination by giving the customs officer power to detain goods until
another officer, acting under another statute,
comes on the job to deal with the goods.

CENTRAL MORTGAGE AND HOUSING
CORPORATION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Gordon B. Isnor moved the second
reading of Bill M-12, an Act to amend the
Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation
Act.
He said: Honourable senators, after the
brilliant and informative manner in which
the senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden)
presented the previous bill, I realize how
weak will be my attempt to explain the bill
now before the house.
I wish to thank the honourable leader of
the government for giving me an opportunity
to explain this bill, for I have been interested
in the activities of the Central Mortgage and
Housing Corporation since its inception. I
recall the time when, in 1935, the Dominion
Housing Act was first introduced, and later,
in 1938, when there was a change-over to the
National Housing Act. That Act was followed
by the Central Mortgage and Housing
Corporation Act. The bill now before us contains six fairly simple clauses, and is
intended to take care of the expanding
activities of the corporation.
Clause 1 of the bill deals with the change
from the Minister of Finance to the Minister
of Resources and Development. It will be
recalled that under the National Housing Act
the Minister of Finance was named, and that
that Act was administered by the Department
of Finance.

SENATE
Clause 2 recuires the corporation to comply
with the directions of the Governor in
Council or the minister. Central Mortgage
and Housing Corporation was established in
1945, primarily for the purpose of administering the National Housing Act. At that time

almost entirely to fiscal measures, and the
corporation was administrative in relation to
the policy set out in detail in the Act.
Having regard to the nature of the operations,
parliament at that time considered it proper
to give Central Mortgage and Housing
Corporation a large degree of independence
to operate within the framework of the Act.
Since 1945, however, the corporation has
been obliged to expand its operations and to
assume heavier responsibilities. For some
time it has been in the field of direct construction of houses for veterans, and more
recently of houses for members of the armed
forces and other government personnel.
Under the new arrangement with Defence
Construction Limited, Central Mortgage and
Housing Corporation will be playing a still
broader and more important role, either
directly or indirectly, in the construction of
a wide variety of defence projects. All these
developments have changed substantially the
nature of the operation of the corporation.
It is not now administering a purely fiscal
policy set out in considerable detail in a
statute, as was the case in 1945, but has a
very much broader field of activity.
Clause 3 of the bill provides for more
flexibility in the choice of members of the
board of directors from the public service.
The present statute provides that the directors shall consist of the president and vicepresident of the corporation, the Deputy
Minister of Finance, the Deputy Minister of
Resources and Development and the Governor of the Bank of Canada. The proposed
amendment provides that the board of directors shall consist of the president and vicepresident, three members from the public
service of Canada, and five from outside
the public service. The clause also provides
that appointments from within the public
service shall be made by order in council,
instead of the appointees being specifically
named in the statute. This proposed amendment, as circumstances change, will allow a
change to be made in the members of the
board chosen from the public service.
Clause 4 relates to the qualifications of
the directors.
Instead of using only the
expression "British subject ordinarily resident in Canada", it is proposed, in accordance
with the Canadian
Citizenship Act, to
include also the words "Canadian citizen".

Clause 5 deals with the composition of the
Executive Committee of the corporation. This
change is made necessary by the revisions
in the composition of the board of directors.
The new provision is that the Executive
Committee shall consist of the president and
vice-president and two other directors to be
selected by the board. Under the section to
be repealed the Executive Committee consists of the president, vice-president, Deputy
Minister of Finance and one other director
to be selected by the board.
The final clause, section 6, amends section
24, which deals with the borrowing power
of Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation.
The
corporation
administers
the
National Housing Act, and in so doing lends
large sums of money to lending institutions,
and, in certain cases, direct to borrowers.
The capital of the corporation consists of
$25,000,000, together with a reserve fund of
$5,000,000, which under the act it was allowed
to build up, and which is made up of the
proceeds of sales which have been brought
about from time to time since 1945. The
major portion of the funds which it bas lent
comes from the treasury, from which it
borrows the money on debentures.
The
section with which we are dealing limits the
corporation's borrowing power from the
treasury. By section 24 it is prohibited from
borrowing an amount in excess of the
amount owing to it by lending companies and
other borrowers. When the Act was drawn,
no provision was made for the financing of
foreclosed mortgages.
The present amendment deals with this subject, and provides
that when a mortgage is foreclosed and property acquired,
it shall continue to bo
regarded as a loan for the purposes of this
section until the corporation has disposed of
the property either for cash or on a deferred
payment plan. If it is sold under a deferred
payment plan, the amount owing to the
corporation under the agreement for sale is,
for the purposes of section 24, regarded as
a loan.
As I stated earlier in my remarks, I am
particularly interested in this bill and in the
operations of the company, and I have taken
the trouble to procure and look over the
annual report of the corporation for the year
1950.
I did so because of its expanded
activities, particularly as they relate to
defence projects. We in the East have with
us in large numbers members of the navy.
army and air force and naturally we want
to make sure that they are properly housed.
I was interested to find information in one
table contained in the report showing that,
under the Department of National Defence,
provison bas been made in a very large way
for quarters for the navy. In 1950 alone

JUNE 6, 1951
3,901 units were constructed in Canada to
take care of the armed personnel. Included
in that total, as far as Nova Scotia is concerned, are 626 projects. Manitoba has 296,
British Columbia 513, and Labrador 277.
These units, along with those of the other
provinces, compose the total of 3,901 which,
as I have stated, have 'been undertaken by
the corporation. In so far as Nova Scotia is
concerned, the corporation last year erected
at Tufts Cove, for the navy, 471 units, at a
cost of $5,614,000; at Greenwood, for the
Royal Canadian Air Force, 140 units; and at
Debert, for the army, 15 units, a total of
626 units.
It is also interesting to note what progress has been made by this corporation.
During the entire period of its housing
operations there has been a total construction of 141,158 housing units, representing an
investment of something like $753 million.
These figures, I suggest, give some idea of
the activities of the -corporation.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Does my honourable
friend know when the housing corporation
will be :permanently established in its new
quarters on Montreal road?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: The honourable senator
no doubt recalls the discussion which took
place about the new quarters, which will
house something like a thousand employees
who are to be permanently located there. I
am not in a position to state the exact date on
which the construction will be completed.

Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I ask another
question? I have the impression that the
new minister's contact with the activities of
the housing corporation will be closer and
more responsible than previously. Am I right
in assuming that?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I am very pleased that
the honourable senator asked that question,
because it gives me the opportunity of saying
how pleased I am that the activities come
under this particular minister. He is an
exceptionally fine type of administrator, and
I feel quite sure that, because of the new
set-up, he will be in closer touch with these
activities. Does that answer your question?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: If I may so express
myself, I hope that the new minister will take
a close and scrutinizing interest )in the
administration of that organization and in
the arrangements for the staff that it employs.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I think he has already
done so.

The 1935 Act was followed by the National

In 1944 a new National Housing Act was
passed, and it is the one with which we are
dealing today. It provides for four different
types of loans:
1. Joint loans, which are granted jointly
by the Central Mortgage Corporation and
financial institutions for the purpose of building, or assisting in the building of, private
houses;
2. Rental insurance loans, providing for the
building of apartment houses, and granted

SENATE

Governor in Council provides that the rate
shall never exceed the long-term government
bond rate, plus 2 per cent in the case of joint
loans, 11 per cent on rental insurance loans,
1½ per cent on primary producer loans, and
1 per cent on limited dividend loans.
The interest rate on long-term loans is
defined in paragraph 3 of section 3(c) as being
the average rate of interest return yielded
by Government of Canada bonds outstanding
at the time, and which would not mature or
cannot be called for payment for at least
twelve years after that time.
Now let us take an example of a joint
loan. At the present time the average yield
of long-term government loans is 3-22. It
would thus be possible for the Governor in
Council to fix a rate that would not exceed
5-22. The interest rate could then be established at 5 per cent, which would allow 3'
per cent to the Central Mortgage Corporation
and 52 per cent to the financial institution
concerned on their respective shares of the
loan. Such amendment would permit the
Central Mortgage Corporation to continue its
arrangement with financial institutions, and
to carry on as in the past; but if the amendment is rejected, the Corporation could not
do so without reducing its own, share to 1,
per cent, and consequently it would be necessary to start subsidizing these operations,
which I do not think is advisable.
In addition to this amendment, sections
5 and 7 of ihe bill provide for the repayment
of loans through
monthly instalments,
whereas the present Act provides for annual
or semi-annual payments. Since the borrowers collect their moneys monthly, it has
been found much more appropriate to calculate the payments on a monthly basis.
Honourable senators, it is my intention, if
the bill gets second reading, to propose that
it be referred to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce, so that officials
of the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation may be available for questioning
At first
about details of the measure.
glance it might appear to be very complicated, but ho anyone familiar with the
different types of loans made by the corporation it is very simple.
The purpose of the bill is to render the rate
of interest flexible. At present the rate of
interest is fixed by law. At the present
time, when the rate of interest is rising, it
is not appropriate to have a fixed rate which
cannot be increased to accord with the prevailing rate.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question? He mentions the

prevailing rate. Is that 3.22 per cent the
present yield on Dominion Government 3
per cent bonds?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: It is the average rate
on Government of Canada bonds maturing
twelve years from now or later. On all
these bonds, including the perpetual bonds
and all Canadian government loans which
are not repayable until twelve years or
later, the average yield at the present time
is 3 .22 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May J ask another question? Does the yield figure out at 3.22
per cent becaýuse the Bank of Canada will
buy the bonds now at prices which make that
yield possible?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: No. That is the average yield from the fixed rate on the bonds,
including the perpetual bonds, without taking
into account the reduction in market price
of the bonds?
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I say just a word or
two, on this point? My friend opposite (Hon.
Mr. Euler) smiles. The government of
Canada says that it never promised to buy
back its bonds at par, and that is a correct
statement. It did of course undertake to
pay par at any time for the so-called savings
bonds which were issued at a rate of 24 per
cent. But it was well understood that the
Bank of Canada would take in the 3 per
cent bonds at par. The Bank of Canada
will no longer do that. It says that it has
given no orders to the chartered banks or to
insurance companies against selling government bonds, that these institutions are free to
dispose of as many bonds as they wish. But
just let a bank or an insurance company try
to sell a large block of government bonds,
and see what will happen! If, for instance, a
life insurance company unloaded $100 million
of government bonds on the market and the
Bank of Canada or the government did not
step in to maintain the price, where would
the market go? I suggest that 6 per cent
would then be regarded as a very reasonable
yield.
I would much prefer to have the rate of
interest fixed in this bill, because the leaving
of the rate flexible will give the government
a tremendous control over its bonds. I am
not pessimistic, but I just wonder what will
happen the next time the government tries
to sell bonds. The people I know best will
not buy Dominion Government bonds with
this threat over their heads. This may be
good financing and it may be good politics,
or it may be neither, but my business sense
tells me that it would be better if this bill
provided for a fixed rate of interest. If you

JUNE 7, 1951
wish to sell Dominion Government bonds
today you have to take a discount of-well,
some of them are at 2.88.
Hon. Mr. Euler: And some are more than
that.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes. I honestly think that
the government should have inserted a fixed
rate of interest in this bill. That would have
stabilized government bonds, but the bill as
it is now is simply another threat to the
people who hold bonds. I cannot imagine
that anybody will buy any amount of Dominion Government bonds if a measure like
this is placed on the statute books, because
the measure is, I repeat, a straight threat to
the rate of interest.
It is not so long ago that the public were
not too keen about buying bonds at all. They
always understood what a mortgage on a
farm or a house was; they knew that it bore
a definite rate of interest, five or six per
cent, or whatever it was. It took a good deal
of time and advertising to induce people as
a whole to become interested in bonds. They
wondered how good these things were, and
if they could be sold at any time. The public
also have always understood what a life
insurance policy is. Anyone who has a policy
knows that on the face of it is stated the
amount of cash that can be borrowed against
the policy after it has been in effect a certain
number of years. In time a good many people
were persuaded to buy government bonds;
but what will happen if we pass a measure
like this? In my judgment it will strike at
the rate of interest on bonds and make people
fear that the security is not good, that the
investment is hazardous. For some years
I have been maintaining that the rate of 3
per cent on government bonds was a forced
rate, insisted upon by the government so as
to keep interest charges down. My contention was that the rate was not justified in
the light of the risk that investors took, and
now that is proved to be true. The minute
we get under pressure the government's
policy is to allow the bonds to be sold at
whatever price can be obtained. The government has so far guaranteed to buy back
its 2& per cent savings bonds at par at any
time. If you have one of these bonds you
can go into any bank and get your money.
But there is nothing to prevent the government from making a change in that policy.
It is dangerous to have the rate of interest
controlled by order in council. That is my
judgment. I think people will be frightened
when they find out what the situation is.
What is to prevent loan companies and
other lenders of money from saying, "We
want a higher yield"? Money is getting

tighter all the time. I see that the Province
of Ontario had to go to New York for money
recently.
I do not know whether any
members from New Brunswick are in the
house at the moment, but if so I may say to
them that I was a little surprised at the
present rate of interest on that province's
bonds.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: May I ask my honourable friend a question?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Is Canada the only
country in which the rate of interest has
changed?
Hon. Mr. Haig: It may have changed in
other countries, but we have no control over
them. My point is that we had a policy that
our rate would be stabilized, and that a
Dominion Government 3 per cent bond would
be worth par at any time. At least, that is
what the public understood. Whenever anyone asked me about it I always pointed out
that the government had never said the
bonds would be maintained at par, that there
was no legislation to maintain them at par;
but the fact is that people thought that if
they bought a $100 bond of the Dominion
Government they could get $100 in cash for
it at any time they wished.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: What the seller gets
for a bond is the market price. Not long ago
a Dominion Government $100 bond could be
sold for more than $100.
Hon. Mr. Haig: A little more.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: For $103 or $104.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I have paid a price of
$105 for Dominion Government bonds that
today are worth only $97.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: That is the play of the
market.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, it is not the play of
the market. It could be described as the
play of the market if buyers knew that
ultimately the government would redeem the
bonds at par.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: And so it will.
Hon. Mr. Haig: You can wait for twelve
years.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Wait until the bonds
mature.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But in the meantime if you
need money you will be up against it. There
is nothing to prevent the government from
deciding at the end of twelve years, should it
be in financial difficulty at that time, to issue
new bnnds replacing the old ones.

SENATE
The minute the public of this country
realizes that it cannot sell 3 per cent bonds
at par, that day the credit of this country
suffers, and public confidence may not be
regained for years to come. I do not like
the provision as to a fluctuating interest rate;
I prefer to know what I am getting and what
I will be asked to pay for it.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: In other words, my
friend would like to see a continuation of
control at 3 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not want control; I
did not say that I did.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: That is what you
mean.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No. I want the interest
rate of 5 per cent, 6 per cent or whatever it
should be, stated in the bill. It is not my
function to say what the interest rate should
be; but I believe it ought to be fixed, so that
a person who is building a house will know
what rate he will be required to pay. At
best, this bill should provide that the government may come back to this house and ask
for an amendment, if necessary, as to
interest rate.
I repeat that I am opposed to a fluctuating interest rate, and by passing such a provision as this we are hurting the credit of
Canada in so far as borrowing is concerned.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Does my friend argue
that this is a tixed rate of interest?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, it is fixed, but it can
be changed to a certain extent.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: It is given 'flexibility.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes; it can be changed if
a decision is made to do so.
Let me answer my friend's question, so
that he will not misunderstand me. If the
interest rate on bonds goes up to 5 per cent,
then the government can increase the rate
on loans to 6, per cent.
Hon. Mr. Crerar:
Hon. Mr. Haig:

7 per cent.
That is the fluctuation I

Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Maybe the government would not find any borrowers.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But they would put the
interest rate up. The bonds may become a
drug on the market. I think the maximum
rate of interest should be fixed in the bill.
Hon. W. D. 'Euler: Honourable senators, I
am more or less inclined to agree with the
remarks of the leader opposite, and I am
not altogether satisfied about the wisdom of
making the interest rate flexible.

I should like to draw attention to a rather
disturbing observation made by him as to
the decline in value of Dominion bonds, most
of which are Victory Bonds and bear interest
at 3 per cent. The last issue went as high,
I understand, as $105.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Correct.

Hon. Mr. Euler: That rise in market value
was due to the fact that the Bank of Canada
stood behind the bonds, and with that support they did not go lower than $105. I
think, however, it must be borne in mind
that the government made no promise to
the public that the holders of bonds would
be able to sell them at par.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I did not say that it did.
Hon. Mr. Euler: But I think that the brokers and agents who sold the bonds told the
people that if they bought these securities
they could sell them at any time for a hundred cents on the dollar. I know they did
in my own community. The giving of that
assurance was most misleading, and many
people are disappointed to find that on the
sale of the bonds today they must take a
discount of from 3 to 5 per cent. This situation is having an unfortunate effect upon
certain provincial bonds. For instance, some
hydro electric bonds in Ontario are selling
as low as $92. This is all a result of the
withdrawal of support of government bonds
by the Bank of Canada.
The unfortunate result of all this, as the
leader opposite has pointed out, is the breakdown of public confidence in government
bond issues. The federal government will
some day have to borrow by way of refunding bonds, and in the unfortunate event of
the country being faced with another war,
heavy borrowing will be necessary; the people
will only buy bonds for patriotic reasons.
Before the first war the people of Canada
generally knew little about bonds. It took
a long time to make thern bond-conscious
and to educate them in this investment field.
Under present conditions there would have
to be a pretty strong inducement to cause
This
people to buy government bonds.
destruction of public confidence is to my
mind most unfortunate.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
I cannot quite agree with the leader opposite
that this legislation fixes the rate of interest
that will be imposed or charged on housing
loans.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I did not say that. I said
that it fixed a fluctuating rate, and that as
the interest rate on bonds goes up the rate
on loans can be increased.

JUNE 7, 1951
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I take it now that my
friend is opposed to the flexible rate, and
that he would prefer to have a fixed rate.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I would prefer to have the
rate flxed by statute.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: How can the rate be fixed
by statute without getting into a large area
of control by legislation.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is the way the law
has been since 1939 or 1940, and it is proposed by this bill to change it.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: At any rate, the interest
rate on high-grade government bonds at the
present time, on the basis of information
given by the honourable member who introduced the bill, is about 3-22 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Correct.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Consequently, companies
engaged in the making of loans for housing
could have a return of 5-22 per cent; but that
return will fluctuate as the interest rate on
high-grade bonds changes. The rate may go
higher, and it may possibly go lower. My
guess is that it will not go much lower for
some time to come.
It is quite true that no promise was implied
or given by the government that bonds sold
during the war could be depended upon. I
think my honourable friend from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) is quite right in stating that
when canvassers were selling the bonds to
individuals they perhaps gave the impression
that they would always be worth a hundred
cents on the dollar. It seems to me that one
of the reasons for this decline in the value
of bonds, with a -consequent increase in yield
to purchasers, is that possibly many people,
those who give some study to these matters,
believe that the inflationary trend will
increase, and that in consequence the purchasing power to be derived from their bonds
will decrease, so that they are disposing of
their bonds now, even though they take a
loss on the operation. They believe, whether
their fear is well-founded or not, that conditions a year hence may possibly be worse
than they are today. As far as my observation goes, that viewpoint is a definite factor
in the value put on these securities in the
bond market. It is true that the government
as a matter of public policy, might decide to
protect the price of bonds, by announcing
that the Bank of Canada will buy them at one
hundred cents on the dollar.

a very important bearing on this whole business of inflation. If people sell their bonds
at one hundred cents on the dollar, when the
individual gets the money he has that much
more money to spend. The resultant pressure on the price level pushes it up.
Hon. Mr. Euler: He puts it in the stock
market.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: He might put it in the
stock market, or he might put it somewhere
else.
Hon. Mr. Haig: He buys common stocks.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That aspect of the problem cannot be overlooked. It would be most
unfortunate, I believe, if five years from now
we were to find that the Bank of Canada
owned the great bulk of Dominion Government bonds which had been sold to the
public. The consequence might be economic
disaster. Consequently it is much better, in
my judgment, to let bond prices find their
own level.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Why did they not do that
in the first place?
Hon. Mr. Haig: The men who sold bonds
to me were agents of th,- government. The
government paid them a commission. Is not
that true?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Let us be fair about it. It
may be that in the city of Toronto someone,
in response to a request to organize a bondselling campaign, offered to give his services
to the organization for selling the bonds. That
sort of thing was done all over the country.
There was a great deal of voluntary service.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Sure.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: If under those circumstances a volunteer salesman, in order to convince a prospective purchaser that he should
buy the bonds, said, "These are government
bonds; they will always be worth one hundred
cents on the dollar", that does not necessarily
constitute an obligation which the government today must honour.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But did not the government
pay a commission on all these bond sales?

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: It was very small.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I don't care. They paid a
-commission. Therefore the sales were made
by agents of the government.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: How far my honourable
friend's argument is valid is a matter of

ever was, of anything, that if an announcement were made tomorrow that the Bank of
Canada would buy at par all bonds offered in
the market, the quantity of bonds presented
to the bank would be astonishing.
Hon. Mr. Haig. Not after what has happened
lately.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I think the situation is
governed mainly by the fear in people's
minds that the value of the dollar may go
still lower. A person in receipt of an income
of $3,000 a year from $100,000 worth of government bonds ten years ago enjoyed nearly
double the purchasing power he has today.
What he fears is that five years from now
this purchasing power will be still less.
Consequently he feels the urge to get into
some other type of investment where his
interest return will be greater, even though
his risk may be somewhat increased. That
fact, it seems to me, very largely influences
the situation.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: We have been discussing the whole question from the point of
view of Dominion finance and bonds. What

Corporation and its activity?

they will not sell their government bonds at

a loss and then loan money at less than the
prevailing rate of interest.
Hon. Mr. Euler: If I may be permitted
another remark: my honourable friend is
entirely right with regard to the position
of insurance companies and other lending
institutions. Since the interest rate was set
at 5, per cent, these insurance companies
practically stopped lending money for the
purposes of government housing, and the
only way to get them to do it is to increase
the rate. I am not convinced in my own mind
whether the rate should be a fluctuating one
or whether it should be fixed; but certainly
it is necessary to increase it, or the money
will not be forthcoming from the ordinary
lending institutions.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: The only fluctuation
that can take place is the ordinary gap of
2 per cent between the government bond
rate and a mortgage, and the Governor in
Council is not empowered to go beyond that
2 per cent difference. Of course, if the interest
rate goes up and up, the rate of interest on
loans for building bouses will go up until the
builders will not borrow money. Then the
demand for loans will be limited and the
rate of interest, like any other merchandise,
will come down.

Hon. Mr. Bouffard: What I know about the
matter is this. If one compares housing construction figures in May 1951 with those of

WEIGHTS AND MEASURES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon.

G.

P.

Burchil

moved

the

second

reading of Bill 355, an Act respecting Weights
and Measures.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
follows the Act respecting Units of Length
and Mass, passed last Thursday, which
changed the method of establishing our
national standards of length and of weight.
These national standards are: the pound
avoirdupois, the ounce troy, the gallon, and
the yard. The Act passed last week provided that the National Research Council
shall maintain standards of length and of
mass, and shall calibrate and certify reference standards, which will be in the custody
of the minister, and be the legal standards
for the purposes of weights and measures.
The bill we are considering this evening
is concerned with the administration of the
inspection service of our weights and
measures standards. This service is carried
on under the Standards Division of the
Department of Trade and Commerce.
An Act dealing with these matters was
passed in 1873. It was amended in 1914, by
the addition of two clauses concerning the
metric system, and again in 1935, where
clauses dealing with short weights were
revised.
The basic responsibility of the inspection
service is to inspect and compare all trade
devices, scales, weights and measures with
the working standards, and to make sure that
they are correct. Since the original Act was
passed, such changes have occurred in the
Act and in its administration as to make it
desirable to entirely re-write the statute. Some
sections of the original Act have been deleted,
others have been revamped, and still others
have been added. I may say, however, that
the main principles are unaltered. Honourable senators might find it interesting if I took
a moment to tell them something of the
extent of the work of the inspection service
of the Department of Trade and Commerce.
That service during the last few years has
grown to large proportions. During the fiscal
year 1949-50 members of the inspection staff,
numbering 109, travelled 737,000 miles, .called
80713-361

at 141,000 places of business, and inspected
449,000 pieces of equipment. In the last
year 11,300 scales have been spot-checked
and 100,000 pre-packaged articles have been
examined. Fees are charged for this work, of
course, and the revenue derived nearly covers
the cost of operation of the service. The
Standards Division also supervises the inspection of electricity and gas meters, so that the
over-all revenue from all three services
balances the over-all expenditure, and there
is no net charge on the federal treasury.
When the bill goes to committee, honourable senators will have an opportunity to note
the various changes which have been found
necessary by reason of mass production, and
the development of current trading practices,
and for administrative purposes. I do not
believe that any of these changes will cause
criticism, and I doubt whether any useful
purpose would be served by my going into
them here.
There are two new features in the bill
which I should like to mention. First of all,
in the last few years the wide development
of pre-packaging goods, particularly groceries,
has made it necessary that the packages
should indicate the weight or measure of the
goods contained in them. The Food and Drug
Act requires that the containers of items
under its jurisdiction shall indicate the contents, and other federal legislation makes
similar requirements.
In the interest of consumers, who should
be given an opportunity to judge relative
prices by weight or measure, it is felt that
pre-packaged articles should show the amount
or weight of the contents. As matters now
stand, a manufacturer who pre-packs an
article under the Food and Drug Act must
mark it; but if a similar article is packed
in retail premises there is no such requirement. For this reason it is considered desirable that all pre-packaged articles be marked
as to contents. I might add that this is the
standard practice of large producers and of
many retailers.
The second point I wish to mention concerns the Province of Newfoundland. Proclamation of the original Act has been published,
and that Act is now effective in Newfoundland. Some of the standards and equipment
in use there do not meet the requirements
in effect in other parts of the dominion. It
would appear desirable, therefore, that the
Governor in Council should be authorized to
continue the use there of certain standards
and equipment until such time as any necessary adjustment can be effected.
There are some changes in the penalties
provided by the Act. For example, one of
the provisions of the present Act stipulates

SENATE
that one-half of the penalty shall be paid to
the person who sues. It is desirable that this
provision be deleted. There is also a change
in the matter of disposal of seized equipment.
Honourable senators, I think I have covered
the main features of the changes proposed
in the legislation before the house. The officials of the department will be present in
committee to answer any questions which
honourable senators may wish to ask.
To summarize, the new Act is, in effect,
a modernizing and tidying up measure
which will orovide for the proper administration of the law in the light of current
manufacturing and trade practices.
Hon. Mr. Horner: May I ask if there is in
this bill anything to regulate the grade or
measurement of lumber?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Nothing at all.
Hon. Mr. Horner: That is a mistake.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Can the mover of the
motion tell the house if there have been
many penalties for short weight or other
evasions of the law?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Departmental officials
have furnished me with a statement which
shows that last year, 1950-51, ten convictions
were secured under certain sections of the
Act and fines were imposed.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Are the offences
specified?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: The prosecutions were
under sections 53 and 54 of the present Act,
which I have not before me at the moment.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I am just wondering in
what kinds of businesses those offences were
committed.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: If my honourable friend
is curious as to whether any of them were

committed by grain dealers, I can set his
mind at rest by saying that they were not.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I have heard of such a
thing as overages in country elevatorsreflecting somewhat on the accuracy of the
scales.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I have heard worse than
that. If the manager of an elevator has a
shortage he pays the shot; but if there is an
overage, it goes to the elevator company. I
speak with some knowledge, because I am
acquainted with a man who was in the business for thirty years. In his first year he
was short a thousand bushels. That is the
last time he was ever short.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Burchill moved that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.

proviso, namely, that the Governor in Council
may at any time order any of the privileges
granted under this item to be withdrawn in
any case where a country does not grant
corresponding privileges te Canada. It will
be recalled that the Customs Act, which was
before us the other day, provided that if the
ownership of goods passed from the hands of
a person who in Canada was entitled to hold
them free of duty they would be subject to
the normal rates of duty otherwise applicable
to them.
I also wish te mention item 409f, which is
set out in schedule A, at the bottom of page
2 of the bill. It extends the number of kinds
of agricultural implements, equipment, etc.,
which may be brought into Canada free of
duty. This item starts with the words "grain
crushers," and everything mentioned from
there on down to "hay loaders" has been
added to the item. In other words, the old
item began with the words "hay loaders".
All the implements mentioned in this item
-wil! come in free of duty, subject only to the
proviso that they are for use on the farm for
farm purposes only.
I pass now te items 216f and 238.
These items relate to what is commonly
known as the plastics industry, which bas
been going ahead by leaps and bounds. This
provision is only a limited approach to the
question by reason of the fact that during the
past year the Tariff Board was asked to
inquire into the whole industry and to determine what tariff classification it should be
given so as to properly reflect the various
developments which have taken place in the
industry. These two items, 216f and 238 have
to do with certain raw materials which in
certain circumstances are free of duty, and
which in other circumstances-namely if
they happen to be of a class or kind made
in Canada-are subject to a certain rate of
duty. Under item 238 there is one commodity
vinyl type, which carries an increase in duty,
by reason of the fact that it is a product
of Canada. Here the rate of duty is 15 per
cent across the board, which is an increase
over the existing duty. It may be anticipated that within the next year, if the Tariff
Board bas completed its work, there will be
a complete schedule of items dealing with
the whole industry.
I wish next to deal with a series of items,
namely 410a to 410z. These items, seventeen
in all, are contained in the schedule before
They relate to equipment for

use in the mining industry. The only change
is that the schedule is extended to include the
importation of parts for the various types of
equipment enumerated in these items. As
and when the rates affecting these items are
given the force of law, these parts will be

allowed to come in at the same rates of duty
that apply to the machine or equipment to
which they pertain. Heretofore the rates on
these parts have been scattered throughout
a variety of items in the customs tariff, and
have borne difierent rates of duty depending
upon the material of which they were made
and other factors which would influence the
rate of duty. The net result is an over-all
reduction in the rates of duty.
I wish now to refer briefly to item 682,
which has to do with "fish hooks for deep-sea
or lake fishing, nets and nettings," etc. The
elimination of the phraseology "cotton, hemp,
manila, or other vegetable fibres", makes it
possible to include in this item equipment
containing nylon fibre.
Perhaps I should say a word about Item
277, which sets out the duties on "oils, hydrogenated, blown, dehydrated or sulphonated,
not including blown or hydrogenated fish,
seal or whale oils". For years past, in the
administration of another section of the
tariff, the Department of National Revenue
has taken the position that hydrogenated
oil-and it was castor oil that brought this
matter to a head-was a processed oil, and
it was set out in a special item, namely, No.
711, "Goods not otherwise enumerated". The
matter came to a head when some paint
company sought to bring in castor oil, to be
used in paints, and thus get the benefit of
a lower rate or of freedom from duty. The
Tariff Board, overruling the department,

Hon. Mr. Horner: If an oil enters into the
manufacture of margarine, it is in direct
competition with a much superior product.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I expected to be asked
a question about margarine. I therefore took
the trouble to secure a little information
about it. As far as I can learn through my
own research, assisted by officials of the
Department of National Revenue, there is a
separate item in the tariff relating te cottonseed oil, which is one of the vegetable oils

JUNE 12, 1951
used in the manufacture of margarine. Item
277 does not relate to cotton-seed oil. The
rate of duty on cotton-seed oil imported
from the United States is 10 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Is peanut oil affected?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Peanut oil also is dealt
with in a separate item of the customs tariff,
and in the crude state carries a rate of 10
per cent.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Whale oil?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Item 277, the item we
are dealing with, includes hydrogenated oils,
which are subject to the duties provided
here. It does not include blown or hydrogenated fish, seal or whale oils, so these are
not subject to the rates of duty specified. I
am sure that must give great comfort to my
honourable friend.
In Schedule B, which pertains to drawbacks, there are two items of drawback to
which, I think, attention should be directed.
There has always been an item 1052, under
which machinery brought into Canada by the
automotive industry, for the purpose of
carrying on its business, gets the benefit of a
drawback of 99 per cent. But now "parts"
have been added. That is, an automotive
manufacturer may bring in "all parts" and
get a drawback on the same basis as though
he were importing the completed machinery.
Another item, No. 1053, has been added to
extend the benefit of the drawback on
"machinery, new or used, and all parts
thereof", to cover "aircraft engines, aircraft
equipment, or parts of the foregoing for the
manufacture of aircraft, aircraft engines",
etc. These items also get the drawback of
99 per cent.
As to the rest of the bill, perhaps a general
statement is sufficient. Items 435 and 440k
deal with locomotives and diesel engines.
The latter provision is intended to benefit
fishermen. It includes "engines and complete
parts thereof ta be used exclusively in the
propulsion of boats or in hoisting nets and
lines used in such boats ...
bona fßde owned
by individual fishermen for their own use in
the fisheries, under such regulations as the
minister may prescribe". Item 440k (2) is new,
and relates to diesel engines and complete
parts thereof. I do not propose to deal in detail
with the other items, although I will do so
if any honourable senator wishes to ask
questions about them. Some of them extend
to the parts of particular machinery or equipment the tariff rate which was formerly
available only in respect of the machinery
or equipment itself. There is also some
recognition of modern developments. For
instance, item 475, relating to stereotypes
and electrotypes, now includes what are

known as rubber plates, because apparently
these are now used in connection with printing. All are free under the three tariff subdivisions.
As regards the reference of the bill to
committee when it has received second reading, I will consent to whatever course the
Senate may desire.
Hon. Mr. McIntyre: Suppose an engine,
worth say $400, is imported from the United
States for use in fishing, is a percentage of
the tax refunded to the fisherman?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: All I can tell my honourable friend is, that, under item 440k, an
engine brought in to provide motive power
for a boat exclusively used in bona fide
operations by fishermen is subject to one of
the rates of duty provided for in the item.
These rates are, under the British preferential
tariff, free; under the most-favoured-nation
tariff 122 per cent; and under the general
tariff 15 per cent. As a matter of practice,
I believe, the most-favoured-nation tariff is
really our general tariff, the general tariff
being maintained as a sort of invitation to
countries, who might otherwise feel disinclined, to make trade agreements with us,
and as an indication that if they will make
a trade agreement they will get the benefit
of the most-favoured-nation rates. In other
words the general tariff is a bargaining tariff,
and applies at the present time, I believe, to
about ten countries, among them Japan,
Russia, Honduras and a number of small
states. I cannot go any further in answering
the honourable senator's question, because
the drawback is something else, and there
is no item in the bill before us dealing with
a drawback in respect of the matter he has
referred to. If an importer were entitled to
a drawback, and he might very well be, it
would come under the general tariff provisions. These are not before us at this time,
so I cannot answer the question.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: There must be some significance in the presentation at this time of
a bill to lower the duty on certain tariff
items. Has the honourable senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) any information
for the house about any reciprocal benefit
Canadians may enjoy as the result of• the
lowering of duties on certain items under this
bill?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The items to which I
have referred mainly cover raw materials
to be further processed in Canadian industries,
or machinery, equipment, or parts of
machinery and equipment, to be used in these
industries. It is a wise move to lower the
rate of duty on these items or to make their
entry free, because it will stimulate Canadian

from a ceiling price on their products; so
anything that can be done under these tariffs,
either directly or indirectly, to maintain
these industries on some basis that shows a
profit, no matter how little, is to be
encouraged. I cannot pick out any items in
this bill that would be in the category the
honourable senator is suggesting. I think the
net purpose of reducing some of these tariff
items is to assist certain Canadian industries.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Do these reductions
invade the British preferential tariff?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The British preferential
tariff remains as a definite tariff preference.
In some circumstances you will find that the
rate of duty is the same all across the board.
In other cases you will find a differentiation.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Well, does it invade the
British preferential tariff?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: It would be difficult to
answer that question now, because to do so
I would first have to go through all the tariff
schedules and then go to the Department of
National Revenue and try to relate each
individual item brought in to the different
rates of duty. Let us assume, however, that
the British preferential tariff is invaded to
some extent. Then, that must be a matter
of government policy and, if so, it is open to
any senator to argue whether or not it is a
good thing.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I have two or three questions
I should like to ask. My first has to do with
tariff item 705, paragraph (b), dealing with
settlers' effects. Am I to understand that a
settler who came here on April 11, 1945, over
six years ago, could now bring in a reasonable amount of settlers' effects? And what is
a reasonable amount? It is provided here that
a reasonable amount of the effects of a settler
may be entered from certain countries. I want
to know who is going to decide the number of
articles a settler may bring in? Will a settler
who entered this country on April 11, 1945,
still have the right to make application, and
to bring in goods under this item relating
to settlers' effects?
Hôn. Mr. Hayden: Yes, because it says:
Where the settler's first arrival occurred between
April 10, 1945, and April 11, 1949 . . .

All these questions about bona fide settlers
and "reasonable amount" are subject to such
regulations as the minister may prescribe.
Hon. Mr. Reid: My second question bas to
do with machines used for baling hay and
straw. As is well known to anyone who is
familiar with farming, there was a time when
wire was the only material used for the baling

of hay and straw, but the baling machines of
recent years use cord instead of wire. I know
this is so in British Columbia and on the
Pacific Coast.
t was brought to my attention
two years ago that a tariff duty had to be
paid on these machines and on the cord, and
at that time I appealed to the Minister of
Finance to lift the restrictions on these items.
I am wondering if anything has been done

about lowering the tariff on these items?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: An enumeration of the

new items indicated in 409f, would take you
to "hay loaders".
Hon. Mr. Reid: This is not a hay loader.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No, but everything down
to the words "hay loader" is new. If there
is any place within the entire enumeration
of this item under which you can qualify the

piece of machinery about which you are talking, then the rate of duty is easily arrived at.
It is free all across the board. The question
to be decided is whether or not the particular
type of baling machinery referred to is within
this enumeration. I cannot tell that without
reading the item very carefully. My friend
from New Westminister (Hon. Mr. Reid) has
knowledge of this item because he was interested enough to seek to have something done
about it. He should be able to tell me from
his reading of the item whether or not he
thinks it is included.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The fact of the matter is
that I have read the item and I do not see any
mention of hay balers.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: All this information can
be supplied in committee.
Hon. Mr. Reid: My third question has to do
with motor cars. Under this legislation can
a settler bring in a motor car as a settler's
effect, provided that he does not sell it? I
think that formerly a settler's automobile
was admitted free of duty, especially if he
was coming here from the United States. But
I see no mention of this in the bill. Item 705
does mention "highway vehicles", which of
course could include a lot of things.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is a very broad
term. Certainly a motor car is a highway
vehicle. There are certain exceptions to the
kinds of vehicles covered by the item: it does
not include vehicles or implements moved
by mechanical power, nor machinery for use
in any manufacturing establishment. So the
broad meaning of the item is cut down to
that degree.
Hon. Mr. Reid: You have no information as
to whether motorcars will be allowed in free?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No.

JUNE 12, 1951
Hon. Mr. Reid: I think that a former
Minister of National Revenue who now sits
in this house (Hon. Mr. Euler) will agree with
my statement that in the past settlers coming
from the United States and taking up farming
in this country were allowed to bring in their
personal motorcars free of duty.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I have no information
as to whether there has been a change in
that regard.
Hon. J. J. Kinley: Honourable senators, I
am sure that the presentation of a tariff bill
brings varied recollections to many of us who
have had some experience with tariffs in
the past. I recall the days when the tariff
was the big issue dividing political parties in
this country. The Liberal party was considered, or supposed to be, the low-tariff
partyHon. Mr. Aseltine: Did you say "supposed
to be"?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I said it was considered
or supposed to 'be the low tariff party.
Hon. Mr. Horner: "Supposed" is a good
word.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I used that expression
advisedly. And the Conservative party was
supposed or considered to be the high tariff
party.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: You can use that expression advisedly too.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I have heard it said that
the Liberals were for a low tariff when they
were out of power, and that the Conservatives
when they were out of power were for a high
tariff. However that may be, I think we all
agree that the tariff does not play the
important part that it used to play years ago
in trade between nations. Then everything
seemed to depend on the tariff. We were
told that in order to build up a country like
this it was necessary to have manufacturing
industries, and that they could not survive
without tariff protection. And that seemed to
be accepted by many citizens. We had the
example of the United States, which was
always a high tariff country, and which has
become the chief manufacturing country in
the world.
However, trade today is controlled by other
factors than the tariff. Monetary methods
now have more influence on business than
any tariff has. Other important factors regulating the flow of goods between countries
are prohibitions and quotas of one kind and
another. As we know, the importation of
certain classes of goods is sometimes
absolutely prohibited.

This bill seems to be based on the principle
that we must import machine tools and implements used in primary industry. To a degree
that is true. But a country may so encourage
primary industry as to reach a point where
it has no other kind of industry, and I think
everybody will agree that today a country
which had only primary industry would be
in a pretty poor state. It has been said that
if primary industry is the first step in civilization, secondary industry is the second step.
There is no doubt that secondary industry,
manufacturing, is a great bulwark to the
prosperity of any nation. It gives employment to people and raises the standard of
living. Coming as I do from the Maritime
provinces, I am of course anxious that our
primary industries should be given every
possible assistance, but I think there comes a
time when we have to admit that it is wise to
make possible in our own country the success
of industries that manufacture goods to supply
the needs of primary industries.
I feel a little bit out of place in expounding
a doctrine of this kind. It is a doctrine which
perhaps would come better from my honourable friends of the opposition, but they and
their party seem to have surrendered all
desire for tariff protection. I recall that a few
years ago-and I mention this by way of
compliment to them-they injected some lifeblood into their party by adopting a free trade
leader from the West. However, under his
leadership they did not succeed in getting
into power, so perhaps they may be turning
their thoughts once more towards the old
policy of Macdonald. It may be that if
thoughout the years they had adhered to
their policy of adequate protection they
would have stood higher than they do today in
the estimation of the business people of this
country.
I notice that in one or two places this bill
invades the British preferential tariff. I
refer to some items on which the general
tariff used to be, say, 20 per cent, the intermediate tariff 15 per cent and the British
preferential tariff free. Well, when you make
the item free in all classifications you of
course invade the British preference. Take
item 440k as an instance. The second part
of that item reads:
Diesel engines and complete parts thereof, to be
used exclusively in the propulsion of boats or in
hoisting nets and lines used in such boats for use
exclusively in bona fßde commercial fishing operations, under such regulations as the minister may
prescribe.

Well, for many years diesel engines were
imported from England duty free, but there
was a tariff on those that came in from the
United States and other countries. Now it
appears that importation from any country
under the most-favoured-nation tariff wil be

SENATE
free. So in that instance the British preference will be affected. I say to you that I do
not think we shall ever manufacture many
diesel engines in Canada under a tariff like
that. There used to be a company in British
Columbia which did very well in the manufacturing of diesel engines.
It has been
bought out by a British concern, which I
believe intends to assemble and partly manufacture some larger types of British diesel
engines in this country.
This tariff will
rather destroy any preference that the company would have had under the former tariff.
I bring that to the notice of the Senate, so
that we may explore it a little further when
the bill goes to committee.
My honourable friend from Prince Edward
Island was inquiring about gasoline engines.
It will be noticed that the first part of item
440k reads:
Engines and complete parts thereof, n.o.p.

We must be careful not to be led astray by
that wording. My own company down in the
Maritimes makes gasoline engines, and we
have got to the point where we have practically no protection on our products at all.
I suppose that if we were up here in central
Canada we would have enough influence to
see to it that some protection was provided.
However, we are not complaining, for we are
interested in the general welfare of the fisheries. It will be noticed that a little lower
tariff is provided with respect to gasoline
engines; these engines are made in Canada
in considerable numbers and bought by individual fishermen. But the fishing industry
has come to be big business, and in general
it is the large companies in the business that
use diesel engines. These companies have
been treated very well in one way and
another.
It may be that we should consider carefully
just how far we are going in the reduction
of tariffs. No country ever became great
without extensive manufactures, and we
should see to it that conditions in this country are such as to permit the development of
manufacturing industries. It seems to me that
low tariffs as a means of subsidy, for the purpose of bolstering up an economic condition,
are just as bad as high tariffs for protection.
Tariff protection is after all an economie
problem, and should be based on conditions
within and without the country. The Conservative party has been for high tariff, and
the Liberal party for low tariff. Personally, I
have always favoured a freer tariff.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: An adequate tariff.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Yes; somewhere in
between the two, at rates which would be
fair to the people as a whole.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Free trade?

Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators,
perhaps I, like the senator from Queen'sLunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley), may be allowed
to reminisce a little. He mentioned the
policies of the two great old parties-perhaps
I could say the one great old party and the
other less great in these days. At any rate,
the policy of the Conservative party in former
years was that of high tariff, or, if you like,
protection.
This was for the purpose of
building up infant industries, the assumption
being that when those industries reached a
certain stage of development they would no
longer need protection. On the other hand,
the Liberal party was supposed to be a low
tariff party; in fact, in parts of the country
such as the West it was almost a free trade
party. I suspect that even some Conservatives who lived in the West believed in free
trade principles.
On one occasion I remarked to a person
in a high place in the Liberal government
that in my view the difference between the
two old parties in so far as tariff was concerned was that the Conservative party
preached high tariffs and practised moderate
tariffs, while the Liberal party preached low
tariffs and practised moderate tariffs. In
other words, in actual practice there was very
little difference between the two parties, when
the Honourable Mr. Bennett came to office
and jacked the tariffs up very high.
Some reference has been made to the
British preferential tariff, which most people
seem to favour.
I can recall very well a
time when a proposal was made to reduce the
tariff on British textiles. About that time
I was talking to a prominent shirt manufacturer in my own riding, and I pointed out
that I did not see why a manufacturer should
be in favour of a British preference. I did
not think that a manufacturer who was put
out of business by British competition would
feel any better than one who suffered similar
competition from other sources. When the
reduction of tariff on textiles affected the shirt
business, the manufacturer of whom I speak
was strongly in favour of the British preference. He wanted to keen the tariff on British
textiles low, because that was the raw
material for his business; but at the same
time he wanted a high tariff on shirts, which
were his finished product. Those who produced the raw material wanted high protection; the manufacturer
who bought it
favoured low tariff.
The tariff conference, which first met in
Geneva, and later in Torquay, England, and
in Havana, made certain adjustments which
were good; but it also made some exceptions
which were entirely wrong in principle. If
we rely on the general reviews of its

JUNE 12, 1951
activiýties, Canada did not actually get a
great deal of benefit from the conference.
My reason for reaching that conclusion is
this: How can we make a fair agreement
with our friends in the United States when
under their law the President can reduce
existing tariffs by only 50 per cent?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I do not believe a fair
agreement can be made under those circumstances. In order to have higher protection
the United States only needs to put its tariffs
so high that a reduction of 50 per cent will
still exclude anything from other countries.
I will conclude with a more or less personal
observation. In the old days, when I was a
member of the House of Commons, I was
accused of being high tariff. Perhaps that
accusation does not interest the Senate
particularly; but it was not true. The only
reason I was in favour of a tariff in some
in-stances was that the government of the
United States, for instance, kept up a high
tariff against us, which excluded our products altogether. Under those circumstances
it was surely fair that the producers of our
own country should have a little better than
an even chance in Canada; and to that
extent I was in favour of a reasonable tariff
to provide reasonable protection against what
otherwise was inequitable competition.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, I
have a question to ask of the senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden), but first,
appropos of what the senator from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler), has said, it was always
well known in the party to which I belong
that every member was a free trader so long
as free trade did not interfere with the
manufacturing concerns in the town he
represented; but if it did interfere, then he
was a strong protectionist. I have witnessed
many a battle against free trade by Liberals
who in their home towns had little industries
which were against free trade.
The question I have in mind has to do with
item 409f, which relates to articles for use
on the farm. Among other articles the item
mentions "complete equipment for milking
parlours". Now, I thought I knew something
about the farm, but I must confess that I
am ignorant of the meaning of a milking
parlour. Is it a fine place, with polished
marble, where cows are milked?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I do not think the word
"parlour" in this item has the usual meaning
of a place for entertaining guests. I do not
know whether it refers to the palatial accommodation provided for cows when they are
being milked, or is a place where dairy
products are served to the public. I am quite

sure, however, that the information will be
available when the bill is considered in
committee.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is scarcely a farm term.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Perhaps I ýcan enlighten
the honourable senator as to milking
parlours. In a modern barn cows are no
longer tied in a row, and the milking equipment moved from cow to cow. The practice
now is to have a central place which is
equipped with a milking machine, a steel box
for feeding the cow some grain, and a gate
through which she may be brought in for
milking purposes. This arrangement is said
to be a great improvement over the old
method, which was much less sanitary. That
place in which the cow is milked, honourable
senators, is a milking parlour.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: May I ask the senator
from Toronto a question about items 1052 and
1053, on page 7, Schedule B? Will he
explain the 99 per cent?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is a portion of the
duty, not including any special duty or dumping duty, paid on the importation to which,
when you establish the user, you are entitled
as a drawback. If you establish that what
you have brought in is to be used for the
purposes specified in either item 1052 or item
1053, you are entitled to file a claim for
drawback.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: The remarks
of the honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) challenge reminiscence. My mind goes back to those inspiring
days of long ago when we argued the question of tariffs on the basis of principle. I
can look across the chamber to the honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
and remember that he proclaimed himself
a free-trader from the West, avowing a
principle which he has not forgotten and
which I believe he has not renounced. For
my own part I have made many free-trade
speeches, and I am as convinced today as I
was when I was twenty of the soundness of
the doctrines of the Manchester School. I am
as convinced now as I was at any time that
there is no more destructive or expensive
method of raising revenue than that involved
in a tariff, and that this country or any
other would be greatly benefited by adhering
to principle, rather than seeking small, petty,
To throw
partisan, sectional advantages.
its markets open to the world and allow its
people to buy in the cheapest and sell in
the most expensive markets, wherever they
may be found, seems to me to be logical,
complete and sound.
I remember the days when Sir Wilfrid
Laurier made free-trade speeches. I think

SENATE
he was awarded a medal by the Cobden Club
of Great Britain. I also recall very vividly
a discussion that I had with Sir Wilfrid
following the great debacle of 1911, when the
Liberals' attempt at a common-sense treaty
of reciprocity between Canada and the
United States was defeated disastrously by
the special interests that combined against it.
When, following that election, I expressed
my regret at the decision, Sir Wilfrid turned
to me and said, "Young man, a commercial
warfare between these two great nations is
antagonistic to common sense". I treasured
that thought in my memory, because it was
so forcibly and eloquently expressed. Even
in private conversation Sir Wilfrid was an
orator. He did much in tariff matters to
resist the encroachments of private interest
and to protect the public at large.
My
honourable
friend
from
QueensLunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley) like many
another, appears to be a free trader when
he buys and a protectionist when he sells.
He talked about the growth of the United
States as a high-protection country.
Of
course there were many factors other than
tariffs in the growth of the United States;
and in actual fact the United States is the
largest free-trade area in the world. What,
more than anything else, has held the United
States together, is the fact that interstate
tariffs were never allowed to grow up,
although there is as good an argument for
a tariff between the State of Maine and the
State of New York as there is for a tariff
between the United States and Canada. The
actual fact is that the United States, from
the tropical regions of the South to the
almost northern regions of the 49th parallel,
The people of the
is a free-trade area.
Pacific coast exchange their products freely
with the people of the Atlantic coast, and
nobody has ever suggested that they would
benefit by refusing to do so.
The same reasoning applies to the United
Kingdom. There was a time, following the
idealistic and soundly logical campaigns
headed by Cobden, Bright and others, when
England traded freely with the world, when
her ports were open to the manufacturers
and producers of raw materials in every
country, and when businessmen, buying in
the cheapest place available and selling in
the highest market obtainable, secured a vast
international trade. Those were the days of
England's greatness. That was the time when
the commercial and the military and the
naval flags of England floated supreme over
all the seven seas. It does seem too bad,
now that we are dealing with tariffs such
as these in a mundane sort of way, that all
principle seems to have gone out of the
debate, that the public has grown tired of

the argument. I have been involved in this
issue for, I suppose, nearly fiity years. In
all that time I have taken part in arguments
with regard to tariffs and free trade; and
apparently today we are in exactly the same
position as far as deciding the question is
concerned as we were when I was a boy of
twenty. We have made no progress whatever; rather we have gone back, because as
the honourable senator-I was going to say
for "Margarine"-for Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler).Hon. Mr. Euler: Order!
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: As the honourable
member from Waterloo pointed out, the
argument now is based purely on considerations of private gain, and the public no longer
argues or even thinks about this matter on
broad national principles. Of course that is
to be keenly regretted.
I hope that some
day there will arise in Canada, as there did
in the United Kingdom, a leader able to
attract the attention and focus the minds of
Canadians on this problem. Though today it
seems hopeless to argue for lower tariffs,
much less free trade, I have not given up
hope that the time will come when Canada
will decide this matter as England did in a
previous generation, not so much upon the
principles of the Grit party, but according to
the philosophy of Liberalisrn. Probably you
and I will not be here when that comes to
pass, but I would like to sec it, and some
day I hope it will take place.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: I should like to ask the
honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) whether he would be
wiiiing today to see Canada throw down all
tarif barriers and proclairn herself a freetrade country; whether he believes that that
would be practicable so long as the United
States and other countries maintain high
tariffs against us.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is a good question,
ard I thank the honourable senator for asking
it. As a rule it is a difficult question, asked
bona fide by some of others, anu by some
of themselves. My answer is yes, and it is
based on this philosophy. If you allowed our
manufacturers to engage in those industries
which are indigenous to Canada, without
imposing trade rcstrictions and increasing the
costs of their buying, you would place them
in a position where they could compete
against any other manufacturer in the world.
Instead of it damaging our manufacturing
industry it would do the reverse. Somebody
bas already pointed out that the finished
product of one industry is the raw material
of another. That has always been the case,
and my conviction is that a city such as

JUNE 12, 1951
Toronto, strategically located for transportation and the carrying on of business, suffers
more from trade restrictions than any other
place in Canada. I likewise am convinced
that no place would benefit more than
Toronto were the artificial obstructions to
trade swept away and the manufacturers
allowed to compete freely. It is their own
affair if the United, States wishes to maintain restrictions against their business people,
to tie their hands and increase the cost of
the manufacturing of their goods. I think
our duty is to decrease our own costs; certainly not to deliberately and artificially
increase them. The decrease in costs that
would come from a reduction in tariffs, particularly in relation to our basic industries
such as farming, would be the :same in principle as the decrease in costs that comes when
we dig a canal, build a railroad, or improve
our highways. It makes trade freer, cheaper,
and eaýsier to carry on, and no one thinks
for one moment that that kind of free trade
is not advantageous. As I say, I can see no
distinction in principle between the free
trade that comés from building railroads,
canals and highways, and the freer trade
that comes from lowering tariffs. My answer
to the question asked by the honourable
senator from Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis)
is yes. I should like to see us stand on our
own feet and say that we will trade with
anybody in the world. If we did that we
would beat the other fellows, and the United
States manufacturers could not compete with
us in the markets of the world.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: I wish with all my heart
that the government of today would bring
that policy into effect. We would have such
a flood of unemployment in this country that
there would be no doubt as to who would
be in power after the next election.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
because of the lucid explanation of this bill
given by the honourable senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden), and the fact
that in my opinion these changes move in
the right direction, I thought at first the best
thing I could do was to stay in my seat this
afternoon. The discussion, however, has
taken a somewhat broader turn.
My honourable colleague from Queen'sLunenburg. (Hon. Mr. Kinley) expressed the
view that there is really little difference
between the two old parties on the tariff
question, except that the Liberals when in
opposition preached low tariffs and when in
office imposed higher tariffs, and the Conservative party when in opposition preached
high tariffs, and when in office imposed lower
tariffs.
The honourable gentleman from

Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) came to the conclusion that on the tariff question both partles
were about the same, they were moderate. I
am not going to discuss that point but I
should like to ask my colleagues in this
house who can look back far enough, to
reflect on what the tariff was in this country
thirty, forty or fifty years ago. At one time
when there was an active tariff agitation in
Western Canada there was a duty of 25
per cent on agricultural implements coming
into this country from the United States and
elsewhere. With the passing of time that 25
per cent protection was wiped out. It was
argued, and I was one of those who supported
the argument, that the reduction in or the
elimination of the duty on agricultural
implements would not result in serious harm
to Canadian industry and, in particular, to
the agricultural implement industryHon. Mr. Roebuck: And you were right.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: -and I ask this house
whether that view, which was widely held
in Western Canada at that time, has not been
justified? Not one agricultural implement
industry in Canada has been put out of
business as a result of putting agricultural
implements on the free list. The reductions
of tariff on many other items of our trade
have been very substantial, and duties are
low as compared with those of fifty years
ago. Has this injured anyone in Canada?
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Has any farmer benefited?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: We are at a higher peak
today than we ever have been in the production of wealth and the expansion of our trade.
Have these reductions worked any injury on
Canada? On the contrary, they have been
of very great and definite advantage to the
economy of this country. That is why I was
delighted to see that this bill proposes stepsmodest as they may be-in the same direction. With all due respect to those who differ
from me on the point, I may say that there
never was a greater fallacy than the argument that we were going to injure ourselves
by admitting foreign goods to this country.
What concerns me at the moment is the
fact that we have resorted, as have many
countries, to other devices. I am quite free to
say that the tariff, the levying of a certain
percentage on goods coming into Canada,
does not play the part that it did in years
gone by. We have now got more refined
methods for interfering with trade. I am
speaking not only of Canada. We have
sinned somewhat against the light, but we
have not been the worst sinner in that respect.
Like other countries we have quotas and
exchange restrictions and customs valuations
for duty purposes. All sorts of devices have

SENATE

been applied, and the interesting thing is that
it was some of the authoritarian countries
that showed us the way to the imposition of
certain of them.
Let me make my position clear, if it needs
to be made clear in this house. I am against
tariffs for protective purposes. I never was
an enthusiastic or a warm or even-to use the
phrase of my friend from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler)-a moderate friend of the preferential
system of tariffs. With a preferential system
all that you do is put a circle around a certain
group of countries and say "We are going to
trade with ourselves, and the rest of the
world can go hang." It was the fear or the
effect of that system that induced other
countries, particularly European countries, to
push their tariffs against Canadian goods so
high.
Honourable senators, one of the roads to
peace is the promotion of the fullest and
frcest trade between all countries; the removal
of all the barriers that stand in the way of
trade.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: People who trade with
each other understand each other. If we in
Canada are trading with Germany or France
or the United States, a certain number of
individuals in Canada get to know fairly well
a certain number of individuals in these
countries.
Consequently, the
profitable
exchange of goods, the profitable business of
importing and exporting, not only helps the
prosperity of our own country, but also assists
in the promotion of that good will and understanding which is necessary if this world is
ever to travel along the road of peace.
Hon. Calveri C. Prati: Honourable senators,
up to a point I agree with the senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) that there is a
great deal of unnecessary fear as to the results
of reducing or indeed of abolishing tariffs. I
am not advocating that this country should
abolish all tariffs and go entirely over to free
trade. Tariffs have been of great advantage
to us as a factor in foreign trade bargaining
whereby we can offer something and get
something in return. I should say it would
be good business to remove more duties and
generally lessen restrictions on the importation of American goods in this country if in
return we were to be given freer access to
the American market for our products. We
should always be watching for opportunities
to pursue that policy.
I should like to call the attention of the
Senate to what has happened as a result of
an actual instance of the abolition of tariffs,
right in the Dominion of Canada. The proposal to abolish the tariffs in question caused

many people to fear that the industries
affected would be ruined. But this has not
happened. I am referring to the abolition of
duties on the importation into Newfoundland
of goods from Canada as a result of confederation. Time and again I was asked, as
all business men on the island were, how our
local industries would be affected by the
removal of tariffs on goods coming in from
the Canadian mainland. The duties were
graded according to the essential needs of
the various industries and the economic
factors involved, but in the main they were
higher than the duties which Canada imposes
as a protection for its own industries. Our
industries produced a wide range of goods,
such as clothing, confectionery, biscuits,
cordage, paints, metal goods, utensils, boots
and shoes, and so on. They employed several
thousand people, with a payroll of several
millions of dollars. Looking at the matter
from a purely business point of view, one
would have said that without tariff protection
those industries had not a chance to survive.
Like many others, I always took the view that
Newfoundland industry would be affected
by abolition of the tariff on all Canadian
goods in the same way as Canadian industry
would be affected by abolition of the tariff
on all United States goods. And although
I know it is dangerous to draw an analogy
where so many factors are involved, still
I should say that the large industries in
Ontario, Quebec and some of the other
provinces, with their streamlined production
methods, certainly confronted the small
industries of Newfoundland with competition
as severe as that with which Canadian industries would have to meet from the huge
manufacturing concerns in the United States
if no tariff protection were provided.
Well, over night Newfoundland's tariff
against Canada was abolished. Since then, il
is truc, our local industries have been going
through a pretty tough time, adapting themselves to the new conditions; but there is
not much less employment in them than there
was before. They are meeting the impact
of the big factories in the larger provinces
my modernizing their methods. Generally
speaking, we in Newfoundland do not feel
depressed over the fate of our manufacturing
industries. They are fighting their battle
and getting along.
It is true that conditions in some of the
industries are not as satisfactory as we would
wish but I contend that our experience is an
object lesson which teaches that tariff protection for many classes of manufactured
goods is not as essential as many think it is.
I was much impressed with the point made
by the senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) with reference to the farm implement

To my way of thinking, it would be disbut I can recall only once when the tariff astrous for Canada to tie her tariff policy in

with that of the United States, and base her
hope for trade with that country on the
chance that it will continue its present trade
policy. When conditions go ^against the
United States, I am sure they will not continue to accept Canadian exports as they are

doing today. True, the country south of us is
a great country, has given large sums of
money to the cause of less fortunate nations
and is today a bulwark for freedom; but I
have never believed that it would favour the
importation of Canadian goods when it was
disadvantageous to it to do so.
I draw to the attention of the house the fact
that the Liberal party was in power for
fifteen years, from 1896 to 1911, and has held

office for the greater part of the past thirty
years. But at the present time agricultural
implements for use in the Prairie Provinces
cost double their 1896 price.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Three times as much.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Perhaps I am mistaken in

saying that the price is only double.
Hon. Mr. Aselfine: Four times as much.

Hon. Mr. Haig: My father bought a sixfoot-cut binder in 1890 for $150, and last fall
when I was up in the country a farmer I
knew paid $350 for a seven-foot-cut machine.
I hope the Parliament of Canada will stand
against tariff agreements with the United
States, depending on them to hold the present
arrangement stable. I know they will not
do so.

My honourable friend from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner) reminds me that whereas
in 1896 the price of binder twine was eight
cents a pound, it is now thirty cents a pound.
Of course binder twine is on the free list.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The cost of everything else
is up, too.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes. But I can remember,
as a boy, going to political meetings and

hearing Liberal speakers say that if the
duties were taken off binders and binder
twine the cost would go down, and that the
only obstacle was "these nefarious Tories,
who are keeping up prices by their tariffs".
On many a platform we were told: "Elect

the Liberals to power, and binders and binder
twine will come in free, and we will all be
happy."
Hon. Mr. Rober±son: And we are happy.

Hon. Mr. Haig: And the farmers are still
kicking. Look at the price today.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the honourable gentleman whether, if there were a
duty on binder twine, the price would not
be higher than thirty cents?

Hon. Mr. Haig: I am only going by
When there was a duty on
experience.
binder twine it cost eight cents a pound; now
there is no duty, and we have to pay thirty
cents.
Hon. Mr. Euler: If there were a duty now
it would be higher.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I don't know anything
about that.
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: Does my honourable
friend argue that if the tariff were restored
the price would go down?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I don't know. I know only
what my experience has taught me. The
honourable member from Lethbridge (Hon.
Mr. Buchanan) has been in parliament a long
time, and I would like him to point out when,
in any year he likes to name, the general
revenue from tariffs was decreased by reductions made by the Liberal party when in
power. I can find no such case. The fact
is that in Canada tariffs are a dead issue.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Does my honourable
friend recall what resulted from the removal
of the tariff on farm tractors? I would remind
him that this was the act of a Conservative
government.
Hon. Mr. Haig: To be quite candid, I do
not remember, because I was not farming at
that time. I was farming in the days when
you used a team of horses on a plough and
three horses on a binder. I have no personal
experience with a tractor; I only know that
nowadays in our country it costs four or
five thousand dollars. The only reason I
refer to this is because I do not think the
tariff is an issue. I am in f avour of the
resolutions to which it is proposed by this bill
to give effect.
I congratulate the honourable senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) on his very able
explanation of the bill. I am not at all
surprised that the leader of the government
always nominates the honourable member
from Toronto to introduce these intricate
resolutions on tariffs, customs and excise,
because he does it in a way that simply disarms opposition: when he gets through we
are struck dumb. But after a few remarks
by the honourable member from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) and the honourable member for Queens-Lunenburg (Hon.
Mr. Kinley), whether they favour my point
of view or not, I feel myself in fighting mood
again. Whereas the honourable member for
Toronto bas me disarmed and helpless, when
the other honourable senators I have mentioned, or the honourable member from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) take part in the

JUNE 12. 1951
debate, I am not sure that even my honourable friend from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) can keep me in my seat.
In conclusion, let me say that I have no
objection to the bill, but I think it should go
to a committee, where the details may be
further explained.
Now let me make one plea. In whatever
concessions we Canadians make through our
government or our parliament, let us not
count upon like concessions from the United
States. If we do, we shall find ourselves
building on the shifting sand. The history
of American tariffs shows that from their
beginnings the people of the United States
have been unfavourable to trading agreements. Whatever affects one of their states
is regarded as affecting them all, and their
inclination is to trade within themselves.
Ninety per cent of their business is carried
on within their own borders. As a Canadian, I would far sooner link our economy
with that of Great Britain, or France, or
some other European country, than with the
United States.
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: Do you think they
will put a tax on newsprint?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Who? The United States?
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am not sure about that;
but what they will do to get concessions, I

believe, is to threaten to cut off trade with
this country.
The Hon. the Speaker: May I suggest that
honourable senators should try to observe
more closely the rules of the house? We have
had a very lengthy and quite interesting discussion of what has been described by more
than one of the speakers as a dead issue.
I must confess that I have been too lenient
in this matter, but when one speaker had
proceeded along these lines I did not think it
would be fair to limit other honourable
senators. I hope, however, that those who
take part in our debates will see to it that
there is a definite connection between their
speeches and the bill under discussion.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

TORQUAY TRADE AGREEMENTS
SUGGESTED CONSIDERATION IN COMMITTEE
Hon. Mr. Robertson:
Honourable senators, I have been asked my opinion on the
advisability of referring the Torquay trade
agreements to an appropriate committee for
study and for the questioning of officials, as
was done in the House of Commons. If
honourable members of this bouse think that
such a study in the time available would
serve a useful purpose, I should be glad to
comply with such a suggestion. It has been
intimated that the appropriate committee
would be the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce; however, it occurs to
me that the Standing Committee on Canadian
Trade Relations is the proper body to considc this subject.
I will not be in the house next week, but
if it is the wish of the committee to study
these trade agreements, I would be pleased
to make a motion to that effect. If, however, a decision has not been reached by
tomorrow, i am sure that the deputy leader
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) will meet with the
vishes of the honourable senators.
EXCISE TAX BILL

SECOND READING
Hon. Salter A. Hayden moved the second
reading of Bill 294, an Act to amend the
Excise Tax Act.
He said: Honourable senators, as this bill
is part of a plan to raise more money for
purposes of defence, and to carry out the
program of the government to this end, most
of the amendments contained in the bill
provide for increases in taxes. That fact
makes my task less pleasant than it would
be were I able to announce that on the
whole the bill provided for decreases in
taxes. In calling attention to the various
provisions, one can at least be certain that
they are not in the category of news
announced for the first time. Honourable
senators have already been acquainted with
the bad news contained in the bill; in fact
all the tax items have been in effect since
April 11 last.

Section 6 of the bill is the general section
which increases the rate of sales tax from 8
to 10 per cent. This tax applies to all goods
other than those contained in the list of
exemptions in schedule III of the Act, to

which certain specified additions are made.
As regards the series of increases, sections
3 and 4 are word for word 'the same as the
existing sections which deal with the excise
tax on furs, except that the proposed amendment would increase from 15 to 25 per cent
the tax on all dressed and dyed furs and on
the current market value of the fur content

in garments.
By section

10, schedule

I of the Act is

repealed and the schedule I annexed to ýthis
bill is substituted therefor. This schedule,
appearing on pages 7 to 10 of the bill, contains a long list of items and shows the rates
of excise tax applicable to them. Perhaps
I might indicate some of these. On page 7
will be found listed: automobiles, toilet

preparations and electrical appliances, on all
of which the rate has been increased from
15 to 25 per cent. Item 3, paragraph (b), is
new. Until the budget was introduced there

was no tax on appliances ad-apted to household or apartment use, such as stoves, hotplates and grills. These are now subject to
a rate of 15 per cent.
Paragraphs (c), (d), (e) and (f) on page 8,

providing for an impost of 25 per cent, relate
to firearms and ammunition, motor cycles,
golf clubs and golf balls, fishing rods and
fishing reels.
The rate on the remaining
items on this page and page 9 has also been

increased to 25 per cent.
As to page 10, the 15 per cent rate on
articles of china, porcelain, earthenware, and
so forth, has been increased to 25 per cent.

In section 15 a specific rate of 30 per cent is
applied to carbonated beverages, aerated
waters, and so forth.
The only reduction in the entire schedule
comes in section 16, where the rate on such
items as candy, chocolate, chewing gum, and
so forth, has been reduced from 30 per cent

to 15 per cent.

Needless to say the over-all

effect of these new rates will be to greatly
increase the amount of revenue derived from
taxation.
Hon. Mr. McDonald:

Is section 15 new?

Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes.

The purpose of section 11 of the bill is to
repeal Schedule II of the Act, and substitute
the new schedule to be found on page 11.
There is a tax of 50 cents per pound on
carbonic acid gas and similar preparations
to be used for aerating non-alcoholic beverages.

Prior to the budget

there

was

an

excise tax on cigarette papers and cigarette

JUNE 13, 1951
tubes for rolling your own cigarettes, but
this tax was found so difficult to enforce that
the government has repealed it and has provided for an increased excise tax on manufactured tobacco. On cigarettes the rate of
two cents for each five cigarettes or fraction
thereof contained in a package, has been
increased to two and three-quarter cents.
The tax of two cents for each ounce or
fraction of an ounce of manufactured tobacco
contained in any package has been increased
to five cents, and the old tax of half a cent
for each ounce or fraction of an ounce of
Canadian raw leaf tobacco, when sold for
consumption in this country, has been
increased to one and one-quarter cents.
Section 12, amends Schedule III of the
Act. It gives some relief from taxation to
people who require certain drugs, and two
drugs have been added to the list of exemptions, namely, cortisone and ACTH.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Give us that name in
full.
Some Hon. Senaors: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: If any honourable senator wishes to familiarize himself with the full
technical and scientific term for this drug, I
suggest that he rehearse its pronunciation for
some considerable time because practically
every letter of the alphabet is used in it.
Schedule III is further amended by adding
tariff item 708 to the list of tax exempt
goods. This item, which we discussed yesterday, includes military supplies of Commonwealth countries and member countries of
the North Atlantic Treaty, and it also covers
the personal effects of the representatives of
those countries while they are on duty in
Canada.
Then we come to the general sections of
the bill. The first one to which I should like
to refer is section 9, which deals with the
power to conduct inquiries under the Act.
The wording of this section is exactly the
same as the wording of section 6 of Bill 198,
an Act to amend the Customs Act, which
we considered and passed a few days ago.
Section 9 of the bill before us will give the
deputy minister, or any other officer designated by the minister, power to conduct an
inquiry or investigation, and it will confer
upon him for the purpose of such inquiry
or investigation all the powers and authority
of a commissioner appointed under Part 1
of the Inquiries Act. The procedure for compelling the attendance of witnesses is spelled
out, and I think this new section will be
much fairer than the old one to any person
who appears as a witness before an inquiry
or investigation into these matters. For
example, at the present time a witness who
persists in refusing to answer a question can

be committed for contempt if the person conducting the inquiry has the power of a commissioner under Part 1 of the Inquiries Act;
but under this amendment the refusal to
answer any proper question will become an
offence punishable on summary conviction.
In other words, the authority to determine
that there has been contempt, and to commit
a person for contempt, is taken from the
person conducting the inquiry. In my opinion
it is wise to remove this authority from the
person who is conducting the inquiry. A
feeling might develop during the course of
the proceedings which would influence him
in deciding the propriety of any question, or
in determining the penalty that might be
imposed. A third party, say, a magistrate,
might be considered more impartial in dealing with the matter and imposing any
penalty.
Section 8 of the bill provides for appeals
from decisions of the Tariff Board. It provides
that on questions of law appeals may be
made to the Exchequer Court, and authorizes
the Exchequer Court judges to set up rules
of procedure.
Section 7 raises a very pertinent question,
and one which we considered recently in
connection with claims for refunds. Subsection 1 of section 115 of the Act at present
provides:
Where any difference arises or where any doubt
exists as to whether any or what rate of tax is
payable on any article under this Act and there is
no previous decision upon the question by any competent tribunal binding throughout Canada, the
Tariff Board constituted by the Tariff Board Act
may declare what amount of tax is payable thereon
or that the article is exempt from tax under this
Act.

The present subsection 2 provides:
A declaration by the Tariff Board under this
section shall have the same force and effect as if
it had been sanctioned by statute.

That is to be repealed, and a new subsection
2 substituted therefor, as follows:
Before making a declaration under subsection I
the Tariff Board shall provide for a hearing and
shall publish a notice thereof in the Canada Gazette
at least twenty-one days prior to the day of the
hearing; and any person who, on or before that
day, enters an appearance with the Secretary of
the Tariff Board may be heard ai the hearing.

Subsection 3 makes a declaration by the
Tariff Board under this section final and conclusive, subject to appeal on a question of
law to the Exchequer Court, as I have already
pointed out.
There is also a new subsection 4, which
I think the Senate will consider important.
It cuts short the time within which a claim
may be made for refund resulting from or
arising out of a decision of the Tariff Board.
The time limit now provided in the Excise

SENATE
Act is two years. That limitation is set out in
subsection 5 of section 105 of the Act, and it
may be just as well to read it. It is as follows:
No refund or deduction from any of the taxes
imposed by this Act shall be paid unless application
in writing for the same is made by the person
entitled thereto within two years of the time when
any such refund or deduction first became payable
under this Act or under any regulation made
thereunder.

The new subsection 4 of section 115, as set
out in this bill, says that where a matter has
been referred to the Tariff Board because of
doubt, etc., and the board makes a declaration which has the effect of reducing the rate
of duty on any particular goods, no refund
or deduction shall be made in respect of
taxes paid more than six months before the
date of the application to the Tariff Board
for a declaration.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I interrupt my
honourable friend there? Does that mean
that the total period within which a refund
may be claimed is limited to six months?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The refund is limited to
taxes paid not more than six months before
the date of the application.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But six months might go by
before the application is heard.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I am sorry, but I have
not made the point clear. The subsection
says:
No refund or deduction shall be made under
section one hundred and five as the result of any
declaration of the Tariff Board under this section
in respect of taxes paid more than six months
...
before the date of the application to the Tariff
Board for a declaration under this section.

Hon. Mr. Haig: It is not six months after
the date of the application?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No. Let us assume that
an application is made today. Well, a refund
may be made in respect of taxes six months
prior to this date.
Section 13 of the bill, on page 6, provides
that this subsection 4 of section 115 shall not
come into force until the first day of
December of this year.
Sections 2 and 5 of the bill amend the
definitions of "duty paid value" and "sale
price". Frankly, after reading the amendments, wherein the word "is" is substituted
for "be", and "determining" is substituted for
"calculating", and so on, I must confess that
the meaning of any change that may possibly
be wrapped up in these substitutions is
beyond my ability to follow or explain. It
will be noted that the definitions of each of
the terms are given twice. From now on the
same definitions are used in both Part XI and
Part XIII.

Section 1 of the bill is of a type which we
should like to meet more often. It repeals
Part X of the Act. Naturally when a portion
of a taxing statute is repealed we would
prefer not to have it replaced by sone other

instance it happens that Part X, which deals
with the excise tax on cigarette papers and
cigarette paper tubes, is being repealed only
to make way for re-enactment of and
increase in the tax elsewhere in the bill, as I
have already mentioned.
These are all the points which I think it
is necessary to mention.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I ask my honourable
friend if the exemptions from the sales tax
remain as they have been?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The exemptions under
the Sales Tax part of the Excise Tax Act, Part
XIII, are net disturbed at all. The only
change is the addition of the miscellaneous
item. Schedule III, the exemptions schedule,
includes the exemptions under Part XIII and
other exemptions as well. Nothing is added to
and nothing is taken away from the exemptions from the sales tax.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Honourable senators, my
deskmate (Hon. Mr. Crerar) has just asked a
question which I had intended to ask. Before
I put a further question, I should like to
compliment my friend from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden) upon the exceptional clarity with
which he has explained this bill, and indeed
with which he always explains a bill.
The question I had intended to ask is this:
Has there been any change in the policy of
exempting all articles of food-I think I am
correct in saying "all"-from the sales tax?
I think that question has been answered now.
And am I correct in assuming that margarine
is to become subject to the sales tax of 10
per cent, although butter and all other foods
will continue to be exempted?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I should like to protest
against that.
Hon. Mr. Horner: The tax should be higher.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
will not deal with the technical clauses of the
bill, for I think they can be considered much
better in committee, where we have the
opportunity of questioning departmental
officials. We had an illustration of that this
morning when we were able to get from
officials an explanation of the reason for a
certain bill and a statement of how it will
work in practice. Honourable members will
know that in the present bill there are some

JUNE 13, 1951
sections with which I do not agree; still I
think it is better to go into them in
committee.
At present I wish to confine my few
remarks to the tremendous increase in taxation which will result from this bill. We may
as well recognize that the sales tax on articles
covered by the bill has been increased by 25
per cent. I could deal with the history of the
sales tax in this country, but I shall not take
the time to do that this afternoon. I may
be told that the tax was introduced when
the Conservative party was in power, and
although the Liberal party promised to repeal
it if given a chance, that bas not been done.
Indeed, the startling thing is that under a
Liberal administration the tax has been
increased.
Now, the effect of the sales tax on a certain class of people is absolutely unfair. One
may justify income tax on the ground that
those with higher incomes pay higher taxes
than those with lower incomes. That theory
may be open to question, but I will not go
into it now. There can, however, be no
contradiction of the fa.ct that sales tax bears
more heavily on the people in the lower
income tax brackets than upon any other
class. For instance, the family with an
income of $10,000 a year may buy no more
of the articles subject to sales tax than the
family with an income of $2,000. In fact, the
likelihood is that the one with the higher
income will have two or three children, while
the other may have five or six -children.
The system of sales tax is absolutely
wrong. It is a desperate remedy in desperate
times. We are not exactly in desperate
times now, but as we are expected to be
ready for war or by our readiness to prevent
war, we are in them to a certain extent. But
there is an awfully big difference between
being actually engaged in a war and being
in the preparatory stage. The fact is that
only a relatively few men and women have
so far been taken out of ind-ustrial employment to engage in defence projects. We have
perhaps five or six thousand men in Korea
and several thousand more have volunteered;
but, that is only a drop in the bucket compared with the number of men and women
who will be drawn from industry under
actual wartime conditions. In my opinion
sales tax is a wicked levy on the people. It
is just a step from the application of a
capital levy.
As regards excise tax, there may be some
justification for an increase in rates on some
of the items set out in the schedules, but as
to others there can be no justification. Take
automobiles, for instance. I have nothing
special to say about that item. True, the

world got along without cars before 1900, but
today they are practically a necessity for
many people. An excise tax of 15 per cent
seemed plenty, but now it is being increased
to 25 per cent.
I wish to draw the attention of the house
particularly to, the tax on articles that are
used for housekeeping. I know that in the
rural parts of the province of Manitoba the
women make good use of such electrical
appliances as stoves, washers, refrigerators
and heaters. This fact was demonstrated
recently during a visit to my house by a lady
from Holland district-a rural area-who
was attending a church meeting in the city.
While at the house she asked my wife to
show her the kitchen equipment. My wife
showed her the electric stove, the washing
machine, the sweeper, the refrigerator and
the heater in the bathroom. This lady from
the country commented that although she
lived on a farm she had all these conveniences, and that half of her equipment
was of the same make as my wife's.
In the western provinces, and indeed all
across Canada, electricity has gone into
almost every community, and there is no
greater convenience to farm people, particularly the housewives. In the development of electrical power in the province of
Manitoba we adopted the Ontario practice.
If I may digress for a moment, I would say
that the people of Ontario, having taken over
the power developments, are not required to
pay taxes on them to the Dominion government. We in turn took over the power sites
in Manitoba, and are not required to pay
taxes to the Dominion government.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: That is why we have a
sales tax.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The development and distribution of electrical energy all across my
province bas brought many labour-saving
devices to the women-folk. Now we find that
a great many of the appliances used in the
home to make life a little easier are being
taxed heavily. I am told that, except for the
care of young children, a woman whose home
is equipped with modern electrical conveniences can perform her household duties alone
as well as she could without that equipment
but with the help of one or two maids.
To me it is outrageous that a Liberal government should seek to increase sales tax
by 25 per cent on commodities that some
people say are unessential. I say they are
most essential, and therefore I oppose this
kind of legislation.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: How would you raise

argument on this suýbject with a member
from the ather place.
Speaking about
refrigerators, he said, "We can do without
Frigidaires. We did without them before;
why can't people do without them now?"
I ask honourable senators to reflect on the
housing conditions in this country today, and
partic.ularly to think of people with familles
living in small apartments. Without refrigeration, how are they to keep their food fresh;
and at present prices they cannot afford ta
let it go to waste. We are living in a different
age frorn our fathers.
Having endorsed the views of the leader
of the opposition, I want to register a special
protest against this 25 per cent tax on cheap
furs. It is most uni ust and discriminatory.
I do flot object ta a tax on expensive or luxury
furs being paid by people who can afford to
indulge in high-priced furs. But, if I have
gathered the right impression from the
debates in the other place, coats made of
mouton, which is simply processed sheepskin,
came under this heading and are subi ect to
the 25 per cent tax. We ail know that 1h
many parts of Canada the climate is such
that furs of some kind are an a.bsolute
necessity for the health and. well-being of
the people. Why should persans of limited
means, who live in areas where the temperature is at times extremely cold, and who
cannat buy costly furs but can afford $100
ta $150 for these cheap coats of processed
sheepskin, have ta pay 25 per cent tax on
these articles of clothing which are absolutely
necessary ta them?
1 kriow that my pratest will make na
difference, but I wish ta go on record as
saying that this tax is discriminatory and
most unjust. I register my protest against it.
Hon. Thomas Reid: I intend ta ask a
question of the mover of the bill, but before

remarks about saine observations we have

as the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) professes ta be when he says that

with hum on this point is that the great
mai arity of the people are not aware of a
hidden tax. The rate of sales tax began at 1
per cent, -but was soon increased as goverinments, being human, found out that nobody

to impose these taxes, they would not take
advantage of it. But let me tell you about
British Columbia.
In aur province there
is a provincial tax of 3 per cent, so that
honourable senators from other parts af
Canada who now pay a tax of 8 or 10 per
cent on a car would, if they lived in British
Columbia, pay an additional 3 per cent, and
they could flot escape t'his charge even
though the purchase were made outside the
province.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The same is true of
Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Why are the provincial
governments s0 anxious ta get the right ta
impose a sales tax? At the present turne,
when somebody goes into a store and for
a dollar article pays another three -cents by
way of 'provincial governinent tax, he is
reminded that his three cents goes direct to
t'he government, and this provokes, shail I
say, propaganda against the government. For
this reason the provincial governments of
British Columbia and every other province
would like to, be able ta impose a sales tax,
because it would be indirect and concealed,
and therefore unnoticed. It seems ta me
that we members of this honourable body
should not fail to keep a keen eye on what
governments are doing. The proposed tax-ation hits the poor far 'harder th-an it does
any honourable senator or other persan of
means, and it hits them ail along the line.
The apposition leader (Hon. Mr. Haig)
made some reference ta candy. I do not
favour throwing such sops to the people as
lowering the tax on candy, because in my
opinion, if the Minister of Health were doing
his duty he would protest against that particular tax concession. The more candy that
is consumed-at least the cheaper kind-the
worse for the health of the people. I remember a speech about Coca-Cola, which was
not wefl received everywhere. Whatever some
doctars may say, I believe that the heavy
consumption of drinks of this kind, and of
candies, particularly the cheap kinds, is of
great detriment ta the health of our children.
Last Christmas I attended a dental conference where, believe it or not, I had been
invited as guest speaker. I chose ta speak
about the care of teeth. Perhaps it was a case
of "«fools rush in where an-gels fear to tread".
At ail events, the president of the organization agreed with me that the great quanitity
of sugar consumed by aur people is certainly
detrimental ta their teeth. During the hast
war the children of Itahy did not have sugar,
and it has since been proven that as a consequence their teeth were in better condition
than those of the Italian children of prewar days and those of today.

SENATE

I maintain that from the health point of
view this tax should have been left as it
was.

If it is so necessary to acquire more

revenue the tax might even have been
boosted. But it was reduced because of the
great cry that was raised about the penalty
that was being imposed on our children.
I am opposed to hidden taxes, and I warn
Canadians that they had better watch out for
them because, in my opinion, the more the
government can take from the people in this
way the greater will be our federal expenditures. The majority of citizens think that it
is the personal income tax which produces
the revenue necessary to carry on the business of the country. They seldom turn their
eyes to the sales tax. They do not realize
that there is a hidden sales tax on everything
they purchase.
On previous occasions in this chamber I
have drawn attention to the high prices of
household goods and foodstuffs in Canada as
compared with those in the United States.
I maintain without fear of successful contradiction that competition in this country has
been stifled, and that there is practically no
competition at all. That is not so in the
United States. I can point to dozens of
articles that sell at varying prices in different stores in a certain American city; and
yet in British Columbia, no matter where
you go the prices for these goods are exactly
the same. Americans who have lived temporarily in Canada have pointed out to me
that there seems to be some kind of a combine operating against our people because of
lack of competition. I think we are all in
favour of free enterprise, but we are in
danger of losing free enterprise in Canada
because of this non-competition. At some
future time I shall quote prices to prove to
this honourable body that in the goods I have
mentioned competition exists in Seattle, and
that despite the higher wages paid in the
United States most goods are far cheaper
than in Canada.
Honourable senators, these hidden taxes
are dangerous; but all governments like them
because the majority of people are unaware
of their existence. I realize that money has
to be found somewhere to meet our increased
expenditures, but it is my opinion that our
people would show a greater interest in
government expenditures if they were better
acquainted with how they are contributing
their money. I should like the honourable
senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) to
tell us just what revenue was obtained last
year through the sales tax?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: About $470 million.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, the question-

Hon. Mr. Hayden: If no other senator
wishes to speak at this time, there are one
or two comments I should like to make in
closing the debate. In introducing the bill I
merely dealt with the proposed amendments
and the over-all effect of the legislation, but
the remarks of subsequent speakers seem to
have been based on policy and the wisdom
of imposing these taxes.
I always enjoy being asked questions by
the honourable senator from New WestIt was quite
minister (Hon. Mr. Reid).
unnecessary for him to have said that in a
certain instance he "rushed in where angels
fear to tread" because even in the short time
he has been in this chamber he has always
been forthright in his remarks. I have not
read the Debates of the other house over the
long period when our colleague was a
member there, so I cannot say whether or
not he ever strenuously objected to the
principle of indirect taxation. Assuming that
he did, however, let me say that those
supporting a party in power that increases
revenues for social security measures and so
forth, cannot then decry in a general way
the methods adopted to secure the necessary
revenues. I make that remark in its general
application.
Hon. Mr. Reid: There will be another tax
for social security purposes.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Quite probably there
will be. It is only a question of judgment
on the part of those who administer the
affairs of the country just how these taxes
will be imposed.
There is one thing we can all be sure of,
and that is that there will always be taxes;
and there will probably be an increase in
the number of things taxed. We must accept
this as inevitable, because taxation is the
only method by which a government can get
the revenues necessary to carry on its business. It may be suggested, of course, that
a government can cut down its expenditures.
Well, in times when the strain on the
treasury is not too great, a government can
afford to cut down on expenditures, and then
a lower tax rate is sufficient to carry on its
business.
Let me say that I do not like paying taxes
in any form. This is a most natural reaction.
I do not think anyone enjoys paying taxes.
But if you wish to live in an organized
society under conditions such as exist in
Canada, then you have got to be prepared
to make some contribution. It may be that
there are injustices here and there, but in a
democracy, which moves slowly at all times,
these things gradually correct themselves.
To my way of thinking, for the very reason

JUNE 13, 1951
given by the senator from New Westminster,
a sales itax is a logical method of raisinýg
substantial revenues. It is painless in the
sense that the ultimate consumer is not
aware of the tax he is paying on the article
he buys. The same argument applies with
respect to customs and other duties.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Would my honourable
friend agree that they are not only painless
but deceptive?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Well, after having said
that they were painless, if I agreed that they
were deceptive that would not advance the
argument in any direction at all. As I understand it, the principle of taxation is to raise
revenue from sources where it can be collected with the greatest ease, the least
objection, and at the lowest cost. Certainly
the sales tax satisfies those requirements. It
has been described as an unjust tax; but
considering the very large number of necessaries of life that are exempt from the tax,
I say it cannot correctly be so described.
Schedule III of the Act, which lists the
exemptions, includes practically every kind
of food used by humans, except margarine.
Furthermore, other goods and articles in
great variety are exempted, under these
headings:
Farm and Forest,
Engines,
Mines and Quarries,
Marine and Fisheries,
Religious, Charitable, Health, etc., Prînting and
Educational,
Diplomatic,
Certain building materials, Coverings,
Fire brick, Refractories, etc., Processing materials,
Machinery and apparatus to be used in manufacture or production,
Miscellaneous.

And then there is a whole list of exemptions
specifically referred to under the heading:
Goods enumerated in Customs Tariff items.

My submission is that having regard to
the exemptions applicable to necessaries of
life, the statement that the sales tax is unjust
is altogether too sweeping and general. It
may be said that the excise tax on washing
machines and refrigerators, for instance, is
in the circumstances unjust. Well, let me say
first of all that, as I conceive it, that tax and
other excise taxes were imposed for two
purposes, in accordance with government
policy, namely, to raise revenue and to take
away some spending power from the people.
The government considered it wise at this
time to levy taxes that would discourage a
buying spree in certain classes of goods, the
uncontrolled purchase of which might interfere with other and more important matters.
It was felt that the raising of the price of
goods through taxation was one way of
decreasing demand. Certainly that has turned
80713-37J

out to be true as to motor cars, and it looks
as if the upward spiral of inflation may have
stopped rising and turned into a downward
spiral of deflation. At any rate, that is one
objective that is sought to be accomplished
by this taxation.
The government does not want to start in
on a whole system of price controls, which
would necessarily involve wage controls and
prohibitions of one thing and another-to
say nothing of subsidies which would have
to be paid to producers of certain classes
of goods in order to take care of increased
production costs, for without subsidies no
plan of price control could long succeed. The
obvious reason why this would not be a good
time to introduce such a system of controls,
with all the other things that it would
involve, is that there is no future point to
which the people could look forward as being
likely to mark the termination of the controls.
When, in a time of war, a government asks
parliament to sanction controls, it is stated
or at least implied that they will be
terminated as soon as possible after the end
of the war. But just at present we are in
what might be called a twilight stage, when
we do not know whether the future will
bring peace or war, and in these circumstances it is considered unwise to introduce
controls to which no more or less definite
terminating point could be fixed.
Therefore the policy of the government is
to try to reduce by other means than price
and wage controls the inflationary pressures;
which are affecting us all; and as inflatiair
cannot be checked so long as the purchasing
power of the people continues to increase,
the government is seeking by means of taxation to drain off some of that purchasing
power. As to the effectiveness of that policy
some people may hold one opinion and some
may hold another. I am simply pointing out
that this is the policy of the government. It
is at any rate a weil-recognized method of
doing the desired job, and it seems to be
on the way towards doing that job in so far
as some items are concerned.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Before my honourable
friend goes farther, may I ask him a question
,for the purpose of seeing whether I understood him rightly? Did he say that the spiral
of inflation was going down?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No, I did not say that, or
at least I did not mean to say that. My point
is that an upward spiral of inflation is something that feeds on itself. The greater the
purchasing power in the hands of the people
the greater will be the demand for goods and
the higher the prices of goods. The object of
increased taxation such as proposed in thir
bill is ta deprive the public of some of that

SENATE
purchasing power so that the spiral of inflation may be stopped from rising and be
converted into a downward spiral. There is
of course a danger that if you start a deflationary spiral you may not be able to stop it.
Producers of goods spend large sums of money
on advertisements designed to encourage
people to buy, and if we were to create a
period of deflation the people would no longer
have much purchasing power. Somewhere in
between the two extremes there must be a
more favourable position than that which we
occupy at present.
The leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) has said he is against the increased
taxes provided for in the bill. Well, if we
are going to discuss simply an increase in
taxes, I too am against that on general
principle. That is, if we could get along
without increasing taxes I would certainly
subscribe to my honourable friend's statement. But the government must have more
money in order to take care of its present
program, particularly the defence program.
Hon. Mr. Duffus: On a pay-as-you-go basis.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes. In the last war we
adopted the excellent policy of paying 50 per
cent of the cost as we went along. Our
revenues were more buoyant than those of
most other countries that participated in the
war, and after the war we recovered more
rapidly than those countries did. The government's present policy is, to the fullest extent
which the capacity of the country will permit,
to pay as we go the expenditures forced upon
us by the existing emergency.
Hon. Mr. Duffus: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: This bill that we have
before us is, in the opinion of the government,
necessarily incidental to the carrying out of
that policy. You may agree or disagree with
it, but that is the government's policy.
My honourable friend the leader of the
opposition also says that we are spending too
much money. Well, I agree that it would be
an excellent idea if we could reduce our
expenditures and at the same time do all that
we must do in this period of emergency to
prepare ourselves to fight a war, if it should
break out; and also if we could at the same
time continue providing for all the social
security measures that we now have in force.
My friend the senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid), who was a supporter of the government in another place
when those measures were adopted, must
take some responsibility for them. I am not
criticizing him at all, for I myself have supported the same measures so long as I have
been a member of this house. Yet those
measures increase the drain on our revenues,

and we must see that more money is collected
through taxes. If we could maintain those
measures without increasing taxation, no one
would be happier than I. If the leader of the
opposition could whisper into the ear of, say,
the President of the Soviet Union, and
persuade him to bring about a cessation of
propaganda against us and our allies, so that
we would no longer be disturbed by the threat
of war and would no longer need to continue
the defence program which we have undertaken, then I should say there would be no
need for increased taxation of the kind we are
now considering.
It is always easy to get up and talk against
increased taxes. Anybody can make himself
popular by proclaiming that taxes are too
high and should be reduced. But there are
times when, if you are considering the best
interests of the country over a long range,
you must run the risk-if need be, even during an election campaign-of incurring
whatever degree of unpopularity may result
from advocacy of increased taxes. The government says that it is in the best interests
of Canada, and of other countries who think
and act as we do, and want to preserve their
ideals and objectives, to unite and be strong
enough to resist aggression if it should come.
We hear criticism, for instance, based on
whether the fur used in the manufacture of
a certain garment is a high-priced or lowpriced fur. When we take an over-all objective view of things, such criticisms are, in
my view, petty. I believe that every Canadian loves his country, and wants to continue
to live in a land of freedom and security.
When he realizes what is going on elsewhere
in the world, he is quite prepared to face any
obligation, and perhaps even to pay any price,
to maintain economic stability in this country.
Imposition of taxes is a matter of government policy. Some of these taxes could perhaps have been better chosen, and with
respect to these the opposition is perfectly
free to criticize the action of the government.
If the iron 'curtain suddenly came down on
Canada, such criticism would of course be
immediately shut off. Criticisn is, therefore,
necessary and advisable; but we must keep
in mind that if Canada is to remain strong in
her place beside the other free countries she
has got to increase taxation in order to do so.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, is it your pleasure to adopt the
motion?
Some Hon. Senators: Carried!
Hon. Mr. Haig: On division.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time, on division.

JUNE 13, 1951
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Hayden: I move that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
POST OFFICE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. G. P. Campbell moved the second
reading of Bill 322, an Act respecting the
Canada Post Office.
He said: Honourable senators, I desire,
first, to draw attention to the fact that all
honourable senators have in their files a
copy of Bill 322, as presented for first reading
in the other place. Except for certain changes
in rates, as set out in Section 11, the bill was
given third reading in the other house in
substantially the form in which honourable
senators have it before them.
This measure constitutes the first revision
of the Canada Post Office Act that has taken
place in many years. There are few changes
except in rates-to which I shall refer-and
one or two other amendments to which I
will draw specific attention. This bill would
delete certain arnbiguous and obsolete provisions which are not in keeping with the
practice followed in the Post Office Department, and in that way would considerably
improve the Act.
Because of the lateness of the hour and
the fact that it is proposed to refer this
bill to the Standing Committee on Banking
and Commerce, where officers of the department will be available to answer questions,
I will not take the time of the house to
deal with the bill section by section.
Section 2, which is the interpretation section, contains definitions of terms used
throughout the bill.
Section 3, dealing with the general organization of the Post Office Department, provides for the appointment of the Postmaster
General by a Commission under the Great
Seal of Canada.
By section 4 the Governor in Council is
given power to appoint a Deputy Postmaster
General, and the other officers and employees
may be appointed by the department.
The powers, duties and functions of the
Postmaster General are very clearly set out
in section 5 of the bill.
Section 6 gives the Postmaster General
power to make regulations which will provide for administration of the department,
and for the control of the various Post Office
branches, and generally for the handling
and distribution of mail.

Section 7, prohibits the use of mails for
unlawful purposes, and these provisions may
be of particular interest to some honourable
members in view of the recent discussions
which have taken place -about the action
taken by the Postmaster General in prohibiting the use of mail where fraud.was suspected in the sale of securities. It was at
that time suggested that there sheuld be a
board of review, to which any person who
had been affected by a prohibitory order
made against him could appeal to the minister. This new section will give the Postmaster General power to make an interim
order prohibiting the use of the mails in
cases where he suspects that the mails are
being used for fraudulent purposes. I would
point out that this power is necessary in
order that action may be taken quickly
against those who commit such frauds. We
know that they are of a hit-and-run nature,
and that the offenders may, when they feel
they are being discovered, move elsewhere
and operate under another name. The bill
would, therefore, continue the power which
authorizes the Postmaster General to take
immediate action in such cases. The offender
may, however, obtain a hearing by applying
to the Postmaster General, who will refer
the matter to a board of review consisting
of three persons 'appointed by him. This
body will have al the powers of a Commissioner under the Inquiries Act. After
hearing the case it will report to the Postmaster General, who has the final say in the
matter, and who, as the minister responsible
for the administration of the department,
retains the power to either confirm or revoke
the interim order. Some question may be
raised as to whether or not this is an effective appeal from a decision of the Postmaster
General. I would point out to honourable
senators that the minister, who is charged
with the administration of the department
and the control of the mails, is in turn
responsible to parliament for any action which
he or his officers take.
I turn next to section 10, which has to do
with the increase in rates, and is probably
the most important section of the bill. As
honourable senators know, the exclusive
right and power to handle letter mail and
distribute letters is vested in the Postmaster
General. So it has always been regarded as
important that parliament should retain control of letter rates. This matter was discussed at some length in another place.
I desire to point out to honourable senators
that the proposed increase applies, not to
letters, but only to newspapers and periodicals. The rates now in force are inadequate;
in fact the returns show that revenues

SENATE
received from the handling of this class of

and other periodicals.

This total increased

imail amounted to less than $4 million, revenue of $1,800,000 will have the effect, it
whereas the cost of handling it was

between
fifteen and sixteen million dollars, and the
result was a deficit on this item of about $12
million. Therefore it was felt that there
should be an adjustment of rates which would
lighten somewhat the burden which in this
respect falls upon the taxpayer. The low
rates which have existed hitherto have
amounted to a subsidy to those engaged in
the publication of news through newspapers,
weeklies and other periodicals. While nothing
should be done to prevent the distribution
throughout Canada of newspapers and
periodicals which disseminate information, it
is important to take a realistic attitude with
respect to the cost of handling these things,
and the proposed changes in rates will go some
way towards providing for increased costs in
Rages, salaries and distribution expenses.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Would the honourable
senator indicate what the rates are now?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: I was about to give
some figures by way of comparison. The
present rate for dailies is 1 cents a pound for
the news content, and 4 cents per pound for
the advertising material where it occupies
more than 50 per cent of the space. In other
words, a daily newspaper without advertising,
or with an advertising content of less than
50 per cent, now pays 11 cents per pound; but
if the advertising content exceeds 50 per cent,
the rate for the advertising material is 4
cents per pound. The proposed new rate is
2½ cents per pound on news and 4 cents for
each pound of advertising material.
In this connection I would draw the attention of honourable senators to a change in
the bill since it was introduced in the other
place. The original draft provided for a rate
of 4 cents, without any reference to advertising. Later it was provided that so far as
weeklies are concerned, that those having a
circulation of 50,000 or more would pay 3
cents for each pound weight or fraction
thereof, as against the old rate of l½ cents
per pound; weeklies having a circulation of
less than 50,000 but more than 10,000 would
be charged 2,, cents for each pound weight or
fraction thereof; and for weeklies with a
circulation of less than 10,000 the charge
would be 1 cents for each pound weight, as
compared with the old rate of 1 cent per
pound, subject to the exception that 2,500
copies may be mailed free of postage within
a distance of forty miles of the place of
publication in a city or town having a population of not more than 10,000 persons.
It is estimated that the increased revenue
will amount to about $800,000 from the dailies
and $1,000,000 from the monthlies, weeklies

is hoped of reducing to $10,000,000 the difference between revenues and costs. Of the
total volume of distribution, 45 per cent consists of dailies and 55 per cent of weeklies
and other periodicals. It is estimated that
the increased revenues from these two
sources will correspond with the percentages
they bear to the total volume. This, it is
considered, is a fair distribution.
I do not know that the remainder of the
bill needs any special comment.
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: How will section 11 in
its amended form affect the small weekly
newspaper with a circulation of, say, 2,000?
Am I to understand that no charge is made
for the first 2,500 copies or less?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Yes; there is no charge
where the total number of copies is 2,500 or
less, distributed within an area of 40 miles
of the place of publication.
There is a slight change in the section under
"Free mail". Letters may be mailed without
postage to or by a member of the Senate or
House of Commons during a session or during
ten days prior to or following a session.
Previously the privilege was limited to members of both houses during a session, and to
anyone sending mail to a member of either
bouse ten days before a session. Now it is
extended to ten days before and ten days
after the session.

Hon. Mr. Lambert: Both ways.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Both ways.
There is one change in connection with the
power of the Postmaster General to deal with
contracts. Formerly the period of time for
advertising a contract for conveying mail
was not less than six weeks. That period is
reduced to three weeks. Also the Postmaster
General is given power to enter into any
contract for conveying mail involving an
annual expenditure up to $1,000. Hitherto
the maximum for a contract which could be
let by the Postmaster General without the
formality of tender was $200 per annum.
In the remainder of the bill provision is
made for the transportation of mail, and
persons engaged in this form of transportation
are required to provide adequate facilities
for carrying the mail or vehicles containing
the mail.
There is another amendment dealing with
offences. Under the present Act the Postmaster General has certain powers to impose
fines and penalties. Under this bill these
powers have been deleted, and the offences
have been set forth in the Act. Provision has

JUNE 13, 1951
been made for prosecution in the usual way,
either by indictable offence or non-indictable
offence.
The final section of the bill provides that
the Postmaster General shall present to the
Governor General an annual report respecting the administration of this department.
Unless there are specific inquiries, I would
suggest that honourable senators hold their
questions until the officers of the department
and the Deputy Postmaster General appear
before us in ýcommittee to discuss in detail
the various sections of this bill.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Is section 23 new?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: No. I just mentioned
that the Postmaster General previously had
the authority to award contracts up to $200
without tender. This provision has been
changed to give him authority to award contracts up to $1,000.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Can the honourable
senator tell us whether there is a deficit or a
surplus in the total revenues of this
department?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: I am sorry, but I do
not have that information.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It seems that deliveries
have been reduced to one a day, and this has
resulted in a great deal of dissatisfaction
among post office employees. Is this matter
referred to anywhere in the bill before us?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: If the honourable
senator is referring to Toronto, I can say that
the Post Office Department is quite aware of
the bad situation which exists in that city.
As a result of the tremendous increase in the
business and in the population of that city,
the post office officials have found it impossible to get the necessary personnel to provide
for the frequency of delivery that they feel is
warranted. This problem is receiving constant
attention, but my information is that there
does not appear to be any immediate hope of
improving the situation.
It may be of interest to honourable members to learn that during the last five years
285 post offices have been established in
Canada. During the same period 65,000 additional rural route boxes were set up, and
385,00.0 additional persons were served by
letter-carrier delivery. I suppose the larger
cities are responsible for increasing the
burden on the department in connection with
this last item. The matter referred to by the
honourable gentleman from Toronto-Trinity
is under consideration.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Perhaps the wages are
too low.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I am opposed to our Post
Office Department subsidizing the newspapers

of this country to the extent of $12 million. I
think it is time to take action when the
honourable the Postmaster General admits
that Canadians could have a three-cent postage rate instead of a four-cent rate if it were
not for this subsidy of $12 million. I realize
that this subsidy has been paid for a long
time now, and that people have got used to it.
I am also familiar with the argument that our
people read the newspapers and are educated
by them and so on. But I maintain that if
the newspapers were to decrease their advertising by a slight degree there would be no
need for this subsidy.
Many countries today are appealing to
Canada for newsprint, and in this connection
I would refer to the large size of some of our
daily newspapers. The week-end editions
carry magazine sections which must weigh at
least two pounds, and fifty to sixty per cent
of the space in them is taken up by advertising. I should like to know what it costs the
government to send some of these trashy, sexy
and so-called comic papers through the mail
from, say, Toronto to British Columbia. I
am absolutely opposed to this country subsidizing this type of newspaper. The merchants
who advertise in them are of course aware
that it is to their advantage to have the
newspapers go into every corner of the
country; but I would point out that in many
instances they are competing against local
merchants who pay taxes in the places where
they carry on business.
I know that my protest will not have any
effect on this legislation, because the bill has
already been passed by the House of
Commons. I just wanted to -let the Senate
know where I stand on the issue.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Is the subsidy of $12
million a gain to the newspapers or is it a
gain to the recipients of the newspapers?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I cannot give you any better
authority than the Postmaster General, and I
have quoted his words. If you take exception
to what he has said you should ask about it
in committee. It is not what I say.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, but my question
really is: Who gets the benefit?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I think the newspapers get
a greater benefit than the readers. Both the
newspaper publisher and the newspaper
advertiser are anxious that the paper be
widely circulated. The advertiser, as is
well known, pays according to the number
of subscribers to the publication in which he
is advertising. The larger the circulation
the more costly the advertising rate. It is
to the advantage of newspapers to have a
large circulation, and naturally they are death

SENATE
against paying a higher postal rate. The
protests against this come mostly from newspaper men.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Is it not a fact, that
the larger the circulation the larger the
benefits given by the newspaper to its
Canadian readers?
Hon. Mr. Reid: That is a very debatable
point.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: It depends what is in
the newspaper.
Hon. W. A. Buchanan: Honourable senators,
I hope that I will not be interpreted as rising
in my capacity of publisher of a newspaper,
though I confess that the newspapers are
affected by this legislation. Probably those
most affected are the smaller newspapers of
the country. I am not complaining on my
own account, but I resent the suggestion that
the newspapers are being subsidized and the
impression is left that nothing else in this
country is subsidized.
Unquestionably a loss in postal revenue for
carrying newspapers may be interpreted by
some people as a subsidy. On the other
hand, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation
is competing with the newspapers in Canada
in advertising as well as in supplying news,
and is the Canadian Broadoasting Corporation not being subsidized in some form or
other directly by the people of Canada? Is
this not also true of Trans-Canada Airways?
I say that that corporation loses money in
the carrying of mail, and that the lass is
made up by the public. It seems to me most
unfair to single out newspaper publishers
as though they were the only class receiving
a federal subsidy.
What I am about to say bas nothing to do
with the newspaper I publish, so I cannot
be accused of speaking from self-interest. In
Prince Edward Island there is published a
newspaper whose circulation is principally
among farmers who can be reached only by
the rural mail routes. They will now have
to pay more money to have the paper
delivered to their homes. There is no question about that, for the newspaper publisher
cannot absorb the whole extra cost. I
received today from the publisher of a paper
in a small city in Ontario a letter stating that
the extra postage charges would mean an
additional expenditure of $10,000 a year for
him. I cannot say that he is raising any
strong complaint, but I bring the matter to
the attention of the bouse because I believe
that the increased costs will be proportionately heavier for the small papers than for
the large newspapers.

I rose principally to speak on this question
of subsidy. If we are going to stop the payment of subsidies from the federal treasury
let us go ahead and do so; but surely we
should not single out some subsidies for this
treatment and leave others undisturbed.
Hon. Paul H. Bouffard: Honourable senators, I have no financial interest at all in any
newspaper in the country, but I know that
the financial position of some of them is not
what it should be. The more educational a
paper is, the greater is the difficulty of supporting it by revenue from subscriptions and
advertisements.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I quite understand that
some papers in large cities are able to balance
their budgets with more or less ease. With
high revenues from subscriptions and advertising, they will not be seriously affected by
the increased mailing rates. But the eff ect
on a newspaper in a smaller city-I would
say, for instance, in Quebec-might be
severe, for much of the distribution is done
by mail, to subscribers who live at considerable distances from the place of publication.
There is no other means of sending the paper
to many of these people, and I am sure that
if the increase which was first proposed had
been put into effect the most educational
newspapers published in the province of
Quebec would have found it hard to survive.
They could only have attempted to meet the
increased cost by raising their subscription
rates. Were they obliged to do that the
number of subscribers would decline, and of
course in consequence the advertising rates
and revenues would go down. In my opinion
the full postal increase as originally proposed
would have made it impossible for some of
the most useful papers in the country to
balance their budgets.
I am not saying at all that a subsidy should
be paid to the newspapers of the country.
My point is that, had the increased mail
charges been imposed to the full extent first
suggested, the burden on newspapers which
fulfil a very useful function in this country
would have been very heavy, perhaps in
some cases heavier than they could bear. I
therefore wish to congratulate the Postmaster General upon his action in reducing
the rates from the level first announced, and
I hope it now will be possible for the newspapers,
particularly
those
outside
of
Montreal, to carry on without increasing
their subscription and advertising rates.
There is a considerable difference between
advertising rates charged in Montreal and in
Quebec city. In Montreal a newspaper can
get 40 cents a Une, but in Quebec it is not

JUNE 13, 1951
possible to charge more than 16 cents. If
a publisher asked a higher ra-te than that he
would flot get the advertising. The subscription price for newspapers in Quebec is now
Up to $12 a year. Well, there are a good
many people who will pay that much for a
newspaper but cannot afford to pay any
more, and who, would have to discontinue
their subscrîptions if the charge were
increased. And, as I mentioned before, any
serious decline in the number of subscribers
will cause a drop in advertising revenues.
I do not consider that the government is
paying a subsidy to the newspapers. As I
look at ît, the government is sirnply doing
what it can to enaýble as many people as
possible to, receive a newspaýper. And of
course a newspaper often furnishes to the
reader not only news but material of considerable educational value. Though I arn
flot opposing the increased mail rates as
provided for in the bill, 1 ýcertainiy thinýk
the igovernment would have been unýwise had
it insisted on fixing the rates high enough to
wipe -out the whole of -the $12 million deficit.
I repeat my opinion that no surbsidy is
being given to the newspapers. If there is
any subsidy at ail, it is to the newspaper
readers, many of whom. live in more or less
rem-ote parts of the country and depend upon
a newspaper for their news -and a great bulk
of other informative material. It is a good.
thing that the postage charges are not being
pushed so high that newspapers will in
consequence be forced, to inicrease their subscription rates, for then many people such as
I have in mind would have to do without a
newspaper altogether. Certainly I would flot
h-ave supported any bil which would have
had ýthat result.
Han. Arthur W. Raebuck:
H-onourable
senators, like the preceding speaker (Hon.
Mr. Bouffard) I also, have no financial interest inany newspaper. But I arn by no means
withýout experience
l newspaper work.
When a younger man I earned my living
for fifteen years as a newspaper writer: five
years on the Toronto Daily Star editorial
staff, and ten years in northern Ontario,
wýhere I published my own small papers. So
I have some intimate knowledge of the
difficulties encountered by newspapers in
smaller communities in their struggle to
survive.
My opinion is-I may be prejudiced in
this-that newspapers, both large and smnall,
have performed a very useful service in our
coinmunities.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
80713-38

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I think that without
assuming too much as a Canadian-which I
arn proud to be-I can say that the population
of thiscountry is above the worldl average in
intelligence. I do not think we are assuming too much in saying that. I would attrîbute
a considerable degree of that high intelligence, which we as a nation have, to the
services rendered by our magazines and newspapers. It would indeed be a disaster if -any
large n;umber of these publications went out
of business. I would cail the attention of my
fellow senators to, the number of newspapers
that over the years have not; survived. There
are fewer newspapers today in Ontario, and
I think in Canada generaily, than there were
ten years ago.
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: That is, the case al
acrosýs Canada.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Thank you. I would
suppose that to be the case. The difficulties
which newspapers encounter in keeping up
their aýctivities are very great indeed. The
logic of the matter was expressed in the
question which. I asked as to whether the
bonus by way of a moderate charge for carrying, was to the newspaper industry as such
or to, the readers who buy the newspapers. I
arn not i a. position to, express an opinion
as an accountant on whether $12 million is
too littie or too much, or on whether the
favour is well distributed. I think, however,
that the minister has a very grave responsibility on his shoukiers if, by some change la
the policy of the Post Office, he makes it
impossible for at least sorne of the smaller
newspapers to exist.
Hon. G. H. Barbour: Honourable senators,
the senator frorn Lethbridge (Hon. Mr.
Buchanan) referred to a paper in Prince
Edward Island which would be .adversely
affected by the postage rates provided by the
bull as originally drafted, and before it was
amended in the other house. I arn told that
the difference between the original rate of
four cents a pound and the arnended rate of
two and one-half cents would arnount to the
difference between $30,000 and $10,000. That
is a big item for a newspaper like the
Charlottetown Guardian. The arnendrnent
would provide at least some relief.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable senators, I do not intend to, detain the house
long, but there is one -aspect in connection
with the relationship of the Post Office
Departrnent to the distribution of newspapers
which should be appreciated. When the bill
reaches comrnittee we will possibly be able
to analyze the situation more carefully than

SENATE
we can here. I feel, however, that the problem with which the department is faced in
connection with insufficient revenue from the
carrying of newspapers is largely concentrated in a comparatively few populous areas
in this country.
Reference has been made to the growth
and 'size of the so-called Sunday magazine.
I know that fourteen or fifteen years ago
the department considered a siinilar proposal to the one contained in this bill in
order to secure additional revenue from the
carrying of newsprint in the form of newspapers. The extensive network of roads and
highways in the Province of Ontario, and
also in Quebec, has enabled certain metropolitan newspapers to distribute their daily
and weekly publications to a large extent by
truck. They have thus been relieved of the
four cent rate that would be charged to carry
the papers by mail to, for instance, Vancouver. I think there is something to be said
by way of requiring those particular institutions to pay a little more on that part of
their output which goes through the mails.
In their cases there is an equalizing factor
by reason of distributions which are made
by truck.
I was brought up in an Ontario town
where a country weekly newspaper was published, and I have a particular interest in
newspapers in places where the circulation
is limited to 2,500 or 3,000. They will not
be affected by this bill. I think a greater
value attaches itself to the weekly newspapers than is generally appreciated. I know
of many towns in Ontario which forty years
ago had two newspapers, now have only one.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The reason they have
only one paper today is because the population of those communities has declined in
favour of the urban areas in and around
Toronto, Hamilton and other cities where
industrial development has taken place. The
amalgamation of the two newspapers in those
towns came about by economic pressure.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: And competition from
the big papers.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Industrial growth in the
urban communities has been greater than in
the rural areas. I know that my own home
town, which at one time had a population of
2,700 or 2,800, is today half that size. The
same situation would apply to the entire
rural area of Western Ontario, and I suppose

rendered today by the single weekly papers,
which are distributed in and around these
small towns and act as a kind of letter from
home to those who have moved away from

the area, is one which I think this bill
recognizes by exempting them from the extra
cost of postage.
As to the larger and more wealthy publications, which carry more advertising, and particularly the week-end magazines, I think
they could be properly analysed and classified so as to bring out some facts about where
the incidence of this change should rest,
rather than leave the burden of the cost of
distribution to be spread over the country
regardless of the fields that are being served.
It is very difficult to bring to bear on any
special groups the incidence of any kind of
taxation. It has got to fall on all heads. I
think in this case it might be possible to
grade the charge in such a way as to get
greater returns from the sources that should
pay it, and that have been getting the benefits
of scientific development over the past
twenty-five or thirty years, in particular, in
the form of better highways, motor trucks,
and so on.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Are magazine sections of
Saturday newspapers subject to the same
rate as the newspapers themselves?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Yes. The magazine
section is rated as a weekly periodical.
Hon. Mr. Haig: For instance, if the
Winnipeg Free Press sends out a magazine
section, and Maclean's Magazine goes out the

same day, are both charged the same postal
rates?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: They pay the same
rate if they are in the classification of a
weekly publication.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: And the Toronto Star
Weekly, and the Montreal

Standard?

Hon. Mr. Campbell: That is right. They are
classed as weeklies, and pay the same rate
as a magazine.
Hon. Vincent Dupuis: I should like to
take this occasion to say a word or two in
favour of our French newspapers and their
publishers. I submit that, compared with
newspapers and magazines published in the
English language, these French papers are
in an especially difficult position. As you
know, the bulk of the French population is
in the Province of Quebec, and newspapers
and magazines published in that province
are sent to any part of Canada where there
is a nucleus of French-speaking people. I
recall that the last time I went to Edmonton,
while looking for a French newspaper, I
entered a store and found there all the
Montreal papers. I was told that the proprietor was the only supplier in Alberta of
French-speaking newspapers.

JUNE 13, 1951
Contrary to the opinion of my honourable
friend from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid), I believe that the subsidizing of a
newspaper is as justifiable and effective as
the subsidizing of any public service, such as
a railroad or the radio. I think it is especially important to support the French press,
which incurs an exceptionally heavy expense
in distributing magazines and newspapers
to parts of the country remote from the
place of their publication.
I take this opportunity to tender my
respects and most sincere thanks to our
English-speaking fellow citizens for the
broadminded way in which they have helped
us to maintain among our Canadian citizens
of French origin all over the country their
knowledge and appreciation of our language
and culture. Two great races have formed
our Canadian heritage and I firmly believe
that any help we can give to spread and
improve the knowledge of the French and
English languages would contribute greatly
in giving to our common country that special
characteristic which would differentiate it
from other countries. I do not know whether
an especially low rate of postage is available
to newspapers and periodicals which are sent
from the province of Quebec, and principally
from Montreal, to the extreme limits of
Canadian territory. If not, I suggest that
assistance in this form be given to these
publications, which foster the love and knowledge of our language and literature.
(Translation):
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri:
Honourable
senators, after the speeches that have just
been delivered in English, it seems fitting
that I should add a word in French. It
seldom happens that a law enacted for the
whole country pleases everybody. There is
always someone, somewhere, who feels
wronged, because
exceptions
invariably
crop up and it is impossible to make a law
providing for every exception.
Generally
speaking, it is the white-collar class which
is hardest hit by an excise or income tax
law. In considering the bill which is before
us, I would compare that class of the population to newspapers with average circulation,
published in cities of average population,

80713-38à

as our honourable friend from Grandville
(Hon. Mr. Bouffard) explained so well a
moment ago. Those are the newspapers that
educate the public, because, after all, the
thick newspapers, filled with advertising, are
often more like colossal circulars than instruments of learning. We would be ill advised
to pass laws which would promote the distribution of commercial circulars by the
Post Office Department, while shackling this
means of culture.
I wish to thank the Postmaster General
and to congratulate him for having amended
his original bill as he did, in order to help
out the newspapers with average circulation
which are unable to take in the most highly
paid advertising because of their limited
space. The heavier newspapers contain
so-called comic strips which, far from serving
an educational purpose, seem rather to distort people's minds and hearts. I wonder
if the Postmaster General could not bear
down more heavily on this particular section
of widely read newspapers, or at least force
them to put a little more sense in these
so-called comics, in the interest of our young
girls and boys and even of those who,
although they have reached a respectable
age, emulate youngsters or go back to their
childhood ways.
Such a step would
strengthen the ideals of our young people,
further the greatness of our country and
provide them with educational matter
presented not in slang but in good French.
I sincerely hope that an effort will be made
to improve conditions. If the press is supposed to be an instrument of culture, then let
us make sure that that insrument develops
the mind instead of distorting it.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
NATIONAL HOUSING BILL

On the Orders of the Day.
Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, before the Orders of the Day are

proceeded with, I should like to make a brief
explanation with regard to the legislative
program before the house.
I anticipate that all the business on the
Order Paper will be disposed of this afternoon, and that there will be no important
measures forthcoming from the other place
for some days. It is my intention, therefore,
to ask that when the house adjourns today it
stand adjourned until next Tuesday evening.
There is, however, one difficulty in the
way of carrying out that intention. The
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce has before it Bill No. R-12, an Act to
amend the National Housing Act, 1944. The
committee sat yesterday and considered this
bill, but because additional information was
required by the leader opposite, and others,
it was not reported back to the house today.
In the ordinary course of events an adjournment until next Tuesday would mean that
the passage of this bill would not take place
before next Wednesday. It is the wish of
the minister concerned that the matter be not
delayed to that extent. I have conferred
with the leader opposite, and he has indicated
that he is quite willing to get the information
he wants from the Minister of Finance when
he appears before the Finance Committee
later this afternoon. Therefore I would suggest to honourable senators that upon completion of the business on the Order Paper
the house, by consent, should adjourn during
pleasure. In that way members of the Banking and Commerce Committee could attend
a meeting of that committee, which I have
already undertaken to call, and when the
sitting of the house is resumed the bill could
be reported back and given third reading.
I would ask the leader opposite if he is in
agreement with that suggestion.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
as the leader of the government has said,
Bill R-12 was considered in the Banking and
Commerce Committee yesterday. At five
minutes to six the chairman pointed out that
it was getting late, and that perhaps we had
better adjourn. I suggested that we proceed
with our consideration of the bill, but as that
did not seem to meet with approval, I then
requested that the report be delayed to allow
me to get certain information regarding
interest rates from the Minister of Finance.
Subsequently, the Chairman of the Finance
Committee informed me that a meeting of his
committee would take place this afternoon,
and that the Minister of Finance would be
in attendance, whereupon I agreed to put
my questions to the Minister of Finance today
when he appears before the Finance
Committee.

not deal witli the question of whether troops

JUNE 19, 1951
are to be sent abroad, and it has no connection
with the question of command of integrated
NATO forces. It is solely concerned with the
laws and regulations which are to govern an
armed force after it has been sent, by mutual
agreement, into another North Atlantic
country.
It is a fully reciprocal agreement, and will
give valuable protection to Canadian servicemen serving in the integrated force. At the
same time the rights of the receiving country
are fully respected. The agreement provides
that "it is the duty of a force . . . to respect

the law of the receiving State, and to abstain
from any activity inconsistent with the spirit
of the present agreement, and, in particular,
from any political activity in the receiving
State."
General Eisenhower, in a statement issued
today, says that it is a most important agreement, one of great significance to the integrated force under his command.
As there will be full opportunity for
detailed discussion of the agreement in parliament in due course, I do not propose to
take up time now with a clause by clause
explanation. I will, however, list the main
subjects dealt with in the agreement. They
are:
1. The criminal and disciplinary jurisdiction of
the military courts of the visiting force and the
jurisdiction of the civil courts of the receiving
country;
2. The application of the tax laws and customs
tariff of the receiving country to the visiting force;
3. The application of the immigration regulations
of the receiving country to the members of the
visiting force;
4. The settlement of claims for damage or injury
arising out of the activities of the visiting force;
5. The procurement by the visiting force of
goods, accommodation, labour and services from
sources in the receiving country;
6. The wearing of uniforms and the carriage of
arms.

From this brief description of the scope
of the agreement, honourable members will
realize, I am sure, that the twelve negotiating countries, with their differing laws and
legal systems, had to be willing to compromise
in order to arrive at any agreement. It was
realized that many countries might have to
modify their laws to take account of the
presence of other NATO forces in their
midst; but an attempt was made to reduce to
a minimum the need for legislative change.
The legal authorities of the Canadian Government are studying the agreement to determine whether legislation will be necessary,
and if so, its scope and extent. It is expected
that the whole question will be brought
before parliament at the next session.

In conclusion I should like to quote the
statement made today in London by the
Chairman of the North Atlantic Council
Deputies. He said:
The agreeement on the status of armed forces
which the North Atlantic Treaty governiments have
signed today is an important addition to the
structural framework of NATO. We believe we
have developed a multilateral charter that provides
a uniform and administratively workable basis
for an orderly, consistent, and fair relationship
between forces from one NATO country and any
other NATO country where they may be assigned
to serve.
The agreement is part of the collective defence
effort, and is essential for the development of the
integrated force under General Eisenhower's command. It gives the governments and the military
authorities simple, practical procedures for regulating a complex relationship.
It guarantees the
members of the armed forces adequate legal protection, and at the sane time, without infringing
on the authority of the military command, fully
recognizes the peacetime rights and responsibilities
of the civilian authorities in the host countries.
The development of collective defence in peacetime requires that forces of various countries which
form part of the integrated force for the defence
of the North Atlantic Treaty area be stationed in
various other countries.
They must be free to
move from one country to another, in accordance
with the demands of strategy and the orders of
the Supreme Command. It is essential that there
be uniformity of arrangement governing their
status in countries other than their own and
their relationship to the authorities and people
of those countries. The conclusion of this agreement is an important step in our common effort to
organize integrated strength adequate to keep the
peace.

Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I should like to thank the honourable acting
leader for the complete statement which he
has given on this problem, and also to offer
a suggestion to which I am sure all members
of this house will agree. The final draft of
the agreement, which the Clerk has just
handed me, is not very long, and as there
will not likely be much discussion tonight
and our Hansard will be short, I would
suggest that this document be made an
appendix to tonight's proceedings. This final
draft is an important document, and one
which the judges, lawyers and citizens of
Canada will want to study. If printed in
Hansard,it will be available to the members
of this house for ready reference, and we will
be well informed on the subject when it
,comes up for discussion.
I would move that this document be printed
in today's Hansard.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Obviously, I have no
objection whatever to my honourable friend's
suggestion.
The motion was agreed to.

APPENDIX
Final Draft of the Agreement Between the Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty
Regarding the Status of Their Forces
The Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty
signed in Washington on 4th April, 1949,
Considering that the forces of one Party
may be sent, by arrangement, to serve in
the territory of another Party;
Bearing in mind that the decision to send
them and the conditions under which they
will be sent, in so far as such conditions
are not laid down by the present Agreement,
will continue to be the subject of separate
arrangements between the Parties concerned;
Desiring, however, to define the status of
such forces while in the territory of another
Party;
Have agreed as follows:

solely against the person or property of
another member of the force or civilian
of a
component of that State or
dependent;
(ii) offences arising out of any act or
omission done in the performance of
official duty.
(b) In the case of any other offence the
authorities of the receiving State shall have
the primary right to exercise jurisdiction.
(c) If the State having the primary right
decides not to exercise jurisdiction, it shall
notify the authorities of the other State as
soon as practicable. The authorities of the
State having the primary right shall give
sympathetic ýconsideration to a request
from the authorities of the other State for
a walver of its right in cases where that
other State considers such waiver to be of
particular importance.
4. The foregoing provisions of this Article
shall not imply any right for the military
authorities of the sending State to exercise
jurisdiction over persons who are nationals
of or ordinarily resident in the receiving
State, unless they are members of the force
of the sending State.
5. (a) The authorities of the receiving and
sending States shall assist each other in the

of the receiving State and in handing them
over to the authority which is to exercise

provisions.

shall notify promptly the military authorities
of the sending State of the arrest of any
member of a force or civilian component or
a dependent.

shall, if he is in the hands of the sending
State, remain with that State until he is
charged by the receiving State.
6. (a) The authorities of the receiving and
sending State shall assist each other in the
carrying out of all necessary investigations

into offences, and in the collection and production of evidence, including the seizure and,
in proper cases, the handing over of
objects connected with an offence. The handing over of such objects may, however, be
made subject to their return within the time
specified by the authority delivering them.
(b) The authorities of the Contracting
Parties shall notify one another of the disposition of all cases in which there are concurrent rights to exercise jurisdiction.

shall give sympathetic consideration to a
request from the authorities of the sending
State for assistance in carrying out a sentence of imprisonment pronounced by the
authorities of the sending State under the
provision of this Article within the territory
of the receiving State.
8. Where an accused has been tried in
accordance with the provisions of this Article by the authorities of one Contracting
Party and has been acquitted, or has been
convicted and is serving, or has served, his
sentence or has been pardoned, he may not
be tried again for the same offence within
the same territory by the authorities of
another Contracting Party. However, nothing
in this paragraph shall prevent the military
authorities of the sending State from trying
a member of its force for any violation of
rules of discipline arising from an act or
omission which constituted -an offence for
which he was tried by the authorities of
another Contracting Party.

Prayers and routine proceedings.
STAFF 0F THE SENATE
REPORT 0F CIVIL SERVICE COMIMISSIONREFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The. Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I have the honour ta present a report
of the Civil Service Commission with respect
ta changes of the rates of compensation of
permanent employees of the Senate.
Han.. Mr. Lambert: I move that this report
be referred to the Standing Committee an
Internal Economy and Contingent Accounts.
The motion was agreed ta.
EXCISE TAX BILL
THIRD READlING

Hon. Mr. Hugessen moved the third reading of Bull 294, an Act to amend The Excise
Tax Act.
Hon. R. B. Harner: Honourable senators,
there are a f ew remarks that I wish ta make
before this bll is read the third tume. There
were some very fine speeches made on the
second reading of the bill, and it was partly
because of the excellent explanation of it
by the honourable senator from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden) that I did not; rise ta
speak at that time. Whiile I agree with same
of his remarks, there was a certain angle
of the question which he entirely failed ta
tauch upan. It is true that, while no one
likes paymng taxes, the governnient must
have money ta carry on its business. But
we must be very careful ta see that the taxpayers are entirely satisfied with what they
are getting for their money. They must be
assured that the methods by which they are
being taxed are not; having the very opposite
effect ta that which is intended.
As ta ail this business of planning, I think
we will soan be as bad -as Russia, with her
five-year plan. We have a three-year planand it may be extended ta fIve years. 1
do not; want a dictator whether bis name is
Stalin or Howe. This systemn Is objectionable ta me. Let me refer back a few yeais
ta a time when we attempted a certain plan
with the object of cuttlng down the cost of
living. At that time No. 1 dairy butter was
selng at 32 cents a paund, and a smnaf
subsidy was being paid ta the dalry producers. Hanourable senators who were here
then will recail that I sald thus was faolish,

and that the plan should not have been
attempted at anything less than 60 cents a
pound.
Instead of reducing the cost of
living, it resulted in a shortage of beef
cattie and butter production, a situation that
in a country lîke this is simply ridiculous.
This was a direct resuit of the government's
interference in setting a price so low that
people were forced out of dairy production
and the cattie industry in many parts of the
country.
Honourable senators will remember that
when the question of margarine came up we
were tald in this chamber that the world was
so desperately short of oiîs that the lifting
of the ban on the manufacture and sale of
margarine would flot make any difference.
It was said that our quota of the world's
oils would be insuflicient to enable our
margarine production to amount to anything.
But what happened? Fifty million pounds
of margarine came on the market, and
although parts of the world are starving
today there is no sign yet of any oul shortage, and our butter production has been
lowered tremendously. Yet we hear a great
deal about the protection of oui native
industries.
Surely anyone who is at ail acquainted
with Canada and our dairy industry must
realize that a country like this is in a sad
position when it imports vegetable oils. The
situation is most ridiculous and uneconomic.
Instead of depriving other parts of the world
of vegetable oils, we should be producing
a sufficient quantity of butter for our own
needs and a surplus for export. Some of the
ails that enter into the manufacture of margarine are imported duty free. Qthers-inedible oils that have to be processed hereare subject to a duty of 10 per cent.
This whole question reminds me of what
happened a few years ago when there was
an outcry against the high cost of binder
twine. We had a factory at Portage la
Prairie-honourable senators from Manitoba
wiil recaîl this-but the duty was taken off,
and imported twine flooded the market; s0
our local product could not be sold profitably
and the factory had to, shut down. Now the
price is three times as high as it ever was
before in this country. I just mentioned this
ta illustrate what happens sometimes.
A lot of people wonder where oui tax
money goes. I have complained before, and I
stiil complain, that in my opinion an awful. lot
of the rnoney spent on our so-cailed defence
preparation Is largély wasted. I was not one
0f the members of parliament ta inake the
trip ta Churchill In Northern Manitoba, but
some who did have told me of the enormous
sunis of money that are being spent up there.
I may be wrong, but I amn not satlsfled that

SENATE

there is any necessity for all that expenditure.
I understand that instead of training men to
withstand the climate, the government has
built underground tunnels from building to
building and installed every kind of modern
convenience that one could think of. I
noticed the same kind of thing on my trip to
Petawawa. Sods were being trucked fifty
miles or so to beautify the homes, and running water systems were being installed and
so on. Well, that is not my idea of what
should be done to aid in the defence of this
country.
Really necessary conveniences in farm
homes today are taxed, and as I said before,
one of the regrettable trends in this country is the movement of people from the
farms to the cities. That movement will
become more serious than it is if something
is not done to retard it. Part of the reason
for it is that farms lack modern conveniences, and young people refuse to stay. Some
families who procured refrigerators and so
on before the heavy tax was imposed were
fortunate, but anyone who wishes to buy
necessities of that kind now has to pay the
higher tax.
I am very much concerned about these
questions of taxation and defence. And what
I think is a more important matter is the
moral and spiritual condition, if you like,
of the people, and their ideals. We must
be careful about this, above all, if we are
to win the so-called cold war. In other
words, we should be most careful to first
cast out the beam out of our own eye before
we try to pull the mote out of our brother's
eye. I believe that we have in this country
much evidence of, shall I say, unfair business ethics. We must live with one another
and set an example of what a freedomloving country can accomplish. If this end is
attained it will obviate the necessity of a
shooting war. Our actions of fair policy and
good government should spread throughout
the world.
We hear the question raised, even in this
chamber, what policies would be most advantageous in the winning of an election, I
am alarmed that in these serious times the
government should consider such a question.
The subject of maintaining a certain party
in power forever sometimes crops up even
in this chamber. Surely this is a situation
against which we should protect ourselves.
I re-emphasize my earlier remarks, that
we should see that the levy of taxation falls
fairly on all the people of this country. Many
of the recent moves by the government have
served to increase rather than to decrease
the cost of living in Canada. For instance,
I think that some method other than the

raising of money by an increase of 25 per
cent in sales tax should be considered. It
is all very well to say that the people do
not see that tax. That may be true, but
such a tax bears heaviest on the people who
are in the lower income brackets, and they
can least afford it.
I have made these observations because,
with all due respect for the excellent speech
made by the senator from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden), I was not at all satisfied that
he had covered this particular angle of the
question. For my part, I do not like to pay
taxes, but I do not mind paying them if I
am getting value for my money. That
theory is, I believe, shared by many other
Canadians.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, the question is on the motion of
Honourable Senator Hugessen for the third
reading of this bill, as amended. Is it your
pleasure to carry the motion?
The motion was agreed to, and the bill as
amended was read the third time, and passed.
PRIVATE BILL
COMMONS AMENDMENT

CONCURRED IN

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the amendment made by the House of Commons to Bill E, an Act respecting British
Columbia Telephone Company.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, on
behalf of the senator from Kootenay East
(Hon. Mr. King) I move concurrence in the
amendment.
The motion was agreed to, and the amendment was concurred in.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Norman P. Lambert moved

second

reading of Bill W-12, an Act resrecting the
Trust and Loan Company of Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
affects two of the oldest financial institutions
in Canada, the Trust and Loan Company of
Canada, and the Canada Permanent Mortgage Corporation. The bill, although it is
entitled "an Act respecting the Trust and
Loan Company of Canada", is presented on
behalf of the shareholders and boards of
directors of both parties to the agreement,
which is published as schedule II to the bill.
Parliament is asked to agree to the reorganization of the capital of The Trust and Loan
Company of Canada. It is asked to agree
also to the transfer of the company's head
office from London, England, to Canada; to
the alteration of its investment objects and
powers; and to the sale to Canada Permanent

JUNE 20, 1951
Mortgage Corporation of its assets in Canada,
which. are comprised in its present business
of a mortgage loan company.
It is interesting to, note that, by an Act of
the Province of Canada, the Trust and Loan
Company was incorporated in 1843 with the
objeet of lending British capital for the
development of Canadian farm. lands. The
legal office, in Kingston, of the first Prime
Minister of this country, John A. Macdonald,
was charged with the duty of drafting the
papers of incorporation of the Trust and
Loan Company, and for a time the head
office of the company was in Kingston. Its
business tended, however, to follow the
western trend of Canadian development, and
at the present time its assets are represented
largely by substantial holdings in mortgages,
agreements for sale and farmn properties in
the prairie provinces. Its offices in Winnipeg
and Regina have been establlshed for a considerable period.
The capital stock of the company has been
owned almost exclusively in the United
Kingdom. The old country shareholders are
now anxîous to enlarge the field of their
Canadian investments so that they can participate in the mining and industrial' expansion of this country. Into this field British
investors, because of present circumistances
and policies, including emergency control
regulations in Great Britain, find it difficuit
to enter, and the company has arranged to
seil its entire holdings of Canadian assets to
Canada Permanent Mortgage Corporation.
The ternis of the agreement of sale are
annexed as Schedule II of the bill. They
have been approved by the sharehoîders o!
the Trust and Loan Company in England as
weIl as by the shareholders of the Canada
Permanent
Mortgage
Corporation.
Also
bylaws have been passed in virtue of which,
subi ect to approval by parliament, the namne
of the company will be ýchanged to "Trust
and Loan Investment Company of Canada,
Ltd.," the head office may be transferred to,
Toronto, and the corporate objectives and
powers wiil be altered to bring the company
for ail practical purposes under the provisionls o! the Canadian Companies Act of 1934.
If this bill is enacted, the company will
receive in Canada a cash consideration o!
seven and a quarter million dollars, which
will be available to it for diversified investment in Canadian enterprises. The money
will be made available by Canada Permanent
Mortgage Corporation, which, as I have
stated, will take over the assets.
So far as the Canada Permanent Mortgage
Corporation is concerned, that company is
subject to the Loan Companies Act of this
country, and it has received fromn Treasury

Board the certificate of approval necessary
to the purchase of the Trust and Loan Comnpany's assets. Because it is not clear that the
Trust and 4oan Company has power under
its act of incorporation to seli its Canadian
assets, Canada Permanent Mortgage Corporation supports the bill. Without parliamentary approval, there would be some
doubt as to the validity of the corporation's
tiUle to the assets to be purchased. Ail parties
concerned have agreed to the transaction, and
in order to make the new status of both comnpanies clear and legally de! ensible it is
necessary that parliament shahl give consent.
Hon. Mr. Raebuck: I understand that the
shareholders of both companies have consented. Where is the doubt?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: That is correct. The
shareholders and boards of directors in both
the United Kingdom and Canada have
agreed; so have the Treasury Board and the
officials of the departments concerned.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Wherein lies the doubt?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The Trust and Loan
Company was incorporated in 1843 under the
old Province of Canada, and it 'has not been
subi ect to the Loan Companies Act, the
Companies Act, or any other legislation passed
since confederation.
For that reason the
officers of the Canada Permanent Mortgage
Corporation have some doubt as to the validity
of their titie to any assets which they may
take over from the Trust and Loan Company.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: As to the power of the
vendors to seil?
Mon. Mr. Lambert: That is correct.
I wii not take up the time of the bouse
with references to the individual clauses, of
which. there are eleven. The matters deait
with in the sections are of a technical nature,
and are framed for the purpose of enabling
the new company to adjust itself to the
requirements of the Companies Act. If there
are any questions regarding the legality or
validity of the bill, its relation to the agreements and the plan of recapitalization, or
other details, there will be am~ple opportunity
to, deal with them Up in committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITE

Hon. Mr. Lambert moved -that the bil be
referred to, the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
SUSPENSION 0F RULE
Hon. Mr. Lambert moved, with leave of the

Senate, that Rule 119 be suspended ini so far
as it relates to this bill.

SENATE

He said: The purpose of this motion is to
dispense with the one-week delay imposed
by the rule, and enable us to proceed with
the examination of the bill as soon as possible.
The motion was agreed to.
CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
(QUEBEC RAILWAY, LIGHT AND
POWER COMPANY) BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. G. Turgeon moved the second reading of Bill X-12, an Act respecting Canadian
National Railways and to authorize the
acquisition of the railway of the Quebec
Railway, Light and Power Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill has
been brought to parliament by the honourable the Minister of Transport. As honourable members know, some three or four years
ago the Minister of Transport appeared before
this chamber on two occasions to present
legislation. On this occasion, however, he
found it impossible to attend here, and the
honour of presenting this bill has fallen to me.
It is my intention, owing to the urgency of
the situation, to go a little deeper into the
explanatory notes than I would otherwise do.
This proposed legislation would authorize the
purchase by the Canadian National Railways
of the line of railway owned by the Quebec
Railway, Light and Power Company, which is
an electrically operated line running out of
Quebec and through Montmorency, Ste. Anne
de Beaupré and other points to St. Joachim,
along the northern coast of the St. Lawrence
river. Honourable senators will remember
that in 1947 the government was authorized
to purchase slightly over five miles of railway line running from St. Joachim to Cap
Tourmente. That has been purchased, and
the Canadian National Railways now operate
the line from Cap Tourmente on to Nairn's
Falls on Murray Bay.
I would point out here that the purchase
price named in the bill-$750,000 for 25-75
miles of railway-will include all the operating facilities, electrical equipment and stores,
which will enable the Canadian National
Railways to administer and operate this tobe-acquired portion of the railways throughout
the life of the present electrical equipment.
I would point out also that while $750,000 is
now being paid for this 25 miles of railway,
the government in 1919 had to pay $3,400,000
for the 53 miles of railway running from Cap
Tourmente to Nairn's Falls on Murray Bay.
I am mentioning this fact just to make it
plain that the Quebec Railway, Light and
Power Company is not asking any exorbitant
price for the railway and the facilities that
are being sold.

I have here a statement of the net operating
revenues of this Quebec Railway, Light and
Power Company over a short period of years.
From 1939 to 1948, both inclusive, the net
operating revenue showed a loss in only one
year, namely, 1939, when the loss was $50,355.
Every year since then the net operating
revenue has showed a profit.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Would the honourable
senator be good enough to tell us what revenue is derived from the railway itself? What
he is giving us is the revenue of the whole
company.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: What I am giving is the
revenue of the Montmorency division of the
Quebec Railway, Light and Power Company.
That is what is being purchased. This company will continue to operate its buses. It
is selling to the Canadian National Railways
that line, of roughly 25 miles in length, which
runs from Quebec City through Montmorency
to Cap Tourmente. That sale, as I have
already pointed out, will cover the equipment and the various other assets, and will
include a portion of the railway station at
the City of Quebec. Therefore the revenues,
whether they show a profit or a loss, are
the revenues derived from the operation of
that particular piece of railroad. That is what
I am giving.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Would the honourable
member cite from the report of the Quebec
Railway, Light and Power Company?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: I do not happen to have
that report, because what we are interested
in here is the success or lack of success in
the operation of the particular piece of railroad which is under consideration. We are
not concerned, for instance, with what the
Quebec Railway, Light and Power Company
has been making in the last few years out
of the operation of its bus service in the
City of Quebec, because parliament has not
been asked to authorize the purchase of that
bus service. Parliament is only being asked
to authorize the purchase of this particular
piece of railroad which is approximately 25
miles in length.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Where does this 25 mile
stretch of railway begin and end, and why
is the Canadian National Railways buying it?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: I am glad the leader of
the opposition has asked that question. I
would have come to it later, but possibly
this is the proper time for it. The railway
starts at Quebec City and runs in a northeasterly direction to Cap Tourmente. Between
these points are such places as Montmorency
and Ste. Anne de Beaupré. Some years ago,
as I said before, the five mile stretch from
St. Joachim to Cap Tourmente was acquired

JUNE 20, 1951
by the C.N.R., and in 1919 the C.N.R. purchased the 63 miles of railway from Cap
Tourmente to Nairn's Falls on the Murray
river in the vicinity of Murray Bay. Under
this proposed legislation the C.N.R. will be
authorized to purchase the railway in question, and the headquarters of the C.N.R. at
Quebec City will have complete control of
this line. The Canadian National Railways
now have absolute control over sixty-eight
miles of the road, and it is important that the
company be authorized to purchase the
remaining twenty-five miles, so as to give
it absolute control over the whole line running out of Quebec City into Murray Bay,
on the north coast of the St. Lawrence river.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the honourable
member a question? Do bus lines operate in
the district traversed by the railway which
it is proposed to purchase?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: I imagine that bus lines
are operating there. That is one reason why
I mentioned the net operating revenue of
the railway itsielf. As I say, in one year, 1939,
the line operated at a loss, but in every other
year, up to and including 1948, there was a
net profit. In 1946 the net profit was $236,000;
in 1947 it was $301,000; and in 1948, $230,996.
The bill does not propose anything novel,
for in 1916 parliament ýpassed a statute
authorizing the government to purchase this
piece of railway. However, the government
did not act on that authority. After being
incorporated, the Canadian National Railways entered into an arrangement for operating over this line. Though I have visited
Quebec City, as I suppose most senators have,
I am not familiar with the country through
which the line runs, but I am informed that
one of the reasons why the Canadian
National finds it elifficult to operate there to
the best advantage is that the twenty-five
miles section is electrically controlled and
when passing out of this section it is necessary to change over to steam locomotives.
I am sure that all senators would be glad
to see any proper steps taken to assist the
Canadian National to acquire complete control over this line, so that thereby better
passenger freight and passenger service may
be given and the Canadian National be able
to benefit from the operation.
On September 5, 1947, the Canadian
National agreed to purchase the five miles
of railway from St. Joachim to Cap Tourmente. The purchase was never properly
concluded because the Quebec Railway Light
and Power Company is not authorized by
its charter to sell to the Canadian National
Railways. That is why the present measure
80713-39

is necessary. One of the clauses in the
company's charter says:
The company may enter into an agreement with
the Canadian Pacifie Railway Company, the Lake
St. John Railway Company, the North Shore Railway Company, the Quebec Street Railway Company or the St. John Street Railway Company or
with any other electrie railway company in the
district of Quebec, for conveying or leasing to
such company the railway of the company in whole
or in part ...

As the charter does not authorize any sale
or lease to the Canadian National Railways,
the purchase was never concluded. Section
4 of the bill ratifies and confirms this transfer, at $75,000. This amount, added to the
$750,000 for the line of 25-75 miles from St.
Joachim to Cap Tourmente, is the total
expenditure authorized by this bill.
I am grateful to honourable senators for
questions of the kind that have been asked,
and if there are any more I shall do my best
to answer them. I would urge the bouse to
pass the measure as soon as possible, for I
understand from the department that the
minister regards it as a matter of urgency
just now, I suppose largely because we
appear to be coming to the end of the session.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I should like to ask the
honourable gentleman a question. According
to his statement thec piece of railway which
the Quebec Railway, Light and Power
Company is proposing to sell has been operating at a profit of approximately $200,000 to
$300,000 a year. If that is so, why is the
company eager to sell, and at such a small
price?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: As my honourable friend
knows, I could hardly answer that. On the
other hand, I think the purchasing company
realizes that this is an opportune time to take
over the line. The vending company was
willing to sell in 1947, which was one of its
most profitable years. And, as I have already
pointed out, away back in 1916 parliament
authorized purchase of the line by the government. The operation of the line has been a
conglomerate one. I am assuming, without
any knowledge whatever of the facts, that
the administrators of the line probably felt
it would be wise to get out of the railway
business altogether and devote their entire
time and attention to other phases of their
activities.
Hon. Mr. Aseline: I think the company
wants to get rid of the line.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask if it is intended
to refer this bill to a standing committee?
If not, I think it should go at least to Committee of the Whole. In my opinion we should
not pass this bill in a hurry simply because
the minister wants to have that done. It is

time that the parliament of this country
viewed with some alarm the acquiring of
additional railway mileage, especially by the
Canadian National Railways. I for one am
not satisfied with the answers and explanation given this afternoon, and I think the
bill should be dealt with in committee.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: I have no objection
whatever to having the bill sent to Committee
of the Whole or to a standing committee, as
honourable members desire. That is a matter
purely for the house. I am calling the attention of the Senate to the urgency of the
matter.
The senator from New Westminster (Hon.
Mr. Reid) raised a question about the
constantly

Canadian
acquiring new lines.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: I would point out that
the acquisition of this line was commenced
many years ago, and that this bill would bring
about the purchase of the remaining twentyfive miles of railway. I imagine that this
portion of the line, by reason of its proximity
to the City of Quebec, would be most profitable, especially as it runs through the district
I have mentioned, to Montmorency, St.
Joachim and Ste. Anne de Beaupre. As this
twenty-five-mile section passes through the
most heavily populated area on the sixty-eight
miles of line, it would seem to be to the
advantage of the Canadian National Railways
to acquire it.
Hon. Mr. Horner: The senator from Cariboo
(Hon. Mr. Turgeon) mentioned the purchase
of part of the buildings and lands which are
to be acquired. I should just like to mention that my experience in shipping over this
particular line would ýprompt me to believe
that its ownership by the Canadian National
Railways would be advantageous to shippers.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Honourable senators, I
may say that I am not quite sure what part of
the railway depots and lands are to be
acquired. My information is that there are
two stations, one of which is owned and
operated by the Canadian National Railways
and one that can be abandoned. The money
spent in this will result in an absolute saving
in the railway operation.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Honourable senators,
would it not be wise to refer this bill to the
Standing Committee on Transport and Communications where all interested bodies could
appear and ask questions?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: I have no objection to
that suggestion, but I should like to hear
what the honourable acting leader has in
mind.

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Certainly there is no
objection to this bill being referred to a
committee. The only question is one of the
time involved. Except for a measure which
will be dealt with in a few minutes, this is the
last bill to originate in this house this session;
therefore it is desirable that it be given consideration in the other place as soon as
possible.
Normally, a bill of this character would be
referred to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications; but as the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce
has already agreed to meet tomorrow morning at 10.30, I would suggest in the interests
of expediency, and to allow full representation by all interested parties, that this measure
be considered by the Banking and Commerce
Committee when it meets tomorrow morning.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Honourable senators, I have
two questions I should like to ask the senator
from Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon). First,
was this bill introduced at the request of the
Canadian National Railways?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: The bill was definitely
introduced at the request of the Canadian
National Railways, following a discussion of
the whole problem at a meeting of the directors of the company.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Second, is the honourable
senator in a position to make a comparison
between the price paid under the 1947 agreement in the acquisition of approximately five
miles of railway and the cost of this twentyfive mile stretch of line?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: The 1947 agreement,
as I understand it, called for the purchase
of 5-8 miles at a price of $75,000; by the
present legislation 25-75 miles would be
acquired for $750,000. Therefore, the amount
per mile to be paid under this bill is slightly
higher than the amount paid in 1947, but it
is less than the cost per mile in the purchase
of sixty-three miles of line in 1919. I would
point out that the acquisition of the remaining twenty-five miles of railway track
includes all the electrical equipment and
devices which are on hand. I assume that
at the time of the sale of five miles odd, the
company kept a good deal of its equipment;
but with the disposal of the last twenty-five
miles of line the company will have no further need for this equipment.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I ask my honourable
friend whether the railway being purchased
is standard gauge or not?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Exactly.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: I understand it is
as that purchased
the same
exactly
previously.

JUNE 20, 1951
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I presume it is the intention of the Canadian National Railways to
operate this section of the line as a steam
railway?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: I am glad my friend
asked that question. The intention, as I
understand it, is to operate the line electrically during the lifetime of the equipment
which is now being purchased; but when that
is no longer useful the line will be operated
as a steam railway. Therefore, within a short
time the newly acquired line will be operated
by steam, either diesel or coal engines.
Hon. Vincent Dupuis: Honourable senators,
before the bill dealing with the Quebec Railway Light and Power Company is referred
to a -committee, I should like to make a few
observations. As I am not a member of the
committee to which it is proposed to refer
the bill, I fear that I will not be able to put
the questions I have in mind.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Why not?
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: I know from experience
that senators who are not members of a committee are allowed to ask questions only as
a matter of charity.
Some Hon. Senators: No, no.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: May I be allowed to
interject the comment that I too am not a
member of the committee to which this bill
will likely be referred.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: The bill will be referred
to the Banking and Commerce Committee, of
which I am not a member. I do not say
that the members of the committees to which
I belong are not courteous, but the fact is
that those who are not members of a committee find it difficult to enter into any
debate in that committee. I am a little shy
by reason of the fact that I was once told
that because I was not a member of a certain committee I had no right to suggest
anything there; that I could merely state my
views. I think that is the correct attitude
to take according to the rules of parliament.
In any event, I must give my reasons for
saying that this important bill should be
discussed in a little more detail before it
goes to committee. For instance, we should
know the state of repair of the track. Is it
in as good order as any other railway? Is
the line to be operated by steam? There are
many important and interesting details of
which we know nothing.
The bill is desired by the authorities of
the Canadian National Railway, and it is
important that the representatives of the
Canadian people shall discover whether the
railway is justified in attempting to acquire
80713-391

another piece of railroad, particularly in the
light of the fact that the general operations
of the Canadian National Railways for the
last fiscal year resulted in a heavy deficit,
which must be met by the taxpayers.
Although the road, compared with the whole
Canadian National Railway System, is very
small, we are entitled, I think, to know
more about the purpose of the bill. May
I suggest that it would be very enlightening
and very interesting to have the views of
the honourable member from Grandville
(Hon. Mr. Bouffard) on this matter. I do not,
suggest that he is bound to speak, but I
should be very glad to hear from him or any
other honourable senator from Quebec. I
do not think the bill should be allowed to
pass until we know more about the details.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, is it your pleasureHon. Mr. Dupuis: Before the motion is
put, I would like to know whether the
honourable senator from Grandville (Hon.
Mr. Bouffard) will be good enough to let us
have his views.
The Hon. the Speaker: I believe the honourable member from Grandville has already
understood what has been asked of him,
and I am not going to urge him to speak.
The request has already been made.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: I thought he had not
had time to respond to it.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: I think the honourable
member from Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Dupuis) is
within his rights in asking for more information, and he should be assured of the
privilege and the honour of appearing before
whatever committee this bill is referred to.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: I know that I can do so.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: I feel certain that if the
honourable senator attends before the committee he will receive every consideration,
and I think he should be told by the acting
leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) that this opportunity will be
afforded him.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Well, he ought to know
it by now.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Well, let him be assured
of it.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: I protest against these
remarks. I made the statement as clearly
as I could that a senator who attends a committee of which he is not a member is assured
of a courteous reception. But he cannot make
suggestions nor impose his views in committees to which he does not belong.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Oh, yes, you can. You
can do everything but vote.

faced a major reconstruction job, including
the recruitment of working forces, the
rehabilitation of mining and milling plants,
the development of new ore reserves and the
restoration of efficient capacity operation.
Wages and other costs of production had
risen very substantially. It was hoped that
at the end of the three-year assistance period
-that is, at the end of 1950-more normal
operating conditions and costs would be
experienced by the gold operators.
The payment of cost-aid has been of great
assistance to the operators and has most
satisfactorily served the purpose for which
it was chiefly designed. As evidence of this
I shall give you briefiy the figures of production for the past three years. In 1947
the gold production was 2,773,104 ounces; in
1948 it was 3,159,934 ounces; in 1949 it was
3,662,766 ounces, and in 1950 it was 3,874,523
ounces. The total assistance given during
the period 1948-1950 was as follows. In
1948 it was $10,520,322; in 1949 it was
$12,557,322, and in 1950 it dropped to
$7,176,140,
a total of $30,253,785. The
estimate of assistance to be given during the
current year is $10,500,000.
All the major gold mines got a new lease
on life and were able to increase their tonnage and to process less valuable ore. Prospects which were not operating at the price
of $20.67 came into commercial production
and became the employers of people who at
that period could not find other employment
owing to world economic conditions. The
mines were rehabilitated and restored to
efficient operation, and many of the highcost mines, which would have been compelled
to close but for the assistance rendered by
the government to the gold mining industry,
were put into production. However, because
of a certain amount of inflation, the gold
mining industry is again experiencing difficulty because of higher costs of supplies,
labour and other services required for the
production of gold, while the price of the
product remains the same as it was in 1947.
I should like to make a personal observation here. I know there are those who claim
that the production of gold is not as valuable
as it was many years ago when gold was
used as the basis for our currency. I know
too that certain statements have been made
about expending large sums of money to dig
gold from the bowels of the earth only to
transport it and bury it in the earth somewhere else. As is well known, the United
States today controls and has in its vaults
over 80 per cent of the world production of
gold, apart from that held by Soviet Russia.
No one can give the proper answer to why
the United States is holding $22 billion worth
of gold on the basis of $35 an ounce. She holds

the amazing quantity of 600,000,000 ounces
or, in broader terms, 20,000 tons of gold. In
my opinion she would have done a greater
service to the other nations of the world
had she taken some of that gold and distributed it at the time when countries like
Great Britain could not purchase United
States or Canadian dollars and had to deal
principally with sterling countries. In other
words, the United States holds nearly all the
chips, and I am one of those who believes
that a redistributionHon. Mr. Lambert: Is the honourable senator aware of the fact that just after the war
the gold supply was much higher than $22
billion? It has been reduced to the extent of
$6 or $7 billion during the last three or four
years.
Hon. Mr. Reid: My figures may not be
exact.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: They are accurate
enough, but the amount has now been
reduced.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It is quite possible that the
United States has reduced its gold reserves
by exportation to other countries.
I should like to indicate to the Senate the
importance of the gold mining industry in
the Canadian economy. This industry has
been a pioneer in the development of Northern Canada. Owing to the fact that gold can
be readily transported without the building
of expensive railroads, gold mines have been
established in the north country where few
transportation facilities are available. In
many cases the mining of gold has drawn
attention to the areas in which the mines
are situated, with the resultant discovery of
commercial base metal and strategic mineral
deposits which are essential for maintaining
a high industrial economy as well as for
defence production. This is particularly true
in northwestern Quebec, British Columbia,
Manitoba, Ontario and the Northwest Territories. Base metal mines, however, cannot
operate without adequate transportation
facilities. Consequently, further development
has led to the settlement of communities
around the mines in the north country, and
the building of railroads in order to supply
products, particularly those of the forest and
agriculture, to these mining communities.
Thus the growth of Canada's northern development has been dependent on the search for
gold.
The gold mines now in operation give
employment to about 23,000 people. In addition to employees and dependent communities
directly supported by the gold mines, employment is sustained in cities and towns across
Canada where machinery and supplies are

SENATE
manufactured, and in areas where agricultural and forest products are grown. Many
isolated centres are directly dependent upon
one or two mines for existence.
Honourable senators will recall that in
September 1949 steps were taken by the government to alter the value of the Canadian
dollar in relation to the United States dollar.
This action resulted in a change in the Royal
Canadian Mint gold price from $35 to $38.50
a fine ounce, an increase of 10 per cent. As
a result of this increase in price the government introduced legislation amending the
Emergency Gold Mining Assistance Act, to
provide that during the designated or
calendar year 1950 the total amount of assistance payments paid to the operator of any
mine would be reduced by an amount equal
to the product of the number of ounces of
gold to which the rate of assistance is applied
and $3.50. This Act was approved by parliament and given Royal Assent on December
10, 1949.
On September 30, 1950, the Honourable
the Minister of Finance announced that the
official fixed rates of exchange were abolished,
and that the rates would be determined by
conditions of supply of and demand for
foreign currencies in Canada. A direct result
of this policy bas been a reduction in the
price paid by the Mint to the gold producers
from the price of $38.50 established in September 1949. The minister also 'announced
that the reduction in the assistance payment
in respect of the designated year 1950 would
not be applied in respect of gold produced
and sold during the last quarter of 1950.
Prior to September 30, when the official
fixed rates of exchange were abolished, the
discount on the Canadian dollar was 10 per
cent, but after that date the discount fell to
5 or 6 per cent.
A gold mine is defined as one whose value
of gold output during any designated year is
70 per cent or more of the total value of
the mine's production. A mine that does not
come within that definition is not eligible
for assistance under the Act.
The necessary amendment to the Act to
implement this announcement is contained
in section 1 of the bill now before the Senate.
Section 2 of the bill ad-ds a new section to
the Act and provides for assistance payments
in respect of gold produced from the mines
and sold in the year 1951. This section also
implements the announcement made by the
Minister of Finance in the House of Commons on March 9. The International Monetary Fund has been consulted about this and
has raised no objection.
It is proposed that the rate of assistance
in 1951 shall be one-half of the amount by

which the average cost of production per
ounce of gold produced from a mine and
sold exceeds $22, provided that the maximum
rate of assistance be $11.50. This maximum
rate is applied when -the cost of production
of gold is $45 or more per ounce. The rate
of assistance in 1951 will be applied in the
case of an old mine to the number of ounces
of gold by which the number of ounces
produced from the mine and sold in the
year 1951 exceeds one-half of the number of
ounces produced in the new base year, which
is the calendar year 1949.
Where a mine has been unable to increase
its production in relation to its 1949 production, the rate of assistance will be applied
to one-half the number of ounces produced
and sold during the calendar or designated
year 1951. I might say here that the Act as
it now reads provides for assistance payments in respect of gold produced and sold
up to the designated year 1950, and the new
section 3A continues these assistance payments to the designated year 1951.
In the case of new mines coming into production on or after January 1, 1949, the base
year means the first year of production as
determined by the Department of National
Revenue. The rate of assistance in 1951 will
be applied to all the gold produced and sold
from a new mine during that part of the
designated year 1951 that is also part of its
first year of production.
It is estimated that under section 1 of the
bill the assistance payments to gold mines in
respect of the designated year 1950 will
increase from approximately $7,200,000, as
now provided, to approximately $9,200,000,
and that section 2 of the bill will mean an
expenditure of approximately $10,500,000 in
respect of the gold produced in the designated
year 1951.
In conclusion, I wish to state that the
effects of this bill, in brief, will be encouragement and assistance to the industry in meeting the rising costs of gold production and
maintaining the dependent communities.
There are a number of points which could
be better discussed and answered in committee, and if the motion for second reading is carried I shall move that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

CANADA-SWEDEN INCOME TAX
AGREEMENT BILL
SECOND READING

On the Order:
Second reading of Bill 372, an Act respecting an
income tax agreement between Canada and Sweden,
signed at Ottawa on the sixth day of April, 1951.

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
this bill and the next two following it on
the order paper deal with tax agreements
between Canada and other countries, and all
the measures are of a similar nature. With
the rush of work that usually comes towards
the end of the session the Printing Bureau
is getting a little behind in its work, and so
far we have received the first two bills in
the form only in which they were introduced
and given first reading in the other house.
I am informed, however, that no change was
made in them.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I was in the gallery when the
bills were dealt with, and I know there was
no change.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: We have the last of
these three bills, in the form in which it
passed the House of Commons, so that in
effect there are before us current copies of
all three bills as passed there.
Hon. Mr. Haig: There were four of these
bills passed in the other house, were there
not?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: We have received only
three.
Hon. Calvert C. Pratt moved the second
reading of Bill 372, an Act respecting an
income tax agreement between Canada and
Sweden, signed at Ottawa on the sixth day
of April, 1951.
He said: Honourable senators, the general
purpose of this bill is to give effect to an
agreement entered into between the Government of Canada and the Government of
Sweden, and signed at Ottawa on April 6 this
year. The purpose of the agreement is to
avoid double taxation. This affects the field
of dividends, royalty payments, trading profits
and interest. It also establishes rules for
reciprocal fiscal assistance in the matter of
income tax collections. Similar reciprocal
agreements have been in force between
Canada and the United Kingdom, Canada
and the United States, and Canada and New
Zealand.
These agreements are not identical in their
terminology, because existing laws in the
field of taxation differ with each country;
and while the purposes and results obtained
run very much to a pattern-in fact, the
objectives are the same-the rule of application necessarily varies considerably.

It may be useful if I make a brief comment on the various Articles:
Article I makes specific reference to
respective taxes and provides for the inclusion of taxes which may be imposed at a
future date.
Article II gives a general definition which
I need not enlarge upon.
Article III covers taxing of commercial
and industrial profits when they are owned
by a permanent establishment in either
country.
Article IV is for the purpose of preventing
the shifting of profits as between assessable
companies or persons in the two countries
for the purpose of avoiding taxation.
Article V stipulates that profits on the
operations of ships and aircraft shall be taxed
only in the country of residence.
Article VI is a particularly important one.
It confirms Canada's right, as at present
existing, to withhold taxes, and Sweden
agrees to similar procedure. A ceiling of 15
per cent is placed on the withholding tax on
income flowing from Canada to Sweden. This
ceiling is similarly placed by Sweden on incomes from Sweden to Canada. It also confirms our present law that dividends from a
subsidiary company to a non-resident parent
company are subject to a Canadian tax of
5 per cent.
Articles VII and VIII take care of certain
exemptions.
Article IX has standard provisions in respect to government officials in either country.
Article X places the term of temporary
residence which taxation does not apply at
183 days. Public entertainers are not included
in this arrangement.
Article XI exempts for taxes at its source
a pension or annuity paid under the terms of
a contract.
Articles XII and XIII have special reciprocal provisions for those in educational
work. This is for the purpose of fostering
cultural interest between the two countries.
Article XIV provides that residents of both
countries shall be exempt for taxes on capital
gains.
Article XV is intended to provide similarity in procedure as between both countries
in regard to the granting of tax credits.
Article XVI provides that each state will
extend the same treatment to persons of the
other state as it does to its own resident
taxpayers.
Article XVII is intended to prevent double
taxation on an estate, the beneficiaries of
which are resident in Canada.

THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. Pratt moved the third reading of
the bill.
He said: It is not my intention, unless it
is the desire of honourable senators, to move
the reference of this bill to committee. The
agreement took quite a long time to negotiate. If honourable senators feel that there
are matters in the bill which should be more
clearly defined, by ail means refer it to committee. But if any contemplated changes
are merely of a minor character, I suggest
consideration of the fact that this agreement has been negotiated and is the subject
of a bill which was passed by the Parliament
of Sweden. Any further change would
involve the re-negotiation of the agreement.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
CANADA-FRANCE SUCCESSION DUTY
CONVENTION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Calvert C. Pratt moved the second
reading of Bill 373, an Act respecting a Sucand Protocol
cession Duty Convention
between Canada and France, signed at Paris
on the sixteenth day of March, 1951.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
covers the Succession Duty agreement
entered into with the Government of the
Republic of France. It is a result of negotiations which commenced in 1947, and it has
particular regard to the avoidanc.e of double
taxation and the exchange of information
and facts which may be useful in the prevention of evasion of taxation obligations.
The agreement now before you is very
similar to conventions now in effect with the
United States and the United Kingdom. With
your permission I will make a brief reference to the various articles.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Is this bill exactly the
same as the other one?
Hon. Mr. Pratt: No. This relates to succession duties. The other one deals withHon. Mr. Aseltine: -income tax.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: It is similar in principle.
Hon. Mr. Pratt: There is a great deal of
similarity, but it occupies a different field,
namely succession duty collections.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I ask my friend if
this bill embodies an arrangement similar to
that which we have with Britain and the
United States covering the matter of succession duties?
Hon. Mr. Pratt: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Consequently, it is one
that the house can accept, I would think,

it.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: We would like to hear
from the honourable senator.
Hon. Mr. Pratt: While I have not personally studied the other bills which the honourable senator has in mind, I am informed
that they are substantially the same, though
with certain variations to adapt them to
the legislation existent in each country. I
understand that these tax agreements are to
synchronize to some extent with existing
legislation in other countries; but if honourable members wish to have this bill stand to
permit of further explanationsHon. Mr. Roebuck: No. Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Go ahead and explain
the bill.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes. We want to
hear from you.
Hon. Mr. Pratt: I was about to give an
explanatory note on each article.
Article I defines the duties and taxes to
which the convention relates.
Article II, in the first paragraph, defines
the geographical areas which the convention covers. The second paragraph determines the definitions of terms for purposes
of interpretation.
Article III provides, in the first paragraph,
for the establishment of the domicile of a

deceased person.
deals with the possibility of both countries
claiming domicile, in which event the fiscal
authorities will decide the issue by a special
agreement.
Article IV provides that either country, in
taxing the estate of a person domiciled in
the other, will at least allow exemptions,
debts and deductions, based on a ratio of
the assets in the country in question to the
assets wherever situated. Such proportionate allowances are now and always have
been made by Canada under the terms of
the Act, so that as far as Canada is concerned this article makes no change.
The essence of Article V is that on
property taxed by both countries the country
of domicile will allow a credit against its
duty amounting to the lesser of its tax on
such property and the tax of the other
country on the same property. The second
paragraph establishes that such credits will
be allowed after all other credits to which
the estate is entitled. This is all similar to
the provisions in the United Kingdom and
the United States treaties.

SENATE

Article VI provides for a refund period of
five years from the date of death, and for
refunds without interest.
Article VII provides that the two countries
undertake to exchange information so that
each will be advised of the death of its
domiciled decedents and of the composition
of their estates. Furthermore, each country
will be advised of the composition of estates
of persons domiciled in the other country
who have property situated in the first
country. This is similar to the arrangements
existing with the United States.
Article VIII provides for the extension of
the agreement to overseas territories and
defines the conditions upon which this may
be done. A similar provision exists in the
British agreement.
Article IX provides for the authenticity of
the two texts, the effective date of the agreement, and its length of existence.
As to the protocol, the first three sections
are self-explanatory and the fourth section
outlines what assets each country respectively
will expect to be informed of by the other.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Was there any previous
agreement Ibetween Canada and Sweden
respecting succession duties?
Hon. Mr. Prati: No, not to my knowledge.
I cannot answer the question definitely, but
my impression is that this is the initial
agreement.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: At all events, there is
not now one in force.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: No.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Tomorrow.
CANADA-FRANCE INCOME TAX
CONVENTION
SECOND READING

Hon. Calvert C. Pratt moved the second

reading of Bill 374, an Act respecting an
Income Tax Convention between Canada and
France, signed at Paris on the sixteenth day
of March, 1951.
He said: Honourable senators, the principle of this bill bas the same practical effect
as the tax agreement bill to which we gave
second reading.
In effect this bill is designed to approve an
agreement entered into by the Government
of Canada and the Government of the
Republic of France for the avoidance of

double taxation. It provides means for the
two governments to co-operate in preventing
the evasion of taxation on income. As I have
pointed out, the principle of this bill, and
the effect of the various articles, are very
similar to those of Bill 372. Nevertheless I
feel it might be useful to draw attention to
Article VII, particularly paragraph 2 thereof,
which has important implications that were
not necessary in the other bill to which I have
referred.
Under the French taxation system a threefold tax is imposed upon a French subsidiary
company of a Canadian parent company. The
subsidiary is first taxed on its industrial and
commercial ýprofits earned in France. The
dividends paid by the subsidiary to the
Canadian parent company are also subject
to tax. In addition, France imposes a tax
on a portion of the profits earned by the
parent company through the medium of its
sulbsidiary. The effect of Article VII of the
proposed agreement is that a Canadian parent
company will not be subject to tax on
dividends which arise by reason of that company's participation in the profits of its
French subsidiary.
There are a couple of minor factual differences between this bill and Bill 372, an Act
respecting an Income
Tax Agreement
between Canada and Sweden. For instance,
France has not agreed to exemption from
taxation of teachers who are temporarily
residing in that country. In the matter of
the temporary period of residence the Swedish
agreement provides for an exemption of a
fixed period of 183 days, but France makes
exemption only for an undefined period. This
will be a matter for official discussion between
the authorities of both countries.
I am
informed that these points were the subject
of discussion, but no conclusion could be
arrived at.
In view of the fact that the main features
of this agreement have already been before
this chamber in another bill, perhaps it will
rot be considered necessary to review the
schedule of this bill item by item.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read .the second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Tomorrow.
MANITOBA NATURAL RESOURCES
TRANSFER BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. T. A. Crerar moved the second reading of Bill 385, an Act to vary the Manitoba
Natural Resources Agreement.

JUNE 20, 1951
He said: Honourable senators, the explana-tion to this bill is very simple. In 1879 the
federal government set aside for school purposes sections 11 and 29 of each surveyed
township in the Prairie Provinces. At that
time the Dominion Lands Act clearly specified that these lands, known as school lands,
were not subject to homesteading, and were
to be utilized solely for the purposes of
education. When the resources were transferred to the western provinces, the school
lands fund which had been accumulated up
to that date was also transferred to the
provinces. In the transfer agreements covering Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta,
the provision in the Dominion Lands Act
respecting the administration of these school
lands was carried over to the provincial
authorities.
One of the provisions was that the school
lands fund was to be invested in Dominion
Government securities. That brings us to the
purpose of this bill and the two bills that
are to follow it, which is to give the provinces
of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta,
respectively, the power to broaden the field
of investment for these school lands funds.
When this amendment to the transfer agreements is completed each of the provinces will
have authority to invest these funds in not
only Dominion Government securities but also
in the securities of the province, or of a
municipality or school district within the
province. That is the sole purpose of the bill,
and I think no exception can be taken to it.
I may say that the bills immediately following this one on the Order Paper-those
intended to vary the agreements with Alberta
and Saskatchewan-are identical in terms
with the bill that I have explained.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask one question?
Apparently tvhen these agreements were first
entered into the Dominion authority required
that these funds be invested exclusively in
Dominion securities. Undoubtedly it was
then and still is of advantage to the Dominion
to have these moneys so invested. Why is
this concession being made now? Is the
federal government getting anything in return
for the concession, or is there some compelling
reason for the change?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I think my honourable
friend is under a misapprehension. The agreements as they now read require that the
school lands funds be invested in Dominion
Government securities. These capital funds
are to remain intact, and the only change
which the bills make is that each of the provinces which is ýnow administering the funds,
may invest them, as it sees fit, in securities
80713-40à

not only of the Dominion but of the province or of any municipality or school district
within the province.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: My honourable friend
has not quite understood my question. I
appreciated what he told us in his explanation, that the original agreement required that
the funds be invested in Dominion securities.
My point is this. That requirement was no
doubt of advantage to the Dominion, which
was at that time transferring these resources
and moneys to the province. Well, why is it
proposed that the advantage be given up by
the Dominion now? Does the Domi.nion get
anything in return, or is there any compelling
reason why it should make this concession?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The only reason for the
change is that the provinces now are responsible for administration of their respective
funds, and can be depended upon, I think, to
invest them in a way that will best serve the
proper purposes and needs. The provinces
have requested the federal government to
have the change made, and I do not see any
reason why the requests should be refused.
The amendment simply broadens the field of
investment for the funds.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Is there any advantage
to the Dominion Government in the requirement that these funds be invested in Dominion
securities?
Hon. Mr. Howden: Originally the federal
authority administered the natural resources
for the provinces, or sold them and reinvested
the funds. The school lands always belonged
to the provinces, and when the natural
resources were transferred from the Dominion
the provinces assumed administration of these
school lands along with administration of the
other resources.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: And why not?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: As to the point raised
by the senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck), I do not think there was any
advantage to the Dominion in the investment
of these funds in federal securities. It was
at the time rather a question of the rate of
interest. My own view is thatHon. Mr. Haig: I will answer that in a
minute. I will explain what the advantage
was.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I know how you will
explain it: you will point out that Dominion
government bonds have declined on the
market. We have passed this session bills
authorizing various organizations to invest
certain of their funds in securities yielding a
higher return than is received from the
securities now permissible as investments.
One such bill, for instance, authorized a

SENATE
change in the type of securities in which the
United Church of Canada may invest itsi
pension fund. I have no doubt that there is
a similar explanation here.
However, I
think that when these original agreements
required investment of the provincial funds
in Dominion government bonds there was no
particular advantage to the Dominion.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am glad the senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) raised
this point.
My honourable friend from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) thought I was
going to explain it in one way, but I am going
to say something else altogether.
I will
admit that the provinces have asked for this
concession. Money in this country is getting
tighter, surprisingly tighter. The provinces
of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta
know that they can get a higher yield if
they invest their funds in other than
Dominion securities. If we were acting in
wbat we regarded as the best interests of
the Dominion, we sbould not allow this bill
to go through at all.
However, we are
supposed to represent the provinces, and the
amcndmnent may be a good thing for them.
My own province of Manitoba has just
floated in New York a bond issue of
$10,400,000
at 31
per
cent, which is
a higher rate than we have had to
pay for some years. The province will have
to pay the exchange in addition to that
interest.
I believe that at the present
moment the discount on Canadian money in
the United States is pretty close to 7 per cent.
If you went to the bank tomorrow to buy
United States dollars you would probably
have to pay a premium of 7' per cent.
Hon. Mr. Reid:
It wvas 7 per cent last
Saturday.
Hon. Mr. Aselline:
on Friday.

It

was 7-

per cent

Hon. Mr. Haig:
The full value of the
Manitoba issue in Canadian dollars at the
present rate of exchange would be about

$11,200,000,

but the province is receiving

only some $10,900,000.
So the cost of the
loan is more than $200,000, in addition to the
exchange on the interest payments. I do
not know whether anyone could tell exactly
the net rate which the province will pay on
this loan, but it will be quite a bit higher
than Manitoba used to pay. Only about two
and a half years ago the province sold an
issue at, I think, 24 per cent, or at any rate
a little under 3 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine:

At par?

Hon. Mr. Haig: At par. That is why a
desire has been expressed to have these bills
passed promptly.
It all comes about by
reason of the fact that the Government of

Canada is spending too much money; investors
in government bonds are afraid of their
securities and are demanding higher interest
rates. The Dominion Government has now
reached the stage-though Mr. Towers will
not admit it-where it has not got enough
money to liquidate the bonds, and as a result
their market value has declined and the general
rate of interest is going up. All the municipalities across Canada will be obliged to pay
interest at higher rates than they have ever
paid before. The Dominion has in the past sold
some of its bonds at 2, per cent and some at
2, per cent, but now the provinces know that
their own bonds cannot be sold at less than
3' per cent in New York, subject to exchange.
My honourable friend from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert) touched on the subject of
securities the other day, but the illustration
be offered was not as good as the one now
before us. This is the first real evidence we
have had that the investors cannot count on
their securities. They feel that the old rates of
interest are not sufficiently attractive for the
risk they have to take. Surely this is a signal
to the people of Canada that too much public
debt is being incurred in view of the war
situation.
This measure is an indication
from the provinces that they want to widen
their investment field, because they are paying
higher interest rates on their own securities.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Irrespective of the rate
of interest, should not the provinces be
allowed to administer funds from their own
natural resources?
Hon. Mr. Haig: My friend from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) touched on
business acumen. If I were in the place of
the Dominion Government, and acting for
myself, handing over the resources to the
provinces, I would probably require them to
invest in the securities I was selling. That,
in effect, is what the Dominion Government
did.

Hon. Mr. Fogo: May I ask the honourable
gentleman if it is not a fact that the securities in question belong to the provinces?
Hon. Mr.

Haig: Yes, they belong to the

provinces, but since 1927 they have been
held in the right of the Dominion.

Hon. Mr. Fogo: But they were held for the
provinces?
Hon. Mr. Haig: That may be so, but all the
natural resources in Manitoba, Saskatchewan
and Alberta were held by the Dominion
Government up to 1927, at which time an
agreement
was entered
into with
the
provinces.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: But since that time
the securities have belonged to the provinces?

JUNE 20, 1951
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes; but the Dominion
handed over the resources on condition that
the income from them would be invested
in Dominion securities. We are now asked
to forego that condition.
I intend to vote for the bill, because we
as senators are supposed to represent the
provinces. The other place is supposed to
look after the interests of the Dominion, but
we are on the side of the provinces. I have
taken this opportunity to call the attention
of the people of this country to the fact that
the government has to call a halt some place
in its spending program. This first warning
signal, as I would call it, comes not from a
political or an individual citizen, but from a
province as a whole, which thinks the money
involved can be better invested elsewhere
than in Dominion securities. I am very much
in favour of the passage of the bill, and I see
no necessity for its being referred to a
committee.
Hon. A. W. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
I thank the senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Haig) for his speech, although I do not
entirely agree with one point he made. He
said that the rate of interest on government
bonds is rising because of some fear on the
part of the public about repayment. Well,
nobody knows what is in the minds of other
men; such a fear may exist, but if it does
I see no reason for it. I do know, however,
that the interest rate is rising because of
the fact that mortgage money is going up, not
because the lender today is more apprehensive about repayment of his money than he
was six months or a year ago. The plain
fact is that money is being more profitably
invested elsewhere, and the rate is going up.
Perhaps there are many factors which
play a part in fixing the rate of interest;
but if this is a reasonable concession to the
provinces, I am not prepared to stand in its
way. If it is a concession to the provinces,
let us understand it to be such. There do
seem to be some grounds for allowing the
province to invest money which is for its
benefit only, and is really within its control,
in whatever manner it sees fit. Those who
say that there is no advantage in the provision that the province shall invest this money
in Dominion securities do not, I fancy, realize
the picture presented to us at this moment.
My friend from Winnipeg has already made
some reference to it. The Bank of Canada
until recently has supported government
bonds. With the withdrawal of that support
the value of these securities has gone down,
thereby causing -a good deal of trouble in the
building field and elsewhere.
I should like the member from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) to tell us just how much
money is involved in this transaction, and if

as a result of the passage of this bill we will
be faced with the possibility of a large block
of Dominion Government bonds being thrown
on the market. Will this agreement result in
a further reduction in the value of government bonds, or what do we face in that
regard? Will the senator tell us, first, how
much money is involved in this transaction?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: If there are no further
observations I shall be only too pleased to
conclude the discussion.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Just answer the question; there may be other speeches to follow.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: My honourable friend
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck)
inquires how much money is involved in
this transaction, and he fears that if it is a
large amount, the provincial governments
may throw on the market the Dominion
securities now in the school lands fund ani
that that action would have an adverse
effect. I submit to my honourable friend
that that question is not at all relevant tothe issue. This trust fund was set up as
far back as 1879. The Province of Manitoba
was then in existence; Saskatchewan and
Alberta were not constituted until many
years later. But the federal government,
foreseeing the development of Western
Canada, said, "We will assist education in
the new provinces by setting aside for school
purposes in each township two sections of
land",-that is, one-eighteenth of the land
which was surveyed; and they laid down the
conditions of the transfer, namely that the
lands must be sold by auction, and that the
proceeds must be invested for the advantage
of education. It was not intended that the
capital should be drawn upon, but only the
income which resulted from the sales. The
proceeds were to be invested in Dominion
Government securities. The amounts earned
through the fund in Manitoba were turned
over to the province for purposes of
education.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: We know all that, but
we want to know how much money is
involved.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I do not know.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Well, that is the
question.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: What difference does it
make?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It makes a lot of
difference.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: What difference does it
make whether the amount is five or ten or
twenty-five million dollars? That is not the
matter we are concerned with. The question is whether or not the provinces whicli

SENATE
now control these funds and the lands, shall
have the authority to invest the money as
they see fit.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Just to clarify the
matter: Suppose the fund amounts to
$25 million. I do not know how much it is,
but that sum has been suggested. I take it
that if this bill is passed, the provincial
authorities will have the right to sell
Dominion Government bonds to the extent of
$25 million and to reinvest the proceeds in
provincial government bonds.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Theoretically they would
nave the power.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: That is what the honourable senator wanted to find out.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Yes, theoretically. But
is that any reason why we should refuse the
provinces the right to make other investments?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It is a very good
reason.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I do not think so. I
think if we rejected the bill on that ground
we would hear about it-and rightly sofrom the provinces. On the practical side,
however, does it stand to reason that any of
these provinces that may have substantial
amounts invested in Dominion Government
securities would throw them helter-skelter
on the market in order to invest the proceeds somewhere else? If they were to do
that, probably they would lose more than
they would gain. I anticipate that what
they have in mind is this. Every year payments are added to the fund from purchases
of school lands, and what the provinces
desire is the authority to invest these new
funds in such securities as are outlined in
the bill.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The bill does not state
that.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I have no doubt that we
can get information as to the total amount
of Dominion Government bonds now in the
fund. If we were to have that information
tomorrow, and supposing the investments
amounted to $50,000,000-although I do not
suppose the total is nearly as large as. thatwould we on that account change one letter
of this legislation? Would we refuse to
comply with the very reasonable request
which has been made by Manitoba,
Saskatchewan and Alberta, and is being
implemented in this legislation? I cannot
foresee that parliament would reject their
request. If it did I believe its action would
be criticized.
As far as I am concerned, if my honourable
friend wants to get further information, this

and the two succeeding bills can be remitted
to the committee. But I do not believe that
the reasons given by the honourable member
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck)
would warrant us in refusing to pass these
bills.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I certainly would hold
my hand at this moment before I would throw
on the market, or run the risk of having
thrown on the market, $50,000,000 of government bonds. I do not object to the principle
of a province investing its own money as it
sees fit. But let us know what we are doing.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: If the question is
merely one of figures, may I suggest that
we defer until tomorrow the third reading of
this bill, and that we take up at that time
the other two bills, which are precisely
similar. By then, I am sure, we will have
the information.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is a good suggestion.
Hon. Mr. McGuire: Why not refer the bill
to the Committee on Banking and Commerce?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: If the only question
is as to the amount of money invested, I do
not think the bill need go to committee.
Hon. Mr. McGuire: If it goes to the Banking and Commerce Committee the officials
will have time to get the information and
let us have it. Nobody is suggesting that the
bills be rejected, but I am sure we are
entitled to know what is the total amount
in the fund, and to consider what might be
the consequences if the securities were to
go on the market. The Banking and Commerce Committee meets this evening at 8
o'clock. There is only one bill to be considered. I suggest that any bills to which
we give second reading this afternoon might
go to the committee tonight; and when the
bills relating to the Manitoba, Alberta and
Saskatchewan natural resources agreements
are before the committee the officials can
tell us the amounts of bonds involved.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: With reference to the
suggestion of the honourable senator from
East York (Hon. Mr. McGuire), I was anxious
to put before the Banking and Commerce
Committee this evening the Trust and Loan
bill which I presented this afternoon, but
after some further consideration and inquiry
I decided that it would be better for the
committee to dispose this evening of the
Post Office Bill, and postpone until tomorrow
morning discussion of my bill and the others.
I think there are only two more. In any
event there are not so many that they could
not be readily disposed of in the morning.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I remark that it will
not be possible to deal with these provincial

JUNE 20, 1951
bills tonight. To get the information required
it will be necessary, I am sure, to wire the
Treasurers of the three provinces. They are
the only persons who know the amounts of
money invested.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Haig: You will be very lucky if
you get replies by tomorrow morning.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I do not think there
is any hurry about these bills. All we can
do is to hold over second reading of these
bills until the information is available, and
then we can carry them right ahead.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Any objection to the
committee?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: None. But why send
the bills to committee when all we want is
one figure which can be got by telegram?
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON FINANCE

Hon. T. A. Crerar, Chairman of the Standing Committee on Finance, presented the
committee's report on the Estimates laid
before parliament for the fiscal year ending
March 31, 1952.
He said: Honourable senators, this report
is fairly lengthy and I wouli suggest that it
be not read by the Clerk Assistant. I think
the house would find it more satisfactory to
have the report printed in the Minutes of the
Proceeings for today, so that it will be available ta honourable members tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Roid: May I ask the Chairman of
the committee (Hon. Mr. Crerar) when this
report was passed? I am a member of the
committee, but I do not remember being present at any sitting when the report was brought
forward.
Was it done in between sittings,
and did the committee approve of it?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: In reply to my honourable
friend, I would point out that the Finance
Committee met yesterday, after the Senate

rose. Notices of the meeting were circulated
during the Senate sitting. More than a quorum
of members of the committee were present
and they approved the report.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The committee approved

the full report?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Surely.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable members, this

is a very important document; a good deal of
work has been done on it, and I think the
public should have an opportunity to read it.
I would therefore suggest, subject to the
consent of the acting leader of the government, that the report be printed in Hansard.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I think the suggestion

of my honourable friend is a wise one, and I
consent with pleasure.
(See appendix at end of today's report).
The Hon.

the

Speaker: Honourable senators,

when shall the report be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I move that the report be

taken into consideration on Tuesday next.

Supplementary Letters Patent.
(2) Part III of The Companies Act, 1934, shall not
apply to the Company."

The Hon. the Speaker:
Honourable
senators, when shall the amendments be
taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: When I moved second
reading of this bill I asked that Rule 119
be suspended so that the committee could
deal with the bill at once. I explained that
there were particular circumstances which
would justify this action. The petition for
the bill was presented some weeks ago by
the honourable senator from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. Davis), but an unavoidable delay
occurred because of the meetings which had
to be held, and other proceedings which
necessarily had to be taken by the boards
of directors and shareholders in England as
well as here, and the time required to obtain
the approval of Treasury Board and
officials of departments. Every possible
effort was made to get the legislation before
us as soon as possible.
The success of this effort to form the
company in such a way as to permit it to
carry on the business it has undertaken
depends on getting this legislation through
the other place promptly. I therefore urge

given to the amendments, so that the bill

necessary to the suspension of Rule 119, but
I ask, unless there is some fundamental
reason to the contrary, that such consent
be accorded.
The Hon. the Speaker: Has the honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert) the leave of the Senate to move
concurrence in these amendments now?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Unless I can speak briefly
on the matter, I will say "no". It can stand
for a day.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Suspension of the
rule requires unanimous consent, and if the
honourable senator decides that he cannot
agree, it is his right and privilege to take
that stand. In that event, I would like to
move that considerationHon. Mr. Horner: I understand that all
the honourable senator wishes to do is to
be allowed to speak on the third reading.
Hon. Mr. Reid: All I rose to say is that I
have no fundamental reasons for objecting
to this bill, but it seems to me that there is a
tendency towards the end of the session to
bring bills before the Senate for the first
time and rush them through. Yesterday a
bill was introduced with the suggestion that
it must go through practically without consideration, and the bill now before us has
been reported with quite a number of
amendments. I rise as a matter of principle
to suggest that third reading of bills should
be delayed until another sitting. However,
as I have stated, my objection in this case is
not fundamental.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: With leave, then, I
move that the amendments be concurred in
now.
The motion was agreed to.

THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker:

Honourable sena-

tors, when shall the bill be read the third
time?
With leave of the
Hon. Mr. Hayden:
Senate, now.
Hon. A. W. Roebuck: This is the bill that
was discussed so thoroughly yesterday, and
which was explained in part by the sponsor
of the bill in the Banking and Commerce
Committee this morning. We have still not
been told, however, how much is involved,
or whether the Manitoba Government holds
dominion securities which can be thrown on
the market. I am not prepared to continue
objection to the bill, but I should like to
point out that we are taking some chances
on giving the bill third reading now. This
house is certainly entitled to a better explanation than it has received. I think we have
given thorough warning to the department
about the possibilities that lie ahead, but
should the sponsor insist on passage of the
bill without giving the house the explanation
to which I think it is entitled, I am not going
to make any further objection.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Honourable senators,
the bill was discussed at some length this
morning, and perhaps the honourable member
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) would tell
the house what he told members of the
committee.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is fine.

Hon. T. A. Crerar: It seems to me important to get a clear understanding of the purpose of this legislation. I must confess that
when I presented the bill for second reading
yesterday it never occurred to me that
objection would be taken to the principle of
turning over to the Province of Manitoba
the investment of its own funds, which do
not belong to the federal government in any
way whatsoever. I apologize for being unable
te provide the information asked by honourable members in the house yesterday, but
I had not thought it necessary to go beyond
the explanation I gave. The same consideration was given to the bill when it was considered in the other place.
The explanation referred to by the Acting
Chairman of the Banking and Commerce
Commitee (Hon. Mr. McDonald) can very
quickly be supplied now, and since it relates
to the two other bills that will follow, it
will serve the purpose for those bills as well.
I stated yesterday that in 1879, when it
became clear that settlement was going into
Western Canada, the federal government
decided to set aside two sections in every
surveyed township for what was known as
school purposes. In other words, these two
particular sections could not be disposed of
by the federal government, except by sale,
and my recollection is that the sale had to
be by auction. The proceeds from such sales,
as they were paid into the federal treasury,
were put into a trust fund. Now, I do not
know whether the government of that day
established a trust fund or whether it put
the proceeds into consolidated revenue and
credited the account with the appropriate
interest earnings.
By 1930, when these resources were transferred to the provinces, the amounts of the
capital funds for the three provinces were
as follows-in round figures: Manitoba, $5,900,000; Saskatchewan, $17,800,000; Alberta,
$9,550,000. The total was slightly more than
$33 million.
It is important to keep in mind that these
were capital funds. Each year the interest
earned by them was turned over in the right
proportion to the provincial authorities. I
was in error yesterday in stating that the
moneys had been turned over to the provincial governments at the time of the transfer of the resources, in 1930. That transfer
took place shortly before the election which
was held in that year-an election which,
by the way, I have some cause to remember.
The arrangement made about these moneys
was this. The federal government, instead
of paying over the cash, gave its note for
one year to each of the provinces, and the
note carried interest at 4 per cent. That is,
the earnings on each of these funds credited

SENATE
to the respective provinces were at the rate
of 4 per cent and were paid to each province
for school purposes. For some reason that
I am unable to explain to the house, that
arrangement carried through until 1950. That
is to say, every year the federal government
gave its notes for the amounts that I have
mentioned to the provincial governrnents,
and each of the notes carried interest at 4
per cent. In 1950 the federal government
decided to liquidate this obligation to the
provinces, and paid them in cash the respective amounts standing to their credit in
these capital funds. I assume, of course,
that the provinces now have in their respective funds amounts beyond the capital sums
placed there in 1930, for in the intervening
twenty years or so some school lands have
been sold by each of the provinces and payments have been made by the individual purchasers. What the total amount of the funds
is at the moment I do not know; that information would have to be secured from the provincial governments.
Yesterday my honourable friend from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), for
whose ability I have a very high respectand I am not saying that by way of flatterymade a suggestion which I took to mean that
in passing this bill we should attach some
rider or provision which would place upon
each of the three provincial governments
some kind of limitation as to the securities
in which they may invest these funds. In
other words, the suggestion as I understood
it was we should place upon the provinces
some obligation not to dispose of any Dominion Government securities that they hold
for these funds without first getting consent
from, say, the Minister of Finance at Ottawa.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Will my honourable
friend allow me? Of course, I did not make
that suggestion ýat all. My honourable friend
has attributed to me something that I did
not say.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: It was the honourable
senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
who suggested that.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I am at a loss to understand then what objection was raised by the
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck).
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: In the circumstances,
may I be permitted to explain? I made no
suggestion of the kind referred to by my
honourable friend, particularly not of any
continuing form of control over the moneys.
The information I asked for was the amount
of money invested in Dominion securities
which this bill would release and which might
be thrown on the market. The amount
might be small-in fact, it might be no

amount at all. I did not know, and I thought
this house should have that information
before the bill was passed. And when in
the course of the debate yesterday my honourable friend asked me whether it would
make any difference if there was $50 million
invested in that way, my answer was yes,
and that in view of the market conditions
prevailing today I would hold my hand rather
than throw that amount of money on the
market just now. That is as far as I went.
If $50 million or some amount of that size
were likely to be thrown on the market
immediately as a result of the passing of this
bill, I would hold my hand unless some
arrangement was made to govern reinvestment of the money. I do not think we should
be blindfolded when passing a bill of this
kind.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I am told that no one in
the Department of Finance has knowledge
of what each of the provincial governments
has doneHon. Mr. Roebuck: I think someone there
ought to have knowledge before a bill of
this kind is brought before us.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: -not only with the cash
that was received from Ottawa a year ago
but with the amounts that were collected in
the intervening years.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: They did not get bonds,
they got cash.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Yes. I think it would be
rather an unwise thing, if I may say so, for
parliament to say to the provincial governments, in effect, that we require to know how
much of these funds is invested in Dominion
Government securities before we pass this
legislation.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Why?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Because, I think, the provincial authorities could quite properly say
that that is no concern of ours.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: They could say, "It is
none of your business".
Hon. Mr. Crerar: And it is not any concern
of ours.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Federal government
securities are involved.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The provinces are
autonomous in their own sphere and these
moneys unquestionably belong to them. If
the funds are not administered wisely the
provincial governments will have to be held
to account by the people of their respective
provinces rather than by the people of Canada

JUNE 21, 1951
as a whole. That is why I really do not see
the force of the point raised by my honourable friend from Trinity.
Some Hon. Senators: Question.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
INTERNAL ECONOMY COMMITTEE
REPORTS
CONSIDERATION POSTPONED

Hon. Mr. Beaubien, Acting Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Internal Economy
and Contingent Accounts, presented the ninth
tenth, eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth reports

Assistant.
The Hon. the Speaker:
Honourable
senators, when shall the reports be taken
into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Next sitting.
PRIVATE BILL
REFUND OF PARLIAMENTARY FEES

Hon. Mr. Hugessen moved:
That the parliamentary fees paid upon the Bill 1-7,
an Act to incorporate the Polish National Catholie
Church of America in Canada, be refunded to
Messrs. Maclaren, Laidlaw & Co., solicitors for petitioners, less printing and translation costs.

The motion was agreed to.
PRIVATE BILL
REFUND OF PARLIAMENTARY FEES

Hon. Mrs. Fallis moved:
That the parliamentary fees paid upon the Bill
T-6, an Act to incorporate the Scripture Gift
Mission (Canada) Incorporated, be refunded to
Messrs. Briggs, Frost & Co., solicitors for petitioners,
less printing, and translation costs.

The motion was agreed to.
SUSPENSION OF RULES
MOTION

Hon. Mr. Hugessen moved:
That for the balance of the present session Rules
23, 24 and 63 be suspended in so far as they relate to
Public Bills.

He said: Honourable senators, this is the
usual motion which is moved at this stage
of each session. Its passage would suspend
Rule 23 which calls for two days' notice of
certain motions; Rule 24, which requires one
day's notice of certain matters; and Rule 63
which, briefly, provides that no bill shall be
read twice the same day.
The motion was agreed to.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are called, I
think the house would like to have some
idea of what has been suggested in connection
with our future work. We have made very
good progress this week with the various bills
that have been submitted to us, and I am
going to suggest that when the house adjourns
this afternoon, it stand adjourned until
Monday evening of next week. The only
important bill yet before us is the bill to
amend the Income Tax Act, which my
honourable friend from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden) will explain on second reading later
this afternoon. I suggest that if the debate
on the second reading of the bill is concluded
this afternoon, the bill should then be moved
into the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce, to be considered there later this
afternoon and this evening.
The four bills to which first reading was
given this af.ternoon will be explained on
second reading on Monday evening. As
honourable senators will recall, three of them
relate to the Canadian National Railways; and
I have arranged for a meeting next Tuesday
morning of the Standing Committee on Transportation and Communications to which these
bills, if they receive second reading on
Monday, will be submitted. Officials of the
Canadian National Railways will be present
to explain any questions that honourable
members may wish to ask.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Why is it that some bills
are referred to the Transportation Committee and others to the Banking and Commerce
Committee? It seems to me a strange proceeding. I hope there is no idea of juggling
tbem around.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: No. The only reason
I suggested yesterday afternoon that the bill
relating to the Quebec Railway be submitted
to the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce is that that bill was presented in
this house yesterday and it is very desirable
to get it promptly to the other place so that
it can be dealt with this session. It so
happened that a meeting of the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce was
called for this morning; and, rather than have
another meeting of the Committee on Transportation at some other time I felt, and I
think the house agreed, that as a matter of
convenience we should have that particular
bill be considered in the Committee on Banking and Commerce. This, in fact, is what was
done. I quite agree with my honourable
friend that normal and proper procedure with
respect to railway bills is to send them to the
Committee on Transportation.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. Reid: Certainly. That is what
should have been done with the bill yesterday.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: It would have been, but
for the rather special need for prompt action.

CANADA-FRANCE INCOME TAX
CONVENTION
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. Hugessen moved the third reading
of Bill 374, an Act respecting an Income Tax
Convention between Canada and France,
signed at Paris on the sixteenth day of
March, 1951.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
ALBERTA NATURAL RESOURCES
TRANSFER BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. Crerar moved the second reading
of Bill 386, an Act to vary the Alberta
Natural Resources Agreement.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: When shall this bill
be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: If there is no objection, it
might be read the third time now. If there
is any, it can stand over until Monday
evening.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Would it be possible for
the sponsor of this bill to obtain for us,
between now and Monday night, the information for which we asked in connection
with the Manitoba bill? Both the honourable

senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) and I raised this question in the
house yesterday, and in the committee this
morning; and we would still like to know,
if it is not going to hold up the bills too long,
how much of this money is in dominion
bonds because if a large amount is so invested
we do not want all the bonds to be thrown on
the market at once for fear that such action
would depress the price. I am speaking in the
interest of Canadians who have invested
largely in such bonds. If the sponsor of the
bill thinks it is possible to get the information
asked for, I think that third reading of this
bill should be deferred until Monday.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I very heartily second
that suggestion. We have not had the information which was the subject of my request,
in which request I was supported by my
honourable friend from Rosetown (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine). It would be very wise, no matter
what the sponsor thinks he can do in the
meantime, to leave this bill until Monday.
Let us in any event have the time that is
due to us.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I am quite willing that
third reading should stand over until Monday.
As regards the request of my honourable
friend from Rosetown-a very important
place in the Province of SaskatchewanHon. Mr. Aselline: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: No joking, now!
Hon. Mr. Crerar: -I do not think it would
be appropriate for me as a senator to ask
the provincial governments of Western
Canada for that information.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: You do not have to.
The Department of Finance will do it for
you.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: No, it will not.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Let us get this clear.
My honourable friend suggested that I
should obtain the information.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Through the Finance
Department.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That is what I am
about to say: It would be quite improper
for me, as a humble member of this honourable house, to ask the governments of
Saskatchewan, Alberta and Manitoba for this
information, but I shall convey to the
Finance Minister tomorrow morning the
request that my honourable friend from
Rosetown suggests should be made. If the
Finance Minister cares to get the information, good and well, but if he takes the view
that a question of that kind should not be
put to the provincial governments of Western
Canada, I do hope my honourable friends

JUNE 21, 1951
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck)
and Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) will not
hold the lash over me too severely.
The Hon. the Speaker:
Honourable
senators, is it your pleasure that the bill be
read the third time on Monday next?
The motion for third reading was

INCOME TAX BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. Hugessen moved the second reading of Bill 296, an Act to amend the Income
Tax Act.
He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden) to explain this bill.
Hon. Salter A. Hayden: Honourable senators,
this bill implements certain budget resolutions
and contains a number of amendments arising
from requests by various public organizations.
It also contains other amendments which the
department thinks will clarify certain sections
of the existing legislation.
The bill before the house may look somewhat terrifying with its forty sections, but I
can assure honourable members that I do not
intend to deal with the bill item by item. I
propose to deal first with the sections which
cover the budget resolutions, and then to discuss other sections of the bill which might be
of particular interest to the Senate and the
public at large.
The first of the budget resolutions provides
for the defence surtax in relation to income
of corporations and individuals. I should
like to read the budget resolution relating to
the corporation surtax. It provides:
That, in respect of Income earned after the commencement of the 1951 calendar year, a corporation
shall pay a defence surtax for the year equal to 20
per cent of that portion of its ordinary income tax
for the year that is computed at the 38 per cent
rate, or the 33 per cent rate if applicable, (before
allowance lis made for tax credits) subject to a right
to a refund of such tax to the extent that it would
reduce the corporation's taxable income after payment of ordinary income tax to an amount less than
5 per cent of its capital employed.

Section 12 implements the taxing part of
this resolution by imposing the 20 per cent
surtax. The Act now provides that the 20 per
cent tax only applies where a corporation is
subject to the going rate of corporate tax,
which would be 38 per cent at the present
time. It does not apply in the case of companies which earn up to $10,000 a year, nor
does it apply in relation to the first $10,000
item of taxable income to which, by previous
legislation, we assigned a special tax. That
special tax, which was 10 per cent on the first
$10,000, is now 15 per cent. So now the 20
per cent surtax applies to any amount of corporate income, which has been calculated at
the maximum rate of 38 per cent. There is
nothing in the bill which implements the
other part of the resolution. That is to say,
if the effect of the application of the 20 per
cent surtax is to reduce the corporation's
earnings below an amount of 5 per cent of its
capital employed, the tax will not apply. I
can only give here the explanation given by
the minister in the other place. Many methods
were suggested, but notwithstanding the
exercise of the best intelligence and ingenuity
to be found in the department, they have not
been able to devise a method which would
make this provision effective. I pass on this
explanation as being a sincere and honest one,
reached after very great efforts had been
made to work out some method. The great
problem was to decide how to determine
capital employed in a way that would give
any real meaning to this 5 per cent exemption
calculated on capital employed. In many
cases the result of this exemption would be
negligible if you took the capital employed
of a company operating largely on borrowed
capital, on any ordinary definition of capital
employed. At the same time, in the field of
public utilities and elsewhere you have companies rendering great public service. In
fact, they are being called on to render an
increasing amount of public service which
they have to finance out of public borrowings
and from their own operations. It was delired
to give them some assistance so that they
might be able to accumulate something out of
their operations by which to continue expanding in the public interest. Another factor is
that the rates of many of these public utilities
are regulated by an independent body, and
you find these public utility bodies very loathe
to recognize, other than in a limited way, the
effect of increasing costs upon operations for
which they seek to collect additional rates.
The government was fully conscious of this
situation and wanted to give some help; but
to have done it by way of reference to the
definition of capital employed in the excess
profits tax Act would, in my opinion, have
been to hand them an empty shell. I say

SENATE
this because the definition of capital employed which excludes any consideration of
the effect of borrowed capital as part of the
working capital of the company, would not
have given the proper result. As a matter of
fact, the excess profits tax Act was a workable one during the last war only because of
the additional provisions in the Act which
provided other methods of estimating a
standard profit of a company.
I regret as much as anyone that this part
of the resolution vas not implemented. I
wish to express my personal feeling about
this. That is why I asked the deputy leader
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) to move the second reading of ,this bill. I did not want to place any
limitation on myself in expressing my opinion.
I feel that the power to do this sort of thing,
as was contained in the resolution, should
have been taken in some form, so that we
would have an assurance that if a method
coud be worked out for giving the relief
provided for in the resolution it would be
given. It may still be donc, of course, if we
get the necessary undertaking from the minister that the door is not closed and that the
mattcr
il still be considered; and that if
and when it is considered, retroactive effect
will be given to any solution that is found.
I am mentioning this because we shall be
considering the bill in committee, and also
because it provoked a good deal of discussion in the other place and is a matter of
important interest to the people at this time.
Public utilities are a vital factor in the
life-blood and operation of business and in the
whole economic life of the country, and if
they are to continue to expand and meet the
demands for expansion they must be able to
get the names to do so. But if we are going
to squeeze them against rising costs and a
fixed rate for the services that they render,
which fixed rate moves up slowly, if at all,
then some solution will have to be found in
the public interest. I would rather have that
solution come by way of the company being
permitted to earn sufficient and to retain a
sufficient portion of its earnings to enable it
to meet the demands for expansion with its
own funds' together with funds obtained by
public financing, than that there should be
some additional drain on the public treasury
to support and finance that kind of thing.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Will the honourable
senator tell me what is the reason for excluding borrowed capital from the capital of a
company that is allowed to earn 5 per cent?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The explanation most
readily given is this, that interest which you
pay on borrowed capital is a deductible item
of expense, so the company gets the benefit
of the use of the money and the cost of it is

charged against the income from operations;
and it was felt that in the ordinary course
that .consideration was generous enough and
that in these circumstances the money should
not be regarded as part of the capital
employed.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: May I ask the honourable
gentleman a question? Would the sarne
answer apply to a person who used the proceeds frorn a life insurance policy as capital
employed in his business?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is a difficult question to answer, because we are talking about
capital employed in relation to a corporation
and the effect of corporate surtax. If the
proceeds of life insurance are put into a business by way of subscription for capital stock,
they would of course form part of the capital
employed, under any definition; but if they
are put in by way of a loan to the business,
then under any of the definitions that have
been used heretofore they would not be
regarded as capital employed-and that would
be truc, no matter what the source of the
funds was.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Suppose it was a loan from
an insurance company to the policyholder.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: My honourable friend
from Halifax (Hon. Mr. Isnor) was asking me
about the proceeds of life insurace placed
into a business.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: The senator froni Bedford
(Hon. Mr. Quinn) is simply enlarging a bit
on my question.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: If I am carrying on business in a corporate way and I borrow money
on life insurance policies and put that money
into the business, I can put it in either by
lending it to the company or by subscribing
for capital stock.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Or you could put it up as
collateral.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is a form of borrowing, so far as the company is concerned, and
a forrn of lending, by the person who puts up
the money. If the money were put in as part
of the subscribed capital of the company it
would come within the ordinary definition of
capital employed, but if it were lent or put
up as collateral it would not come within that
definition.
Hon. Mr. Davis: May I ask the honourable
gentleman a question? Suppose a company
owned and controlled in Canada operates in
another country and is advanced money by
the government of a third country, by way of
capital, would that be subject to taxation
under this particular scheme?

JUNE 21, 1951
Hon. Mr. Hayden: In reply to my honourable
friend's question, if I understand it correctly,
I would say that there is no tax on capital as
such in Canada. Capital employed came into
the budget resolution only as being a formula
by which you could arrive at an amount of
the earnings of a company that could not
be brought below that figure as a result of the
application of a corporate surtax. In the
formula this amount is 5 per cent of the capital employed. In the legal sense capital does
not mean what people ordinarily take it to
mean when they use the word; it includes,
as the law now is, the subscribed capital of
the company, but it does not take borrowed
money into account. Now, to come to the
question. If a foreign country lent moneylet us put it that way-by way of capital to a
company operating in Canada, there would
be no tax on the capital, but there certainly
might be a tax on the interest paid on that
loan. And there would be no tax in respect
of the repayment of the loan.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Is it possible that you
yourself have worked out a scheme for giving
effect to what you have referred to? For
what you have said I take it that you think it
possible to work out a scheme, and I am
wondering if you have in mind something to
suggest to the government.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I thank my honourable
friend very much for the implication in his
question. Let me express my view this way.
I think that for every human problem there
exists an answer. Given the problem and the
result that you want to accomplish, you try to
find the best means of achieving that result.
Very often in the past, knowing the objective
that we wanted to attain, we have passed
legislation dealing with certain problems in
the belief that the legislation would solve
them in whole or in part, yet year after year
we find that legislation of this kind bas to be
amended for purposes of clarification or of
meeting difficulties encountered in administering the law. Now, what we have here is
an income tax problem, and if we know what
objective we are aiming at, why do we not
take some action designed to accomplish that
objective?
Why should we be hesitant
because the method we choose may not prove
in experience to be a perfect one. If we decide
upon a certain solution this year and later
on there has to be some amendment, that can
always be brought before parliament and
dealt with in the light of the then circumstances. My own personal view is that the
door should not be closed just because we do
not know at the moment how best to solve the
problem. I would suggest that some attempt
be made now to deal with the problem or that
an undertaking be given that when some

solution is decided on it be made to operate
retroactively. I cannot go any further than
that now.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: In the meantime would
you give the minister discretionary authority
over these cases when they come up?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Now you are pushing
me a little far. I would give the minister
authority to deal with this problem by regulation, and then see what happens.
Section 8 of the bill imposes a defence surtax on individuals at the rate of 20 per cent
of the tax paid during the year. There is an
exception with respect to the year 1951,
whereby the surtax is computed at 10 per
cent for the year. Payment of the tax for
this year will commence July 1 at the rate
of 20 per cent for the balance of the year,
thus averaging out to 10 per cent for the
whole year. In the case of corporations, the
tax shall be paid from January 1, 1951, at
the rate of 20 per cent.
I come next to budget item 3, which covers
a variety of things. Briefly, it deals with
additional items of deductible expenses.
Notice of these deductions was given in the
budget resolutions, and they are now being
implemented by way of amendments to the
Income Tax Act. Provision is made for deduction of the following expenses incurred
before computing taxable income: Take the
following cases: travelling expenses which
an officer or employee is required to pay
under his contract of employment; professional membership dues, such as are paid by
doctors and lawyers to their respective
associations; office rent or salaries paid to
an assistant or substitute, the payment of
which by the officer or employee was required by the contract of employment; the
cost of supplies consumed directly in the
performance of the duties of an officer or
employee; and union dues. Honourable senators will find these various items of expense
deductions set out, commencing at page 3
of the bill, where subsection 3 of section 3
of the bill would amend section 11 of the
general Act by adding the new subsections 9
and 10. If an employee or officer satisfies
the conditions set out in the new subsection
9, he then qualifies for deduction of the
expenses set out in the new subsection 10,
paragraphs a, b, c and d.
I wish to make special comment on the
item of deduction, union dues, which is dealt
with in the new subsection 12. To be deductible, union dues must be the amount of money
that a workman has to pay to maintain his
membership in a union. He is not allowed

SENATE
to deduct moneys which he contributes to a
union for the purposes of insurance or pension.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Or for political purposes.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes; for political action.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is excluded.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Would my honourable
friend care to say whether under this new
schedule of deductions members of the House
of Commons, senators, or members of any
legislature, would be allowed to deduct expenses incurred in earning income?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Again, I should not express an opinion. The new subsection 9,
which establishes the conditions by which
one gets in the door, so to speak, to make
claims for travelling and other expenses, gives
the first qualification in these words:
Where an officer or employee, in a taxation year
(a) was ordinarily required to carry on the duties
of his employment away from his employer's place
of business or in different places ...

As an ordinary individual, I would say
that members of the House of Commons and
senators would not fit into that category,
by reason of the fact that if parliament is
regarded as their place of employment, they
would be required to be in Ottawa. By that
interpretation it would not be necessary for

income will be paid in full in respect of the pay
and allowances of each pay period by a deduction
therefrom in accordance with a special table subject to the right of any member to file a return on
an annual basis.

To implement this resolution the bill would
add to the Income Tax Act two new sections,
60A and 60B. Section 60A comes into effect
as of July 1, and from that time forward
there will be a special table of the 'basis on
which a member of the forces will have his
deductions made. The section further provides
with respect to the year 1951, both before
and after July 1, that when a person employed in a civilian occupation on an income
on which he has been taxed joins the forces,
the amount that has been withheld in respect
of the office or employment that he was in,
plus the amount that is deducted in the period
when he is in the armed forces, will be
accepted in full of his liability for taxes for
the year. If, however, he has had income in
excess of $50 a year from sources other than
the two mentioned, the withholding will not
be acclepted as full payment of his tax. On
the other hand, the right is reserved to him
to file a return in the usual way.
Section 60B would create a tax credit of
$1 a day for members of the forces. The
conditions under which this concession may
be earned will be found on page 17. The
party must be a member of the naval, army
or air forces of Canada serving in a zone
outside Canada as prescribed in a regulation
made on the recommendation of the Minister
of Finance. Section 60A applies until the
member arrives at a zone outside Canada prescribed by regulation as aforesaid. Then section 60B becomes operative, and the member
is entitled to this dollar-a-day tax credit.
Here is an illustration of the effect upon a
service-man's income of section 60B. The taxable pay and allowance of a private, lst Class,
is $140 per month. His monthly tax for the
year 1952 would be $9.36. If however he is
serving in a zone outside Canada which has
been so designated by regulation, his credit
of $1 per day more than exhausts any liability for tax. That situation obtains in the
case of the single service-man under the rank
of lieutenant. A lieutenant earns $247.67 a
month. If he bas other income to the extent
of more than $50, his tax situation of course
is different.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Does training in the United
States count for tax credits?

any of us, in the performance of our parliamentary duties, to travel from the place
where parliament sits. Under those conditions, I would say the provisions do not
apply to us.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I suggest that we are
not officers or employees.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: A senatorship might be
called an office.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: For the purpose of income
tax, we are called employees.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Why should we not
charge for bouse expenses in our home town?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I would readily reply to
my friend that there is no good reason that
I know of why actual expenditures laid out
for the purpose of attending and performing
duties here should not be deductible items;
but as I read the document, it is not so
provided.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The only answer I can
I turn next to what has been called the
"Armed Forces Code", commencing at page 16 make to my honourable friend is that such
of the bill, which implements budget resolu- matters are governed by regulations pretion No. 4. That resolution provides:
scribed on the recommendation of the MinThat the governor in council be authorized to

this tax will have on various ranks are contained in House of Commons HansaTd,

the permission of the Senate I will put them

outside Canada for this purpose. But I do
not know what conditions wîll govern the
recommendations of the Minister of Finance.
I should think they would be more closely
identified with active service than a training
period in the United States can be said to be.

The next budget resolution with which I
wish to deal is no. 5, which widens the field
of application of the right to pay a 15 per
cent tax on undistributed corporate income.
It is now applied to all companies, the word
"private", which was the word of limitation in
the section enacted last year, being removed.
In addition, the budget resolution proposes
the withdrawal of this right, from April 10,
1951, from a corporation which is controlled
by another corporation, except in relation to
its surplus to the end of 1949. This sounds
a little complicated, but an explanation will
be found on pages 21 and 22 of the bill, beginning at the bottom of page 21. The purpose
of the budget resolution was accomplished
by striking out the words "private company"
wherever they occurred and simply using
the word "corporation". That opens up the
provision to public corporations.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Is it retroactive?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It is effective January 1,
1951, is it not?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes, that is right.
As regards the class of corporation known
as a subsidiary coantrolled company, the
privilege of taking the benefit of this 15 per
cent is withdrawn as of January 1, 1951. The
reason is this. You remember that last year
when the section was introduced some

discussion took place as to the status of conpanies which acquired control of other conpanies after a certain date, and May 10, 1950,
was fixed as the effective date relating to
companies which acquire control of other
companies.
Subsequent to that date the
acquiring company was not permitted to take
out, without paying tax, the surplus of the
company of which control had been acquired
existing at the end of the taxation year preceding control. They had to go through what
may be called the 15 per cent method to clear
this surplus for tax purposes. This sort of
thing developed. Let us assume that A was
the parent company and B a subsidiary. Let
us also assume that in the year 1950 the
subsidiary company earned profits of $100,000. As the law stands it could pay those
profits to the parent corporation without
incurring a tax; and this was the intent of the
legislation when it was passed. It is just
another illustration of the point I was making
in answering the honourable senator from
Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), that what you
think you have done does not always work
out according to your intentions. Hence the
Here is
necessity for these amendments.
what happened.
A subsidiary controlled
company-being a company more than 50 per
cent of whose voting shares are held by
another company-instead of taking advantage of the law permitting it to pass dividends
without tax to its parent company, would pay
50 per cent to the parent company, as it

JUNE 21, 1951
legally could, and would clear the other 50
per cent by paying the 15 per cent tax; and
the parent company received, 1say, $50,000.
That is, the subsidiary earns $100,000; the
parent gets $50,000 and the subsidiary keeps
$50,000 which it clears of tax by payment
of 15 per cent. The parent company then
pays half to its shareholders, and clears the
remaining $25,000 by paying 15 per cent. The
effec-t of this arangment tax-wise would enable
the ultimate shareholder to get about 75 per
cent of the current earnings of the year on a
basis of 15 per cent tax. It was intended that
they should follow a straight line, and that
the subsidiary would pass its earnings to the
parent company without tax, whereupon the
law would apply and the 15 per cent basis be
applicable at the level of the parent company.
It has been suggested, if there were two subsidiaries, that instead of 75 per cent the proportion might get up as high as seven-eighths.
Therefore the purpose of withdrawing this
privilege to a subsidiary controlled company
is simply to force what I might call a straightUne practice. That is, if there are subsidiaries,
the dividends will come in the usual way to
the parent company without tax, and then
this beneficial provision will take effect, and
such a parent company may with respect to
the year 1950 and subsequent thereto, declare
50 per cent of its current earnings by way of
dividends and then clear the other 50 per cent
as a tax-paid amount of undistributed income
by paying 15 per cent. That, apart from
simply extending the privilege to all companies rather than limiting it to private
companies, is the purpose of section 30 of the
bill, and its amendment of section 95(a).
The next budget resolution deals with what
might be called related companies. You will
remember the provision introduced last year
under which the first $10,000 earned was
subject only to a 10 per cent tax, and then
when the rates were increased the tax was
15 per cent. The theory was that the government felt as a matter of policy that they
should lighten the load a little bit on small
businesses. Not wishing to be discriminatory,
however, they provided that any company
would have this benefit up to the first $10,000.
They went on to provide for a category of
companies called related companies. They
provided that if there were related companies
only one could take the benefit of thé low
tax rate on the first $10,000 of income. The
definition is now being amended for this
reason. As to the original section the government, after taking advice from the Justice
Department, has reached the conclusion that
this is a rather anomalous situation requiring
attention and correction. Let me give this
illustration. Suppose you have two brothers,

or a brother and a father, one at the Atlantic
Coast and the other on the Pacific Coast, each
running an independent, corporate business.
Under the wording of the original section
dealing with this special benefit of a low
tax rate on the first $10,000, these businesses
might be held to be related companies because
of the personality of the two people controlling them. As a result, only one would get
the benefit of that $10,000 provision and the
low rate of tax. To my way of thinking it is
absurd that such a condition should exist.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Surely the department
would not take advantage of a case of that
kind?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The best proof that the
department is not seeking to take advantage
of such a case is the fact that it is asking
to have the section amended so as to clarify
its meaning. Frankly I still think it goes a
little too far, and I shall tell you why. Suppose
you have a father carrying on a business on
the Pacific Coast-and it might be an oldestablished business earning $100,000 a yearand a son owning one share in that company;
then suppose the son himself has a business
in Halifax in which he holds all the shares.
Under the provisions of the amendment in
this bill today these companies would be
related companies because the proprietor of
one of these companies holds at least one
share in the other company. You will see the
wording in section Il (iii):
Persons not dealing with each other at arm's
length one of whom owned directly or indirectly
one or more of the shares of the capital stock of
each of the corporations.

In the illustration I have given only one
company would get the benefit of the low
corporate tax rate on the first $10,000.
Hon. Mr. Lacasse: Which company would be
chosen, the one belonging to the father or
the one belonging to the son?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That was embodied in
the general Act last year. In the first instance
it is up to the two parties to reach an agreement, and if they fail to do so the minister
decides.
The next budget resolution has to do with
increasing the items in respect of which you
may get deduction as medical expenses. It
does not increase the amount of medical
expenses or the formula by which you qualify
for medical expense deduction. The additional items in the list are to be found in
section 6 of the bill, and include insulin, cortisone-and again I shall only pronounce the
abbreviated name-ACTH, liver extract
injectible for pernicious anaemia or vitaimin
B12 for pernicious anaemia, purchased for

SENATE
use by the taxpayer, his spouse or any such
dependent as prescribed by such a medical
practitioner.
I should like to refer now to section 40 of
the bill which implements paragraphs 8 and 9
of the income tax resolution dealing with
special deductions from income to taxpayers
whose principal business is the production,
refining or marketing of petroleum or petroleum products or the exploring or drilling for
oil or natural gas, or mining or exploring
for minerals. It extends the provisions to
1952 in one case and to 1954 in the other case.
The 1952 extension relates to a tax credit
which you may get in connection with deep
well drilling. The 1954 extension relates to
the search for and development of oil and
minerals. You may therefore plan accordingly.
Section 25 of the bill has to do with mining companies. As honourable senators know,
under the present Act mining companies are
exempt from taxation during a run-in period
of six months and a three-year period of
production. That exemption is extended by
this bill to any mining company which comes
into production up to and including the year
1954.
I have now referred to the budget resolutions. There are a number of other items,
but I need touch upon them only briefly,
since the bill will be explained in detail
when we go into committee. However, I
must refer to one amendment, which has the
effect of giving a little bit of consideration
to the part-time farmer. In the past he has
had to adopt many expedients in order to'
be allowed to charge any of his farm losses
against other sources of income.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: What do you mean by
a part-time farmer?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I mean a person who
devotes part of every year to farming.
Many of these people dislike being called
gentlemen farmers, and that is why I am
using the other term. Section 13 of the Act
gives the minister power to designate the
taxpayer's chief source of income or chief
combined source of income; but, so far as I
know, part-time farmers have never been
able to persuade the minister to exercise his
power under that section to enable them to
deduct their farming losses from income
received from other sources. This bill enables
the part-time farmer to deduct from his
income from other sources one-half of his
cash farm loss, or $5,000, whichever is less.
I emphasize the word "cash", because he is
not permitted to charge for depreciation so
as to create a loss on his farming operations,
in order thereby to get the benefit of this
section.

Hon. Mr. Quinn: Does anyone lose money
in operating a farm today?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I was wondering
whether the term "part-time farmers" might
include grain producers of Western Canada
who farm in the summer and go to Florida
or California in the winter.
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: The honourable
gentleman, who comes from the Maritimes,
obviously does not know much about farming conditions in the West.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: These are interruptions
of a kind that I welcome, for they do not
require any answer from me.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: If the owner of a farm
does not operate it himself, but rents it out
to another farmer, would you call him a
part-time farmer?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: No.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No. He is just an
ordinary taxpayer who happens to own a
property on which farming operations are
being conducted. I would not regard him as
a farmer.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: But if the rent he
receives for the farm is less than his cost of
carrying the farm, can he charge his loss
against income from other sources?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: A person who has rental
income from a property is entitled to set off
against it certain expenses for maintenance,
and so on.

I should point out that this concession to
part-time farmers is applicable to 1949 and
succeeding years. I certainly do not qualify
as a part-time farmer, but I am glad that this
amendment is being made.
I also wish to mention Section 7 of the bill,
which deals with dividends received by a
Canadian company from a company in another
country. Let us take the case of a parent
company in Canada which has a subsidiary
company in the United States. Under the
,present law, dividends coming to the parent
company from the subsidiary are deductible
from the parent company's income, if the
parent company owns more than 50 per cent
of the shares of the non-resident subsidiary.
A change is now being made so that if the
Canadian company owns more than 25 per
cent of the shares of the non-resident company, the dividends from the non-resident
company may be deducted. This is in a partial
way, I suppose, a recognition of the principle
under which dividends may pass from a Canadian subsidiary company to a Canadian parent
company free of tax.
Now I wish to refer to an amendment which
has given a great deal of trouble, and with

JUNE 21, 1951
respect to which the minister finally gave an
under.taking that if a more satisfactory
amendment could be worked out later on it
would be applied retroactively so as to give
it effect back to the present time. I refer
to the new Subsection 1F of Section 27 of the
Act, which is set out in Section 7 of the bill.
I referred a moment ago to the principle in
the general taxation law under which
dividends from a subsidiary company to its
parent company, both companies being in
Canada, pass without liability for tax. Last
year in dealing with a special situation we
passed an amendment providing that if a
company acquired control of another company
after May 10, 1950, the surplus of the subsidiary company becomes locked in with that
company, as it were, and cannot afterwards
be passed over to the parent company without
being subject to taxation. So far the most
favourable rate which the Act allows on the
transfer of a surplus in those circumstances is
15 per cent. It was necessary to define undistributed income and to provide a method to
determine what were the current earnings in
each year of the control period after the date
mentioned. As I say, this raised a serious
problem, which we attempted to meet last
year by passing the present Subsection 1F of
Section 27. That subsection which is set out
in the explanatory notes opposite page 6 of
the bill, did not prove very satisfactory, and
is now being replaced. There was a great
deal of objection to it, mainly because the
yardstick used was the notion that the subsidiary corporation was being wound up, and
that whatever would be paid to the parent
company on the winding up of the subsidiary
company was the amount that should be used
in determining current earnings.
The new subsection continues the motion
of the winding up of the subsidiary company.
It is a legal fiction, like the legal fiction of a
reasonable man. There is no winding up, but
for purposes of the subsection you assume
that there is. You also assume that the subscribed capital is all repaid; and what is left
is what you deal with.
Now, there would be no difficulty in arriving
at the current earnings on that basis if you
were dealing with companies that had only
the ordinary preferred and common shares;
but when applied to companies which have
special classes of shares, such as Class A
shares as well as common stock shares, or
if the rights of the two classes of shareholders
as to dividends and as to their position on the
winding up of the company are different, it
is felt by many people that this subsection
still leaves an element of doubt and confusion.
The attempt to arrive at what is current earnings in this class of controlled company, is

for the purpose of determining, when a company pays dividends, whether they are paid
out of current earnings or not. If not, the
company can only clear their claim by following certain procedure and paying a 15 per
cent tax. The department is desirous of devising a formula by which it will be able to
determine readily whether or not current
earnings are being used for payment of dividends when the control was acquired, say,
in 1951, 1952 or 1953. This formula has been
put forward, and it is an improvement on the
wording of the original (1) (f). It was
felt that the formula did not go far enough,
and in pursuance of the pressure put on the
minister he gave an undertaking in the
other place, which appears in Hansard of
June 18, at page 4237. He said:
I am told that this is a most complicated question.
It relates, of course, to the blocked surplus.

The statute calls it "designated surplus"that is, the surplus in the company at the
time control was acquired. As honourable
senators know, it was a common practice
in the past to buy the shares of a cornpany
and put them into a holding company. This
meant that one could quickly repay himself
for the purchase price of those shares.
If the company purchased had a large surplus,
tax free dividends could be declared.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: That has been done in
two or three cases.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I assure my friend that
it has been done in a great many cases. For
many years it was the practice of financiers
and aspiring financiers to get a "free ride"
in that way. That door is being partially
closed by the provisions of this bill, which
says, in effect: "You can still take that ride,
but it is going to cost you a minimum of 15
per cent," and at the same time, the department is going to be fussy about the element
of current earnings on any dividends paid to
make sure that there is no encroachment
upon that designated surplus. It is felt that
even now the provisions do not go far enough
in drawing the line fairly as between the
position of different classes of shareholders.
The minister goes on to say:
In order to effect what may be necessary it will
require two definitions, and they will have to
integrate the blocked surplus with dividends. It
has not been possible to work that out. I am
informed that the Department of National Revenue
are working on this problem and if, as was the case
in connection with other amendments, a suitable
solution is found we will make it applicable to the
same taxation period.

We have the undertaking of the minister
in that respect. Under the circumstances, I
do not think we can object much, as long
as the authorities are headed in the right

SENATE
direction and have the good will to go further
in order to accomplish their objective.
I turn next to section 9 of the bill, which
creates the new section 33A and contains
section 34 as amended. Under section 7 of
the Income Tax Act provision is made whereby the minister may decide what portions of
blended payments received are interest and
principal. He may single out the interest
element and assess the recipient for income
tax in a year in which it was received. It
may happen that such payments include an
accumulation of interest, and not interest
earned within that year. The rigid application of the provisions of section 7 of the Act
might work a hardship in some cases.
Section 33A, which is a new and relieving
section, has particular application to savings
contracts which may run three, four or five
years. Some contracts provide that members
of the plan are only entitled to receive
payments at the termination of the contract.
In such cases the interest portion would not
represent the interest earned in that year.
By section 33A provision is made whereby the
interest portion of such payments as may
reasonably be regarded as payments of interest in respect of a period of not less than three
years will be taxed over a three year period.
In other words, for income tax purposes the
taxpayer may have his interest return averaged over a period of three years, namely,
the year in which he receives the money and
the two preceding years.
Undoubtedly,
the taxpayer would benefit by such an
arrangement.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Did the senator say the
two previous years, or the two following
years?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: It is averaged over the
year in which the payment is made and the
two preceding years. However, the taxpayer
may elect to accept his responsibility under
section 7 of the Act. He is perfectly free to
make his own choice in the matter.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: May I ask a question
at this point? Would this provision apply to
the proceeds from an agreement for sale of
land or a mortgage on which nothing has been
paid for several years and upon which a large
payment is then made, a proportion of which
is interest? Such contracts usually stipulate
the date at which interest payments are to
be made, except in cases where the payments
are made by the delivery of wheat. In such
cases, called "bushel payment agreements
for sale", no interest content is shown, but
the department claims that part of the money
is interest. Would this new section apply to
such payments under a mortgage or agreement for sale as I have mentioned?

Hon. Mr. Hayden: This section would apply
to any payment, a portion of which could be
regarded as interest.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: May I ask my honourable friend this question? In the case of the
reorganization of a company in which interest
had been in default for many years, and as to
which the bondholders were getting something consisting partly of capital and partly
arrears of interest, would this new section
apply?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I do not know whether
it is that sort of case that the department
had in mind when it proposed this relieving
section, but section 7 of the Act is broad
enough to permit of taxing the interest content of a payment if the circumst'ances are
such as to show that there must be an interest
content in it. In the case you cite, where
there is an accumulation of interest arrears
on bonds, for instance, and a settlement is
'arrived at under which a payment is made,
if it can be concluded from all the circumstances that there is an element of interest
as well as capital in the payment, then the
provisions of this section would apply. Under
section 7 of the Act the entire interest portion
would be taxable in the year in which it was
received.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: As extra income?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Taxed as interest.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: But as extra income,

in the top bracket.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes, if the taxpayer happened to be in that position.
Section 34 is an interesting section.
Let us suppose, for instance, that a single
payment is made pursuant to a superannuation or pension plan, or a plan of retirement
from employment whereby the person can
get a lump-sum payment. In this case the
payment is not solely for the last year, in
which it is paid; it represents recognition
for all the years in which the employee has
been with his company. Section 34 contains
an amended provision which enables advantage to be taken of the average of the rate
of tax on the recipient in the year in which
the payment was received and the two previous taxation periods of full employment.
The relevant clause will be found on page 8,
paragraph (c), (i).
Hon. Mr. Aselline: That would not help
very much unless the rate of taxation was
going up rapidly.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Some person told me that
as between last year and this year there has
been a substantial increase in the rate of
taxation!

JUNE 21, 1951
Hon. Mr. isnor: Before the honourable
senator passes from section 34 (a) I wonder if
he would give us an example of the taxation
of a payment made to a valued employee who
has been in service for, perhaps, fifteen or
twenty years. In arriving at the tax would it
only be the salaries of the last two years that
would be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Let us assume that in
1951 the employee receives a lump-sum payment of $10,000. He has an option as to how
he will calculate his tax on that payment. He
can arrive at the amount of payment by
relating the aggregate of the tax for the last
year preceding the taxation year for which
he has received income from the office, and
that of the two immediately preceding years.
It might be that the lump-sum payment was
made between February and June of 1951.
First of all, he takes the last complete taxation year in which he worked, and the two
full years, immediately preceding, and arrives
at the payment in relation to the aggregate
of the taxes for those years. The average
gives the rate that would apply on that lump
sum. That, I take it, is the meaning of subsection (c), (i). It states:
The aggregate of the taxes otherwise payable by
the employee under this Part for the last year
(preceding the taxation year)
for which the
employee had an income from the office or employment and the two years immediately preceding
that year.

That is related to the aggregate of the
employee's income for those years. If he had
no other income the problem would be as
simple as I have stated it. If he had other
income he would arrive at the percentage
relationship of his tax by relating the taxes
on his income from his office or employment
for that period of three years over the
aggregate income for those three years, and
in that way would arrive at the factor that
would apply to the lump-sum payment.
The next section I will deal with is the one
which creates a joint liability. It is section 17,
and will be found on pages 11 and 12. A husband, for instance, may transfer property or
securities to his wife, or she to him, or either
of them to a minor. Under the law as it
exists at present the income from that property, or anything in substitution for it, or
from the securities, is the incorne of the
transferor. Under the new section the liability to tax in these circumnstances becomes
a joint and several liability of the transferor
and transferee. Let us say that a husband
transfers ail his property to his wife. Under
the law as it stands the husband is the one
who is liable for the tax; and of course if he
has parted with everything, he has nothing
with which to pay. So the deal has not been
80713-41

a bad one. But under the amendment proposed in this bill the lialbility to tax in relation to income from transferred property or
securities is a joint liability of both the transferor and the transferee. If the husband has
'other incone and transfers some property to
the wife, the joint liability would be greater,
because what he transferred to his wife
would go to the top of his own income, and
the liability to tax in respect of the transferred assets would be on the top part, not
on the bottom, and it would be a joint liability. The principle is to follow the people
instead of, as is often done in law, to follow
the assets, thus making the liability to tax
coextensive with the group within which the
property and securities are held.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Would action be taken
against both parties in the event of one of
the parties not making payments?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Oh, yes, they are liable
jointly and severally, which means that
either can be proceeded against for the full
amount.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Is not that principle
the same as applies in the case of the gift
tax, where either the donor or the donee is
liable if the other has not made payment?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes. Another point of
interest is that there have been a few
additions in conection with charitable foundations and trusts. It will be remembered that
exempting provisions in this ýconnection were
set up last year. The relevant section of this
bill is No. 20, which will be found on pages
13 to 15. A distinction has now been drawn
between corporations set up for charitable
purposes prior to the lst of January, 1940,
and those set up after that date. A corporation constituted for charitable purposes prior
to January 1, 1940, is not subject to the
requirement that it expend at least 90 per
cent of its yearly income in that year for
such purposes.
Organizations which have
been constituted since January 1, 1940, are
subject to that 90 per cent requirement if
they desire to benefit by the exemption provision. I suppose the actuating reason for this
change is that persons who set up corporations exclusively for charitable purposes prior
to January, 1940 are assumed to have been
motivated by truly charitable principles,
because tax rates then were considerably
lower than they are now, and there was, let
us say, less incentive for the creation of such
institutions. These amendments make it clear
how to determine what is the 90 per cent
that a corporation may pay out in a year
for charitable purposes. If the corporation
has received a gift and the donor who made
the gift has made it out of capital, say, and

SENATE
has not charged off, the gift as an expense
under the charitable deduction provision,
then it is not reckoned as part of the income
in arriving at the 90 per cent which the
corporation constituted after January, 1940,
must pay out in order to earn its exemption.
There is another amendment which allows
charitable corporations and trusts a reserve
equal to one year's income. If you incorporate a corporation today for charitable
purposes you would have no benefit of this
provision in the first year, but then when
you came to the second year you would be
permitted to set up out of your earnings a
reserve equal to one year's income.
There are one or two other items that I
want to mention. Section 19 of the bill deals
with refunds. Up to the present time there
has been no limitation on the time in which a
taxpayer might apply for a refund, but section 19 imposes a time limit. If the return of
a taxpayer's income for a taxation year has
made within two years from the end of the
taxation year, the taxpayer is permitted a
year of default before filing his return and
the minister may acknowledge the refund
without any application and send out a
cheque with the notice of assessment. Under
paragraph (b) of section 52 of the Act as
amended here, the minister shall make such
refund after mailing the notice of assessment
where application therefor has been made in
writing by the taxpayer within twelve months
from the day the overpayment was made or
on'the day on which the notice of assessment
was sent. That would appear to give hi
quite an ample period in which to gain some
idea as to whether or not he was entitled to a
refund. It is mainly in the interests of proper
operation and economy in administration that
the department is seeking to put some limit
upon the time within which a taxpayer may
apply for refund.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Is that not so on every
return?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: You mean the provision
of calling attention?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Yes. I think you show the
tax due and the amount paid to date, and
either a credit or a debit as the case may be.
Would the department accept that as a notice?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Not necessarily, because
the assessment has to govern for the reason
that a refund might develop as a result of the
assessment. That is to say, the department
might determine that you had made a return
against yourself, and in that case the refund
would be the result of the assessment.
I should call attention to the fact that the
department is prepared to pay more interest

on overpayment. You will remember that
the limitation was 2 per cent on amounts
up to $5,000, and half of one per cent over
that. You now get 2 per cent on overpayments, so it may be that there will be a
rush in the field of overpayment of taxes
in order to earn interest from an assured
source.
What is charged for
Hon. Mr. Isnor:
underpayments?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Six per cent.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: There are quite a number of other sections in the Act which deal
with corporation set-ups, and this hardy and
difficult thing of undistributed income, the
formula for which is contained in section
73(a), I think it is, of the Income Tax Act.
There are amendments proposed in this bill
for the purpose of clarifying the language
that was used when the section was first
brought in, and also to prevent, as the
wording in some instances might permit,
getting expense deductions twice.
Then there are sections which deal with
procedure on appeal to the Exchequer Court,
and so on. The new section will read as
follows:
An appeal to the Exchequer Court shall be instituted by serving upon the taxpayer or the Minister,
as the case may be, a notice of appeal in duplicate
in such form as may be determined by the rules, by
filing a copy thereof with the Registrar of the
Exchequer Court and, if the appeal is from the
Inccme Tax Appeal Board, by filing a copy thereof
with the Registrar of the Income Tax Appeal Board.

There are sections which give the power
by regulation to compel an employer to
furnish a T-4 return to his employee, and
penalties are provided for any violation.
There are a number of sections dealing
with administration, but I think we can
develop them more readily in committee. I do
not want you to think that these are all the
different things contained in the Act, but I
have in the course of my discussion extracted
the major problems which gave rise to the
amendments, and the problems which will
develop as a result of the amendments.
Knowing that this bill will be going to committee, there is nothing more I have to say
at this time.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I should like to congratulate the honourable senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) on his very clear
explanation of this most intricate and difficult bill.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I have read this bill
very thoroughly and I have found the

JtUNE 21, 1951
language most difficult to understand. Can
the honourable senator tell us why it is
necessary for any draftsman to use the
language which appears in this bill? Why not
use ordinary language which people can
understand?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Are you- voluntarily
suggesting the taking away of business from
members of your own profession by having
the language made too simple?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Oh, no. I find it very
difficult to understand the language that is
used in this Income Tax Bill, and that is the
reason why it takes a man of the ability of
the honourable senator from Toronto to
explain it.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: He has a good business
in it.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I do not wish to delay the bouse at this time,
but whenever I hear an Income Tax Bill
explained I am reminded of the story told
about the late President Coolidge of the
United States. It seems that he went to
Church one Sunday norning, and when he
came home his wife said to him "Well, Calvin,
what did the minister preach on?" The
President replied "Sin". His wife then said
"What did be say about it?", and the
President replied "He was 'agin' it." Well,
I am always "agin" income tax legislation.
There are few redeeming features about it.
As my honourable friend from Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) pointed out, the language
is so complicated that when the ordinary man
on the street reads it he gets so mixed up
that he says "I'll go and see my lawyer". So,
as a result we lawyers get quite a bit of
business from these people.
In the city of Winnipeg-I cannot speak
for any other place-we have been blest
during the years with three or four very able
administrators who had a large fund of
common-sense and tried to interpret the law
by common-sense methods. I can remember
three of them, of whom the present administrator is one. I could quote case after case
in support of my statement, and in each case
whether my client or the department won
out, both sides were apparently satisfied.
I listened carefully to the able explanation
of the bill by my honourable friend from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden), and like him I
cannot understand why a formula 'could not
be worked out to show the 5 per cent on
capital employed in a business. I have never
been able to understand why an income tax
statute could not set out certain fundamental
principles. I. was a member of the special
committee of the Senate which investigated
the income tax law and recommended that
the minister's discretionary powers be limited
80713-411

in certain cases. The reason we recomnedded
that was that the ordinary person is not able
to understand much of the law, and whenever a dispute arose the final decision rested
with the minister. Of course, the law has
been much improved in this respect, and the
appointment of the Income Tax Appeal Board
has provided much relief to taxpayers. I do
not mean only that taxpayers have been.
benefited financially, but they have received
satisfaction from the board's decisions. The
taxpayer now gets a fairer deal in this respect
than ever before.
I think we have got to spend a good deal
of time on this bill. The Senate has much
responsibility in dealing with a measure of
this kind. In my judgment it is most difficult
for a house of members elected by the people
to give all the time that should be given to
a Statute like this. It is easy to understand
why that is so. There is no political bias in
this statement of mine, but as I said at the
outset I am "agin" the bill. I hope the
leader of the government will be able to
arrange for a meeting of the Banking and
Commerce Committee at 8 o'clock this evening to begin dealing with the bill, and we
should be able to continue working on it
Monday and in that way have a thorough
investigation. Everyone of us here bas had
a great deal of experience with income tax
questions-for we have to deal not only with
our own problems but with those of people
who consult us. And I am referring now not to
lawyers alone, for all members of parliament
are questioned about these matters by peoplewho naturally think that as we .pass the laws,
we ought to understand them.
I candidly say that I see some improvements in this bill. Naturally I am not keenly
in favour of the 20 per cent increase in thetax, although I am rather inclined to agree
that the Minister of Finance adopted the best
possible course in increasing the tax by 20
per cent rather than by amending all the
schedules. I think he acted wisely there. Of
course if the war situation gets worse, or if
for any other reason our expenditures
increase greatly, it may be necessary to have
a general revision of the law. I am hoping
that this arrangement will be carried through,.
for it permits the least possible disturbance
to business in its estimation of the tax. I
say again that I hope the bill will be referred to committee for thorough discussion.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators, r
have one or two questions to ask, but before
putting them I wish to commend the senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) for his able
and lucid explanation of the bill. He made
clear to me at least many sections which
otherwise were not clear.

SENATE
I am pleased that there is an amendment
providing some concession for the so-called
gentleman farmer. I notice the amendment
is retroactive to 1949, so I myself may have
some rebate coming. Three years ago I
received from the taxation clerk a notice
asking for a further explanation of my losses
on the farm. I thought he was going too far
in asking me to explain why I had had losses
on the farm. I told him that the questions he
asked me were none of his business; that he
had better come out and give me some assistance, and then perhaps I could make a profit.
Referring to the section providing for
deductions for medical expenses, I think that
residents of British Columbia, who are now
compelled by provincial law to pay a hospital
tax, should be allowed to deduct this tax.
When one enters a hospital in that province
he shows the authorities his receipt for the
tax, and no matter how long he stays in
hospital he has to pay no bill. A man might
very well pay the tax for ten, fifteen or twenty
years without ever having to go to a hospital.
Of course he would be fortunate, but I am
dealing now with the taxation question only.
The province has found it necessary to
increase the tax year by year.
I also wish to mention paragraph (A) at the
foot of page 1 of the bill, which provides that
a taxpayer may deduct travelling expenses
when away from the municipality where his
employer's establishment is located or-this
is in paragraph (B), at the top of page 2 of the
bill-in the metropolitan area where the
establishment is located. In British Columbia
the words "city" and "municipality" are used
frequently and we know what they mean, but
there might be sorme doubt as to whether or
not the term "metropolitan area" could be
applied to any place within the province.
At any rate, that term is not defined in our
provincial statutes, and I would suggest that
in this bill the words "municipality, city or
metropolitan area" be used, so that no departmental officer may be able to say to a British
Columbia taxpayer claiming deduction for
travelling expenses "You may live in a city,
but the Act requires that to be eligible for the
exemption you must live in a municipality
or metropolitan area."
By way of illustration, may I mention a
situation that has arisen recently in British
Columbia? The Trans-Canada Highway enters
New Westminster by way of the Pattullo
Bridge. Under an arrangement with the
federal government, the provincial government is or should be entitled to 50 per cent
of the cost of construction of the bridge. The
provincial government has taken the stand
that only half of that bridge is within a
municipality, and the other half is within

the city. They draw a very fine line in that
case. We state that we should pay only 50
per cent, for the half of the bridge leading
into the municipality of Surrey. It is that
complication which prompts me to rise this
afternoon and call the attention of the house
to this matter. It seems to me that when the
bill is in committee some consideration should
be given to the insertion of the word "city".
I have two simple questions to ask. First,
why does the bill, at page 1, specifically
mention that an agent general of a province
shall receive a special allowance? Second, is
section 34, at page 23 of the bill, a new
section? It would seem to me that it gives
very wide powers to the minister, in that
he can by registered mail require a person
who has money coming to him from another
person to hand over the money to the tax
department. I know that such action is taken
within departments.
I was interested in a recent case in which
a destitute person had $250 coming to him
from a retirement fund. He wrote to me
requesting assistance. When I inquired about
the delay in paying this man his much needed
money, I was told that the Department of
Finance, to which he owed $300, had placed
a lien on his $250, and that he still owed
the department $50. I am of opinion that
the powers of the minister go too far, in that
he can require a person making payments
by registered mail to turn the monèy over
directly to the government rather than to
the man it is coming to.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: So far as garnisheeing
is con'cerned, I am sure my honourable friend
with his long experience in parliament knows
about the law. There is in the statutes an
Act called Debts Due to the Crown Act, under
which proceedings can be taken to attach
moneys owing by an employee of the government to some department of the government.
The section to which my friend refers in the
bill proposes to simplify the procedure of
collection of debts due the Crown. If this
section were deleted from the bill, there
would still be statutory power to take such
This section
action as my friend mentions.
creates a form of garnishment of money
coming to a taxpayer who happens to be
delinquent in his payments. In this field
one can never a'pply the principle of one case
to another because, in the matter of the
securing of revenue by way of income tax,
a person either owes it or he does not owe it.
In taking action under this section of the bill
providing for garnishment, the government
is not taking on any greater right than an
ordinary creditor would have to take proceedings in a province.

JtJNE 21. 1951
As to rny friend's question about an agent
general of a province qualifying for exemption when he bas a per diern allowance to
take care of his expenses while in. Ottawa,
that is only in addition to the existing law.
Under section 5 of the general Act an agent
general, officer or servant of a province is not
required to include, as part of 'his income an
allowance which he receives for living. As
the provinces f eel it necess*ary to have an
agent in Ottawa, the federal government
extends that concession to him while he must
be on duty in Ottawa, in the same way as if
he were absent from Canada. It is merely an
extension of the principle.
In reply to rny honourable friend's question
as to the confusion between a city and a
municipality, it had neyer occurred to me
that such would ever corne up. I arn sure
the senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) will agree that when we in Ontario
talk about municipalities we refer, for
instance, to the municipal corporation of the
city of Ottawa or the municipal corporation
of the city of Toronto. Municipalities are
created under the Ontario Municipal Act. If
there is a possibility of confusion, the terms
should be clarified.
Hon. A. W. floebucc: Honourable senators,
I s'hould like to compliment the senator. from
New Westminster <Hon. Mr. Reid) for raising
a question on section 34, which. deals with
garnishment. This provision is in the Act,
and I think it is an unconscionable one. It
provides for the garnisheeing of debts already
owing and for debts which. may be owing in
the future. No provincial law of garnishment
goes nearly that far.
As I understand the Act--excluding the
arnendrnents for the moment-the minister
may serve some sort of notice upon a creditor
or a prospective creditor requiring him to
pay to the tax collector such portion of the
debt as the minister may specify.
The
minister may specify the entire amount. I
know of actual cases in which ernployees
who owed money for income tax have had
notices served upon their employers garnisheeing their entire wages due and to fal
due, leaving thern without any income to live

on. I have on occasion protested successfully
against such action, and arrangements were
quickly made to ailow the employee to
receive sufficient to live on. There should
be some provision in this bill, as there is lin
provincial statutes ail over the country,
specifying how much can be garnisheed and
how much must be le! t to the debtor. I believe that the officiais who administer the
Act are reasonable men; I have found them te
be such, and perhaps they would flot stretch
their authority too far; but I think the bull
itself should make sorne provision whereby
a certain proportion of wages is le! t to the
labourer.
The motion was agreed ta, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Hugessen moved that the bull be
referred to the Standing Cornrittee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
NOTICE 0F COMMITTEE MEETING
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators
have before thern a notice o! a meeting of
the Standing Comrnittee on Banking and
Commerce to consider the Incorne Tax Bill
when the Senate rises today. As it is now
nearly 6 o'clock, I suggest that honourable
members might take this as a notice to meet
at 8 o'clock tonight, so that we may avoid
the formality of meeting now, and adjourning until this evening.
My attention has been directed to the fact
that in past years a stenographic report of
the proceedings of the Standing Committée onr
Banking and Commerce with regard to incorne tax has been made. If it is the wish
of the Senate to continue that practice I wil
make the necessary motion. I have not the
wording here, but the effect of the motlonL
would be that a stenographic report be kept
of the prooeedings of the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce in its examination of the bull to amend the Incarne Tax
Act. I s0 move.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until Monday, June
25, at 8 p.m.

SENATE

APPENDIX
Thursday, June 21, 1951
The Standing Committee on Finance to
whom was referred the estimates laid before
parliament for the fiscal year ending March
31st, 1952, have in obedience to the order of
reference of March 14, 1951, examined the
said estimates and now beg leave to report
as follows:The main estimates for government
expenditures in the present fiscal year that
began April 1st were given to the House of
Commons on March 12th, and to the Senate
a day or two later.
On March 14th the Senate adopted the
following resolution:
Order of Reference
That the Standing Committee on Finance
be authorized to examine the expenditures
proposed by the estimates laid before parliament for the fiscal year ending March 31st,
1952, in advance of the bills based on the
said estimates reaching the Senate: That
it be empowered to send for records of revenues from taxation collected by the federal,
provincial and municipal governments in
Canada, and records of expenditures by such
governments, showing sources of income and
expenditures of same under appropriate headings, together with estimates of gross national
production, net national income and movement of the cost-of-living index, and their
relation to such total expenditures, for the
year 1939 and for the latest year for which
the information is available, and such other
matters as may be pertinent to the examination of the Estimates, and to report upon the
same.
That the said committee be empowered to
send for persons, papers and records.
Prior to the Easter adjournment steps had
been taken to secure from the appropriate
government departments certain statistical
data which was available to your committee
when it resumed its work at the beginning of
May. An examination of this statistical data
was decided upon, to ascertain as far as
possible what effect government spending at
all levels of government had on the rising
cost-of-living, or in other words on the
inflationary pressures that produced these
rising costs.

With this end in view the committee examined the totals of proposed federal government expenditures for the current year and
noted the comparison of these expenditures
with the fiscal year ending March 31st, 1939,
which was taken as a base year.
The
expenditures in the fiscal years ending 1950
and 1951 were also compared with the expenditures proposed for the fiscal year ending
1952, shown in the estimates under consideration.
The data covering this is shown in Exhibit
1 appended to this report. This exhibit is a
summary of annual estimates by standard
objects of expenditures and special categories:
(a) The
expenditures
brought
about
through defence preparations are shown
under the heading of "National Defence and
Defence Production".
(b) For departments other than National
Defence and Defence Production, which can
be said to be the ordinary civilian expenses of
government.
(c) A combination of these under the heading of "Totals for all Departments".
Explanatory notes of each of these items
of expenditure are appended to Exhibit 1.
The increases in practically all departments
of our federal government, even measured in
1939 dollars, are very significant. They
should be a matter for concern and should
be clearly studied in relation to the problem
of taxation and the increasing burden on
our economy. An apparatus of government
whose costs increase more rapidly than the
increase in population and the production of
new wealth, can lead to serious dangers to
the state as a whole.
Exhibit 2 shows the combined revenues and
expenditures for all governments in Canada,
federal, provincial and municipal, for the
years 1939, again taken as a base year, and
for 1948 and 1949. There is included also
a similar preliminary estimate for 1950. It
is important to point out here that the statement of revenues does not include intergovernmental-transfers.
For example, the
federal government pays statutory subsidies
to the provinces and substantial sums under
the fiscal agreements with the provinces who
rented their right to collect income and corporation taxes to the federal authority.
Your committee desires to draw special
attention to this statement, Exhibit 2. It

JUNE 21, 1951
indicates the sources from which revenues
are secured by each of the levels of government and also the purposes for which
the revenue thus secured is expended. For
illustration, it indicates the cost of servicing
the over-all public debt of Canada, which
increased from approximately 264 million
in 1939 to over 492 million in 1949, and is
now more than 500 million. Almost all
of this increase was due to the expenditures
incurred in the second world war. It also
indicates the great increase in social service
expenditures over the sane period in the
country's progress to the ideal of the welfare
Under this heading the increase,
state.
exclusive of soldiers pensions and care, was
from approximately $208 million to over
$800 million in 1949. This type of expenditure continues to increase.
Exhibit 3 is a statement of national income
and gross national product in each year from
1939 to 1950, with a few explanatory notes.
It is important here to draw a distinction
between gross national product and net
national income. Gross national product is
the gross income of all the people of Canada
from al sources, which can be compared to
the gross income of a business corporation
or a farmer or a labouring man. To arrive
at the net national income certain deductions
must be made from the gross product. In the
course of a year machinery employed has
to be depreciated in value because it may
become out of date, or because ordinary
wear and tear makes it less valuable at the
end of the year than at the beginning of the
year. The sane thing is true of houses and
automobiles. When all of these and similar
charges are put together they are deducted
from the gross product and the result may
be described as the net national income.
From this total of national income of all the
people in Canada their total living expenses
have to be deducted and since Canadians
enjoy a high standard of living this amount
is the major item. In. the second place,
from the national income of ail the people in
Canada there has to be deducted the amount
they pay in taxes to their various governments. Broadly speaking, what is left is the
volume of savings, from which expansion
and further development takes place, which
may be invested in life insurance policies
or annuities or retained by individual Canadians as a provision against a rainy day. It
is a matter for concern that in the past few
years personal savings have shown a rather
marked tendency to decline in volume. In

his recent budget speech the Finance Minister drew attention to the importance of this
matter of personal savings in the following
words.
It is ta the interest. of every Canadian to make
the maximum effort ta save, or to increase.the level
of his saving, as a direct contribution to the avoidance of inflation and the successful prosecution of
the defence program. The money saved can be
used ta buy Canada savings bonds, or ta pay off
the mortgage on his house or farm more rapidly,
or ta speed up the repayment of other debts, or ta
increase his savings in any other form that suits his
individual circumstances. The important thing is
ta achieve an increase in aggregate saving up ta a
level at least equal ta the new capital investment
which we shall have ta make this year.

Your committee considered it of first
importance that individual Canadians as far
as possible get a clear understanding of what
this means. If individual Canadians spend
their substance foolishly or unwisely, if they
are lazy and thriftless, without any doubt
they create problens for themselves and for
If governments, in
their governments.
response to public pressures, spend money
foolishly or unnecessarily, they put heavier
burdens on taxpayers and create political
discontent and unrest. If political parties
try to rival each other, in promises to the
electorate, seeking in this way to gain political support, they are doing a real disservice
to our country. The easy road is rarely a
wise or prudent one to follow. Scarcely a
week passes without some group of people,
or some organization, pressing upon some
government, somewhere in Canada, some
project for spending more public money.
The result of this is that we have reached a
stage in practically all levels of government
in Canada where those in authority are seeking some new tax, hidden or unhidden,
through which they can meet the demands
made upon them. This course, if persisted in,
is fatal to our well being as a people.
As a result of much loose talking and
superficial thinking, the notion has grown
alarmingly in the minds of a great many
people that governments get their money in
some mysterious fashion; that part of the
responsibility of governments is to solve the
problems of communities and individuals
which these communities and individuals
should solve for thenselves. In this way
individual self-reliance and initiative is
undermined. The wilderness which a few
hundred years ago was the Canada we know
today was not developed in this way.
In the judgment of your committee the
steady grawth that has been apparent now
for quite a number of years, of dependence
upon the state, can lead. to only one of two
results: Either in a steady increase in the
power of the state over the- rights of the
citizens, or the breakdown of democratic

SENATE
representative government as we have understood it and practised it in the past. The
lessons of history in this respect are clear for
all to read.
In Exhibit 4 is given a table of the number
of civil service employees of the Government
of Canada, again taking 1939 as a base year
and giving the numbers for the years 194849-50-51. A cool examination of this table
will convey an idea of the growth in government services. It was of course inevitable
during the war years that there would be
great expansion in the number of government
servants, but one could have hoped that in the
years following the war, and especially five
years after the war was over, that the number
would have diminished. Instead of this there
has been a steady expansion. Your committee
had not the data available of the trends in
this respect at other levels of government of
Canada, that is provincial and municipal, but
it believes that these other levels of government would show quite substantial increases
also.
Exhibit 5 shows the movement of the costof-living index. This index has shown an
alarming increase since the end of World
War II. It is the visual evidence of inflationary processes that are working in the Canadian economy. This condition is not alone the
experience of Canada. It is a problem that
is met with today in every democratic country
in the world. The cause of this inflation can
be stated briefly as too much spending against
too few goods. There is no doubt that the
methods necessary in financing World War II
created tremendous inflationary pressures.
This has been the experience of all wars of
any magnitude; but because World War II
was world wide in the incidence of the
struggle, these pressures were generated on
a scale never before experienced; and the
reason is simple. War is a terribly destructive
thing in its effect on any economy. It creates
tremendous expansion of credit and money
and democratic peoples have not yet learned
the lessons of the great dangers inherent in
this, and lack the self-discipline necessary to
get back again on to solid ground. Moreover,
it must be said that the financial policies
followed by governments since the end of the
war were not always wisely directed to bring
this lurking menace under effective control.
During the war all economic activities
rightly were directed to winning the war; but
this process continued over four years created
an immense void throughout the world for
consumer goods of all kinds. There was
superimposed upon this, greatly expanded
social welfare expenditures. In other words,
payments by governments out of their
treasuries for social welfare budgets of one
kind and another. Your committee is not

discussing here the necessity or otherwise of
these expenditures; but it ventures to say
that their effect in producing additional inflationary pressures cannot be successfully
challenged.
Another important point may be noted
here. If labour costs rise, without an equivalent increase in production per unit of labour,
these increased costs are almost always added
to the cost of goods or services, and thus in
effect are inflationary. As at end of May the
cost of living had increased 82 per cent in
the last twelve years. The general index for
wages, according to a recent release from the
Minister of Labour, stood at 225.5 for April
1951, compared with 100 in 1939. The Finance
Minister in his recent budget speech stated
"Statistics and charts in the white paper I
have tabled indicate that there has been no
measurable increase in per capita productivity during the past five years". It would
thus appear that the increase in productivity
that has taken place, has been due almost
wholly to the increase in the labour force at
work. If wages rise without a corresponding
increase in productivity the effect of this is
bound to be infla-tionary on prices. No solution can be found in prices chasing wages
and wages chasing prices in a dizzy spiral
that has already reached a dangerous height.
Business corporations large and small and
business concerns of individuals seek to protect themselves against rising costs, whether
from labour costs or government taxes of
various kinds, by putting them into the price
the consumer pays.
The extent of this inflation can be
measured in another way. In 1950 our gross
national production reached almost eighteen
billion dollars. Measured in terms of 1939
dollars, it would have been slightly less than
ten billions. This indicates how inflation can
deceive us and distort the perspective of our
economy. There can be no doubt that the
inflation that bas taken place in our economy
in recent years is a very serious thing. A
rising inflation in a country's economy is like
a deadly unknown virus in the bloodstream
of an individual. When inflationary pressures
are at work it is of vital importance that
Governments, at all levels, practice the most
rigid economy and above all avoid going
further into debt. There is little point in their
urging individual citizens to economize if
they do not themselves set a good example.
Your committee pays a compliment to the
Minister of Finance for the warning he gave
in his budget speech on the grave dangers
that are lurking, unsuspected by the vast
majority of Canadians, in these inflationary
processes that are at work. The white paper
given to parliament at the time the budget

JUNE 21, 1951
speech was delivered gave a vast amount
of very useful, information to parliament.
Any member of parliament, or any other
citizen who studies it, can get a fair knowledge of the working of the Canadian
economy. Difficuit as it may be for the people
in a democratic society to interest themselves
in this matter, a clear understanding of it
is vital to, the maintenance of our so-called
way of Ie.
In bis budget Speech the Finance Minister
indicated his expectation that our gross
national product in the present fiscal year
would be about twenty billion dollars. This
should give a net national income of at least
sixteen billion dollars. The information
given your committee indicates that expenditures of all governments, federal, provincial
and municipal this year will be over five
billions.
In other words, approximately
one-third of the net national income of all
Canadians will be paid to their governments
in taxes. Here the big item of increase is
of course the increased. defence expenditures,
which, in the state of the world today, cannot be avoided. As a result of this heavy
load of taxation, combined with the high
standard of living we are endeavouring to
maintain. as a people, the volume of savings
out of which new development must take
place, as already lndicated, is shrinking i
an alarniing way. The stern necessity rests
upon governments and upon individual
Canadian citizens in these dangerous days
through which we are passing to economize
in their expenditures. The people must be
encouraged to build up their savings. The
proposed pension legislation that everyone
appears to be clamouring for, will probably
add four hundred million dollars to our total
of expenditures, and the greater part of this,
for many years to come, will have to be met
out of current production. No one can
accurately forecast the future, but we do
know that the grim depression of the thirties
was set in motion by the collapse of an
inflationary boom present in the world for
the previous eight or ten years. There is no
question that the Canadian economy cannot
avoid being profoundly affected by what
happens in other countries and especially
today i the United States. The uncertainty
of what lies ahead Is the strongest possible
reason to guard against building an edifice
of fixed expenditures which, if dark days
should corne upon us, our economy could not
possibly carry.
It is important that the Canaclian people
realize that inflation, in -the sense of its
impact upon our dally living and the uncertainty and fear it generates as to what may
happen i the future, can have a paralyzing
effect flot only on our economy, but as wel
80713--42

upon the steadiness of thinking in the inidividual citizen, thaît is the mainspring of what
we describe as our democratic way of 111e.
We need a clear understanding that this
danger if allowed to proceed unchecked will
bring serious and grave biardships to humdred-s of thousands of our people. It thus
becomes the duty of every citizen to do, 'as far
as he can, his part in combating it. To that
end he must understand that an increase ini
our savings and an increase in production of
goods and services is a vltally important
matter.
Most hunian beings would like to maintain
or increase their standard of living by working fewer hours per day, or week or month,
and at the same time increase the returne
they get for their contribution to, our Society.
But if an individual works fewer hours per
week and does not produce the same volume
of product that he produced working longer
hours per week, and If 'he gets a higher
monthly return for this reduoed- volume of
production, then, without any question pnices
will, tend to rise and thus the fiames of inflation are fcd and grow. And if any section of
our community increases the share it gets
out of the total productive eff ort then some
other section of the community has of necessity ta take less. It is a lamentable fact that
-the worthy citizens who tried to proteet theïr
future needs by saving, by 11f e insurance or
annuities, are today the people Who are
suffering most grievously, for the simple
reason that inflation has produced a condilion where the income derived from savinM
or life insurance or annuities buys 1ittle more
than hall of the things it would bave bought
twelve years ago. Year by year 'his position
has been growing worse. Suggestions have
been made týhat governrnents can control "u
by taking full and ample power to direct end
supervise the day to day living of the orduinary citizens. Russia is probablY the supreme
exanple today of this kind of govemrnment
control. Here criticism of the government is
forbidden. The press can publish only what
the govemument ordains. Freedomn of speech,
freedom of wrorship, indeed freedom in any
of its aspects disappears. The state as represented. in the few people who govern li,
becomes the all-powerful agent. Initiative,
self-reliance and ail other virtues we aissdlate with high character in, the individuel
disappear and the human family i such a
state sinks gradually and inexorably to Iower
and lower levels, spiritually and materiafly.
These rnay be regarded as stroing worde
and not appropriate for a report of this Idnd,
but your coninittee, f eels that they are facts
that should be pondered and weigbed by
every citizen. Governments of course have

SENATE
their special responsibilities. They are the
ones to whom people look for leadership.
The people also have their responsibilities and
the most important is that they do not press
their governments into unwise policies and
Indeed, they have
unwise expenditures.
another responsibility, and that is through
the agencies of the press and public opinion
to check and admonish governments w'hen
they pursue unwise policies or unwise
expenditures.
Your committee suggests that the government should keep to the lowest point possible
all capital expenditures of every kind excepting those essential to defence, to provide the
minimum of housing necessary and those
expenditures that are normally directed to
increasing the production of goods and services required by the Canadian people.
Where expenditures are made on any of these
items, including defence spending, efficiency
and conomy consistent with attaining the end
in view should be the watchwords guiding
them.
Your committee would suggest further
that the federal government, as the senior
government, should seek the co-operation of
the provincial and municipal governments to
adopt this same policy. It is true that these
governments are largely sovereign in their
own spheres of government, but we venture
to say that their assistance should be sought
and, in as large a measure as possible,
secured.
Your committee concludes its report with
this observation. In its judgment no finer

body of citizens exist in any country than is
to be found in Canada. The proof lies in
what they have achieved in the eighty years
since the scattered colonies that then existed
in what is now Canada were brought together
in one confederation. In this eighty odd
years half a continent has been developed.
The necessary organs of government have
Educational opportunities
been created.
through the development of schools and universities have marched forward with the
needs of the people. Our standard of living
is as high as in any country in the world,
measured by the indices that measure a
standard of living. No country in the world
provides greater opportunities to the young
and daring. The virtues of self-reliance and
initiative and sympathy and forbearance, and
a sense of justice andc fair play have made
the Canadian people what they are today.
One of the supreme responsibilities of all
governments is to exercise wisely their power
and influence to maintain and further
develop these virtues, for the character of a
nation is but the sum total of the character
of its citizens.
Your committee wishes to express its
thanks to the witnesses who appeared before
it for the assistance they gave the committee
in carrying out its work.
All of which is respectfully submitted.
T. A. CRERAR,
Chairman.

SENATE

Since Confederation parliament has been
hearing divorce petitions, which have always
been launched in the Senate. During that
whole time only a few cases have been
thrown out in another place, indeed such a
small number of cases that one can hardly
recall them. That indicates, it seems to me,
what great care must have been taken by the
Senate committee in its work. It has been
my privilege to practise in the courts of the
province of Saskatchewan, and I have
appeared in a number of divorce actions
there. We proceed a little differently, by
way of writ of summons and statement of
claim, and so on, but in general the procedure is similar to that which is followed
by the Senate committee. We follow the
same rules of evidence as are followed in the
provincial courts. By way of a check-up on
our procedure, one of my enthusiastic
colleagues on the committee, the senator
from Huron-Perth (Hon. Mr. Golding),
inquired when divorce cases would be heard
in Ottawa before a judge of the Supreme
Court of Ontario, and he attended the court.
Perhaps he was a little prejudiced, but on his
return he told me that he thought we did a
better job than the court.
I mention some of these matters, honourable senators, because of the discussion that
has recently taken place in another part of
this building. I should like the house to know
is very
Committee
that the Divorce
conscientious in its duties. It goes into the
facts thoroughly, and there is seldom disagreement among the members as to the
disposition of a case.
I would remind honourable senators that
the Divorce Committee commenced its hearings at the end of the first week of the present
session. When that week's work was completed, the bills were reported, and with the
evidence were sent to the other house. The
same procedure was repeated during the
weeks following, until the Easter recess, by
which time we had disposed of nearly 200
cases. But what did they do with the bills
in the other place? They piled them up in
a corner, and did not consider them until
there was an accumulation of two or three
hundred, and then they began to ask questions about them. That is when the trouble
arose.
If this work must continue to be done by
parliament, I would suggest that some
arrangement should be made whereby these
bills, when they are received by the other
place, will be dealt with promptly. In that
way the spectacle of two or three hundred
divorce bills being passed at the end of the
session would be avoided.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: An allegation that has
frequently been made is that the children
of divorced parents are neglected. I should
like honourable senators to know that in 75
per cent of the cases heard by us there are
no children. For instance, I recall one morning when in eight out of ten petitions the
parties had no children. The fact they were
childless is in my opinion one of the main
reasons why they were before the committee.
In other cases the children have grown up
and left home, and the parents are anxious
In still other
te rehabilitate themselves.
cases, where there are young children, we
find that 99 times out of 100 they are better
off after the divorce is granted than they
were before. We inquire into the maintenance and education of children and, as I say,
we usually find that they are better off after
their parents have been divorced. But even
if there is a problem arising from the fact
that there are children, we can do nothing
about it; for custody of children, alimony and
costs are provincial matters, over which the
Parliament of Canada has no jurisdiction.
When one of the parties to a parliamentary
divorce wishes to secure custody of the children, be or she is obliged to take action in
the courts of the province.
For the information of the house I shall
enumerate the items that go to make up the
cost to a resident of Quebec of having an
uncontested bill of divorce passed by parliament. First, a solicitor has to be employed
in Quebec to prepare the petition; then there
is a fee of $210 for filing the petition. The
petition is served by a process server, and an
Ottawa agent who has to be paid is usually
employed. The evidence has to be gathered,
at a cost of perhaps $100 or $200 and the
petition has to be advertised in an English
and a French newspaper at a cost of, in some
cases, $125.
Hon. Mr. Haig: And, there is advertising in
the Gazette.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The Canada Gazette?
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: Yes; in an English and

a French newspaper, and in the Gazette.
When these preliminaries have taken place,
a lawyer, usually from Montreal or Quebec
City, has to come to Ottawa with the witnesses, and the petitioner has to pay their
conduct money and expenses. When the case
is concluded-even an undefended case-the
cost will run as high as $700 or $800.
If parliament desires to do anything to
help the cause of those seeking divorce in
Quebec, I think it should do so. From time
to time I have made suggestions. Houourable
senators will recall that some years ago I,
made the suggestion that the whole matter

JUNE 25:, 1951
of divorce should be taken out of the hands
of parliament. and passed over to the Exchequer Court of Canada. The arguments
against it were that the Exchequer Court,
being a federal court, had no jurisdiction
over alimony or the custody of children.
Such a transfer would have brought about
at least a partial solution of the problem,
and would have resulted in an improvement
of the situation we have now. But nothing
came of my suggestion.
A further suggestion that I made was that
an official, in the nature of a King's Proctor,
should be appointed, who would occupy the
position of a judge. The petition would be
filed in the usual way, and the preliminary
steps would be taken; then this official would
hear the evidence and decide whether or
not a bill should be recommended. He would
report to the Divorce Committee of the
Senate, which would act in the capacity of a
court of appeal, with power to adopt or to
reject a report. If the reports were adopted,
bills would go through their several readings
and be passed by this house, and then go to
the other place. However, I have been told
that this arrangement would not be feasible.
So, in so far as arriving at any real solution
of the problem, I am at a loss to suggest
anything short of the setting up of a divorce
court in the Province of Quebec, an arrangement that seems to be contrary to the wishes
of the majority of the people in that province, and which I for one do not wish to
force upon them.
Honourable senators will recall the Divorce
and Matrimonial Causes Bill, known as the
McMeans Bill, which was introduced in this
chamber in 1938. I seconded the motion for
its adoption, and spoke in support of it. After
a long debate the bill was passed in this
house by a majority of some twenty-five or
twenty-seven, and went to the other place;
but in that house it received only first reading, and therefore was killed. The bill, in
my opinion, was an admirable one. The
framers sought to remodel our law to conform
with the laws of Britain by adding certain
grounds for divorce other than adultery.
Among these were long-continued desertion,
incurable insanity and 'habitual drunkenness.
It also has been suggested that a royal
commission be appointed to investigate the
problem: but nothing has been done. A
prominent Canadian authority on divorce,
Mr. Kent Power, of Calgary, has recently
written a very valuable book on the subject.
If ever a royal commission should be
appointed to investigate the matter, I believe
he would be an excellent person to appoint
to that body.

I have now covered, I believe, all the
points I wish to mention. But perhaps I may
be allowed a few moments to explain my
personal position. It may be remembered
that about this time last year I stated quite
emphatically that I would not be able to
continue as chairman of the committee. I
intended to remain firm in that decision, but
about November or December last letters
began to come in from members of the
committee urging me to reconsider my
decision. I did not answer any of these communications; but when I returned to Ottawa
I found that during the recess our honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson) had not
followed my suggestion, and that no one had
been nominated to take my place. Under
pressure, therefore, I decided to continue as
chairman until the Easter recess. By that
time some two hundred cases had been disposed of. But another hundred were ready
for hearing-the necessary advertising had
been done, the petitioners had paid their
fees-and it was felt that they should not be
penalized because of my wish to resign, so
after the recess we continued to sit on
Mondays and Fridays until practically all
the outstanding cases had been dealt with.
I want to thank the members of the committee, and specifically the legal members,
Senators Fogo, Campbell, Farris and Roebuck,
for their assistance and co-operation in this
work. In no chamber the world over, I am
sure, could a more faithful committee be
found. Their work has been exemplary, and
most of the ime they have agreed with my
decisions, so of course my opinion of them
could hardly be higher! I want to thank them
one and all for their support.
Let me also express thanks to the Chief
Clerk of Committees and his assistants. No
one in this chamber bas any idea of the
amount of work that devolves upon them in
connection with these cases. All petitions
must be examined, affidiavits of service prepared, and notices sent out; and they must
see to it that every petition is in proper
form before it can be dealt with. They work
long hours, and they work very faithfully.
I wish to thank them also for their
co-operation.
Perhaps I have already said too much,
but I want to voice the hope that a movement-some call it a filibuster-which was
started in the other place, and various representations on this matter which have been
made in both houses, will have some tangible
results; that something will shortly be done.
It may not be practicable to effect a change
this year; probably the Divorce Committee
will be required to function again in 1952;

SENATE

but perhaps by the end of next year this
disagreeable work will have been taken out
of the hands of parliament.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Thomas Reid: May I be permitted to
say a word or two about the report which
has just been presented? First, however, as
one of the newer members, may I compliment
very highly the honourable senator from
Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) and the members of his committee. Particularly I would
congratulate the honourable senator from
Rosetown upon his splendid report. I believe
some honourable senators share my opinion
that in the matter of divorce the work of the
Senate Committee is as good as, if not better
than, that of the judges who in various provinces deal with such questions. I believe it
has come to be generally recognized how
well the committee conducts its business.
The evidenýce is considered by a group of
able men, assisted by capable lawyers, and
the cases are handled with great ability. Last
week, in reading the proceedings on one of
these petitions, I was agreeably surprised to
note that when the lawyers in attendance
were asked whether in all their experience
they had known of the same woman appearing in more than one case as a witness, both
lawyers said, no.
Hon. Mr. Golding: They were detectives.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I mention that because in
some countries-Great Britain is one-witnesses can be hired to provide evidence in an
action for divorce. I think we can take a
great deal of pride in the way our Divorce
Committee conducts its business, and I think
some publicity should be given to the statement made by the detectives that they knew
of no woman appearing as co-respondent in
more than one investigation.
As has been stated, no action has been
taken to relieve the Senate of its obligations
in this matter. I believe I can put my finger
on the reason. I speak from long years of
experience in the House of Commons. I doubt
whether any veteran commoner would expect
for one minute that a bill to establish a
divorce court for Quebec would pass the other
house. I think this situation is similar to the
one that arose when we endeavoured to find
a district national flag for Canada. Everyone
knows that this was a great desire of the late
Prime Minister, the Right Honourable
Mackenzie King. As one who sat on the
committee dealing with that question, I know
something of the difficulties that were
encountered in trying to make a choice of a
flag. Finally the Prime Minister realized that
if he were to put the proposal to the Commons it would never pass.

We might as well face the facts and carry
on. We know that a bill to set up a divorce
court for Quebec would never pass the House
of Commons. Those who are against divorce
would not vote for such a measure, and those
with their ears to the ground for votes, would
receive so many letters from people opposed to
the idea that they would hesitate about geting up in their places and voting for it. I
challenge anyone to successfully contradict
what I have just said.
I want to compliment the members of the
Divorce Committee on the .capable manner in
which they have carried out their duties. The
honourable senator for Rosetown (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) has suggested that perhaps we could
reduce expenses by cutting down on the bills.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No, I had reference to

the printing of evidence.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I would correct myself then.
I took it that you were referring to the bills.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: No.

I am advised that

the printing of these reports costs about
$30,000 a year, and it seems to me that this
is a waste of money.

Hon. Mr. Reid: I agree with you in that.
As a result of certain correspondence I
have received, I want to ask the honourable
gentleman from Rosetown if he can tell us
the religious affiliations of those who have
been granted divorces by parliament this
year? As honourable senators are probably
aware, a filibuster took place in the other
house over certain bills which were presented
in the short time set aside for private bills.
This filibuster spread to the divorce bills,
and the newspapers across the country gave
the matter undue publicity. As a result
many citizens across the country are asking
questions about parliamentary divorce proceedings. I wonder if the honourable senator
from Rosetown could answer my inquiry?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: What was the question?

Hon. Mr. Reid: What are the religious
affiliations of those receiving parliamentary
divorces?
Hon. Mr. Aselline:

I cannot give you an

accurate figure; but I have made a day-today check, and I would say that about 25
per cent are Roman Catholics, and of the
remainder two-thirds are Protestant and onethird Jewish.
Hon. John T. Haig:

On behalf of those

honourable senators who do not serve on the
Divorce Committee, I want to congratulate
the members of that committee for the
splendid manner in which they have carried
out their duties. I want to pay special tribute

JUNE 25, 1951
to my deskmate (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), who
has been performing these duties now for
many years.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Eighteen.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I doubt whether he likes
the work. I have been urging him to be
more active in other committees but he is
like the man aboard ship, who when a fire
is blazing has to help put it out. I am hoping
that some of the other lawyer members will
get to be as good at the work of the committee as he has been. Members of this
house need not be the slightest bit afraid of
any criticism that the Senate Divorce Committee is not doing a capable job. Except for
the present chairman, I am the only member
of the house who was ever Chairman of the
Divorce Committee. At one time when I
was a member of the committee the chairman of that day died. There was a case
that had to be heard, and .as I was the only
lawyer-member on the committee who was
present, there was no other possible choice,
and I was chairman for one day. I heard
one case, and the next day I resigned. But
I know how a chairman should act and,
speaking as a lawyer, I maintain that the
manner in which the Senate Committee
handles divorces will stand up in comparison with that of any court in Canada.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: In the courts there is only
one judge, but on the Senate committee
there are at least three. While perhaps only
one member is a lawyer, the others possess
a lot of ardinary common sense, and in a
contested case have a good idea who is lying.
When members of the other house criticize
the way in which divorces are handled by
the Senate Divorce Committee they should
be invited to attend our hearings. I venture
to say that if they did attend, not one of
them would ever raise his voice again in
criticism.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Wishar McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, in the past when the final report of
the Senate Divorce Committee has been presented I have expressed my very great appreciation of the services rendered by the chairman and the other committee members in the
discharge of their duties. Once again I repeat
that I appreciate more than I can say the
willingness with which the chairman undertook his onerous responsibilities. As honourable senators are aware, I have nothing to do
with nominating the chairmen of the various
Senate committees. If I have ever exercised
any influence, it has been to see that the name
of the honourable senator from Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) was included on the list
80713-43

of members of the Divorce Committee,
because I always knew that in its organization meeting the committee would deal with
him, the gentleman from Rosetown, as they
saw fit.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I am not in a position
to say whether some other procedure will be
adopted for the handling of parliamentary
divorce cases. The matter has been discussed
a great deal from year to year, but, as was
said by the senator from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid) great difficulties apparently
stand in the way of any change from the
present system. As long as that system is
maintained, it will be our duty to discharge
as best we can the responsibilities placed on
our shoulders. What the future has to offer,
no one knows, but I am sure that as long as
our Divorce Committee is headed by my
honourable friend from Rosetown (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) and composed of members as able
as its present personnel, the committee's work
will be well and creditably done.
Hon. William H. Golding: Honourable
senators, I would not want this opportunity to
pass without expressing my appreciation of
and my thanks to the honourable senator
from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) for having
taken on again this session the duties and
responsibilities of Chairman of the Divorce
Committee. In his remarks he mentioned
that last fall he received letters from some
members of the committee, urging him to
reconsider his announced decision to continue
no longer as Chairman. I may say frankly
that I was one of those who wrote to him at
that time. I think I can say for all members
of the committee that we feel quite comfortable and at ease when our honourable friend
is presiding at our meetings, for he has had
long experience and is well acquainted with
all the rules and regulations relating to
divorce questions. He is firm in his attitude
towards lawyers and others, and as a result
we get our work done well and very efficiently. I am hoping he will be our Chairman
again next session, and I suggest that if those
who have the responsibility of nominating
members of committees leave his name on the
list of members of the Divorce Committee,
there will be no question as to who will be
chosen as Chairman. I did want to take this
opportunity of expressing my thanks and
appreciation to my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators, I
wish to thank honourable members for the
very kind remarks they have made about me
and the other members of the committee. I
wish to be relieved from serving on the committee, and I hope that when next year rolls

around someone else will have been found to
take my place. As we know, no man is so
important that he cannot be replaced by a
better man.

agreements with two other Western provinces,
it was suggested that if possible I, who moved
second readings and explained the bills,
should obtain from the Department of Finance
information as to how the provincial governments had invested the school land funds.
Immediately afterwards I saw the Honourable Mr. Abbott, Minister of Finance, about
the matter. He expressed reluctance to ask
the provincial governments for this information, but he said he would take it under conHe
sideration and telephone me today.

CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAY COMPANY (SHERRIDON TO LYNN LAKE)
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. John C. Davis moved the second
reading of Bill 376, an Act respecting the

construction of a line of railway by Canadian National Railway Company from Sherridon to Lynn Lake, in the province of
Manitoba.
He said: Honourable senators, it may seem
somewhat peculiar that at this time we should
be considering the construction of any addition to the lines of the Canadian National
Railways. As the title indicates, the purpose of this bill is to authorize the construction of a railway by the Canadian
National Railway Company from Sherridon
to Lynn Lake, Manitoba, a distance of one
hundred and fifty-five miles. This line is
necessary to give access to a fair-sized body
of strategic metal-nickel.
Nickel, like molybdenum and chromium, is
useful as a metal itself but is principally
useful as an alloy with other metals to give
strength, resistance to corrosion, chemical
action and high heat effect. It has an increasing usefulness in the manufacture of the
engines of destruction wnich, through no fault
of ours, we now have to use in our endeavour
to survive. These alloy metals not only enter
into the engines of destruction themselves,
but into the materials of their manufacture
and operation.
Within the past eight or nine years Sherritt
Gordon Mines Limited have spent more than
$6 million on prospecting and development,
and have located a body of nickel-bearing ore
about 120 air miles north of the position of
the old Sherritt Gordon Mine. This body of
ore contains about 14 million tons above the
1,700-foot level, and the ore bodies are still
open at both ends.
Up ta the present time about 90 per cent
of world nickel requirements have been
obtained from one site in the Dominion of
Canada, namely at Sudbury. It has been
judged desirous that other sites 'be opened up.
The only means of access to the body of
nickel in question is by construction of this

JUNE 25, 1951
branch line of the Canadian National Railways from Sherridon. The bill does not set
out the facts of the development of this ore
body; it is simply a measure to authorize the
Canadian National Railways to borrow $10
million for the construction of the line.
Honourable senators will note that the
estimated cost of construction is $14,725,000.
An arrangement has been made with the
Department of Defence Production to supply
the remaining $4,725,000. Further, a contract
has been entered into between the Canadian
National Railways and the Sherritt Gordon
Mines Limited for the operation andt development of the mine. The Sherritt Gordon
Company undertakes to build a mill at the
site, which is 155 miles from the present railhead; to develop the mine; hoist 2,000 tons
a day; employ only Canadian National Railways for inbound and outbound freight
traffic; build a refinery at Edmonton; and in
general conduct an operation to make available this metal, which is vitally needed for
defence purposes, not only to Canada but to
other countries of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
In addition to the $5 million or $6 million
already spent by the Sherritt Gordon Company, there will be an expenditure by
Sherritt of about $33 million. Arrangements
have been completed for the financing of this
amount, and the 'company is ready to undertake the operation immediately. Time is of
the essence. The surface buildings, the shaft
and the hoist apparatus are to be completed
in order to commence operations by November 1, 1953.
Many of the buildings and much of the
equipment will be moved by tractor-train
from Sherridon to Lynn Lake, and the railway will definitely be needed by November 1,
1953.
The contract between
the Canadian
National Railways and the Sherritt Gordon
Company calls upon the company to ,pay the
railway the sum of $350,000 per year for a
period of twenty years. On the assumption
of a daily tonnage of 2,000 tons for a period
of twenty years, the Canadian National Railways, using a 31 per -cent amortization and
depreciation figure, have arrived at the sum
of $244 thousand as gain-not profit-over
each of those years. Therefore, with the
mining company's contribution of $350,000,
the estimated gain for twenty years is
$594,000 annually.
I point out that this sum is not really profit,
because it is only applied to the amortization
and depreciation of this one branch line.
There is no distribution of the general overhead of the railway, for if there were, a
80713-43j

further charge of $1 million per year should
be entered, with an ostensible annual loss of
about $400,000 per year
At the end of the twenty-year period the
Sherritt Gordon Company will have paid to
the Canadian National Railways a total of
$7 million. Further, after the transportation
of 1,880,000 tons of outbound freight by the
Canadian National Railways, under the contract there would be a reversal of position,
and the railway would pay to the Sherritt
Gordon Mines $2.65 per ton of freight until
the sum of $5 million is realched. I place
those two figures before honourable senators:
$7 million, which would be paid by the com,pany over a period of twenty years, or until
1,880,000 tons of outward freight have passed
over the railway, when the position would be
reversed, as I have stated.
The amount of ore above the 1,700-foot
level is conservatively estimated at 14 million
tons, the capture of which will mean a considerable gain to the gross national product
of Canada.
Mining engineers have computed that the gross return from the sale
of this base metal on a 2,000-ton per day
hoist will be $14 million per annum, which
over twenty years would be $280 million.
Add to that the factor of gross national
product of two and a half times this figure,
which economics indicate, and you have a
possible gain in gross national product of
$700 million.
On marketing: the Sherritt-Gordon Mines
Limited have a contract of five years whereby
the United States Government and other users
of nickel will take its entire product on the
basis of 2,000 tons a day hoisted at the
mine-head.
This railway will cross the Churchill river,
and the obtaining of the steel for the entire
branch line presented a nice question at
this time, when steel is as strategic a commodity as any; but it has been decided that
the need of nickel is such that the project
should proceed without delay.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I do not rise to take any
objection to the bill, but to ask a question.
I was rather interested in the details of the
cost of the 155 miles to be constructed. I
have been wondering how the sponsor of the
bill can show that the $350,000 represents
a gain to the Canadian National Railways.
This sum is to be paid annually over a period
of twenty years. How much money is the
Sherritt-Gordon mine to put up; and if they
are to return to the Canadian National
Railways the sum they are borrowing from
them, how can it be a gain to the C.N.R.?
Hon. Mr. Davis: The Sherritt-Gordon will
pay the railways over the first twenty-year

SENATE

period $7,000,000. It is estimated that there
will be a net gain for the Canadian National
Railways of $244,000 per annum on the basis
of 2,000 tons of ore hoisted to the mine-head,
the concentrates being taken partly to Flin
Flon, Manitoba, and partly to the refinery
which is to be located at Edmonton, because
If these two
of the supply of natural gas.
sources of revenue are added together, they
will represent an improved position, though
not necessarily all profit, of approximately
$600,000 per year.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Does the mine get a loan
of $5 million? If so, by whom is it made?
Hon. Mr. Davis: Not from the railway.
My authority is clippings from financial
papers, but I understand that for the launching of this project new money will be available in the amount of $33 million. At the
present time the guaranteed sale for their
product is limited to five years. The return
to the railway will be the $7,000,000, plus
That is definite.
the freight charges.
Amortization of the line and equipment is
figured on a 31 per cent compound basis. I
have a statement here to the effect that $10
million will be contributed towards the construction of the railway by the C.N.R.; the
balance required for construction, namely
$4,725,000, will be provided by the Department of Defence Production. This bill is
for the sole purpose of authorizing only the
raising of $10 million by the Canadian
National Railways. We are not dealing with
the additional $4,725,000 which will be provided by the Department of Defence
Production.
Hon. Mr. Reid: My reason for having
asked the question is that when the bill was
explained in the other place it was distinctly
stated that the mine would receive a loan of
$5 million, to be paid back over a period of
twenty years, and I could not get it through
my head how, if the mine were getting a
loan of $5 million from the C.N.R. and was
paying it back, it could be deemed a gain
to the Canadian National Railways. The
C.N.R. were lending the mine the money on
behalf of the government.
Hon. Mr. Davis: My information shows
no loan by the C.N.R. to the Sherritt Gordon
mine. The financing will be done otherwise,
mainly in New York.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: This proposal is one
which the house can accept, I think, without
much reservation. As it happens, this
particular railroad for which partial provision is made in the measure before us is
in the constituency that I represented in
parliament for a period of ten years. It is
a pretty rough country, abounding in lakes,

rocks and streams. Its great asset is its
mineral resources. Somewhat over twentyfive years ago a body of ore was discovered
in northern Manitoba about ninety miles
north and a little west of the Pas. After a
great deal of preliminary work a railroad
was constructed from the Pas to the location
of the property, and as a result we have the
mine which is known in Manitoba as the
Flin Flon. This mine has been operating for
over twenty years, and its known ore
reserves are sufficient to carry it along for,
as I am informed, at least another twenty
years. The town built at that location has
a population of about 12,000 people.
As the honourable senator from St.
Boniface (Hon. Mr. Davis) has stated, the
mine which is to be opened up as a result
of the building of the railway under consideration is some 125 miles north of what is
known as Cold Lake. The location of the
Sherritt Gordon mine is shown on the railway
map as "Sherridon." It is quite evident from a
general knowledge of the mining industry
that this development will mean the building
of a town of some four or five thousand people
in this new location. I am quite willing to
hold up both hands at any time for an expenditure of this kind, because it leads to the
production of wealth and the employment of
labour. Itis the kind of expenditure to which
this country should give primary consideration. Speaking of the Flin Flon mine, I know
that many carloads of freight move in and out
of that place daily. The mine, which gives employment to well over 2,000 people, has a big
payroll, and the proof of the value lies in
the fact that practically the entire town's
population derives its living from the mining
operations. I think the new development
at Lynn Lake, which will be the terminus
of the proposed line, will be a repetition in a
smaller way of what has happened at Flin
Flon.
One of the remarkable things in our
country has been the development of our
mining industry. It is a matter of interest
that fifty years ago the great pre-Cambrian
shield, extending from Labrador well down
into Ontario and up through northwestern
Manitoba to Bear Lake in the Arctic Circle,
was supposed to be barren of minerals. It
was unusual to find minerals in that kind
of rock formation; but some of the greatest
mines in the world have been developed in
the so-called pre-Cambrian shield. No one
can set a limit to the possibilities of the
mine which is in prospect at Lynn Lake,
and which will be served by this railway.
As everyone in this house knows, Canada
is the world's greatest producer of nickel,

JUNE 25, 1951
and the extent to which all of North America
and some European countries are dependent
upon Canada for nickel is surprising.
Honourable senators for these reasons I
warmly support the motion of the honourable
senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Davis).
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I should just like to give a little history at
this time. I had the honour, as a member
of the Manitoba Legislature, of being present
when the Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting
Company was developed. I remember the
details very well.
The premier of Manitoba at that time was
the Honourable John Bracken, and his constituency included the part of the province
in question. The promoters of the mine came
to Mr. Bracken and said that the Canadian
National Railway before building a line from
The Pas to what is now the - town of Flin
Flon, insisted that the province of Manitoba
guarantee for the first ten years the $250,000
annual loss on the operation of the line.
Mr. Bracken said, and I think wisely, that
he would not consent to any such obligation
as that being undertaken by the government,
but that he would submit the question to a
caucus of the house. It was the first large
Manitoba undertaking. All members of the
house had visited that district in the year
1920, when Mr. Norris was Premier, and all
came to the conclusion that it was just like
a pile of old iron. The man who discovered
the ore interested certain mining people in
New York City in it. They took some of the
ore from the ground and tried to smelt it, but
they could not find any formula to separate
it from the copper, lead, zinc, gold and
silver.
When the promoters came to the legislature, we said: "Well, if the members will
not guarantee $250,000 for ten years in the
interests of this mine, there is not much hope
in the future for mining in Manitoba". There
was no recorded vote, but I think the
members unanimously agreed to promise the
promoters that if they could get a formula
for smelting the ore, and if they could get
the money to put in the machinery and
develop the property, such a guarantee would
be signed.
Work was started, and a million dollars
was spent in finding the formula to separate
the ore. Without that, of course, the mine
was not worth anything. Then the mine promoters came back to the legislature-and this
is the part I may be criticized about. They
said, "How about you boys in the legislature
putting some of your own money into the
mine?" Well, that was kind of touchy, and
it made us think quite a little. But again we
said to ourselves, "If we are not willing to

put up some money in the interests of this
mine, how can we expect other people to do
it?" I want to say quite candidly, however,
that I thought it was an unadulterated
gamble. I am going back some· twenty-five
years. At that time it looked as though our
money would just be wasted. But Manitoba
was very prosperous then, and we were all
buying stocks at $100 one day and selling
them for $110 the next. We were each of us
also induced to buy, I think, $750 in bonds.
That was a lot of money in those days for
some of us, but we got a bonus of 100 shares
of stock with the purchase. The stock was
not worth anything unless the mine paid, but
it paid all right, and we never had to spend
a cent on that guarantee.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Have you still got the
stock?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, I still have it. It does
not pay very much. At $50 a share it pays
8 per cent a year. I think it has been doing
so for about twenty years.
Honourable senators, I think there are
similar prospects in store for this new mine.
As a senator from Manitoba I will hold up
both hands for this development. The prospectors have been telling us for quite a long
time that there is ore in the district; it will
be found not far from the Churchill river,
where the power comes from to operate the
mine at Flin Flon.
The necessary money has already been
negotiated for, and as Canadians we take no
risk in guaranteeing the railway, other than
the risk of whether the line will pay or not
after the mine is developed. The promoters
are going to put up a large sumHon. Mr. Davis: $3 million.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The only thing I could
possibly criticize is the intention to place the
smelter in Alberta. I think it should have
been in Manitoba, but it will be located in
Alberta, because of the oil supply there.
Hon. Mr. Horner: And cheaper gas.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes.
I am not trying to make a booster speech.
I have no doubt that the people who are putting up the bulk of the money for this
development-Largely Americans-have solid
evidence that the minerals are there to pay
a good return on their money, and I think
it is good common sense for Canadians ta
assist in developing the project. There is no
doubt that the people in New York who put
up most of the money for the Hudson Bay
Mining and Smelting Company made a tremendous profit; but in the early days even
they did not think there was in the district

such a large ore body as has since been disI congratulate the government

upon undiertaking to have this line of railway
built. I agree entirely with the senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), that this expenditure is of a kind that will encourage people
to come to Canada to make their homes in
this country.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Davis: With leave of the Senate,

Railways securities which mature or are callable during the years from 1951 to 1955. As I
understand it, the bill would authorize the

or to issue new securities. I think the practice is to make temporary loans and to issue
securities from time to time in amounts which
the market can then absorb. The total principal amount of the refunding authorized by
this bill is $200 million.
Honourable senators may be interested to
know that of the refundable issues that fall
due or become callable in the next four years
approximately $147 million are payable in
Canada, $1 million in London, $995,000 in the
United States and $66 million in Canada,
London and the United States. The rate of
interest on these securities varies all the way
from 22 to 5 per cent.
I might also add that the government loans
to the Canadian National Railways outstanding at the present time amount to approximately $757 million.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Quite a sum.

MUNICIPAL GRANTS BILL
MOTION

FOR SECOND

READING

POSTPONED

On the Order:
Second reading of Bill 390, an Act respecting
grants to municipalities-Hon. Mr. Hugessen.

Hon. Mr. Haig: I wonder if

the deputy

leader (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) would allow this
order to stand until tomorrow. I wish to
speak upon it and I am not ready.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The 'bill will be
explained by the senator from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert).
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Would my honourable
friend be agreeable to my speaking this evening? He could adjourn the debate after I had
finished.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I would rather follow you
directly. That would be more interesting.
The Hon. the Speaker: Shall the order
stand?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Stand.
The Hon. the Speaker: The Order stands.
CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
REFUNDING BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. G. P. Burchill moved the second reading of Bill 392, an Act respecting Canadian
National Railways and to provide for the
refunding of matured, maturing and callable
financial obligations.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a bill
to provide for refunding of Canadian National

Hon. Mr. Burchill: And the total of the
Canadian National Railways funded debt and
loans from the government of Canada as at
December 31, 1950, amounted. to $1,398 million, on which the total interest charges in
1950 amounted to $46,725,698.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Is that going to be written
off?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Honourable senators
may also be interested to know that the
system's total funded debt and loans from the
Dominion Government in 1937 amounted to
$1,284 million. In other words, in the inter-

vening thirteen years the increase has been
only $114 million. This certainly does not
seem a large increase when one considers the

great expansion and development of this
country which the Canadian National Railways serve.
Honourable senators, I think perhaps I need
only add that similar legislation was passed
in 1935, 1938, 1944 and 1947. The securities
which it is proposed to refund will be maturing in the years mentioned, and they will
have to be paid.
If there are any questions and I have the

desired information here, I shall be only too
pleased to answer them.
Hon.

Mr.

Haig:

Could

my

honourable

friend tell us approximately what are the
rates of interest on the different issues?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Yes.

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall the bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: If my friend from New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) has no objection, I would suggest that the bill be now read
a third time.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Perhaps at this point
I should offer a word of explanation. A
meeting of the Standing Committee on
Transport and Communications has been
called for tomorrow morning at 10.30, on the
assumption that the bills having to do with
railways would receive second reading this
evening, and be referred to that committee.
I gave an undertaking to my honourable
friend from New Westminster that an opportunity would be given to honourable senators
to attend the meeting and to ask questions
of the management of the Canadian National
Railways as to these bills and the general
financial position of the railway.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is a good idea.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: In accordance with my
undertaking given some weeks ago, I suggest
that this bill be referred to that committee.

Hon. Mr. Reid: I remember the suggestion,
but I am not saying anything about it.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Honourable senators, I
move that the bill be referred to the Standing
Committee on Transport and Communications.
The motion was agreed to.
CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
FINANCING AND GUARANTEE
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. G. P. Burchill moved the second reading of Bill 393, an Act to authorize the provision of moneys to meet certain capital
expenditures made and capital indebtedness
incurred by the Canadian National Railways
System during the calendar year 1951, and
to authorize the guarantee by His Majesty
of certain securities to be issued by the
Canadian National Railway Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill, like
the previous one, would provide funds for the
Canadian National Railways, to be used as
follows:
Additions and betterments ..........
$37,000.000
New equipment (1951 budget) .....
56,000,000
Acquisition of Securities and retirement of capital obligations .......
3,712,000
Additional working capital .........

20,000,000

From a total of approximately $117 million
there is to be deducted an amount of $16
million available from reserve for deprecia-

tion, leaving a net of $101,215,000, which is
the amount provided by the bill.

SENATE
I do not know how much information the
house is desirous of hearing at this late hour.
It may be the wish of the house that this
bill be referred to the Standing Committee on
Transport and Communications.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I would suggest to the
honourable senator that the information be
given when the bill is considered in committee tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The house has been sitting
only two hours. This is not late.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I shall be pleased to
comply with the wishes of the house in the
matter.
Details of the item "additions and betterments" to be completed in 1951 are as follows:

.Hon. Mr. Reid: How much is to be spent
in British Columbia?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I presume British
Columbia would be included in "Western
Region".
Hon. Mr. Reid: British Columbia is away
beyond the West.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Honourable senators
may be interested to hear a list of the new
equipment which is to be provided, at a cost
of approximately $56 million including sales
tax and inspection charges. The breakdown
is as follows:
28 Standard baggage cars
5000 box cars
500 Refrigerators
500 Box cars (GTW)
40 Box cars (Nfid.)
100 Flat cars (Nfid.)
20 3000-3200 H.P. road diesel locomotives

4 Russel snow plows
1 Wrecking crane
30 Air dump cars
75 Hopper cars for ballast service
1 Scale test car (GTW)
2 Diesel electric cranes
1 16-cylinder engine for diesel units (GTW)
1 Magnet generator flat car
1 50-ton locomotive crane (Nfid.)
20 16-cubie yd. air dump cars (Nfid.)
17 Water transports
5 Units work equipment (D.W. & P.).

I have before me some other information
which, frankly, I think could be better given
in committee tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Reid: You are doing very well.

Hon. Mr. Burchill: I should like to add
that the large amount of $20 million for additional working capital is necessitated by the
expansion of the services of the railway.
As every businessman knows, a larger inventory requires a larger amount of working
capital.
With this brief explanation, I trust that
honourable senators may see fit to give second

reading to the bill, and to allow it to be
referred to a committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall the bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Honourable senators,
I move that the bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications.

Hon. Mr. Haig: May I be permitted to say
a few words?
When the bill is considered in committee
I should like the representatives of the Canadian National Railways to be there to give
some general figures about the expenditures
over the past ten years. I have no doubt
that the purchases of equipment are quite
in order, but I am interested in the financial

side of the picture. I am asking for this
information because of certain feelings which
the three Prairie provinces have about railway freight rates. The railway in that part
of the country has no competition by water
or highway, and we are anxious to get a true
picture of its finances.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I presume that the
honourable acting leader has arranged that
representatives who can give that information will be present at the committee meeting tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen:
I understand that
they will be present.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: And they will have the
information which the honourable leader
opposite has requested.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was referred to committee.

POST OFFICE BILL
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS

CONCURRED IN

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the amendments made by the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce to Bill
322, an Act respecting the Canada Post
Office.

JUNE 25, 1951
Hon. Mr. Robertson moved concurrence in
the amendments.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I want to thank the Postmaster General for the very fine way in
which he accepted these amendments in
committee. They are mine.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: One of them was yours,
but one of them was mine!
Hon. Mr. Haig: But the one about the
committee making the report is the important one, because the minister is the person
who has the right to require the committee
to be appointed, and it would report to him.
That is as far as the bill went. The committee is now required to make recommendations, and in view of what has happened, I
have no doubt that those recommendations
will be carried out. The minister has an
overriding power, but I doubt very much
whether he will exercise it.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: May I concur in what
the leader on the other side (Hon. Mr. Haig)
has said in congratulating the Postmaster
General on the cordial way 'in which he
accepted the amendments. There were two:
the one to which my honourable friend
bas referred, and which he suggested;
another, which I think was equally important, that I suggested and the Postmaster
General accepted. My recommendation was
that the board of review to be set up under
this legislation should include a member of
the legal profession, because the board will
have the important function of determining
whether an offence has been committed and,
therefore, of deciding as to the sufficiency of
the evidence. As I have said, I believe my

80713-44

amendment is just as important as that of
my honourable friend. However, I join with
him in congratulating
the Postmaster
General.
Hon. Mr. Haig: As regards the amendment
referred to by the honourable senator from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen), I think the
honourable member from Rosetown (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) was the first to mention it.
The motion was agreed to, and the amendments were concurred in.

The Hon.

the

Speaker: Honourable senators,

when shall this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I move the third readng now.
Hon. G. P. Burchill: Honourable senators,
I am sorry to detain ti e house on third reading of this bill, but tnere is one matter to
which I want to refer, and some things which
I should like to put on record about the bill
this afternoon, as I have not had the opportunity of saying them before. I allude to the
plight in which privately-owned public utility
companies find themselves through being
obliged to pay the surtax of 20 per cent
imposed by this legislation. This tax is
levied on all public utility companies whose
rates are regulated by public utilities commissions or by the Board of Transport Commissioners. As honourable senators know, in
the provinces of Newfoundland, Prince
Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick,
Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia, the

costs of the business. These include services on the
debt and dividends on the stock. By that standard
the return to the equity owner should be commensurate with returns on investments in other
enterprises having corresponding risks.

In our rural province of New Brunswick
this little free enterprise company of long
standing paid last year into the federal
treasury $703,932 by way of taxes.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: Is that a telephone
company?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Yes. This represented
a tax of $9.89 on every telephone in our
province. The leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig), who shares my view in this
matter, comes from a province where the
telephone users escape this tax, and he can
go home feeling that the users of telephones
in New Brunswick are contributing to the
prosperity of Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I want to point out
that these companies are as old as Canada
itself, and have played a very important
part in every phase of Canadian development.
In fact, they are part of the fabric of Canada.
They represent the modern development of
an amazing invention by Alexander Graham

JUNE 26, 1951
Bell, a Canadian, which plays an important
and vital part in business, political and social
activities throughout the world.
Our modern telephone system was built
under the stimulus of private enterprise. Let
us never forget that. Telephone companies
as well as other public utility companies
have been the targets for taxation by every
federal, provincial and municipal taxing body.
Do our governments today realize what these
companies have accomplished and how vital
they are to our country, and that this burden
of taxation may destroy part of our great
Canadian enterprise? When the honourable
the Minister of Finance introduced this legislation he recognized the point I am making.
He said in the course of his remarks that he
hoped to be able, before the legislation was
passed in the other house, to announce that
ways had been found of lightening this
onerous burden of taxation on public utility
companies. However, when the legislation
was finally passed there, the minister had
to inform the house that the talent of the
legal officers in his department was insufficient ta enable them to find language which
would interpret the words "capital employed"
and thus bring about the desired purpose.
Honourable senators, that is the first time
I ever heard of the legal fraternity being
stuck for an interpretation of any words in
the English language. It occurred to me that
if members of the legal fraternity or others
were able to find language to bring Indiawhich is a republic and which desires to
remain such-within the orbit of the crown
of Great Britain, surely among the legal
fraternity of Canada there are brains enough
to find language to describe such a relatively
simple matter as "capital employed" within
the meaning of section 12 of this bill. And I
wish to say to my honourable friend the
Minister of Finance that if the necessary
legal talent is not available in the Department of Finance I am quite sure that in
this honourable body we have plenty of
talent capable of providing that interpretation.
Government officials in the United States
were able to find a formula. I have in my
hand a copy of Public Utility Survey, a
special section of the Investment Dealers'
Digest, from which I quote the following:

adopted by the Federal Power Commission or other
regulatory authority. This principle was adopted
by Congress and written into the Excess Profits
Tax Act. Similar credits were given railroads and
other utilities with an allowance of 7 per cent to
telephone companies and common carriers by air.

I am putting this on the record, honourable
senators, just te prove to this house that
legal talent in the United States was evidently able to accomplish something that
appears to be beyond the ability of the legal
officers of the Department of Finance of
Canada.

Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I do not wish ta join in the debate, and
although I entirely agree with the honourable
senator from Northumberland (Hon. Mr.
Burchil), I must say something in defence
of the Minister of Finance. I think it is only
fair, especially in this house, to put the
government's case-not that it needs to be
done by me, for the government has many
supporters here, and probably most of them
are better able to do this than I am. But I
do wish to place myself on record in this
matter. The Minister of Finance recognized
the very principle which my honourable
friend has proposed, and with which I agree,
but he said th-at he had run into difficulty in
trying to work out a formula which would put
that principle into effect. The Minister's own
bill does recognize the underlying principle
that no company should be so heavily taxed
as to reduce its earnings below 5 per cent. The
senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden),
who explained the bill to us the other day,
admitted frankly that he was having difficulty
over the same problem, and we had difficulty
with it in committee. I must say for the
Minister of Finance that I think he was quite
disturbed because of his inability ta find a
satisfactory formula for dealing with this
question. The issue has been persistently
raised in this house, while the bill was under
consideration here and also in our Banking
and Commerce Committee, and after listening
to the explanation made by the Minister at
this morning's meeting of that committee,
I came ta the conclusion that within the
next year changes applying to telephone and
hydro electric operations will be made. The
Winnipeg Electric Company last year paid to

SENATE
that if by a year from now the Minister of
Finance has not brought in a bill to make
the legislation more equitable to private
enterprise and to provide a formula such as
my friend suggests, I will join with him in
criticizing the budget of that day. The government should work out a formula under
the present legislation or bring in new legislation by which public utility bodies will be
protected to the extent of 4 per cent, 5 per
cent, or whatever rate is allowed general
corporations.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I am very glad that my friend from Northumberland (Hon. Mr. Burchill) raised this
question in the Senate this afternoon, following upon its having been raised in the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
I gathered the same impression as did the
honourable leader opposite, that the Minister
of Finance is fully aware of the ýdifficulties
which may face the public utility companies
in the light of the substantial increase in the
tax on profits, under the legislation which
we are now considering. I feel that some
measure of relief is almost certain to be
introduced next year. I do, however, think
that there is a great deal of justification for
the statement which the minister made, that
in the short time since the introduction of
his budget he has been unable to evolve a
satisfactory formula by which that relief
could be measured.
My honourable friend from Northumberland gave a most interesting quotation from
certain legislation introduced in the United
States for that purpose. It was ýto this effect:
That the amount of capital on which these
public utility bodies were to get this relief
was determined on the basis -of a uniform
method of accounting used by national public
bodies in the United States. Our trouble is
that we have no uniform method of accounting for public utility companies throughout
the country. Such uniformity of accounting
would make it more easy to evolve a formula.
Honourable senators ,can appreciate how difficult it is to ,determine accurately the real
amount of capital employed fairly in the case,
for instance, of a public utility of many
years standing. I have in mind a case in the
city of Montreal, that of the Montreal Light,
Heat and Power Consolidated. If one were
simply to accept the capital structure as
reflected in the books of that company, it
would show an enormous amount of inflation
in the purchases of constituent companies
and the like. In a number of cases it would
be extraordinarily difficult to reach a fair
statement of the capital actually employed
in publie utilities.

I can only say that I hope and believe
that 'during the next few months-at least
by the time the next session comes aroundthe minister will have evolved a formula
which will give to these public utility companies whose rates are fixed by regulatory
bodies the relief which we agree is justified.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators I
agree with what has been said by the previous speakers on this subject, and I rise only
to comment on a statement made by the
leader opposite. If I should misquote him, I
hope he will correct me. He said, I think,
that it was recognized that profits of at least
5 per cent or 6 per cent should be allowed
before taxation.
Hon. Mr. Haig: My statement was that the
taxes should not reduce the earnings below
5 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The surtax?
Hon. Mr. Haig: The surtax.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Where is that principle
enunciated?
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is in the Act.
Hon. Mr. Euler: If that is the case it does
not apply universally in the matter of taxation. Honourable members will recall a bill
that came to this house a few years agoHon. Mr. Haig: May I interrupt my friend
a moment? The application of this principle
is that the surtax will not reduce the interest on money.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I do not care what kind of
tax it is, whether surtax or ordinary tax. I
just want to correct the impression, if it
has been given, that there is any recognition
whatsoever that private enterprise or any
other company can make 4 per cent or 6 per
cent before taxation is applied.
Honourable senators will recall a bill which
was presented a few years ago to tax the
profits on insurance companies, which I consider was perfectly proper. The profits of all
companies should be taxed on the same basis.
In the case of insurance companies-particularly fire, guarantee, automobile, and companies of that type-there was in years gone
by a tax of 3 per cent on premiums collected,
but there was no tax on the profits of the
company. The then acting Minister of Finance-now the minister-brought in a bill by
which the premium tax was reduced from 3
per cent to 2 per cent-a very nice concession
-but at the same time the companies were
obliged to pay corporation tax. I argued at
that time that there was no reason why
there should be a premium tax in addition
to the corporation tax. The point is that
some insurance companies have very large

SENATE
He said: Honourable senators, the legislation proposed in this bill recalls to my mind
that on several occasions prior to the year
1944 I had the privilege of presenting to this
house, after passage by the House of
Commons, the so-called Ottawa bills, which
provided for an appropriation or grant of
$100,000 in considieration of various services
rendered by the municipality to institutions
located in Ottawa and connected with the
federal establishment. I mention this circumstance at the outset because Bill 390
represents in many ways an evolution of the
principle in the Ottawa bills and a broadening of the ground of municipal taxation
throughout the country. I would like to say
also at the beginning of my remarks-which
will not be prolonged-that in discussing this
bill it would be better to consider the subjectmatter apart from the special interesýt of
Ottawa, because of its unique place as the
capital city, and its relations to the proposed
capital city plan and to the Federal District
Commission, each of which has its own financial arrangements. I believe that an understanding of the principles underlying this bill,
which are applicable to municipalities
throughout the country, will be furthered if
the subject is treated from a broad national
point of view and as constituting a precedent
in Canadian administration, rather than as
particularly related to the affairs of the
capital city.
In 1944, upon recommendation of a joint
committee of the Senate and the House of
Commons, the grant to Ottawa was increased
from $100,000 to $300,000. The grant was
made for a five-year period, and in 1949, at
the end of that period, the government took
steps to deal with grants to all municipalities
throughout Canada where federal government
properties were located. For a considerable
time previously the government had had
under review this whole question of municipalities outside of Ottawa. As a matter of
fact, delegations from the Canadian Federation of Mayors, the Mayors and Reeves
Association of Ontario, and many individual
municipalities, had made representations to
the government asking for an adjustment of
burdens which they felt they should not bear
alone.
On February 17, 1950, Order in Council
P.C. 741 was passed, authorizing the payment
of grants to these municipalities in lieu of
taxes on federal properties, and imposing
certain limitations. Bill 390, which I have
in my hand, puts that order in council into
statutory form. In preparation for this legislation the government, very wisely, I think,

inquired into assessments and rates of taxation in all the municipalities in Canada in
which federal properties are located.
One might pause here to comment that this
legislation really marks an important innovation in the relations of the federal government
with the local governments of the country,
and very definitely illustrates the growing
trend of co-operation between the dominion
and the provinces in the matter of administration. Further, it shows that there are
provisions in the British North America Act
which no longer apply, and which such bills
as this endeavour to steer clear of in an effort
to bring about a more equitable distribution
of the burden of taxation in Canada.
In addition, the government bas reviewed
the experience in the tax fields of the United
Kingdom, the United States, New Zealand,
Australia and the Scandinavian countries, and
it is interesting to note that in only two of
these countries, the United Kingdom and
the Republic of Ireland, are full tax rates
paid by the central government on all of its
properties. Both of these countries are unitary states where local governments are
integrated with and subordinate to the central
government. It should be remembered that
in these countries the central government
maintains the right to assess its own properties, and thereby determines the total amount
of municipal taxes to be paid.
In this proposed legislation three principles
underline all the clauses. In the first place
the constitutional exemption of federal
property from municipal taxation, as provided
for in section 125 of the British North America
Act, is observed. Therefore grants to municipalities as proposed in this bill will be
made as a matter of grace. The second outstanding principle is that the presence of
federal property in any municipality brings
certain definite benefits to that municipality.
This is reflected in the business revenues of
the municipality and in the stability of income
that results from the presence of government
employees.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I am sure that examples
of this readily come to the minds of honourable members when they recall the eagerness
with which representatives of different parts
of the country seek the establishment of
branches of government in their respective
districts. Naturally, owing to circumstances
which are taken into consideration in this
bill, federal institutions have erected their
facilities to a greater extent in some districts
than in others. That leads to the third
principle underlying this bill. In certain
municipalities the larger concentration of

JUNE 26, 1951
federal property adds to the expense of municipal administration, and this is not equalized
by the benefits accruing from the presence of
federal property in those municipalities.
Therefore they must receive special consideration. Accordingly, this bill recognizes
an average of 4 per cent as representing the
proportion of assessment on government
property to the total assessment of all real
property in all municipalities across Canada
where such properties are located. This 4
per cent is described as a national average,
and only those municipalities having government properties in excess of 4 per cent of the
total local assessment are qualified to receive
grants under this bill.
The basis on which. grants are calculated
in relation to municipalities where the concentration of federal property exceeds the
national average, is 75 per cent of the municipal tax level on the excess portion of the
assessment charged against federal property.
This provision is set forth in section 5 of the
bill. It is estimated that some 100 municipalities in Canada qualify for grants on the
basis of having federal properties in excess
of 4 per cent of their total assessment.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Who makes the assessment on the properties?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I shall explain that.
In preparation for this legislation the government set up in the Treasury Board a
unit manned by experienced tax assessors.
This unit made a complete review of all
municipalities where federal property is
located and reached its conclusions on the
basis of what, at the beginning of this bill,
is termed "accepted value". There are two
terms in the interpretation clause, "assessed
value" and "accepted value". Assessed value
is the term applied to the value that is
assessed by a municipality on real property.
The accepted value is the amount that is
established as the fair value of federal properties by the government and the municipality, in agreement; and, as my honourable
friends will readily recognize, there is room
for a great deal of adjustment on that question between the parties. One need only
refer to the city of Ottawa, where the intermingling of control over streets, parks and
various other properties necessitates a very
definite line of demarcation. In explaining
the bill in the other house the minister made
it very clear that this is just a starting point,
and that as time goes on adjustments will
have to be made in the light of experience
and of expansion of federal interests in the
different municipalities.

Hon. Mr. Euler: If there is no agreement
between the municipality and the federal
government, how is it settled what the assessment should be?
Mr. Lambert: That possibility is not provided for in this bill. I have no doubt that,
as far as Ottawa is concerned, adjustments
on these matters are made through negotiations between the Federal District Commission and the municipality, and I think that
in the event of any dispute an appeal would
be made to the Governor in Council.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: There is no right to
any grant.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: No. I think I made
it clear that uûder the British North America
Act all federal properties are exempt from
municipal taxation.
I may as well deal now with the question of why, after the deduction of 4 per
cent-the national average-is made, only
75 per cent of the balance is -considered
instead of 100 per cent.
The minister
explained that clearly in the other house.
He pointed out that in all the municipalities
concerned there are many other properties
exempt from taxation besides those occupied by federal authorities. For instance,
there are such properties as those owned by
the provincial governments. In Ontario, that
would include Hydro-Electric properties.
Hon. Mr. Euler: There are religious
institutions.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: And educational
institutions.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: This assumption by the
federal government of responsibility to pay
municipal taxes in the same way as other
property owners do may in time lead to
assumption of similar responsibility by
federal and provincial governments on equal
terms. As I have said, that is the practice
in England. As yet, though, it does not
seem that the time is ripe for extending this
responsibility to any point beyond that provided for in clause 5 of the bill.
I have already mentioned that some one
hundred municipalities in Canada qualify
for grants on the basis of having within
their bounds federal government properties
of a total value in excess of 4 per cent of
the total municipal assessment.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask my honourable
friend a question? Are Toronto, Montreal,
Vancouver and Winnipeg included among
those municipalities?

SENATE

Hon. Mr. Lambert: They certainly are, for
they all have within their boundaries federal
properties whose combined value is more
than 4 per cent of the respective municipal
assessments.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I doubt it.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I am pretty sure about
that. In Montreal, for instance, the Ford
Hotel has recently been taken over by the
That acquisition raises the point
C.B.C.
of certain qualifications for exemption from
municipal taxation, and affects the percentage
which the value of federal properties bears to
the total value of all assessed properties in
Montreal.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask another question? In Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg and
Vancouver, let us say, are other exempted
properties included in the computation of
the total assessment?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I cannot speak positively
as to that, but I think the regular municipal
assessed value is applied to the real property
held in those areas by the federal government
and which is ordinarily exempt from muniWhether other exempted
cipal taxation.
properties are included in making the computation-such as, for instance, provincial
government properties-I do not know, but
we could easily get that information if we
took the time to go into committee and
inquire of Mr. Taylor, of the Department
of Finance, the officer in charge of the
inquiry conducted preparatory to the bringing
in of this measure.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I know that in the cities
of British Columbia all provincial buildings,
churches, and so on, are included in the
complete assessment.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: That may be so in
Toronto and the other cities mentioned, but
the provincial governments have not yet
undertaken to make any grant or equalizing
contribution such as is provided for here.
It is estimated that the annual cost to the
federal government of discharging its obligation under this bill to the different municipalities will be roughly $5 million. That is
the approximate figure which was given by
the Minister of Finance.
Other grants are provided in the bill to
cover future developments, such as the acquisition by the federal government of new properties in a municipality. There is also a
clause covering the unpaid portion of local
improvement taxes on properties acquired
since December 1942. This applies to a city
like Ottawa, where the many new properties
acquired in that year to meet increasing
administrative demands during the war,

would add to the contribution provided for
under the general provisions of the bill.
I think that is all I need to say on the
background of the bill. Section 2, the interpretation section, defines various terms, such
as "accepted value", "assessed value" and
"federal property". Certain exemptions from
the definition of "federal property" are set
out in paragraphs (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v)
of clause (c) of section 2.
They are as follows:
(i) real property forming part of an undertaking
in respect of the conservation, irrigation, reclamation, rehabilitation or reforestation of land,
(ii) a park, historical site, monument, museum,
public library or art gallery,
(iii) an improvement to land or structure that is
not a building designed for the shelter of people,
plant or movable property.
(iv) real property under the control, management
or administration of the National Railways as
defined in The Canadian National-Canadian Pacifie
Act, 1933, or a corporation, company, commission,
board or agency established to perform a function
or duty on behalf of the Government of Canada, or
(v) real property leased by His Majesty to a
tenant from whom, by reason of such tenant's
interest in that real property, a municipal taxing
authority may collect real estate tax.

As has already been observed, Crown
companies, including the Central Mortgage
and Housing Corporation, have already
engaged in separate negotiations with municipalities wherever the municipalities have
so desired. For that reason they are not
included in this bill.
The main purpose of the bill is to make a
sincere attempt to place the whole question
of the distribution of the burden of municipal
taxation on a more equitable basis.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Would the honourable
senator indicate the section which sets out the
amount of $5 million?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I said that the minister's
estimated cost of grants across Canada in
relation to this bill was $5 million.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: That is not covered by the
bill?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: It is not in the bill.
Hon. Mr. Prati: May I ask the honourable
senator whether defence projects and installations are included in the properties subject
to assessment and taxation? I have in mind
such defence establishments as naval dockyards, within city limits.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: No; they are exempt.
Somewhere in the bill there is a clause which
refers to a shelter for people, and projected
activities in relation to national defence such
as have been mentioned by my honourable
friend. For instance, I may refer to the
harbour commission property in Halifax,

JUNE 26, 1951
which will now be subject to assessment; but
the rate of tax that will apply is to be decided
between the federal and municipal authorities. There is a strong difference of opinion
on the subject. I find that the views of some
of my friends from Halifax differ from my
own. Personally, I think that the properties
represent value contributed entirely by the
federal authorities. I have -used the harbour
commission property in Halifax as an example, but the principle could be applied to
other establishments such as the Gander Airport, and military establishments in the far
north where villages have been set up and
equipment and personnel have been supplied.
All relevant factors will be taken into consideration in arriving at a reasonable assessment and a fair tax value.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I should like to ask the
senator from Ottawa if I am right in assuming
from what he says that the amount of assessment and the rates are still entirely in the
hands of the federal authorities?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I would assume that as
they relate to properties that become subject
to the new arrangement, the final decision
will be made by the federal authorities, but
only after taking all factors into consideration.
I did not intend on this bill, to refer to the
City of Ottawa but by way of illustration I
may be permitted to mention it. In pursuance of an assessment of federal properties
in the City of Ottawa a claim was made
against the federal government for the current
year in the amount of $3,338,900. Of this
amount the city will get $962,392. How that
figure was arrived at can perhaps be ascertained when the bill is considered in committee, but I have no doubt that the full
claim was based on the assessment rate as
applied to all real property, driveways and
everything else, that comes within the purview of the federal government. There are,
however, certain expenses taken care of by
the government, such as the paving of Wellington Street, the removal of snow and the
care of parks. After proper deductions were
made the amount agreed upon in connection
with the City of Ottawa was $962,392.
Certain undertakings on the part of the
federal government in connection with the
National Capital Plan should also be taken

come
within
the jurisdiction
of the
Federal District Commission, as I shall
explain later this afternoon with reference
to another bill seeking power to build a
railway in the area, and to do other things.
Al pertinent factors were, as I have said,
taken into consideration in the case of this
municipality, and similar factors will be con-

sidered as they apply to other municipalities
where federal properties are located. It may
take years to work out a satisfactory adjustment-or it may never be done-as between
the federal and municipal authorities on this
question of taxation. However, this measure
is a great improvement on existing arrangements, and is most acceptable in view of the
increasing responsibilities of municipalities.
Hon. Mr. King: Do I understand that the
$300,000 grant to Ottawa will now disappear?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Yes; the grant of
$300,000 -a year, made to the City of Ottawa
in 1940, was for a period of five years. That
arrangement came to an end in 1949, when
the present legislation was in preparation,
and for one year the city was granted an
intermediate amount by order in council.
Hon. Mr. King: But now that disappears?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: It disappears, or it is
incorporated here bodily.
Hon. John T. Haig: I do not intend to
delay the house at any great length. I
entirely agree with the opinion that the main
matter of the present bill and the grant to
the City of Ottawa should have been the
subject of two separate statutes, because the
backgrounds are entirely different. Ottawa
is a capital city, and there may be differences
of opinion about the amount of money which
should be expended on its improvement. But
there is general recognition that the capital
city should reflect the best ideals and -aspirations of the nation, and that visitors, whether
Canadians or friends from abroad, should
be able to get here a fitting impression of
Canada.
But such considerations have
nothing to do with the bill.
My criticism of the government is that it
has combined dissimilar objects in one bill.
The result will be, I think, that Ottawa will
not get the sort of consideration which it
would have received had its needs been dealt
with separately. I for one might be quite
willing to allow votes for the capital city in
amounts which I would not be willing to
grant to municipalities all over the dominion.
At the same time, if all these proposed grants
are lumped together, the onus is on those
who support the bill to prove, in the light
of fundamental principles, that Ottawa
should get a bigger proportion of the national
tax money than any other city. Such factors
as enter into the local question of planning
for the beautification of Ottawa are not
applicable in the case of other municipalities,
and I think that this difference should have
been recognized by combining the provision
for Ottawa with the subject-matter of
another bill which is coming a little later on.
In this way we would have had a clear idea
of what we were called upon to deal with.

SENATE
Candidly, although we talk glibly about
the Capital Plan, I find the plan very hard
to visualize. But there is one aspect of it
that I can visualize very well. When I 'first
came to Ottawa it was possible to walk
from the Chateau Laurier to Sparks street
without two or three times running the risk
of violent death. I know that when my
wife visits the city and leaves the hotel to
walk to Sparks street, I always feel nervous
about whether she will get back in one piece
or not. We can thank the beautification plan
for that sort of hazard. My honourable
friend from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner),
whenever I speak of Confederation Square,
says it should be called Confusion Square.
Automobiles seem to bear down on one from
every direction; and now things there have
got so bad that the city, I notice, has put a
policeman on duty and installed him in a
box. They do not dare to let him out by
himself, lest he be killed by the rush of
traffic, so they put him in a cage. By good
fortune you may rush across the road in
twenty-four seconds, but you have to run
very fast and be a real sprinter if you hope
to reach the other side alive. If that is a
consequence of the so-called Capital Plan I
am not for it.
I see that in another place somebody has
been talking about the moving of the Union
Station. I think it would be a crime to
change its location.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Why should people who
wish to visit the city have to detrain about
four miles away and try to get into town
by taxi or truck or whatever means of transportation they can find. The site of the Union
Station was fixed at its present location when
the plan for the Chateau Laurier was adopted
by the then government. I think Sir Wilfrid
Laurier and his Cabinet used good judgment
in placing the passenger station where it is.
In any event, as I have said, the entire
plan affecting Ottawa should have been put
in one separate bill. Had that been done,
members in this house and the other place
would have been more willing to vote the
necessary money-not necessarily an extravagant sum-to make Ottawa a really beautiful
city. It has a beautiful location. That is
one reason why the capital was placed on
the banks overlooking the Ottawa River, and,
happily, at the boundary between two great
provinces of which we are so proud. It is
an ideal situation for a capital city. I am
not here to talk politics on behalf of my
party, and some of my friends in this group
may not agree with me, but I repeat that
Ottawa should be made a beautiful capital
city. At the present time we are not in a

position to devote money to this purpose, but
probably within five years either we shall
be at war with Russia or there will be an
evident prospect of world peace.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: As a matter of information, I think it is only fair to state that in
each of the past three years two and a half
million dollars has been voted to the Federal
District Commission for the National Capital
Plan, and a similar sum will be allocated
this year. So $10 million will be available
for developmental purposes. That, however, is
apart from the subject-matter of this bill.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am pretty sleepy, but for
the last three years I have been alive to this
annual vole of two and a half million dollars
-and I expect to see the same amount in the
estimates this year. But I do not think the
money should be spent just now. While I
heartily favour the beautification of Ottawa,
my criticism is that the entire plan for the
capital, including taxation relief, road relief
and the rest, should have been contained in
one bill so that it could have been discussed
by itself.
I pass now to another ground of criticism.
My city of Winnipeg objects strenuously to
the proposed basis or method of taxation. In
Manitoba, after a good deal of agitation, the
provincial government has been induced to
pay each year the estimated tax on all its
commercial undertakings located within the
city. In these modern days any government
should pay the ordinary municipal taxes on
buildings it uses within the municipality, and
for which fire and police protection and other
services are provided. It may be said that the
government as a taxpayer reaps no benefit
from the educational expenditures, but this is
not a sound argument. Thousands of married
couples have no children; neither, of course,
have business properties; but no one would
think of suggesting that childless couples, or
Eaton's or the Hudson Bay stores should be
relieved of that part of their municipal tax
which is expended on education, because there
can be no stable democracy which is not
founded on education.
I do not like this 4 per cent limitation. I
am doubtful if the value of all the Dominion
Government property in Winnipeg equals 4
per cent of the total assessed value of taxable
property. I would not say that of a small
municipality. My colleague from Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) draws my attention to
the fact that the post office at Rosetown is
assessed at $170,000.
I should think that
that would be more than 4 per cent of the
total assessment of Rosetown.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: If my honourable friend
is correct, Winnipeg would not receive any
grant at all.

JUNE 26, 1951
Hon. Mr. Haig: No.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I am not in a position to
argue that point with him.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The City of Winnipeg has
claimed that this has been the case right
along.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: You have a big federal
building in Winnipeg. What about the
hospital?
Hon. Mr. Haig: There is no Dominion
Government hospital in the area except Deer
Lodge, and that is actually outside the city
of Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The veterans' hospital
is at Deer Lodge?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, and that is located in
a small municipality outside of Winnipeg.
I am talking about larger cities where such
buildings do not come within the city limits.
As far as I know, the only federally-owned
building in Winnipeg is the Federal Building.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: And the post office.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes.
Hon. Mr. King: What about the drill hall?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, the armouries are in
Tuxedo.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: According to the argument of my honourable friend, Winnipeg
comes within the 4 per cent average. If the
Dominion Government were to establish a
scientific research plant in Winnipeg similar
to the one which functioned there during the
last war, then the city would rise above the
4 per cent average and become eligible for
the grant.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That sort of thing seldom

exempted property. There might be a difference in Montreal, where there is a good
deal of exempted property; but that is not
the case in my city. It is true that churches
are exempted in Winnipeg, but.there is not
much value in them.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Does the Province of
Manitoba pay any taxes to municipalities?
Hon. Mr. Haig: The province owns all the
liquor stores and pays an annual tux to the
city.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Is that just a business tax?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, and a realty tax as
well. Our business tax is not heavy, but our
realty tax is.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Does the Hydro Electric
Company pay taxes in Manitoba?
Hon. Mr. Haig: It has only one building in
Winnipeg. The province pays taxes on all

commercial undertakings, but not in connection with the Parliament Buildings, the
Court House or the Land Titles Offices. It is
my understanding that the Hydro pays an
amount which it has agreed upon with the
city. I think it is equal to what it would pay
on a commercial undertaking.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Is the assessment
equal to assessments on private undertakings?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes. The Canadian National
Railways pay taxes on the Union Station and
on their shops. I am subject to correction but
I think the amount which has been agreed
upon is $300,000 a year. The Canadian Pacific
Railway Company are having a lawsuit
about the payment of taxes on their hotel,
which does not come within this exemption.
What I want te get at is this. I think that
in this ýday and age, when municipalities face
heavy expenditures to provide police, fire
and other kinds of protection for their
citizens, the Dominion Government should
be ready to pay ordinary taxes on their
properties-except for parliament buildingsin the various municipalities. In my own
province the load on municipal governients
has become so terrific that I do not know
what is going to happen. I am sure this grave
problem exists all over Canada.
Another criticism of this bill is that it
places all the power in the hands of the
federal government. In Manitoba a board has
been appointed to revise assessments in the
municipalities. For instance, farm lands are
assessed on the same low rate, so that taxation on these lands within a municipality is
fair. In turn, each municipality is brought
to the same taxation level. I think this board
I speak of assesses the Federal Building in
Winnipeg at about $3 million. Then it assesses
the Eaton's store, which ýcost about $3 million,
on the same ibasis. I think this is the plan
upon which the Dominion Government ought
to have proceeded. My honourable friend
from Northumberland (Hon. Mr. Burchill)
has already suggested today that there is a
growing tendency for semi-government institutions to go into business. Under this
exemption they pay no taxes.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Would not the answer be
to remove all exemptions, even if it were
ncessary to amend the British North America
Act? We have that power now?

Hon. Mr. Euler: I did not understand you

SENATE
all of this talk about the large volume of
business the provincial government buildings
bring to a city is greatly exaggerated. The
only good thing about the Manitoba Parliament Buildings is that if you happen to be
member of the legislature for Winnipeg it is
quite convenient for you to conduct your
own business in the daytime and attend to
the affairs of the province at night. There
was quite a struggle in Saskatchewan before
it was decided to make Regina the capital
of that province and Saskatoon the seat of
the Provincial University. Well, I think
Saskatoon got the better of the deal. Students
move in there each year and spend a lot of
money on supplies and room and board.
I think this bill should go to committee
where Mr. Taylor, perhaps, could explain to
us the basis of the assessment. Although this
bill is a step in the right direction, it goes
only a little way. I am sure that I speak for
many municipalities when I say that they
are anxious that the federal government pay
a more equitable portion of the assessment
on federal buildings located in municipalities.
Hon. Gordon B. Isnor: Honourable senators,
we in Halifax have been particularly interested in this matter. I recall that this was
a live issue when I was a member of the
city council back in 1914 and later, when
as a member of the provincial government
I came here as one of a delegation to present
the case for Halifax. And in 1949 I joined
with the mayor and other members of the
city council in presenting on behalf of Halifax
a case for a grant in lieu of taxes.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I am very happy to know
that the government now proposes to take
the step represented by this bill. I do not
know that I altogether follow the argument
of the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig). With his legal mind he may be able
to see what I cannot see, but I am inclined
to favour the inclusion of Ottawa within the
provisions of this bill.
The senator from Ottawa who explained
the bill (Hon. Mr. Lambert) said that his city
was in a unique position in so far as federal
properties are concerned. I do not think
that Ottawa's position in this respect is as
bad as that of Halifax, and I will give my
reason for saying that. Our total assessment in Halifax is $76,771,295, and the value
of federal property there which is exempted
from municipal taxation-the value to which
the provisions of this bill should apply-is
$32,536,697.
In my hand I hold a map of
Halifax coloured in yellow, green, red and
blue, the portion coloured in blue representing
federal property. That represents 40 per cent

of our total assessed property.

So you will

appreciate what it means to us in Halifax
to have a bill of this nature coming into
effect.

Certainly we agree that the bill does

not go far enough, but it is a step in the right
direction. The value of the federal properties
in Halifax was determined by a Montreal
real estate appraiser whb went over the
assessment roll and reduced the values stated
there. As a result, the government gave the
city of Halifax last year a grant of $197,394.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Was that on the basis of
your municipal taxation rate?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: As nearly as possible they
used the yardstick which is proposed in this
bill.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That is not an answer to
my question.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I am sorry, but perhaps I
did not hear the question clearly.
Hon. Mr. Euler: After they arrived at the
accepted value as determined by the appraiser
fron Montreal, did they apply to that the
fixed municipal taxation rate?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: That is what we are hoping
will be done. Negotiations are still being
carried on.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I understood you to say
that a grant had been made.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: The government just
allowed us, as I say, a grant of $197,394.
Hon. Mr. Horner: That would not take your
valuation into account?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: No, that would not
take account of our valuation, for that has
not been accepted as yet.
I would also correct, if I may, a statement
made by one senator with regard to the
dockyard. I hope that all naval dockyard
properties will be included under this bill. I
feel sure that they are not among the
properties excluded by section 2 (c). The
senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen)
shakes his head.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I should have thought
that a dockyard fell within the description
in section 2 (c) (iii):
An improvement to land or structure that is not
a building designed for the shelter of people, plant
or movable property.

It would seem to me that under those words
a dockyard would be excluded: but if there
was in the dockyard a warehouse building
for the storage of goods it would, I think, be
included.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: You have to visualize the
dockyard in Halifax, apart from the shipyards. The dockyard is used to repair only

JUNE 26, 1951
naval ships owned by the federal government, and therefore I feel that it should be
included within the provisions of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: If the dockyard can be
considered as a shelter for ships while they
are being repaired, then perhaps it may be
defined as a "shelter of movable property"
and so perhaps be included.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I bow to the superior wisdom of the deputy leader (Hon. Mr. Hugessen).
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I am just expressing
an opinion.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I rose to say that I appreciate this step which is being taken, and I hope
that the government will go further and give
us a greater benefit, for in Halifax, with 41
per cent of our assessed property owned by
the federal government, we certainly have
been carrying on under a handicap. Of
course, we have had a certain benefit from
the fact that the government is using the
property and employing people there, but
that is taken into consideration in the bill by
the calculation based on 75 per cent, as set
out in clause 5 of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I take it that the problem in Halifax is fundamentally one of distribution of assessment.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: That is right. The matter
is under negotiation at the present time. In
addition to the ordinary federal properties
we have of course a good deal of property
owned by the Canadian National Railways,
for Halifax is more or less the eastern
terminus of that railway, and besides we have
properties owned by the National Harbours
Board and other bodies. We are not getting
any grant from the National Harbours Board
in lieu of taxes on its properties, but negotiations are being carried on and we hope to
have them brought within the terms of this
bill.
My chief purpose in rising was to express
appreciation for the step that is being taken
in this bill and to express the hope that a
further step in the same direction will be
taken soon.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Does the city of Halifax
collect no taxes on the Nova Scotian Hotel?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Yes, the city does collect
an amount, which is agreed upon.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators, I
am glad that this bill is to be referred to committee, but as I may not be a member of that
committee I wish to make one or two remarks
now. To my mind the bill is slightly ambiguous in some respects-I do not say that
offensively. at all-but I am particularly

pleased that the government is giving statutory expression to the principle underlying
the bill. While it is probably true that this
matter came to a head through efforts of the
city of Ottawa in particular, it is also true
that, as was pointed out by the senator who
explained the bill (Hon. Mr. Lambert), various
municipalities throughout Canada wherein
federal properties are located have long been
asking for some assistance in lieu of taxes.
For many years I had the honour to represent a municipality where 75 per cent of
the total value of the assessed property was
Crown property, and the remaining 25 per
cent carried the entire financial burden.
Year after year at municipal conventions
the Province of British Columbia put forward resolutions in an attempt to get relief
from the heavy burden upon the municipality, and to draw the attention of the country to the fact that the time might very well
come when the government would own 100
per cent of the property.
The senator who introduced the bill (Hon.
Mr. Lambert) stated, and rightly so, that
towns and cities do bene.fit by having government properties located within their limits;
but he also pointed out that a point may be
reached when federal property is a detriment
to a municipality. We have evidence of the
desire of one city, Hull, to obtain government
property by the transfer of the Printing
Bureau from Ottawa to that city, where a $10
million building is being constructed. In my
opinion, it would take more than a $10 million building to improve the City of Hull.
Indeed, the beautification of the city would
require that half of its buildings be torn
down and rebuilt. However, the new federal
building in Hull will create employment and
result in the building of homes. I do not
suppose that city is particularly worried
about whether or not it gets a cent of tax
from the federal government.
The City of New Westminster, on the
other hand, has been well treated by the
federal government. The authorities who
look after federal property there have agreed
entirely with the assessment made by the
City Assessor. True, there bas been an agitation to require the government to pay taxes
on the total assessed value, and the fight
has been going on for a long time. However,
I want to commend the government for its
move to place on the statutes a provision
which would assist municipalities.
Should I not be able to attend the committee which will consider this bill, I should
like to point out an ambiguity which may

VETERANS' BUSINESS AND
PROFESSIONAL LOANS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Thomas Reid moved the second reading of Bill 286, an Act to amend the Veterans'
Business and Professional Loans Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the Act which
this bill is to amend is not one under which
loans are made, but through it the government guarantees loans to veterans. The purpose of the bill before us is to extend to 1955
the provisions of the Act, and to include in
the definition of "veterans" persons who are
not now eligible to receive benefits under
the Act.
The first clause of the bill before us makes
provision for veterans who have elected to
take benefits under the Veterans' Land Act
but who, for certain reasons, have changed
their minds or for certain reasons have failed
to carry out the arrangement. Under the
amendment such veterans may qualify for a
business loan upon repayment of any benefits
received under the Veterans' Land Act.
By section 3 of the bill, which is similar to
the provision under the Farm Improvement

to veterans who have served and are serving in the Canadian forces during the present
period of unsettled world affairs.
It w'ill be recalled that about a year ago
the Government of Canada under its commitments as a member of the United Nations,
decided to augment its armed forces by the
enlistment of a special force for service in
Korea. At that time it was stated that men
who served in such a force would be assured
of benefits comparable to those given to
veterans of World War II, and appropriate
It may also be
to present-day conditions.
recalled that section 7 of the Canadian
Forces Act, passed in 1950, authorized the
Governor in Council to establish such a
force and to extend to its members such
benefits of veterans' legislation as might be
found suitable.
Pursuant to that authority an order in
council was passed in the latter part of 1950,
under which persons serving in such forces
were guaranteed the benefits of the Pension
Act, the Reinstatement in Civil Employment
Act, the Civil Service Superannuation Act
and the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1940.
As the authority for such orders in council
will expire with the end of the present

JUNE 26, 1951
session, it is necessary to give statutory
effect to the provision of these benefits. This
bill not only does that, but provides for
additional benefits to be given to these
veterans, and to veterans who were similarly
engaged, as and when the conditions of their
service can be determined by events.
The exact nature of the benefits now
being furnished or authorized will become
apparent upon a study of the various clauses
of the bill itself. Briefly stated, the bill
authorizes the Governor in Council to
establish for the purposes of the Act the
conditions of service which may be considered comparable to overseas service in
the last war; and benefits are provided to
the qualified veteran in relation to the kind
of service he had. For example, the advantages of the Reinstatement in Civil Employment Act are open to all persons who served
on the strength of the special force, regardless of the place or places in which they
served. These aids are also available to
veterans who served with the regular forces
for a period not greater than three years.
Further, the full benefits of the Pension Act
are given to persons in the special force,
regardless of where they have served, and
to officers and men of the regular forces or
reserve forces who, while on the strength
of the special force, received injuries in a
theatre of operations. The Unemployment
Insurance Act is made applicable to veterans
of the special force, and, on certain
prescribed conditions, to veterans who served
in the reserve forces or the regular forces
on the strength of the special force. The
Civil Service Superannuation Act is made
applicable to persons who enrolled for the
purpose of service in the special force, and
to officers and men of the reserve forces
serving on the strength of the special force,
as though such service were equivalent to
service duting World War II.
As I have mentioned, the bill provides for
additional benefits to those already covered
by this legislation, and it also empowers the
Governor in Council to extend such benefits
of existing veterans' legislation as may be
considered appropriate to all members of the
regular forces who have had service in a
theatre of operations.

PENSION BILL
MOTION FOR

SECOND READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

Hon. Thomas Reid moved the second reading of Bill 288, an Act to amend the Pension
Act and change the title thereof.
He said: The Department of Veterans
Affairs has received representations from
time to time from veterans' organizations
suggesting amendment of the Pension Act to
make it more equitable in the light of changing conditions. Study having been given to
these representations, the Department of
Veterans Affairs is recommending amendments to the Pension Act, and these will be
found in the bill now before the house. I
may add that they were considered in committee of the other house.
Briefly, the bill provides more adequately
for the children of pensioned widows. At the
present time the pension for a child of a
deceased pensioner cannot be continued
beyond the age of sixteen years in the case
of a boy, and of seventeen years in the case
of a girl. Under this bill it will be possible
to prolong the payments to the age of
twenty-one years if the child concerned is
making satisfactory educational progress, but
could not for financial reasons otherwise
remain at school.
I may point out that under the present
Act 128,050 children are now being assisted,
at an annual cost of approximately $500,000.
A widow receives $75 per month, and grants
payable for children up to the age of nineteen are: for the first child $19, for the second,
$15, for, the third, $12. In future the rates
will be: $38 for the eldest child, $30 for the
second, $24 for the third. In other words, the
allowances for children are being doubled. By
the year 1959 the cost of these benefits will
have risen to $750,000.
The bill deals also with pensioned former
members of the forces who, because of some
legal impediment to marriage, have been
living with common-law wives. The existing
Act provides that only if such a union existed
on or prior to the lst of May 1933 may additional pension for the wife be paid from and
after the subsequent marriage. In this bill
it is proposed to advance the date before

widows of these pensioners eligible for pensions. It is provided, however, that if any
widow's marriage to her late husband took
place between the first day of May 1948 and
the first day of May 1951, no retroactive payment or pension can be paid for any period
prior to the lst of May, 1951.
Clause 17 of the bill clarifies the present
law respecting the use of departmental files
by veterans and responsible veteran organizations in connection with pension matters.
May I take just a minute to indicate our
practice in this respect by comparison with
that of other countries, particularly Great
Britain. I remember that about five years
ago, In connection with the claim of an
Imperial veteran, I appeared before the
representative of the British Ministry at
Ottawa, and asked to see the man's file.
The British official said to me, "In making
that request you are not dealing with a
Canadian matter. Even the Prime Minister
of Great Britain would not be allowed to
see the man's file. We never show these
files to anyone. All I am able to do with
you and for you is to tell you something of
But here in Canada,
what it contains."
members of the Senate or of the House of
Commons are permitted, upon representations, to have access to the departmental
files relating to these matters, and in the
present bill it is proposed to extend the
privilege to those officials of veterans' organizations whose status as the soldiers representatives is properly confirmed.
Further, by section 8 provision is made
respecting the cost of the last illness and
burial of a pensioner, including the erection
of a suitable headstone. At the present
time burial expenses are allowed up to $100,
plus $50 for last illness or medical
expenses. Under the new provisions funeral
expenses will be increased to $135, plus $50
for last illness, and there is the extra
proviso that a proper headstone will be
erected on all graves of veterans.
Honourable senators, as this bill will be
sent to committee, perhaps a more detailed
explanation of it can be given at that time.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: As this bill has not
been distributed to honourable senators in
the form in which it passed the other house,
with amendments, I would move the adjournment of the debate until tomorrow. This will
give any honourable member an opportunity
to speak on the second reading of the bill
after having seen it as passed by the other
house.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Hugessen was
agreed to, and the debate was adjourned.

VETERANS INSURANCE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Thomas Reid moved the second reading of Bill 352, an Act to amend the Veterans
Insurance Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the Veterans
Insurance Act, passed in 1944, came into
force on February 20, 1945. It authorized the
minister to enter into a policy of insurance
with World War II veterans, and certain
other persons, under the terms and conditions
set out in the Act. One of the conditions
limited the period within which a policy of
insurance could be taken out. In 1948, the
time for entering into an insurance contract
was extended, and certain classes of persons
were added to those eligible for insurance.
The time so extended has now expired for
certain persons.
This bill proposes to further extend the
period of time during which an insurance
contract may be entered into. The proposed
date is December 31, 1954, but the cut-off
date for a veteran may be ten years after
the date of his discharge if that date is later
than December 31, 1954.
Under the present Act the sum of $1,000 is
authorized to be paid to the beneficiary at
the time of the death of the insured. It is
proposed to increase that amount to $2,000.
The present Act provides that, if no beneficiary or named-contingent-beneficiary survives the insured, the insurance money to
the extent of the reserve only shall fall into
the estate of the insured. It is proposed under
this bill to eliminate this restriction and to
pay in full the face value of the insurance.
Under the present Act the definition of
"War" sets out the date of commencement
of the war but not the date of termination.
Under this bill it is proposed that World
War II, for purposes of the Act, shall be
deemed to have terminated on September 30,
1947. This is the date upon which all
members of the armed forces were taken off
active service.
Under the present law all applications for
contracts of insurance must be approved at
head office, as a result of which no insurance
benefits are available to dependents where
the applicant dies before his application has
been examined and approved. Section 7 of
the bill before us has the effect of removing
this defect. Contracts will be deemed to have
been entered into in such cases if the initial
premium has been paid and the contract is
one that would have been approved had the
applicant not died.
This bill also includes several minor amendments to the Act. Certain restrictions are

cash value. As of May 31, 1951, 14,850 insurance policies, totalling $31,194,167.10, were in
force.
As of March 31, 1951, the Returned Soldiers'
Insurance Fund, which consists of all
premiums received, together with interest at
4 per cent, less all claims, surrender
values, and other payments, amounted to
$25,483,756.43.
Section 1 of the bill eliminates the time
restrictions found in the present Act, and
allows any legally adopted child to benefit as
a "child" under the Act.
Section 2 increases the amount of the insurance from $1,000 to $2,000.
It gives the
Minister authority to pay not more than $2,000
on the death of the insured, and provides that
the remainder, if any, shall be paid to the
beneficiary as an annuity.
Section 3 repeals section 5 of the Act and
substitutes a new section 5, under which the
insured may designate as a beneficiary a
grandchild, parent, brother, sister, or some
other person. In this respect the revision
brings the Act into line with the principle
of the Veterans Insurance Act.
Section 5 of the bill provides that no
premiums are to be paid by the insured after

It has been found difficult in certain cases
to determine the question of permanency of
a disability. This difficulty will be removed
by the amendment set forth in section 3
of the bill. By this amendment the insured,
as to the question of waiver of premiums,
shall be deemed to be totally and permanently
disabled if his total disability has existed
continuously for a period of at least one
year.
Section 15 of the bill makes it clear that
where the beneficiary named in the policy
dies before receiving all the insurance money,
the remaining proceeds of the policy to
which such beneficiary is entitled shall pass
to his or her estate.
Honourable senators, if this bill is given

more detailed explanation may be obtained.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

SECOND READING

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Thomas Reid moved the second reading of Bill 389, an Act to amend The Returned
Soldiers' Insurance Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the Returned
Soldiers' Insurance Act became effective on
September 1, 1920, and applications were
received until September 1, 1923. During that
period 33,577 insurance policies, totalling
$75,728,500, were issued. On June 11, 1928
the period for receiving applications was
re-opened, and applications were received
until August 31, 1933. During that period

possible alternative measures of old age

test for pensioners, and including plans based
on contributory insurance principles, the
probable cost thereof and possible methods of
provid.ing therefor, and the constitutional and
financial adjustments, if any, required for the
effective operation of such plans, and other
related matters. That, honourable senators,
is a background of our social security
planning.
I should like to re-emphasize the fact that
the bill now before us is to provide assistance
to the aged, rather than a pension. This Act
is to come into effect on the same date, namely
January 1, 1952, as the Act to provide
assistance for blind persons.
I shall deal briefly with the clauses of the
bill, which for the most part are selfexplanatory.
Sorme of the definitions set out in section 2
of the bill are as follows:
(a) "agreement" means an agreement made under
section three;
(b) "application" means an application for old
age assistance;
(c) "assistance" means old age assistance provided under provincial law to the persons and under
the conditions specified in this Act and the regulations;
(d) "Minister" means the Minister of National
Health and Welfare;
(e) "provincial authority" means the officer or
body charged with the administration of the provincial law;

The word "recipient" is used throughout this
measure instead of the more common term
"pensioner".
Section 3 has to do with agreements with
the provinces. I may say that even after the
passage of this bill further agreements
between the federal governrment and the
provinces will be required to carry out the
provisions of the Act and to make regulations.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask a question at
this point? If a province decides not to take
advantage of the provisions of the Act as

Hon. Mr. Isnor: I take it that the question
of the honourable senator from King's refers
to the portion of the cost paid by the provinces in relation to the present Act?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: What have they been
paying under the present legislation, and
what will they be required to pay when the
new social security legislation is passed?
Does the result show an increase or a
decrease?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I looked up the facts relating to the province from which the honourable senator comes, namely Nova Scotia, and
I find that under this measure, whereby the
province is required to pay 50 per cent of
the monthly payment to persons between 65
and 69 years of age, the amount is less than
the present contribution of 25 per cent of
the monthly payment under the present Act.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Does the honourable
member know what the situation is with
respect to the other provinces?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Perhaps I can explain it
by placing on the record a table showing a
comparison of the present cost to the provinces of maintaining old age pensioners
over 70 years of age, and the estimated cost
of their contributions to assistance to persons
between 65 and 69 years. This is the table:

from their own resources.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. Isnor: The calculation is figured
on a 25-75 per cent basis.
To continue my remarks on the bill: section
6 provides for the obtaining of information
from census records. Section 7, a very
important clause, deals with the provisions
of the agreements to be made between the
provinces and the federal government. The
federal and provincial authorities will meet
and make agreements, and regulations
pursuant to those agreements.
I will allude to only one point in this
connection. It will be recalled that under
the existing Act the province may recoup
itself from a pensioner's estate and pay to
the federal government its share. That provision has been changed; but if a province
should desire that the arrangement be continued, it can still recover payments from the
estate and pay a percentage to the dominion.
Section 9 deals with the duration of agreements. Section 10 prescribes how they shall
come into force.
Section 11 relates to
regulations.
Of the last two sections, number 12 provides for the submission to parliament by
the minister of a report showing the operation for the year of the agreements made
under the Act and the payments made to the
provinces under each of the agreements.
By the final clause the Act shall come into
force on the first day of January, 1952.
Incidentally, I might mention, in reply to the
honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden), that the measures with which we
are dealing will, I understand, come into
force on the same day.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: What is the statute under
which the dominion at present pays 75 per
cent?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: The Old Age Pension Act.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The statutes to which the
honourable senator refers are those referred
to on page 2 of the Old Age Assistance Bill.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: The title "Old Age Pension
Act" has been changed. In future it will be
referred to as the Old Age Security Act. The
word "security" is new.
Hon. Mr. Reid: In section 7, paragraph (vi),
page 4, there is reference to those who shall
still be eligible to vote "at any provincial or
municipal election." Should not the word
"federal" also be included? Although the
province is in charge of this part of the
security or welfare plan, the dominion pays
50 per cent of the cost, and the intention is
that receipt of the assistance "shall not by
itself constitute a disqualification from voting" at any provincial or municipal election.
Would it not be well to add "federal"?

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: May I point out to my

honourable friend that this clause contains a
provision to which a province must covenant
and agree. The province must covenant and
agree that the recipient shall not be disqualified from voting at any provincial or
municipal election. Obviously a province
could not convenant that the person should
not be disqualified from voting at a dominion
election.
On motion of Hon. Mrs. Fallis the debate
was adjourned.

FEDERAL. DISTRICT COMMISSION

BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. Norman P. Lambert moved the second

reading of Bill 397, an Act to amend the
Federal District Commission Act, 1927.
He said: Honourable senators, I do not
think this bill requires a lengthy explanation.
When it was dealt with in the House of
Commons it received the unanimous support
of all parties, and was disposed of in
approximately fifteen minutes. At that time
the chairman and members of the Federal
District Commission were lauded for their
splendid work.
I would just point out that there are three
technical changes proposed by this bill. The
first is to permit the Federal District Commission to include a member for Newfoundland. A second amendment is to place the
Federal District Commission under the
jurisdiction of the Board of Transport Commissioners. That jurisdiction does not exist at
the present time simply because it is a case of
one commission dealing with another. Before
the Federal District Commission can remove
the cross-town tracks in Ottawa and build a

JUNE 26, 1951
five-and-a-half-mile railroad to the suggested
terminal area, it must first deal with the Board
of Transport Commissioners and receive the
permission of the government by order in
council. This will provide a double check.
The third amendment is to authorize the
Federal District Commission to pay grants
to municipalities for land acquired for
inclusion in the Gatineau Park. These grants
are to compensate for the loss to these
municipalities of tax revenue during the tax
year by reason of the acquisition of the
property by the commission.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: What do you mean when
you say that this commission is to come under
the jurisdiction of the Board of Transport
Commissioners? Will the Board of Transport Commissioners be supreme?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The Board of Transport
Commissioners will have charge of the
administration of the Railway Act.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I understand that.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: A permit must be
obtained by the Federal District Commission
with respect to all undertakings in connection
with the building of railways and so on. As
my honourable friend from Rosetown (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) is a constitutional lawyer, be
may understand the difficulty involved in
a commission receiving special statutory
approval when submitting proposed expenditures to the Board of Railway Commissioners.
This bill will overcome a technical point and
leave the way absolutely open for the commission to apply to the Board of Transport
Commissioners for approval of any railway
development required in connection with the
implementation of the National Capital
District Plan.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Has it anything to do
with the removal of the Union Station and
the railway tracks to .it?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: It is pretty well understood that there is no prospect of removing
the Union Station from its present location
for the next twenty-five years.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Then we shall not have
to worry about that, because we shah not
be here.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: It is proposed to move
the freight yards to an area south of the
city, and to do away with all cross-town
tracks in Ottawa. Before this -can be done,
however, the Board of Transport Commissioners will have to approve the plan, and a
permit will have to be granted by way of
an order -in council. These amendments have
to do with what are purely techincal difficulties which now stand in the way of the
work of the commission.

Honourable senators, I should like to associate myself-and I am sure every member
of this house would want to do likewisewith the complimentary references that have
been made about Mr. Bronson, Chairman of
the Federal District Commission, and the
other members of the commission, for their
magnificent and unselfish devotion to the
cause of the National Capital District Plan
over the past fifteen or twenty years. All
the fine things that have been said about
them have been richly deserved. I happen
to know the unobtrusive character of the
work that these men have done, and without
any compensation except the sense of having
done a decent job of public work.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators, I
do not rise to oppose the appointment of the
members of the Federal District Commission.
As a member of the parliamentary committee dealing with this matter a few years
ago I got to know the various men connected with the Federal District Commission,
and I know of their work and their ability.
The appointment of another commission may
be all right, but I am alarmed at the power
which is being handed to it without any
direct control from parliament. We are giving
these men a great deal of authority by granting them the power to construct railways
and to buy and lease and to enter into agreements with realty companies. I should like
to warn the government of the dangers of
this practice, and I would suggest that they
see to it that a special parliamentary conmittee is set up to which the members of
the Federal District Commission could give
an annual accounting.
I am sure we are all in agreement with
what the honourable senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) has said about the chairman and members of this commission. What
I have to say is in no way a reflection on
them. They are up against a difficult problem, I wonder how many of us realize that
in carrying out the National Capital District
Plan they have to deal with something like
thiry-five different government bodies. There
are twenty-two municipalities in Quebec and
eight are in Ontario. Then there are the
Ontario and Quebec provincial governments,
the federal government itself, and the Ottawa
Planning Area Board. This sort of thing
presents a real stumbling block to those who
are trying to develop this great national
capital.
Honourable senators, I think I see another
principle being broken this afternoon. We
just gave second reading to a bill authorizing grants to municipalities in lieu of taxei.
These grants are to be given when government lands and buildings are removed from

SENATE
the taxation of municipalities, and so some
measure of compensation is given. I am all
in favour of giving the municipalities a
grant, but this bill is setting a precedent.
It gives special consideration by taking, I
think, 5,000 acres out of the Gatineau Park
area.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I think the federal government is going 'to pay something like $5,000
to the municipality involved.
I am not
against the principle involved here, but the
government is augmenting or adding to the
Act to which I have already referred, and
is giving an extra grant of money. I think
it should all be done under the one heading
or bill. If we are going to give an extra
amount, let us be more open about it.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: May I interrupt my
honourable friend?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: In authorizing the Federal District Commission to pay to Masham
township certain moneys in lieu of taxes
the federal government is delegating to the
commission exactly the same kind of power
that it has delegated to the Canadian National
Railways and to the Central Mortgage and
Housing Corporation, namely, power to mlake
separate negotiations wherever it is felt
desirable to do so. I think that is all there
is to this. After all, the Federal District
Commission is the authority that administers
the federal district itself; and, as my honourable friend from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) knows, this includes the Gatineau park
area. I 'cannot see that there is any conflict
in principle between the making of grants to
municipalities by the bill to which we gave
second reading this afternoon, and the delegating of this power to the commission.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I have every faith in the
commission, for I know of the good work that
it has been and is doing. I was principally
referring to the difficulty that the commission
has in doing business with such a large number of municipal and other bodies, and I
think there must be some solution to that
problem. Also, I do think that the commission
should meet a parliamentary committee once
every session. The commission would not
mind that at all, I feel sure, for it has a good
story to tell, and its appearance before a
committee would result in good publicity
being given throughout Canada to all that is
being done towards the building of a national
capital.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: May I ask if my honourable friend would like Mr. Bronson, the
Chairman of the commission, to bring before

the committee a map for reference, and especially for the purpose of making clear the railway problem with which they are confronted?
I think that would throw a good deal of light
on the subject.
Hon. Mr. Reid: All right. I would also like
to have Mr. Greber appear before the committee, for I am one of those who question the
wisdom of bringing a man from an old
country like France to give effect to our ideas
for a national capital in this relatively new
country. As everybody knows, because of
changes that have been made on Confederation Square you take your life in your hands
every time you attempt to cross a street there.
It bas been well said that the place should
be renamed Confusion Square.
I also wish to say here that I do not think
much progress will be made towards development of a national capital unless greater
co-operation is received from the city of
Ottawa; and how can you hope to do much
with such an unreasonably large body as
the present city council? This relatively
small city bas 28 aldermen, 4 controllers and
a mayor, a total of 33 members on the city
council.
Just think of it! At the last
municipal election the citizens voted in
favour of a reduction in the number of wards
and aldermen, but I doubt very much if any
reduction will be made. It is the old story,
that every member of the council will favour
a reduction so long as it does not apply to
himself.
I could go on and say plenty about the
city of Ottawa, but perhaps this is enough
for the time being. I should like to feel that
some real progress was being made towards
the building of a great national capital, but
I fear that none of us now in this chamber
will live long enough to see the completion
of half of the scheme as outlined in the plan
displayed in this building.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: You never can tell.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Well, if it turns out that i
am wrong, I shall be the first to admit it.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
I just wish to remind you that it is quite a
long time since I first applied in this house
the name "Confusion Square" to that section
of Ottawa between the city post office and
the Union Station.
As to Mr. Greber, I have read articles by
Canadians who claim that we have in this
country lots of men well qualified to supervise the planning of the national capital. I
certainly hope that I shall not be here to
witness one of the things recommended by
Mr. Greber-the destruction of the present
Union Station and the building of another at
some considerable distance from the site of

JUNE 26, 1951
the present terminal. There will never be
any sensible development of a national
capital if we keep doing things that can only
result in increasing freight rates and further
cluttering up the streets and driveways with
buses and trucks. If the Union Station were
located at a considerable distance from the
centre of the city, freight and passenger
business between the station and the city
would have to be handled by buses and
trucks. The railways would lose business
and would have to increase their rates, and
traffic conditions in the city would become
even more dangerous than they are now.
The present location of the station is a
practical one, so why change it?
I am one of those who think that before a
man sets out to beautify the grounds around
his home-whether he lives in a city or on a
farm-he should know that he is in a financial position to pay the cost. Canada could
make itself more beautiful in many other
ways than this way of building up a large
national capital in Ottawa. For instance, we
could irrigate areas where it is possible to
grow enormous quantities of grain. If we
carry on as we are doing, railway freight
rates will become so high that people in the
central and eastern provinces will no longer
be able to pay for transportation of grain
from the bread basket of the world, Western
Canada. We often hear it said that this
country will in time have a population of
100 million people.
Well, if that ever
happens, I hope most of them will be wise
enough to settle as near as possible to the
source of the world's finest food. I still
think that perhaps the national capital of
this country should be in the centre of that
area rather than in the heart of this "neck
of the woods".
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Why not in Winnipeg?
Hon. Mr. Horner: That would certainly be
a more central site than Ottawa.
I like natural beauty, and I deeply regret
that I was not able to see the Ottawa district before it was spoiled by the hands of
man. To my mind the greatest natural
beauty is to be found in areas left in their
natural state. City boulevards and so on
do not appeal to me as they seem to appeal
to some people; but still it hurts me when
tere is needless destruction of these things.
After streets have been built and sound
buildings erected, along comes somebody
who proposes to destroy everything and
replace it by something newer. I certainly
dislike seeing anything like that.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators, I
think we all join in the commendation
expressed by the senator from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert) of the Chairman and members

of the Federal District Commission for the
excellent and unpaid public service rendered
by them.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: In the course of the
debate a number of interesting comments
have been made. With reference to a point
raised by the senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid), I will admit that there
is of course something to be said for limiting
the powers given by parliament to a commission of this kind. I would remind my honourable friend, however, that there are already
at least two restrictions on the commission's powers, particularly with reference
to capital expenditure on the construction of railways.
In the first place,
as will be seen from subsection (3) of
the new section 7A, which is set out in section 2 of the bill, if the commission proposes
to construct any railway, it will have to
proceed under the provisions of the Railway
Act, and therefore will be required to obtain
the approval of the Board of Transport Commissioners. That has already been pointed
out during the discussion. The second limitation is, of course, imposed through parliamentary control over the commission's
finances. Before the commission could undertake any expensive project it would have to
come to parliament for a vote of money.
Therefore, there are at least those two measures of control.
On the other hand, I was somewhat
impressed by the suggestion that the commission should be invited to appear before a
committee of this house on occasions when it
may seem desirable to do so, in order to
explain clearly the progress that is being
made with the beautification plans which are
being developed for the Capital.
Hon. Mr. King: That is within our right and
power.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Quite. We are entirely
within our rights in asking them to appear
before us.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: Has the commission
power to obligate itself to spend money on
railways, for instance, and then ask parliament to vote it?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: No, it would have to
come to parliament to get the money for the
work.
I was about to deal with the question of
railways, and in that connection I may say
that I am in complete agreement with the
words uttered earlier in the debate on another
matter this afternoon by the honourable
senator who leads the opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) and his colleague the senator from

SENATE
Blaine Lake. (Hon. Mr. Horner). I fail to see
the necessity or the utility of tearing down
the present railway station, which is well
located in the centre of the city and is particularly convenient for out-of-town businessmen who wish to arrive at a place where they
will be within a few minutes walk of the
principal government offices.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask whether that
plan has been adopted?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: No.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: No; but it is part of the
Greber plan, which envisages the ultimate
destruction of the present station.
Hon. Mr. Euler: But it has not been decided
upon?

THE ESTIMATES
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON FINANCE

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the report of the Standing Committee on
Finance on the Estimates laid before parliament for the fiscal year ending March 31,
1952.
Hon. T. A. Crerar, Chairman of the Standing Committee on Finance, moved concurrence in the report.
He said: Honourable senators, after having
a look at the Order Paper and observing the
number of bills that are there for ýconsideration by this house, and having regard also
to the fact that we are near the end of the
session, I shall make my remarks brief,
which I am certain will meet with full
approval.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: This report deals with
matters that are of immediate and pressing
concern, not only to Canadian people individually but to their representatives in the
halls of parliament and in the various legislatures, who have to carry on the public
business of the country. If we lived under
a form of dictatorship these problems would
not bother us. But we live under a system
of representative government, whereby the
people elect their representatives to parliament, to legislatures and to municipal
councils; and upon those representatives there
rests the responsibility of carrying on the
public business entrusted to their charge with
the greatest degree of fidelity and care that
they can give to it.
The importance of representative government is not, it seems to me, as clearly understood in these days as it was in years long
past when, at times, people rose in rebellion
against misgovernment and took a much more
active interest in public affairs. The world
has of course changed greatly; people today
have preoccupations and distractions that
take up their time, with the result that more
and more the responsibilities of the State

JUNE 27, 1951
rest upon the elected representatives of the
people, who not only must keep in touch
with the electors and inform them of the
progress of policies but, if possible, get their
guidance and direction. This apparent apathy
in public opinion is in part reflected in the
fact that one sees elections at ýall levels of
government at which less than half the
number of registered and qualified electors
turn out to vote. This apathy, as I said a
moment ago, is traceable to the numerous
distractions which occupy our time and
thoughts. I am convinced also that in large
measure due to the dislocating effect of two
world wars within one generation. I think
I have previously remarked in this chamber
that nothing is se degrading and demoralizing to the human spirit as the devastation
caused by war.
Having that in mind, it seems te me that
if our democratic way of life and the system
of government which we all love are to
survive, we must be continuously on guard
to see that government is well conducted, to
try to arouse and maintain public interest in
elections, te see that laws are wise and taxes
just, and, if possible, that government
expenditures are of modest proportions.
There can be no greater mistake than to
believe that the liberties and freedoms we
possess today cannot be challenged or
changed. Other countries whose democratic
systems were apparently as firmly established
as ours have travelled that road, -and we too
may find ourselves slipping down the path
which leads te change.
Se te preserve
liberty-that great blessing of humanitywe must be eternally on guard. With this
thought in mind, some emphasis is laid in
the report upon the dangers which lurk in
our ecenomy and, probably, in our conception
as individuals of this business of government at all levels in Canada. The greatest danger which faces the Canadian people,
and not only them but all the western democracies, is the peril of inflation. In our report
we have laid some emphasis upon that
peril,
and
offered
'certain suggestions
which may aid in guarding against it.
Of course the causes of inflation are well
known. In general they were aptly described
by a witness before our committee as "too
much money chasing too few goods".
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: What has created the
condition of too much money? In the main,
as indicated in the report, it was inflationary
processes that were liberated during the
conduct of the war. There has never been
a war of any magnitude which did not set
loose these inflationary processes. Why?
80713-45J

Because credit must be expanded, and often
money has te be created te finance the
struggle in which the nation is engaged. In
the last war, as the report states, forces
whose incidence was world-wide were generated te a degree never before known. Following the war, democratic governments were
faced with the tremendous task of bringing
this flood of money under control. In an
authoritarian state that would have been
comparatively simple. In Russia it would
be, and was done by simple issuance of a
decree that every persen who possessed
rubles had te surrender them at a certain
time and take in exchange what the government saw fit te give him. An authoritarian
government can prescribe what people shall
buy, how much they shall buy, and what
price they shall pay. It can lay down rigid
rules te govern every segment of its economy.
It can regulate the working hours of the
individual; it can say te him, "You must
work at this job, not at that one".
Hon. Mr. Euler: We have that, too!
Hon. Mr. Crerar: In other words, freedom
disappears. I emphasize this aspect because
it seems to me of tremendous importance.
What is imperilled is the maintenance of
freedom and liberty, two principles which
are imbedded in the whole structure of our
way of life.
I said a moment ago that inflation was
the result of too much money chasing too
few goods. We had in this country a situation which was by no means confined te us,
but common te every demecratic country,
wherein ordinary civilian demands for goods
and services were thrust aside by government order, and rightly se, because of the
need te marshal and direct the resources of
the nation te the great adventure of winning
the war. To my mind it is impossible te
have wars without infiation. Government
bonds were sold te the extent of billions of
dollars. Everywhere the public, unable te
expend its money on automobiles, furniture,
refrigerators, radios and other electrical
equipment, was buying these bonds. Many
people were able te pay off their debts: in
the Western Provinces during the war years
there was a tremendous reduction of farm
mortgage debt. But when the war ended,
the opportunity te buy articles of which they
had been deprived during the war was presented te individuals who had accumulated
large supplies of money, and there resulted
-a tremendous stimulus te our whole economy.
I do not wish te criticize adversely the
conception of the welfare state; but there is
no doubt in my mind that the expenditures
upon welfare projects-not only in Canada,

SENATE
but in the United States and in Great
Britain-plus the savings of private citizens,
accumulated a purchasing power which
unquestionably fed the fires of inflation.
Take for example the expenditures of all
governments in Canada in respect of what is
known as social welfare, but exclusive of
soldiers' pensions and soldier .care. In 1939
the cost at all levels of government in
Canada was $208 million. Under the general
heading of social welfare, not only the
federal government, but every province, and
almost every municipality in the land,
includes items for this kind of outlay.
So in 1939 our total expenditure for this
purpose was $208 million. Ten years later,
in 1949, it was over $800 million. At the
same time our public debt charges naturally
had gone up, because we had to borrow to
carry on the operations associated with the
war. The cost of veterans' pensions and
after-care in 1939 amounted to a little over
$55 million. In 1949 it was over $200 million.
So that if we put together veterans' pensions
and care and add them to the ordinary
expenditures on public welfare, we find that
in 1949 we were spending over $1 billion.
Increases have taken place since then. We
have not got the figures for the present
annual period, but I venture to say that it
is close to $1,200 million.
Perhaps some of my colleagues will differ
with me on my next point, but I think it is
important that we considJer it and look at it
objectively. Yesterday we gave consideration
to two bills that will extend the whole area
of pensions. At the next session of parliament
we shall consider the matter of paying pensions to everyone over seventy years of age,
without a means test. According to all available data this will mean an increase over
existing pension payments of probably $300
million. We shall then be in a position where,
by 1952, we will be spending under this general heading pretty close to $1,500 million.
This will include soldiers' pensions and aftercare, to wéhich of course no one should object,
for our disabled soldiers must always have
our care. This scheme of pensions is based on
the report of the joint parliamentary conmittee that examined the matter. We could
have looked at these pension proposals in a
somewhat different way had the Korean war
not come about and had the heavy increase
in defence expenditures not been found
necessary. When the report was made it was
not anticipated that by 1951 this country
would be spending approximately $1,750
million on defence. Neither was it anticipated that within three years the government
would be spending a total of $5 billion for
defence. That is the government program

and no one can conscientiously challenge it.
Without questioning the bona ßldes of those
who believe in the welfare state, and the
motives of those who support the idea of old
age pensions without a means test, to
everyone over seventy years of age, we
should examine to find out how far we are
committing the economy of this country.
This brings me to another point mentioned
in the Finance Committee's report. The
Finance Minister, in his budget speech,
estimated that the gross national product of
this country in the present fiscal year would
probably reach $20 billion. It may be
assumed, therefore, that for the same period
our net national income will be about $16
billion.
What do we mean by net national income?
That is the amount that Canadians, taken as
a whole, have for their living expenses and
to pay their taxes and to accumulate their
savings. Out of that amount the first charge
involves taxes which total more than $5
billion. This means that close to one-third
of our net national income will be absorbed
in taxes. Then we have to consider the
living of our people. We have on the whole
what may be described as a high standard
of living and we do not want to sec it cut
down. The amount taken for our standard
of living and the amount required to pay
taxes narrow the margins of savings. Now,
as these margins are narrowed we find we
have not the funds available te invest in the
necessary development of this country. The
idea I wish to convey to my colleagues is
that we know what happens to a farmer or
a businessman who spends beyond his
income. Ordinarily we think such a person
is taking a risk if he incurs expenditures
today in the expectation that the prosperity
of tomorrow will take care of them. If our
economy could be depended upon to keep
going up and up without further inflation, I
think we could navigate with a considerable
degree of safety. But we are taking that
chance and we should never lose sight of
the fact that inflation has tremendously
distorted our economy. If we take last year's
gross national product of $18 billion and
translate it into 1939 dollars, the total gross
product would be a little under $10 billion.
When we look at the figure of $18 billion we
are bemused by it. And we think we are
very prosperous. But we have the appearance of prosperity only because inflation has
disguised that picture and distorted it. It
is true that a great many people in Canada
today are living better than they lived in
1939. All you have to do to prove that is
to take the cost of living index, which
measures the day-to-day living of the people
and shows the inflation that has taken place,

JUNE 27, 1951
and set it alongside the average of the wage
increases, and it will be seen that without
doubt-and my authority is the Department
of Labour-that the average of wage
increases has advanced substantially beyond
the increase in the price level.
But there is one section of the Canadian
people, a very large section, who are suffering grievously today, and that is the class
who are living on savings or annuities or
other means of protection that they had set
up against their old age. Take, for instance,
a man who in 1939-or even in 1942-had
$10,000 invested in Government bonds at 3
per cent. He got from them an income of $300,
which is the same income that he gets from
them today, if he is still holding them; but
the $300 will buy little more than half of
what it would 'buy in 1939 and in addition
his taxes have increased. As I have said an
important section of our people have been
unable to protect themselves against at least
some of the increases that have taken place
in prices and taxation. And I wish to remind
the house, as I think I have done before,
that those people are the best .class in our
community. They are the middie class-if
you like, the lower class-the people who
have been running the municipal business in
most of our municipalities, who have been
doing our church work and looking after our
schools. They are good worthy citizens. It
is tragic to contemplate what this inflationary
process has done to them and what it will
continue to do to them if it is not checked.
The Minister of Finance outlined certain
policies of a fiscal character which he claimed
would be a check on the inflationary process.
For instance, fiscal policy was used to make
money dearer. Or, te put it another way,
the government's policy resulted in the interest rate being raised. True, in consequence,
the price of governzment bonds was depressed,
but the point I am making at the moment is
that the interest rate was raised. The banks
tightened up on the granting of credit; there
were consumer 'credit restrictions; and new
business enterprises were told that unless
they could get from the Minister of Defence
Production a certificate that their new
development was essential for defence purposes they would be refused the right to
charge depreciation for a period of four
years.
There is no doubt whatever that these
policies are working today, but let us not
delude ourselves by losing sight of the fact
that in certain areas of our country they are
going to produce some unemployment and
some hardship. There will be pressures upon
the government, upon parliament, and upon

members of parliament to have the restrictions relaxed, becaùse when people have lived
in the environment of inflation they want to
continue living in it. It has a sort of
exhilarating effect upon people. It is something like the effect that narcotics have upon
persons who take them. At first these persons
are stimulated, they feel fine and wish to con,
tinue the indulgence, but after a few weeks
or months they discover that in order to feel
the same effect they must take a larger dose.
As I see it, inflation has that kind of effect
upon our economy. So I venture to express
the hope here, that public opinion will support the Minister of Finance in the steps that
he bas taken to try and hold this thing in
check. It we cannot discipline ourselves to
control inflation voluntarily, with a minimum
of official controls, then the only recourse
will be the regimenting of the country from
coast to coast. I was a member of the
government during the war period and I know
the difficulties that there were in making the
controls effective. To do so the authorities
must be prepared to be ruthless. And let
me say here that a large measure of the success of the wartime controls between 1941
and 1946 was due to the courage of the man
who was at the head of them. There is no
You cannot prosecute
question of that.
people aIl over the country for violating controls-and that is the necessity which confronts you-unless you can get a great body
of voluntary support for the controls. In the
stress of war, when dangers are upon us or
threatening us, you can get that kind of support from the people in a sufficient measure
to make the controls work. But in the
absence of that over-all danger, to impose
controls would I think place upon the whole
machinery of government a strain that would
make maintenance of the controls very
difficult.
If the government once goes into controls
it will have te make them apply widely, to
wages and salaries, to prices and everything
else, and there will have to be rigorous and
unrelenting prosecution of violators. That
is the way things are done in Russia. But
so far as I am concerned I want to see the
other method tried here. It would be a
grand thing, honourable senators, if the
Canadian people, conscious of the dangers
that are threatening them, could discipline
themselves to such a degree as to be able te
get by the present crisis without having to
undergo the hardships of controls. And that
can be done, but it will require courage,
steadfastness and dissemination of knowledge
among the -people. Perhaps that is a little
too much to expect.

SENATE

I conclude Just as I did in my report. I
have an abundance of faith in the Canadian
people. I have no patience whatever with
the public man who thinks that he has to
offer some sort of monetary inducement to
electors to obtain their support. If he goes
out and discusses issues with them on the
basis of reason, the overwhelming body of
the people will respond to his appeal. Of
course, differences will arise on public policy.
If our democratic way of life is to be continued, it is important and necessary that we
do have differences. But let us never forget
that the authority resides in the people. Let
us ever be ready to trust the people and
enlighten them, so that they may have before
them the knowledge to guide them in their
responsibilities as individuals for the whole
business of government. Perhaps it is too
much to expect; but if we as patriotic citizens
think of the future welfare of our country and
remember the fact that those who ýpreceded us
handed down a country worth fighting for
and preserving, and if we put these considerations ahead of the petty political
advantage of the moment, I have no doubt
whatever that this country can survive the
perils which today threaten it, and that we
can get back on the highway to progress,
sanity and peace.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Calvert C. Prati: Honourable senators,
we have listened to a speech by the senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) which I am
sure we will all remember for a long time.
In it he dealt with fundamental matters
that really count. His speech reveals the
earnestness which be bas shown in his office
as Chairman of the Finance Committee. I
think the report of that committee, and particularly the foreword, which is the product
of the 'chairman, contains a great deal of
meat for thought and guidance in our
deliberations.
Although I was not a member of the
Finance Committee, I took the opportunity
of sitting in on as many meetings as I could.
I was much impressed with the ability of
the executive officers of the various departments to answer clearly from first-hand
knowledge the questions put by the committee. The capacity of these men demonstrates the efficiency and high calibre of the
heads of the governmental departments. The
committee dealt with the officials who
appeared before it on an administrative basis;
matters of policies were out of their sphere.
I am glad that the chairman's statement
dealt with matters on the broader plane.
Every thinking iperson is alarmed at the
rapid increase in governmental expenditures.
I shall not be referring in this talk to defence

expenditures or to the new measures of
social security, but rather to the multiplication of the ordinary public services. The evidence given before the committee impressed
me strongly with the need for effective
centralized control of departmental expenditures and commitments of public funds. AU
departments seem to be building up their
own services, and dipping into what may
appear to them to be an inexhaustible public
fund. Active and energetic handling of
departments is, I know, the lifeblood of
public administration; but how much each
department should spend in relation to the
total sum that the country should collect
and spend is of most vital consequence.
True, one can say that parliament is the
controlling body, and that it represents the
people. The elected assembly takes weeks
debating the estimates and public accounts.
We hear much of the fact that the people
demand this and that; but is it not rather,
that the elected representatives of the people
continue to stimulate the demand, and in
fact create demands for more public expenditurcs?
I have never been an elected member of
parliament, and so I have not been brought
up to think politically; so by reason of that
fact alone I feel justified in speaking on these
matters for the ordinary citizen. If just a
small portion of the time spent by members
in telling the people how much they should
get for this and for that, and how the government could carry this or that burden, was
spent advising the people of the dangers to
their own living by having the government
spend too large a proportion of its revenue
for certain purposes, a great public service
would be done. One may say that is poor
politics. Well, perhaps it is; I do not know.
This I do know: the impression of good
statesmanship will last longer and sink deeper
than the impression of good politics.
No one can say that the people of this
country complain of expenditures occasioned
by war or national emergency.
Canada's
experience in that respect is something of
which she can be justly proud. If, however,
the level of such emergency spending is taken
as justification for peacetime spending, I
contend that public sentiment is being grossly
misjudged.
Now, what do we find in the estimates
which are at present under review? I do
not intend to comment on expenditures for
national defence, except to say that such
expenditures make it all the more necessary
that the greatest care be exercised in spending the people's money for administration.
The Chairman of the Finance Committee
has pointed out that in 1949-50 our gross

JUNE 27, 1951
national production reached a total of about
$18 billion. I shall not dwell on the estimates
in this connection, except to say that based
on the dollar value of the thirties a comparison of federal expenditures reveals a ratio
of over 20, per cent in 1949-50 as against
12-9 per cent in 1930. There is no yardstick
for arriving at very precise percentages of
comparisons in this respect. The lesson we
can draw from that situation is that government expenditures are keeping pace with the
inflationary trend of recent times. That, to
my mind, is highly dangerous. The government is rightly, and with commendable foresight, putting on the brakes to stop the
upward spiral; but expenditures for public
services have the habit of remaining
irreducible.
We hear from all directions expressions of
alarm at the tide of inflation sweeping the
country, and the outcry to arrest it. With
government expenditures mounting by reason
of the constant enlargement of services, and
the more inflation is arrested, the deeper government expenditures dip into the taxpayers'
pocket and the more it hurts. Civil Service
salaries and wages for the year 1938-39,
apart from those for national defence and
defence production, amounted to $74 million.
The recent budget provided under this heading the amount of $301 million. Travelling
expenses alone increased from $3,750,000 in
1938-39 to $14,500,000 for the current year,
or an annual increase of $11 million. To my
mind, such an increase is fantastic. One
could go on dealing with increases under
various headings, but for the sake of brevity
these two may serve as illustrations. I
know that with the growth of the country
both in population and production, and the
deflated value of the dollar for goods and
services, government expenditures have to
increase. I contend, however, that the
increase is dangerously high. It is taking too
large a slice of the people's income. It is
taking too big a portion of what otherwise
could be development capital for industry,
and is cutting too deeply into people's
income and into those means of saving which
alone can make our citizens independent and
free from becoming charges on the state.
I can well understand why a country
which has reached the zenith of its industrial
progress and is confronted with diminishing
earning power for too large a population will
turn to measures of state guardianship.
Neither of those conditions is applicable to
Canada today, but we have to watch the
trends.
The industrial potential of Canada is tremendous, and Canadians could hardly be
blamed if they were the most optimistic

people in the world. The expenditures of
today will look comparatively small in years
to come, but we should not overlook the fact
that people have to live in the present. The
soundness or unsoundness of our economy
now will largely determine the measure and
pattern of our economy, and indeed the
maintenance and extension of our free institutions, in the future.
Last year I travelled across the Atlantic,
and while in a certain country was asked
my impressions of the changes which had
occurred since my previous visit a few years
before. My answer came very readily: it was
that half of the population seemed to me to
be filling out forms, interpreting and applying them, and the other half was working to
produce something to be reported on the
forms. Too great an extension of government control, and the doing for the individual
of what he should be doing for himself and
what in a free country he wants to do for
himself, will bring about that state of things.
We in Canada are not by any means at that
stage-far from it-but the quickest way to
get there is to create too much government
expenditure, which denies the people the
retention of a margin of their earnings sufficient to enable them to live comfortably
and to provide savings for themselves.
Another very serious aspect of this matter
is the increase in the demands of provinces
and municipalities. Where local taxes are
superimposed on the higher federal taxes,
living becomes increasingly difficult. In the
provinces which are not blessed with a high
degree of industrialization, the avenues of
taxation remaining ta them, and the ability
to bear taxation, are too limited to do
justice to their normal services. Before
leaving this point I will quote from a statement said to have been made recently by
the President of the Canadian Federation of
Mayors. He is reported to have said:
In 1930 the municipalities took 40 per cent of total
taxation in the Dominion, the provinces 22 per cent
and the federal government 38 per cent. In 1948
municipalities took 12 per cent, the provinces 20 per
cent and the federal government 68 per cent.

I recognize that federal revenues are
collected to be spent on the people of Canada
in all provinces and in all places in Canada,
but I think the time has come to call a halt
to extensions of services that are not
absolutely essential to the progress of the
nation. I believe there should be a more
thorough combing through of present services
to see whether the returns in all departments are commensurate with the contribution that is being made.
Nations, like individuals, have their good
days and their bad days, their good health
and bad health. The time to safeguard one's

SENATE
health is when one is well, not after lie gets
sick. So it is with a country. Check the
excesses before they hurt too much. I
believe that the increase in public expenditures in recent years represents an excess
which has to be checked. The hope is that
the checking can be done before we run
into a period of ill health brought on by
serious economic defiation, for then the
remedy will really hurt.
I will close these remarks with this comment: The ills of a business can seldom be
cured only by retrenchment, and government is the biggest business of all. An urge
to retrench should not be allowed to overshadow the need for progressive policy and
the expenditures necessary to carry it out.
For instance, there may be-I do not
know-waste in, for instance, the Department of Trade and Commerce. But as one
who has had an opportunity to measure its
usefulness in the field of overseas trade
development and in other branches of commerce and industry, I hold that it should
have all the money it actually requires to
assist in stimulating the industrial life of the
nation. The same comments may apply to
the Department of Mines and Technical
Surveys, to the Department of Agriculture,
the Department of Resources and Development and to the division having to do with
National Research. Recently the Department
of Fisheries received a "shot in the arm" and
is now able to give valuable assistance to a
great and previously neglected natural
resource. I would not put on any of these
resource-building departments any other
restriction than that the money they receive
shall be spent wisely and carefully for the
promotion of sound and progressive policies.
I note that for what I have termed the
resource-building departments the budget
of 1951-52 provides about 9 per cent of the
total outlay, exclusive of National Defence
and Defence Production.
Finally, honourable senators, may I say
that I can see no greater sphere of usefulness open to this body than to bring into
the limelight the need for wise and prudent
public expenditure and sound fiscal policy
for the Dominion of Canada. I believe that
it is a primary duty of the Senate not only
to continue to develop its views on these
matters but to use its utmost endeavours to
impress them on the citizens throughout the
length and breadth of this country.
Hon. Thomas Farquhar: Honouralble senators, I wish in the first place to -congratulate
the honourable senator from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) upon the splendid report he has
brought to this chamber. Those who have
read the report-and that I believe includes
all honourable senators-will, I am sure,

agree with me that it contains a great many
thought-provoking and very useful suggestions to which serious consideration should
be given.
I wish to deal very briefly today with a
matter on which the members of the Finance
Committee received some information from
the Chairman of the Board of Governors of
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. I
refer to a broadcast which was made by a
certain lady in Ottawa, a broadcast which
was very untrue and misleading. I should
like to read a paragraph or two from the
report of the proceedings of the Standing
Committee on Finance Gf June 7. I quote:
Hon. Mr. Golding: I do not object at all to criticism.
I think everybody who serves the public
must expect that. But I do not want to have people
resort to lies in their criticisms. That is the objection I take. I was under the impression that the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation had control
over what went over these private stations. I think
our friend Senator Haig had the same idea. That is
the reason why I am bringing this matter to your
attention this morning. I don't know, but I think
it is pretty disgraceful to use the facilities of the
radio, by which you get in touch with thousands of
people, to tell stuff like that, in which there is no
truth. How can you ever rectify it? How can you
ever get together that same crowd that you have
talked to? There is no chance at all. He admits
that in his letter. It is not possible. So that is one
good reason why they should exercise a good deal
more care before they make a broadcast of that
sort.
Hon. Mr. Haig: What control have you over this?
Mr. Dunton: We have no control over a thing
like that.
Hon. Mr. Haig: None at all?
Mr. Dunton:
We have the power and responsibility of making regulations, of which we have
made a series. Those regulations do not include any
check on accuracy of statements or on opinions
expressed. That would amount to censorship.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Could you make such regulations?
Mr. Dunton: Yes. We have a book of our regulations here.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I say, could you make regulations which would enable you to control a thing
of this sort?
Mr. Dunton: I suppose we could.

And further on:
Hon. Mr. Haig: Do you not do that now in political broadcasts?
Mr. Dunton: No.
Hon. Mr. Haig: In an election, if I want to speak
over the radio, I have to deliver my script to you
before I can make the broadcast.
Mr. Dunton: No, sir. Not to the C.B.C. There is
nothing we do that compels a station to ask you to
file your script in advance. That is on their own
responsibility. That is up to the station.

I would point out that the Chairman of the
Board of Governors of the C.B.C. makes the
statement that lie has no control over the
accuracy of statements made over private
stations. I think this is a very serious matter,
and this idea is not in accordance with the
purpose of the Canadian Broadcasting Act.

JUNE 27, 1951
I remember very clearly the -debate that took
place when the Honourable C. D. Howe introduced the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Bill in 1936. The corporation was to
carry on a national broadcasting service in
Canada, in the place and stead of the old
Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission.
This is what Mr. Howe had to say on that
occasion:

federal government is paying large sums of
money year after year in an effort to provide
good broadcasting service to the Canadian
people. I think that if the government were
to take over all private stations, the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation could be operated
on a sound, financial basis.

engine. Finally the agent of the manufacturing company was successful in getting a
dozen of these engines, and he put them all
on display. The farmer went in to see them
and was asked to pick out the one he wanted.
He said, "Well, I have got along so far
without one and I guess I can continue to
do that for a bit longer". Then the agent
realized that he had made a mistake in
placing the whole twelve engines on view,
so he took eleven of them and hid them
away. After that, he soon disposed of them
all. There is a good deal of that kind of thing
being 'done by merchants, large and small,
in this country.
Another point. I am not sure that the government's policy of allowing interest rates
to rise is the proper one to pursue. Surely
that will make rich people richer and take
money away from the poorer people who
have to pay the higher rate of interest.
Besides, we ought to encourage private enterprise, and in order to do that we must see
that capital is available for young people
who desire to go into business for themselves. This country is still a great country
in many respects, and I view with some
seriousness the .difficulty that today faces
young men who desire to obtain credit in
order to go into business. The policy that
curtails the giving of credit may retard the
very development that we want to see in
Canada. I know what it meant to me as a
young man to be able to secure credit from
the banks in order to get along with my
work; and because of the experience I had
then, I have had a kindly feeling for banks.
But now they have been asked ýto curtail
credit, and I repeat that I sympathize greatly
with young men who are trying to start a
business in these circumstances.
The senator from St. John's (Hon. Mr.
Pratt) has a very amusing story which
illustrates how poorly the expert sometimes
shows up beside the man of practical experience. Many of us will recall the story about
the large transport truck that was so high
that it got stuck in an underpass. The police
came around to keep the large crowd of
people out of the way while an expert with
a large crane was endeavouring to figure out
some way of getting the vehicle free. Then
out of the crowd stepped a ten year old
boy, who said, "If you want to get through,
just let a little air out of the tires". That
solved the problem which apparently was
too much for the so-called expert.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
it was not my intention to take part in the
debate this afternoon, but the remarks of the
honourable senator from Algoma (Hon. Mr.
Farquhar) and the applause which greeted
them prompted me to rise to prevent the

impression going abroad that the entire personnel of the Senate is in favour of his suggestion that the government should take over
all privately owned radio stations in this
country. One thing I like about the Senate
is the fact that we can rise in our places here
and voice our opinions freely. I would be
inclined to agree with my honourable friend
if he meant that the government itself should
take over all radio broadcasting in this country, but the fact is that today no broadcasting
is being done or controlled in Canada by the
government. Instead it is done by a corporation which we have set up, the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation-the CBC-which
is away above the government. I am looking
forward to next session when there will be
a fuller opportunity to debate this very
question.
May I be allowed to point out to my honourable friend from Algoma and other senators that it was the private companies that
were the first to develop radio and broadcasting in this country. They really pioneered.
I claim that one cannot sit by quietly without being alarmed when one listens to certain CBC programs and observes the seeming
favouritism that is shown to certain people
who at times express communistic thoughts
and speak freely in favour of Soviet Russia.
Let us ask ourselves whether the government
has anything to do with that. Also let us
ponder the question whether or not we have
taken the dangerous step of creating a body
that is above parliament, and of handing
over to it all rights to radio broadcasting.
In my province of British Columbia the
company that makes a monthly or semimonthly check of radio listeners-I think it
is know as the Haines Anderson Companyreports that fewer people listen to the CBC
programs than to any others. I asked the
manager of the CBC who were the judges of
what programs should be used, and he said
largely the public. Well, it is apparent that
in the province of British Columbia a large
section of the public do not think so very
highly of CBC programs. And when I think
of some of those programs I wonder why
anybody at all would listen to them. It is
astounding that anyone should broadcast
some of the "tripe"-I call it that advisedlywhich goes out in week-day afternoon programs over the CBC-programs featuring
stories in which married women are being
courted by the husbands of other women,
and in which the voices of the people taking
part are made to sob, shake and quiver. If
any senator will get up and say that that
kind of thing is good for the people, I shall
be more than a little surprised. God help us,
if we are to hear more of it.

JUNE 27, 1951
I hope an opportunity to discuss this question will be afforded to us next session,
because I for one am prepared to take the
opposite view to that expressed by the senator from Algoma (Hon. Mr. Farquhar).
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members, it
is my intention, after a few remarks, to move
the adjournment of the debate for the very
good reason that we have a heavy agenda
before us. It is that reason which prompts
me to speak against the policy of the government in its legislative program at this session. Within the past ten days we have been
deluged by legislation from the House of
Commons.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: There is no good reason
why much of this legislation should not have
-come before us long ago.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It is not fair.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: The members of the
opposition held it up in the other place.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The opposition members do
not control the program, though they may
cause some delay. The other house discussed
the budget at great length, and now within
the past three weeks it has been shelved and
a flood of legislation has come in. We had
before us yesterday a very heavy order paper,
and a like volume of business is before us
today. I attend the meetings of the committees regularly and know what is going on.
No one would criticize the Chairman of the
Banking and Commerce Committee for what
happened last evening, but I would point out
that some half dozen bills, each of which
merited an hour's consideration, were rushed
through the committee stage.
I am anxious to assist the government and
this house in the passage of legislation, but I
strongly protest against the procedure that
is being followed. I assure the leader of
the government in the Senate that I do not
criticize him, for he has nothing to do with
the legislative program in the other place.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But I point out that in this
session, which already has lasted five months,
we have considered more legislation from the
other place in the past two weeks than in
the previous four and a half months. There
is something wrong with a system that allows
that kind of situation to develop. We as
senators want to do a good job for the people
of Canada, but how can we do it under these
conditions?
I speak with some authority on this complaint, because as a practising lawyer I know
that I -cannot give proper consideration to
80713-46à

any question unless I have adequate time to
study it, and perhaps to discuss it with a
friend. For example, the member from
Northumberland (Hon. Mr. Burchill) yesterday spoke of the finding of a formula to
accomplish a certain result. How can that
be done when business is handled as it is?
The Senate, as I have said, wants to do a
good job, and to my mind there is no other
body in Canada more able to render real
service. We have no fear of causing displeasure to anyone, or of the effect that our
decisions may have on the result of an
election. When I speak on behalf of the
province of Manitoba, I am saying what J.
T. Haig thinks is best for that province in
the light of the needs of all of Canada. I may
not agree with the views expressed by another
senator from my province, but I respect his
thoughts.
I am discouraged this afternoon by the
problem that confronts us. There is no
question of money or the payment of salaries
involved. There must be something wrong
with the rules of the other place.
Hon. Mr. Reid: They need amendment. That
house is always objecting to what we do.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, the members over there
and the press accuse us of not spending
enough time on legislation.
Hon. Mr. Reid:
enforced.

The rules need to be

Hon. Mr. Haig: The British parliament
found that it could not carry on and aRiow
unlimited debate-and I do not refer only to
the length of the speeches. The house had
to get down to a business-like way of doing
things. But here it is always the same, it
matters not who is prime minister or leader
of the opposition, someone is responsible for
this abominable delay in bringing forward
legislation early in the session. We sit around
with our hands folded for a long period, and
in the last two or three weeks of the session
we do the greater part of the business.
I move the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.
FEDERAL DISTRICT COMMISSION BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
may I now ask the house to deal with Bill
397, an Act to amend the Federal District
Commission Act, 1927.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I move that Ihis bill be now read a third time.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I desire to move that this bill be not now read
a third time, but that it be amended as
follows:

Page 2, line 3: Insert after the word "company"
words "or companies".
Page 2, fine 9: Insert after the word "company"
following-"save for the purpose of carrying
the provisions of subsection two of this section".

Honourable senators will recall that earlier
today this bill was reported from the committee without any amendment. The general
tenor of the bill is to permit the Federal
District Commission, amongst other things, to
enter into agreements with railway companies
with respect to the location of lines and other
matters, under the general beautification plan
for the city of Ottawa. The amendments
which I have proposed come from the department, and they in no way affect the spirit of
the bill. Their purpose is to make clear
beyond any doubt that the railways and the
Federal District Commission have the right
to enter into these agreements.
The first two amendments, which would
amend subsection 2 of new section 7A, would
make it clear that the commission may enter
into agreements with more than one company.
Under the present wording there is some
doubt as to whether that could be done. These
amendments are in accordance with the intention of the minister.
The purpose of the third amendment, which
is to subsection 3 of new section 7A, is to
make certain that sections 151 and 154 of the
Railway Act apply to any agreements made
under the preceding subsection of the bill.
These sections of the Railway Act deal with
agreements of sale, leases, amalgamations,
agreements for interchange of traffic and running rights, and apply to companies. This
amendment is necessary, therefore, in order
to make it clear that at least for the purpose
of entering into binding agreements or sales
the commission is a company. The Railway
Act, as I understand it, permits railways to
enter into agreements in this connection only
with other companies, and in order to give
the commission the legal right to enter into
these agreements the amendments are sought.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
is it your pleasure to concur in the amendments?
Some Hon. Senalors: Carried.
The amendments were concurred in.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall the bill, as amended, be read the
third time?

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill, as
amended, was read the third time, and passed.
PENSION BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Reid for the second reading of Bill 288, an
Act to amend the Pension Act and change
the Title thereof.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators
will recall the circumstances under which I
adjourned the debate yesterday afternoon
after the very full and clear explanation of
this bill from the honourable senator from
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid). It was
merely because at the conclusion of his
speech we had not received the copy of the
bill in its final form as passed by the House
of Commons. In that form the bill is now
before us, and has been for the past twentyfour hours. I have no remarks to make on
the second reading.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: When shall this
bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
OLD AGE ASSISTANCE BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Gordon B. Isnor for the second reading of
Bill 395, an Act to provide for Old Age
Assistance.
Hon. Iva C. Fallis: Honourable senators,
at the risk of making myself unpopular by
speaking when there is so much on the
order paper, I feel that after all there has
been a great deal of male oratory around
this house during the past few days and
perhaps the weaker sex might be allowed
the indulgence of a hearing for a few
moments.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: The honourable senator
from Halifax (Hon. Mr. Isnor), who introduced this bill yesterday, gave the house
a very full account of previous legislation
along these lines, and of the steps which led
to the present legislation. He also dealt in
detail with the financial and practical aspects

JUNE 27, 1951
of the bill. As a member of the joint committee of both houses on Old Age Security
which met last session, and which is responsible for the report and recommendation to
the government upon which this legislation is
based, I would like ta say a few words from
I do this
a slightly different angle.
principally because I know, from conversations with some members of this house and
many persons outside of it, that everyone
does not look with a kindly eye upon this
measure.
As senators, we have said over and over
again in this house and, when we had the
opportunity, to the public outside, that the
most important work of the Senate is done in
committee. Remembering the committeesespecially, perhaps, the special committeesupon which I have been privileged to sit,
I feel that statement to be true in more
ways than one. It is true not only because
of what these committees accomplish-and
they aecomplish a great deal-but because
of the influence that is brought to bear upon
the thinking of the members of these committees. We may go ta the meetings with one
idea about a bill or some other subject under
discussion, and after listening to the information which is brought there, and to a great
deal of discussion, our thinking if we have
open minds-and I think we all have-is
affected to a very great degree. I believe
that is one of the benefits of these committees which we may not always recognize.
I can illustrate this from a personal
experience on the Committee on Indian
Affairs. I frankly confess that when my
leader nominated me to serve on that committee I was not particularly interested. I
had never given much thought to the subject,
and my only sentiment about it was one
which is shared by the great majority of us,
namely that of wishing that the original
Canadians might have a good deal. But while
sitting on the committee-which sat for a
good many hours and a good many weeks
over a period of three years-listening to
discussions and representations from every
part of Canada, my interest continually
increased, so that I am now and always
shall be extremely interested in the welfare
of the Indians of this country and in legislation pertaining to them.
And so it is with this Committee on Old
Age Security. I know that some people
object, mentally if not also vocally, to the
proposal which is before us. But as I sat in
the committee and listened to the information
which was given us and to the arguments
that were put forward, my views changed
a great deal. Men from different parts of the
country, speaking with first-hand knowledge
of the subject, told us of the premature

ageing of men and women in their localities
who are engaged in exceedingly strenuous
work-work which often brings the smallest
remuneration, but takes its physical toll to
such an extent that at sixty-five years of
age many of them are no longer able to
perform their arduous duties. They know of
no other way of making a living, and the
remuneration they have received throughout
the years has not been sufficient to enable
them to provide for retirement at sixty-five,
even though they may be so physically disabled as to be unfit for work.
As all honourable senators know, the bill
before us deals only with the assistance to
be given to necessitous people in the age
group sixty-five to sixty-nine years, and
implements the committee's unanimous report
on this particular phase of the question. I
might add that although the report was
unanimously agreed to, that does not mean
that every member of the committee was
entirely satisfied with it. Some thought that
the recommendations went too far; others
that they did not go far enough. But all
had one thing in common: we were anxious
to see something done; so a compromise was
reached and the committee brought to
parliament the unanimous report upon which
this legislation is based.
I for one regret that the government did
not deal with the whole subject in one piece
of legislation. I should have welcomed a
bill broad enough to cover the whole field of
universal pensions at seventy, assistance to
the needy between the ages of sixty-five and
sixty-nine, and a method of financing these
provisions. If all these matters had been
incorporated in one bill we would have had
a much clearer picture of the whole plan,
and therefore could have discussed it more
intelligently. That was not done, however,
and this bill is the only one which we have
before us at the present time.
Like many other members in this house,
including the honourable senators from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) and Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner), I am not partial to paternal legislation. I have disliked the trend
toward the welfare state and away from the
encouragement of thrift and industry. Yet,
as a practical person, I must say that we have
to face realities and look upon conditions as
they exist. We live in a day when, because
of a serious decline in the purchasing power
of our dollar, many of our older citizens who
are living on fixed incomes, annuities, pensions, and interest on money in various
forms, find themselves through no fault of
their own completely unable to meet the
ordinary every-day needs of life. This
involves not only high rents and high food

SENATE
prices, but medical expenses, which usually
become greater as one grows older. So,
because of all these factors, old age has
become for them a time of fear and anxiety.
I know some will say "Well, why did they
not plan more carefully for their old age"?
I confess I have said that myself many
times. But the fact still remains that many
who retired some years ago, thinking they
had sufficient means to keep them in modest
comfort, now find that in these days of higher
costs, and the consequent diminution of the
purchasing power of the dollar, their incomes
are totally inadequate.
I am particularly glad to see incorporated
in the bill an increase in allowable income
for those between sixty-five and sixty-nine
years of age who will receive the pension.
This is an increase in what was allowed to
pensioners of seventy years of age under the
old act. J think this is most important
because it will provide an incentive to those
who are able to work to do as much as possible to increase their incomes.
I know that the method of financing an
old age security prograin is not a matter for
discussion under this bill, but I should just
like to make the general comment in passing
that the committee was unanimous in recommending that the financing should be on a
contributory basis. Some of us, including
myself, urged very strongly that the extra
money needed should bo raised by direct
taxation. I am not one who believes in painless taxation, such as some senators were
advocating the other day in the house. I
think that if everyone has to pay a direct
tax towards social security, he knows that
he is not going to get something for nothing
in this world; that somebody has to pay for
it. I think it is important that people should
be made to realize that governments, unlike
magicians who pull rabbits out of hats, do
not pull money out of hats and spread it
beneficiently around the country but that
somebody has to pay for every benefit they
receive from social legislation. Whatever
system of taxation or method of financing is
adopted, this fact should be brought home to
our people.
I do not think we need worry unduly about
the burden that the financing of this program
will place upon the country-I was not so
sure of this after the honourable senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) concluded
his speech earlier this afternoon-for if we
are fortunate enough to have peace in the
world in the years ahead, the possibilities
of development of our natural resources are
so great that one can scarcely visualize the
Canada of twenty or twenty-five years hence.

I was intensely interested in the debate
which took place in this house the other day
on Bill 376, an Act respecting the construction of a line of railway by the Canadian
National Railway Company from Sherridon
to Lynn Lake in the Province of Manitoba.
The Manitoba senators told us of the remarkable development which had taken place in
the course of a few years in one small section
of the country. It was a striking illustration
of the vastness of the possibilities of our
heritage as Canadians. What these Manitoba
senators had to say reminded me of a conversation I had last winter with an American
businessman in the southern states. He was
talking about the great future that lies ahead
of Canada; he mentioned the Alberta oil
fields, our vast iron ore deposits, and iso on.
He said to me, "I was born in Canada, and
I moved to the United States when quite a
young man because the United States was
then the land of opportunity", and, be said
"It has been that for me. I have prospered,
and I have never regretted the move." Then
ho remarked "If I had sons today, I would
tell them to go to Canada, because it is now
the land of opportunity". I asked him "Why
do you say that when the United States is
such a vast and prosperous country? It seems
to offer plenty of opportunity". He replied
"Well, I say that simply because there is
little more in sight in the United States in
the way of opening up new country and
starting new developments. But you people
in Canada have just started, and I never
miss an opportunity to say to the young men
of my acquaintance 'If you want to succeed,
go to Canada. That is the land of opportunity
now.'" I was very much impressed with that
statement. So, if that be true-and I think it
is-I do not believe we need be unduly
worried about where the money will corme
from to finance this pension undertaking.
Those honourable senators who know me
will agree that I am the last person to condone extravagance, unnecessary spending, or
the mortgaging of the future by any government, for if trouble came we might find it
difficult to discharge our obligations. But
if the time should come when, because of
international trouble or a depression, we find
it necessary to curtail either present or
planned expenditures, I can think of a great
many ways in which we 'could economize.
We do not need to tear down the Union
Station-I am sure my honourable friend
from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) will
agree with me in that-and there are many
other things involving huge expenditures
which we could very well do without. I do
not think, however, that we need curtail our
expenditures at the expense of the aged and
disabled of this country.

JUNE 27, 1951
Honourable senators, for these reasons I
give my wholehearted support to the bill.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
I desire to take up a little time of the
Senate to discuss this bill. I offer no
apology for speaking on this important
measure, although the hour is late, for as
far back as the year 1931, when I was a
member of the House of Commons, I proposed a contributory measure of old age
pensions.
I want to compliment the government upon
introducing such a measure as this, and
also my honourable friend from Halifax
(Hon. Mr. Isnor) upon the excellent speech
he made yesterday when moving second
reading of the bill. However, I am a little
pertutbed by what looks like a trend in
our social welfare schemes. I was hoping
that we would have all-out contributory old
age pensions, but this bill proposes to provide assistance-that is the term used-to
people between the ages of 65 and 70 who
can qualify under a means test. And it is
intended to introduce next session a bill to
provide assistance-termed old age security
-to all those of 70 and over, regardless of
their means. At the moment I will not deal
with the legislation of the October session,
other than to say that some of the intimations
as to its contents are rather interesting.
For instance, it is said that all people over
the age of 70 will receive $40 a month. Of
course I am not in favour of paying that
sum to the rich and well-off as well as to
those in need, for I claim that however high
the income tax may go for this pension it
will never take back from those who receive
the $40 a month, even if they be millionaires,
the full $480 that -vould be paid to them
in any one year unoer such a measure.
Assistance by way of income tax is not
just the same thing as direct payment under
a contributory old age security scheme. I
am one of those who hold to the somewhat
old-fashioned belief that there is something
worth iwhile preserving in man, namely, his
self respect; and you take that away if you
hand him from the treasury some payment
towards which he has not made any contribution.
I do not know whether many senators have
had anything to do with the handling of old
age pension cases under the éxisting scheme.
I have had to do with hundreds of cases
and I know something of how the system
works, at least in the province of British
Columbia. I can tell that girls of twentyone to twenty-four have been used as investigators-young people who have not the

experience which age brings-and they have
been into homes to ask the most intimate
and particular questions of people. This is
a practice that has made many citizens sour
if not bitter. I know of many instances
also where people, because of their objection to giving the detailed explanations and
information asked for, have refused to fill
out the necessary forms to obtain old age
pensions.
I was looking forward to the time when we
would have a scheme under which every
citizen could walk boldly up to a wicket and
justly ask for, and receive, some payment
towards which he had contributed. But here,
after all the years of experience in this and
other countries, we are bringing in an Act
authorizing the handing out of payments from
the treasury to people who have to qualify
under a means test.
I would remind the government of what
usually happens when you start a scheme for
handing out public money. During election
campaigns the scheme becomes a political
football. If up to the time of the election the
maximum monthly payment is $40, parties
opposing the government will say "Put us in
office and we will give you $60 a month," and
some candidate will go one better and promise
$70 or more. During the by-election that
followed my elevation to the Senate, one
candidate had no organization and no definite
platform other than one based on the slogan,
"Sixty dollars at sixty." That was all he said
over the air and through the press and on the
sidewalks. As Liberal campaign manager I
knew that there was some danger, to our
candidate because I had learned from my
long public experience that you can usually
get more votes by making promises like that
than by citing performances. I can truthfully
say, however, that I never used such tactics.
Every senator who has run for public office
knows that what I say is true. The candidate I speak of did well, and the ProgressiveConservative and the CCF candidates lost
their deposits.
I would advise the government-I do not
suppose it will take my advice, for it never

Hon. Mr. Reid: I would advise the government to do some serious thinking before it

SENATE
brings in next session a bill to make an outright contribution to every citizen, and to substitute for it a scheme whereby every man
and woman in the country above a certain age
will make contributions towards insurance or
pension, or whatever it may be called, for his
or her own old age. I strongly urge the
substitution of a contributory scheme because
I am afraid that a non-contributory scheme
would destroy or at least seriously weaken
the feeling of self respect and independence
which is so necessary for the people of a
nation such as we have in Canada.
I agree with the remarks made by the honourable senator from Peterborough (Hon.
Mrs. Fallis) as to the position in which some
people find themselves in their old age. I say
with pride that I come of honest, God fearing
parents, who brought up six children. Like
thousands of other parents in this country,
after having raised a family of six children
they reached a time of life when, through
no fault of their own-and they were thrifty
-they found themselves with little resources
left. In Scotland we have a phrase "poor, but
honest," and I trust that every senator knows
what that phrase means. And again with
some pride I say that I have endeavoured to
remain true to the second part of that description. As to the first part, I can only say that
fortunately this country has been very good
and kind to me by giving me the honourable
position' which I hold here, a sinecure so to
speak, for life. But because I myself am safeguarded against want, am I to sit silent and
not raise my voice on behalf of the many
thousands in this country who are just as
good as I am but less fortunate? I sometimes
think that too many people who are well ofi
are inclined to forget how fortunate they
have been. I have heard some of them say of
other classes: "Why don't they work harder?
Why don't they save?" In voicing that criticism they remind me of the man who got out of
a burning hall by trampling over the heads of
other people and, having safely reached the
street, kept crying "Why don't they come
out?"
One hears often the expression: "Why don't
they save their money for their old age"?
The fact is that there are many thousands of
good, honest, hard-working citizens in this
country who, through force of circumstances,
could never save anything from the small
amount they earn. I make no apology therefore to anyone for rising this afternoon to
speak on behalf of that great class of people.
The government, to my way of thinking,
is in this inflationary period spending money
in other ways in such amounts that, as
regards old age pension benefits, they seem
to be standing still and looking backwards.

It is a well known fact that a dollar today
will buy only 45 cents worth of what it would
purchase in 1939-and who is to say that the
standard of living or high wages will go
down, even to the level of 1939? From my
observations practically every raise since
1939 has become stabilized. Too often we
look back and think of what we could buy
something for in 1930 or 1939, forgetting that
we are on a different level or plane today,
and that perhaps high wages and prices are
here to stay.
I should like the government to make the
old age pensions scheme a strictly contributory, for it is then that the means test can
properly be removed. I wonder how many
honourable senators have had an opportunity
to observe a means test being carried out.
I wonder also how many of them would submit to answering questions by some snooty
individual who makes such comments as,
"Your furniture or house is too good for you
to ask for an old age pension". The applicants
for pensions are so harrassed by questions
from these youthful investigators that the
very hearts and souls of many old people
have been seared.
The pension should not only be on a contributory basis, but to my mind it should be
for a greater amount than $40 a month. I
point to the unemployment
insurance
measure as a contributory scheme which has
worked out very well. Have you ever heard
of anyone suggesting that unemployment
insurance benefits should be increased? No.
The reason is that an increase in the returns
would mean an increased contribution from
the workers. An old age pension plan could
very well work the same way. For instance,
in such countries as Great Britain, New Zealand and Australia there is no great cry or
demand for increases in old age benefits, for
the very good reason that the schemes are
contributory schemes. To my way of thinking a contributory plan would mean that
everyone had to pay, and then all would
have a right to hold out their hands and
receive something back in return.
We hear a great deal of talk about the
proposed new old age security scheme,
under which all persons, whether well to do
or needy, will receive $40 a month upon
attaining 70 years. To my way of thinking
such a proposal is unsound. If, the government requires those who wish to receive a
pension to make application, let me say that
when I attain the age of 70 years I for one
will never do it. But I feel that that cannot
be said for everyone who may not require it,
for selfishness still exists today.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: Would the honourable
senator permit a question?

side the government service, it is becoming
increasingly difficult to maintain a staff of
competent engineers to do the work of or
associated with this organization. In addition to strictly P.F.R.A. work, engineers of
this organization serve the Prairie Provinces
Water Board, which has the responsibility
of recommending allocations for various purposes of water from the main streams. The
Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act staff also
conducts extensive survey work such as is
now in progress on the Assiniboia river, and
the Saskatchewan river, and various other
surveys in the Prairie Provinces and British
Columbia, all of which must precede decisions as to what projects if any will be undertaken. It is regarded as highly important to
enact the proposed amendments so a strong
and efficient staff will be built up and maintained.
As to amendment No. 4, regarding projects
which can be undertaken without the specific
approval of the Governor in Council, the cost
of any such single project is by law now
limited to $5,000. This state of things makes
it necessary to obtain each year a very large
number of orders in council to carry out the
P.F.R.A. program. With construction costs
more than doubled in the last few years, the
number of orders in council required has
increased proportionately, and this creates
a difficult and cumbersome administration
problem.
This concludes what I have to say about the
provisions of the bill, except in relation to
the last matter that I mentioned. I believe
most honourable senators know that the
smaller projects include stock watering dams,
dugouts, and small and large pastures in the
prairie area, particularly in that part commonly known as the Palliser Triangle, which
is largely composed of the semi-arid areas of
Western Canada. The smaller projects are
connected with matters of that kind. The
larger ones could not be dealt with under
this amendment.
I have no further information with regard
to the proposed legislation. I understand
that the Committee on Natural Resources will
meet tomorrow morning, and this bill could
properly be turned over to that committee,
by whom any further information that is
required can be obtained from officials of the
department.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

CRIMINAL CODE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. A. K. Hugessen moved the second
reading of Bill 391, an Act to amend the
Criminal Code.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
rather important bill, amending the Criminal
Code in a number of respects, and perhaps
the first thing I should do is to apologize to
the house for having undertaken to explain
these amendments. I do not pretend to be
any kind of an expert on the criminal law,
nor have I practised the criminal law of this
country. My explanation is that yesterday,
when this bill came to the bouse for first
reading, other than myself there was no
senator on the government side who is a
lawyer. I know full well that had it been
possible for the honourable senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) to be here to
explain this bill, he would have done it
much better than I can, or if I could have
got in touch with the honourable senator
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) ho,
too, would have explained it more competently than I can do. There are a number
of other honourable senators of whom the
same may be said. However, I fear the
bouse will have to do the best it can with
such explanations as I can afford.
One thing I should do at once is to tell
the house what this bill does not contain.
When the bill was introduced in the other
place it contained a clause, the former section 21, which caused a good deal of comment and criticism. That section has since
been deleted.
It allowed officers, as the
section rather quaintly puts it, to "observe
the operations of various telephones" where
it was believed that telephones were being
used in common gaming houses or common
betting bouses, and that observation could
be either visual or by means of some special
kind of recording machine. This provision
introduced a somewhat new principle into
our criminal law. I understand that it was
originally suggested by the Attorney-General
of Ontario. As I have said, it met with
considerable criticism in the other place,
and it was eliminated before the bill came
to this house.
The remaining sections of the bill may
conveniently be divided into seven main
groups, or comprised under seven headings.
The first group deals with treason, sedition
and sabotage, and the sections are of conREFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The third relates to offences in connection

is quite topical, deals with the question of
drunken driving of automobiles. The fifth
has something to do with matters of indecency. The sixth group relates to changes
made in the Act to conform to the National
Defence Act which this parliament adopted
last year. The seventh contains various
miscellaneous provisions with which I shall
not trouble the house.
The provisions dealing with treason, sedition and sabotage are perhaps the most
important, and they are to be found in sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 18 of the bill. Section
3 widens the definition of treason.
Hon. Mr. Reid: What page is section 18 on?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I am dealing with section 3, which widens the definition of treason.
One of the present definitions of treason is as
follows:
Assisting any public enemy at war with His
Majesty in such war by any means whatsoever...

That definition is changed to read:
Assisting, while in or out of Canada, any enemy
at war with Canada, or any armed forces against
whom Canadian forces are engaged in hostilities
whether or not a state of war exists between Canada
and the country whose forces they are ...

That widens the definition of treason to
include a treasonable act committed outside
of Canada by a Canadian citizen. It also
widens the definition to include, for instance,
the assisting of the armed forces of the
Republic of China, which are engaged against
our forces in Korea, although there is no
formal state of war between the two
countries.
Section 4 of the bill deals with assisting
or harbouring deserters or absentees from
the Canadian forces. The house will perhaps
remember that when we considered the
National Defence bill last year, there was a
provision which imposed very severe penalties on those who harboured deserters from
the forces in times of emergency-that is to
say, in times of war. The section before us
covers the assisting or harbouring of deserters
or absentees in times of peace, and in this
case the penalty is much less than that for
offences in times of emergency. Perhaps I
should refer to the amendment introduced in
the other place, to the effect that no proceeding is to be instituted under this section
without the consent of the Attorney-General
of Canada.
Section 5 of the bill deals with the resisting
of the execution of searches being made for
deserters under a warrant authorizing a building to be broken open. It amends section 83
of the Code in two respects. It adds to the
term "deserter" the words "direct absentee
without leave from the Canadian forces", and
it increases the fine for resisting the execution
of search from $80 to $200.

Section 6 of the bill deals with persuading
men to desert, and with the harbouring or
concealing of them knowing them to be
deserters. Section 84 of the present Act deals
with all the forces of Canada as well as the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
The
National Defence Act, however, provides the
necessary penalty for members of the Canadian armed forces, so the new section 84
simply restricts this provision to members
of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Why is it necessary to
have a special provision with regard to the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police? Why does
it not apply to every police force in the
dominion?

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Well, the R.C.M.P. is
the only dominion police force, is it not?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Would not any similar
provision with regard to provincial or municipal police have to come under a provincial
statute?
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: No, the Criminal Code
applies to every person in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes, that is so. Well,
I suppose the only answer is that none of the
provinces has asked for this provision, or it
may be that there is a similar provision somewhere else in the Criminal Code. I do not
know.
Section 8 of the bill introduces a new section, 132A, into the Act, and has to do with
miscellaneous offences of a seditious nature.
These are described in the new section as
follows:
Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and
liable to imprisonment for five years who wilfully
(a) interferes with, impairs or influences the
loyalty or discipline of; or
(b) publishes, edits, issues, circulates or distributes any writing that advises, counsels or urges
insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny or refusal of
duty by; or
(c) advises, counsels, urges or in any manner
causes insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny or refusal
of duty by
a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
the Canadian forces or the naval, army or air forces
of a State other than Canada that are lawfully
present in Canada.

As I say, that is a new type of offence.
Section 9Hon. Mr. Marcotte: What about section 7?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I shall come to that. It
has nothing to do with sedition, and I am
now taking up the sections dealing with
sedition and treason. Section 9 deals with
punishment for seditious words, seditious
libel, and seditious conspiracy. The only
respect in which it alters the ipresent law,

SENATE
as contained in section 134 of the Criminal
Code, is to increase the maximum penalty
for any of these offences from two years'
imprisonment to seven years' imprisonment.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Is there any definition of
the word "seditious"? I ask that question
because Mr. Justice Locke discussed this
question around Easter when the Supreme
Court of Canada was dealing with a certain
appeal from the Jehovah Witnesses of the
Province of Quebec. He said that it was
necessary to go back to the thirteenth or
fourteenth century in old English law to find
:ut what sedition really is. Seeing that we
are putting this in the Act, I am wondering
if there is any definition of the word.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I am unable to answer
my honourable friend, but I would point out
that we are not putting these words into the
Act. They are already there.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Oh.

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: What we are doing
is to increase the maximum penalty from two
to seven years' imprisonment.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: There is no definition
of sedition in the Criminal Code.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: No, I think it is a
matter of a long series of judicial decisions,
and that the question has to be determined
in each case.
Section 18 is the last one dealing with
security. It relates to offences which may
generally be described as sabotage. The section is headed "Acts Prejudicial to Security"
and it prescribes a maximum penalty of ten
years imprisonment for an offence created
under the new section 509A. There are two
requirements for -liability under this section.
The first is that the accused person shall have
committed a "prohibited act", which is
described in subsection (2) as meaning:
Any act or omission that
(a) impairs the efficiency or impedes the working of any vessel, vehicle, aireraft, machinery,
apparatus or other thing; or
(b) causes property, by whomsoever it may be
owned, to be lost, damaged or destroyed.

The second requirement for liability is that
the "prohibited act" shall have been donc:
for a purpose prejudicial to
(a) the safety or interests of Canada; or
(b) the safety or security of the naval, army or
air forces of any State other than Canada that are
lawfully present in Canada.

Hon. Mr. Bouffard: May I ask my honourable friend a question? Section 3 describes
treason as:
assisting, while in or out of Canada, any enemy at
war with Canada,

and so on. My question is this. If an act of
treason or assisting the enemy is committed
outside of Canada, is that not punishable by
the military law?

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes, if the act is committed by a member of one of the armed
forces; but the section applies to offences committed by civilians as well.
The second general subject with which this
bill deals is the registration of firearms and
offensive weapons. This is dealt with in
section 7, and the whole effect of that section
is to revise present sections 115 to 129 of the
Criminal Code. No change is made in penalties or in the procedure for registration by
the public of pistols and revolvers, but there

is added a new requirement that automatic
firearms-that is, sub-machine guns and
things of that kind-shall also be registered.
I do not know whether any reputable citizen
walks around with a sub-machine gun.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: There is a big change in
the dennition of "offensive weapon".
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes. I am coming to
that.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask a question? Subsection (2) of the new section 120 says:
Notwithstanding section
fnds a person whom he
grounds, ta be under the
possession of a firearm,

127, a peace officer who
believes, on reasonable
age of fourteen years in
air-gun or air-pistol or

ammunition therefor may seize it ...
Are these words "under the age of fourteen
years" new?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: No; they will be found
in the prcsent section 126. I am informed
that there is no change in substance made by
any of these new sections. They merely
revise and bring up to date the present
sections, and add the requirement that automatic firearms be registered. I should point
out that they also provide for a central
register to be kept by the Royal Canadien
Mounted Police, presumably in Ottawa, of all
offensive weapons in Canada.
As remarked a moment ago by my honourable friend from Grandville (Hon. Mr.
Bouffard), section 1 of the bill enlarges the
definition of "offensive weapon". It repeals
paragraph 25 of section 2 of the present Act,
which defines "offensive weapon" or "weapon" as including:
any gun or other firearm, or air-gun, or any part
thereof, or any sword, sword blade, bayonet, pike,
pike-head, spear, spearhead, dirk, dagger, knife, or
other instrument ...

It substitutes for this a new paragraph
25, which gives this general definition:
"Offensive weapon" or "weapon" means
(a) anything that is designed to be used as a
weapon; and
(b) anything that a person uses or intends to
use as a weapon, whether or not it is designed to be
used as a weapon ...

Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask another question?
Subsection (2) of the new section 120 says
that a firearm found in the possession of a

JUNE 27, 1951
person believed to be under the age of fourteen may be seized. Is there also a penalty
for violation of this subsection?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I cannot answer that
question. I have not practised criminal law
for a number of years now, and I am afraid
that my inability to give a full explanation
of the bill is evident.
Hon. Mr. Reid:' I asked the question
because it seems to me that there should be
a penalty for violation of the subsection.

and so on. The reason for the change is that
sometimes it is very difficult to prove that
an accused person actually posted some
improper material, whereas it would be relatively easy to prove that he made use of the
mails for the purpose of transmitting or
delivering the material.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: A person might have
someone else do the posting for him.

and so on. The new section says that the
offence is committed by every one:

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Exactly; an employee
or someone else.
Section 16 changes section 364 and 365 of
the Act by reducing from one year to six
months the minimum terms of imprisonment that may be imposed under those sections; and it adds a new section 365A, which
makes a suspended sentence not applicable
for an offence under these sections. The
offence dealt with here is the stealing of a
letter, parcel, post letter bag, or anything
of that kind, from any post office or any
officer or person employed in any business of
the post office. At present the law provides
a minimum penalty of imprisonment for one
year for any of the off ences under either of
the two sections. Two changes are now proposed. Section 365 would reduce the minimum penalty from one year to six months,
and section 365A would provide that the
general provisions of the Criminal Code for
suspended sentence shall not apply to these
particular sections.
Section 20 of the bill is inserted for the sake
of convenience, and involves an offence which
may have been committed in respect of the
mail during the course of delivery, in circumstances where it has gone through two or
more magisterial jurisdictions. This section
provides that such an offence shall be deemed
to have been committed in any of the magisterial districts to which the carrier's route
extends.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Would the honourable
senator tell us why it is necessary to make a
mandatory minimum penalty of six months
for stealing a letter or piece of mail from the
post?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I shall have to leave
that question to be answered in committee.
I do not know why such a suggestion was
made.
The fourth of the series of offences dealt
with is drunken driving, and is set out in
section 14 of the bill. The present provisions
of the Criminal Code dealing with drunken
drivers of automobiles will be found in subsection 4 of section 285. That provides severe
penalties for,

who makes use of the mails for the purpose of
transmitting or delivering
(a) any obscene or immoral book,

Everyone who, while intoxicated or under the
influence of any narcotic, drives any motor
vehicle ...

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: If the bill is given
second reading, I shall suggest that it be
sent to the Committee on Banking and Commerce, where there will be an opportunity
to question representatives of the Department
of Justice.
The third group of subjects dealt with by
the billHon. Mr. Hardy: Before the honourable
senator goes on with the third group, may I
make one remark? The new section 115,
which is much like the present section of
that number, says:
Every one who carries or has in his custody or
possession an offensive weapon . . . is guilty . . .

What does that mean? Does it apply to
every one who has an offensive weapon in
his house? If it does, I have apparently been
breaking the law, for in my house I have
a big automatic firearm, although I have
forgotten just where it is. I do not want to
be fined for that.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: It depends, I think,
upon whether my honourable friend is keeping the firearm for a purpose dangerous to
the public.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: Well, if some intruder
came in, it would be used for such a purpose.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Of course, I do not
know my honourable friend's motives in keeping the weapon.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: They are fairly innocent.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I trust they are.
The third general class of offence dealt
with by the bill is covered by sections 12, 16
and 20. Section 12 simply makes the wording
of the present section 209 of the Criminal
Code more effective. The present section
says:
Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and
liable to two years' imprisonment who posts for
transmission or delivery by or through the post,
(a) any obscene or immoral book,

SENATE
It is now proposed to insert the new subsection (4a) of section 14 of the bill, which
creates a lesser offence, with reduced penalties. The new subsection provides as follows:
Every one who, while his ability to drive a motor
vehicle or automobile is impaired by alcohol or any
drug, drives any motor vehicle or automobile . . .

In other words, while the present section
makes it an offence for a driver to be intoxicated or under the influence of liquor, the
new subsection makes it an offence when a
driver's ability is impaired by the use of
alcohol.
Hon. Mr. Marcoite: Does it not go farther
than that?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Does "impaired
alcohol" include intoxication?

by

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: One who is intoxicated
is evidently impaired.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Quite so. I understand,
however, that a good many judicial decisions
show that in order to convict a person of
being intoxicated it is necessary to show that
he was in a fairly advanced stage of intoxication. It has been shown by a number of
cases that a driver's ability may be impaired
by the use of alcohol without there being
complete intoxication. The present law provides a compulsory terrn of imprisonment
upon conviction on the first offence. By the
new subsection (4a) of section 14 of the bill a
lesser offence is provided for, under which
there is a compulsory fine for the first offence
and imprisonment for succeeding offences.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: If a person is found
guilty of intoxication, and not simply of
impairment of his faculties, he would receive
the more severe penalty?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask if in the case
of second or third offenders for drunken
driving there is any provision for impounding
the car or cancelling the driver's licence? For
instance, when a person who has been convicted of drunken driving has served his
terrn, he may get drunk again and do further
damage, even to the extent of killing somebody. Does the bill merely provide for an
increase in the
fine for subsequent
convictions?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Can his car be impounded
and his licence cancelled?
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: May I interject that the
provincial legislature takes care of such
cases?
In Quebec, for instance, a person

who is convicted of a second offence of
drunken driving has his licence taken away
for life.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I think the federal authorities should have the right to provide that a
car be impounded for a lengthy period. A
limited number of convictions should be
allowed before such action is taken.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I think the suggestion
of my honourable friend is quite a proper
one, and should be brought up when the
bill is considered in committee.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The subsection uses the
words "impaired by alcohol or any drug". Is
the word "drug" new?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The present subsection
uses the word "narcotics".
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I am speaking of subsection (4a), and am asking whether or not
the word "drug" is new. It might happen
that the ability of a man coming home from
a visit to his dentist would be slightly
impaired by the use of a drug.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: May I ask the honourable
gentleman if, under subsection (4a), a person
who is caught behind the wheel of a
stationary car can be convicted of drunken
driving?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is the case now.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: That is exactly the
same; there is no change.
Hon. Mr. Haig: As it is 6 o'clock, I suggest
that we now adjourn and resume at 8 o'clock.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I am about through.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But there are some other
speakers.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: May I be allowed to
finish my explanation?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: The bill is going to a
committee.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: If there are no further
speakers, the bill -can be referred to committee following my explanation.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: If the bill is referred
to a committee, I am satisfied.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: Provided we have the
right to propose amendments after it is
reported back to the house.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: You undoubtedly will
have that right. May I be allowed to complete my explanation?
Subsection (4d) of section 14 permits as

are matters of detail. Also there are one or
two minor miscellaneous provisions. Perhaps
the only one to which I need draw attention
is section 22, whereby a change is made in
section 929 of the Code, relative to the constitution of juries. In three places the word
"persons" is substituted for the word "men".
The purpose of that change is to permit of
women serving on juries in those provinces in
which by provincial legislation they can so
serve. Had the honourable senator from
Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis) been here,
I would have directed her attention to the
fact that in this bill it is made quite clear

the operation of certain rules for the remainder of the session makes it possible to give
third reading to the bill today without unanimous consent of the Senate. If I am not right
in that, I think that third reading will have to
be postponed until at least tomorrow, for I
am not 'consenting to the motion.
Hon. Mr. Roberison: I have no ýparticular
views on the matter. There is no urgency
requiring passage of the bill today, and the
motion could stand for a few hours or a day,
if that would suit my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I will briefly state the
reason why I am raising the objection. This
bill was brought down in the dying hours of
the session.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: A copy of this bill came
to my desk yesterday afternoon, after the
sitting had commenced. I did my best to
read it while the debate was going on, but
I found it impossible to do so effectively. The
bill was later referred to the Standing Conmittee on Banking and Commerce, and was
given about an hour's consideration last
evening. Indeed, less time would have been
spent on it had I not insisted on being given
the opportunity to read the sections as they
were passed. There was a contest to see
whether I could read the sections as fast as
they were called, and I lost. However, we
did spend an hour on the bill.
Hon. Mr. Euler: You can spend another
hour here.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: If the bill was of an
ordinary character no doubt such study as
was given to it last evening would be sufficient; but this is an important measure which
affects the liberty of the subject, and there
has been really no time for public study. We
should at least be given the time allowed by
our rules.
If this measure is to come up this afternoon,
perhaps nothing would be lost by dealing
with it now; but if it were left over until
tomorrow, there would ýat least be opportunity for editorial comment. There appeared
in the Citizen this morning a very excellent
editorial on this subject, in which it
was stated that the minister had laid himself
open to attack from those concerned about
democratie principles by reason of the fact
that the bill had been brought in at the end
of the session and had been put through
the various stages with such speed. The
article suggests that parliament should give
this series of Criminal Code amendments
further scrutiny, and I entirely agree.
If the bill'is to be considered later today,
I would just as soon proceed with it now,

but if consideration is to be deferred until
tomorrow, there will be some opportunity
for public reaction.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I may say to my honourable friend that the house has always
been considerate with regard to any suggestions I have made, and I have never attempted to avail myself of my technical rights
with respect to the progress of the work of
parliament unless I had very good reason
for doing so. If the senator from TorontoTrinity desires that this order stand over
until tomorrow, I am quite willing to concur,
with the understanding that should it become
apparent later today that this session of
parliament will adjourn tonight-though I
consider that unlikely-I would then ask
that the bill be considered.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There is one other
point I should like to emphasize. No discussion took place on the second reading of
the bill, the understanding between the deputy leader and myself, :and others, being
that discussion would be allowed on the
motion for third reading. That is another
good reason for allowing further time for
consideration of the measure.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I am willing to ýallow
this order to stand; but in the event of the
business of the other house being completed
today-which is a rather remote probability
would be for this house to determine
-it
whether the measure should then be considered. Is that satisfactory?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Quite satisfactory.
Hon. Arthur Marcotte: Honourable senators, I am very pleased that the government
leader has taken the stand he has. The
bill warrants careful examination, and as
yet we have had no chance to read and study
it. As the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) reminds us, the
principle of personal liberty is involved:
some sections of the bill affect the liberties
of the subject-the Canadian citizen. I am
fully in accord with the views expressed by
the honourable senator. If it is urgent that
the discussion proceed now, this afternoon
or this evening, I am willing to acquiesce,
but I hope it will be possible to defer the
debate until tomorrow. The subject is one of
great importance. When only a question of
money is at issue I am not very greatly
concerned, because, as has been said in the
other place, millions of dollars today are

old age pensions to blind persons should be
greater than those of old age pensioners who

While I vote with great pleasure for the
passing of this bill, I would urge the minister
and his assistants to study the problems of
the blind in relation to the developments
under this Act for the next two years. The
department will now have a better chance
to do that, because under this bill the blind
are being dealt with separately. I am sure

correct those deficiencies.

unaware of the plight of its members. We
have been pretty considerate on many
occasions, and perhaps on other occasions
the example I have mentioned might be
followed, and with some little arrangement
or ingenuity, work might be found for these
people.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
THE ESTIMATES

REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON FINANCE-DEBATE
CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the consideration of the
report of the Standing Committee on
Finance on the Estimates laid before parliament for the fiscal year ending March
31, 1952.
Hon. John T. Haig:

Honourable senators,

I want to say at the outset that I hope anything I say will not by the widest stretch of
imagination be considered political in nature.
In the first place, the problem placed before
our committee was altogether too serious and
important to the whole of Canada for me to
adopt such an attitude; and secondly, it
was the Senate's responsibility to appoint
committees to carry on investigations such
as the one just .conducted, and to be sure
that the findings reported to this house could
be used for educational purposes throughout the whole country.
I join in the -compliments paid yesterday
by the senator from St. John's (Hon. Mr.
Pratt) to the Chairman of the Committee on
Finance, the senator from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar). I have had the pleasure and
honour of knowing the senator froin Churchill
for forty-four years, which anyone will agree
is a long time. I hold him in the same

high regard as do the people of Manitoba.
True, some people criticize him for this or
that, as they criticize every other public
man, but by and large, in our province he
is regarded as a very representative Canadian. Canada will not go far astray if the
administration of our country-in dominion,
provincial and municipal fields-is in the
hands of such men as the senator from
Churchill.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Last session and again
this session there was some question as to
the origin of our practice of referring estimates to a committee for study. The truth
is that the seed was sown by the senator
from Kootenay East (Hon. Mr. King), when
he was leader of the government in the
Senate. Those who were here at that time,
in the early years of the war, will remember
that he proposed that the war estimates be
referred to a committee as soon as possible
after they had been brought down in the
House of Commons. That proposal was put
forward as possibly one means of meeting,
in part at least, a strong protest, in which
I personally and other senators joined. The
protest was against the practice of sending
the main Supply Bill over to the Senate in
the dying days of the session when there
was no opportunity to give it anything like
the consideration that it required. Al of
us, irrespective of politics, felt that we should
not be asked to pass such important legislation without having at least some chance
to study the expenditures, and to make for
the benefit of the government and the country
whatever recommendations we felt were
While the present system of
necessary.
referring the estimates to a committee may
have its shortcomings, I am sure it is a
great improvement over the previous system.
By studying the estimates in committee we
now are able to lay before parliament, and
through parliament the people, our views on
public expenditures in the federal, provincial
and municipal fields, and the financial position of the country at large.
At this point I wish to express thanks to
the departmental officials who appeared
before our committee and gave us such a
clear explanation of the financial problems
facing us. I also wish to congratulate the
government upon allowing these officials to
appear and speak so freely. I cannot recall
a single instance of an official shielding himself behind the statement that a question
asked of him had to do with government
policy and could not be answered by him.
It was a splendid thing to allow these civil
servants this freedom of expression. After

JUNE 28, 1951
all, while a country's greatness may depend
chiefly upon its government and parliament,
no ,country can progress very far without an
enlightened and intelligent civil service to
handle the day-to-day business.
In the committee we were confronted with
a very urgent miatter, the present high cost of
living, and the effect that governmental
expenditures in the federal, provincial and
municipal spheres have upon it. The committee's report gives comparative figures of
expenditures for the years 1938, 1949 and
1950 and- of estimated expenditures for 1951.
Parliament and the public can rely upon
these figures, for they are official, obtained
from departmental representatives.
The steering committee recommended, and
the Senate has authorized, the publication
of a certain number of copies of the report in
Engish and a certain number in French. I
am not giving aw'ay any close secret when I
say that we appointed one of our members to
act as secretary, and that copies of the report
will be sent out to every daily and weekly
newspaper in Canada and to every member
of every provincial legislature. We hope that
senators themselves also will distribute copies
in their respective provinces. In other words,
we hope that a good many people will study
this report, for the committee's purpose was
not merely to procure facts for the information of the Senate, but to bring those facts
to the attention of the people at large, so
that they may have a -sound basis on which
to form a judgment when considering questions of the day.
The senator from St. John's (Hon. Mr.
Pratt) said yesterday that we want to get the
people to realize that when they ask any
governmental authority-federal, provincial
or municipal-to make expenditures for this
or that, the money can come only from the
people themselves, through taxation. I think
the committee's report makes that point very
clear.
The -committee did not attempt to go into
the subject of war expenditures. We had a
perfect right to do so, of course, but we felt
that it would be improper to question them
at this time. We are in a very serious situation just now. I do not want to deal with
that matter at the moment, other than to say
that we trust that by spending millions of
dollars, perhaps billions, we may be able to
arm ourselves and assist in ýarming our allies
to such a degree that any aggressor will be
afraid to start an attack. I make bold to say
that the life of one of our Canadian boys
which might be lost in battle is more precious
to Canada than the millions that we are
spending for defence purposes. I feel very

strongly that we should not question expenditures on defence so long as the present war
situation continues. Some people think it
may last another five, ten or twenty yearsI do not know, and I would not even guessbut I hope that the aggressor nations of the
world today will come to their senses and
realize that in an open -conflict with the western world they would be defeated.
I come now to the matter of government
expenditures. When a comparison is made
between the expenditures of 1939 and those
of 1951, at all levels of government-though
some of the provincial and municipal figures
are only estimates-the tremendous increase
is startling. When I point particularly to the
increase in federal expenditures over the
past twelve years, I am not speaking in a
political sense, for that same rise is reflected
in the budget of every province and municipality. That the problem is a serious one
cannot be denied.
If I may digress for a moment, I shall
point to the plight of the school teacher in,
for instance, my own community. I can
speak with some authority on this problem,
for I was once a teacher myself. Later I
served as a school trustee, and since then
I have had children and grand-children
attending the schools. In my opinion the
influence of the teacher on the child of, say,
six to twelve years, is as great as that of the
mother, though of course in the long run, the
mother has the greater influence. When I
was a boy certain teachers, both men and
women, placed their stamp on my life and it
has stayed with me down through the years;
yet I cannot recall one of those teachers who
ever became rich, or even received half what
I thought he was worth. The municipalities
have a problem to see to it that their teachers
are adequately compensated.
I heartily support the grant that has been
made to universities, but I point out that
this aid is going to only a small segment of
our educational system. When I was attending university some thirty years odd ago,
about 2 per cent of our citizens had the benefit of a university training; today-partially
because of my voice in the matter, perhapsabout 3 to 4 per cent of our children enter
university. The problem of educational costs
extends to public schools and high schools in
all provinces.
I turn now to the financial problems of the
provinces. As an illustration of the inflationary trend I point to the province of
Manitoba where, when I was a member of
the legislature, the budget was $5 million a
year. Incidentally, I recall that two years
after a Liberal government came into power
-this is not a political argument-there was
a budget of $6j million. I tell you, we made

SENATE

the town ring with our condemnation of that
government for increasing the budget by $1million. Last year that same province, with
a population increased about 25 per cent, had
a budget of, I think, $39 million.
Take the province of British Columbia, as
another example. I do not know what its
budget was some years ago, but I think my
friend from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) will admit that it is today trying to set
a new record in Canada for provincial
expenditure.
Hon. Mr. Reid: British Columbia has just
gone wild.
Hon. Mr. Haig: There is no doubt about
that.
I point to all these expenditures because
this money has to be raised by means of
taxation, and it is the people who have to
pay the tax. If businesses are taxed, the
cost of the tax is passed on to the consumer.
The cost of living index now stands at about
182 as compared with 100 as of the period
1935-39. If one takes any number of years,
there will be a relative comparison.
The member from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) has drawn our attention to the
position of the middle and lower middle
classes, whose occupations do not permit
them to pass on additional costs. I refer to
such people as those whose livelihood comes
from mortgage interest, pensions or fixed
salaries. In the case of teachers, for instance,
pay increases, when they get them, trail about
six or eight months behind the rise in the cost
of living. Although it was not specifically
mentioned, I believe that the incomes of
industrial workers have increased more than
82 per cent. I understand that an index
issued by the Department of Labour indicates
that incomes in this group stand at more than
200 as compared with the cost of living index
of 182. The point I am attempting to make
is that when the rise in one group exceeds
the cost of living index, the income of some
other group must fall below that index.
In this complex picture there are three
distinct groups: The industrial workers, the
white collared people and the primary producers. In an expanding economy such as
we have today the primary producers do not
suffer but in a depression they are the ones
that suffer most. The industrial worker
today enjoys a high demand for his services,
and he does not suffer. I repeat, the experience of the past shows that in an economic
bill the primary producer is the first to suffer.
Hon. Mr. Euler: With the floor prices as
they are today, the primary producers should
be all right.

Hon. Mr. Haig: But how long those floor
prices will last, I am not prepared to say.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Neither is anybody else.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is easy to have floor prices
when the demand is strong.
I might discuss the war and other issues
which have a bearing on this matter, but I
prefer to emphasize the underlying general
principle. If the government wants to convince the people of Canada that the cost of
living can be controlled, the first thing it must
do is to try in every conceivable way to
cut down all public expenditure except those
for defence preparations. No department of
government should be exempt from the drive
for economy.

It is inevitable that our huge

expenditures on war and war preparations
should cause reductions in our standard of
living; and there can be no doubt that the
public reaction will be strongly hostile. Last
Monday four federal by-elections took place.
My personal knowledge is limited to two of
them, namely Winnipeg and Brandon.
In
Winnipeg there was no other issue than the
cost of living. The leading newspaper there,
the Winnipeg Free Press, last week-end published an editorial in which the statement
was made that the anti-government candidate
was running on his own, and refused to say
what party he represented, but of course
everyone knew what side he was on. The
successful candidate did not poll as many
votes as he got in the general election, when
he was defeated, but the Liberal candidate
was beaten because so many Liberals did not
vote.
Why did they not vote? Honourable senators can advance any reasons they like for
that; but I have lived in that part of Winnipeg for thirty-eight years, I know the district
and the people, and I know that they resented
the increased cost of living
That, for them,
was the issue. The same problem, though in
somewhat different form, was foremost in the
by-election in Brandon, where many of the
voters are farmers. My honourable friend
from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) may say that
having been assured of a basic price, and having received $65 million for their losses on the
British wheat contract, they should be satisfied. But their complaint is that higher costs
affect them at every turn, increasing the price
of the things they buy, and the wages of farm
labour. Their young men and women are
leaving the farms to take employment in the
cities, where wages are higher, though

whether they are really better off is another
matter.

At any rate, in protest against this

general situation, many farmers voted against
the government candidate. I am told that the
same factor operated in the two other ridings.

JUNE 28, 1951
How is this situation to be met? The government proposes to increase taxation and
control credit, but it is by no means sure that
these measures will have the result which
the government expects. Canada is in a
singularly difficult position for one particular
reason which, though it bas not been much
emphasized, will need attention from now on.
The United States is a very large and rich
country, and as soon as prices of our primary
products fall below American prices the people
of that country buy from our stocks to build
up their own. Meat is a good illustration of
that practice. I think Canadians should be
told that our standard of living must be
reduced. We cannot maintain it and carry
the expenditures of the war and the defence
program.
Included in the estimates is provision for
aid in, the form of war materials to Belgium
and the Netherlands. That is all to the good.
In helping these nations to equip themselves
we are helping ourselves.
I do not intend to discuss the subject of the
welfare state. All of us believe in provision
for the national welfare, but it is a matter of
controversy how much should be spent and
in what manner the money should be distributed. The question will be before us next
session in connection with old age pensions.
Although it has not much to do with the
subject before us, I want to express the
thought that we are more disturbed about
the trouble in Iran and its possible effects
on the world situation than we are about the
war in Korea. A senator should be very
careful of what he says on these matters,
but I am persuaded that government policy
in Great Britain in the last five years has
encouraged a trend which may be very
difficult to stop. I know nothing about the
merits of the issue between Britain and
Iran. Perhaps the company drove too harsh
a bargain; perhaps it has been paying less
than it should have paid; perhaps the contract should have been revised. The fact
remains that the idea that you may take
things from people because they have them
and you have not was initiated in Great
Britain by the Labour Government of that
country, which went to men who had
organized businesses and conducted them for
many years, and announced "We shall take
over your enterprise and give you compensation in the form of bonds." These bonds
may be good or bad, but the fact remains
that compensation was offered in pounds,
which at the time were worth $4.85 and are
now worth only $3. The decline has wiped
out a great part of the equity of the former
owners of nationalized industry. It is all
very well to criticize private enterprise, but

he who deals unfairly must be prepared to
stand the consequences. Britain has fostered
the theory that the community is supreme
over the individual; and we are now seeing
some of the consequences. The state takes
over, and freedom fties out of the window.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Iran is merely doing what
the British Government has done.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes. The Iran government says, "You did it; why shouldn't we?"
And there is no answer. I am disturbed
about that situation, and I hope that our
government will do everything it can to
assist in ironing out that situation. It is
impossible to adequately compensate men
or companies of men for the loss of businesses which they have built up. Certain
intangibles are involved-like goodwilland they cannot be paid for. People who
believe that the state is entitled to take over
any enterprise have got to admit that this is
all Iran is doing. The Persian government
has told the British, in effect, "Get out of
here. You have had enough; we do not owe
If we apply to private
you anything."
enterprise the policy which the British government began, we shall end up in exactly
the same way.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That is what has kept
Saskatchewan from developing its oil resources. The companies are afraid of being
taken over.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That kind of threat will
hinder any development, and the Province
of Saskatchewan has found that out. The
Government was bitterly
Saskatchewan
criticized about its oil policy, and as a consequence it adopted the policy followed by
Alberta. People do not want to spend money
on oil development only to find out that the
government has practically full control over
it. If Saskatchewan and Alberta possessed
the same amount of oil, I would rather invest
my money in oil in Alberta than in Saskatchewan, because I would not be afraid of
the government of the province taking away
my oil interests. The Government of Saskatchewan is of the same mentality as the
present Government of Great Britain, and if
things went well it would take my property
away from me.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The oil companies agree
with you.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Sure they do!
Hon. Mr. Lambert: It is in the same class
as Iran.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, the problem is exactly
the same.
The honourable senator from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) is now present and I want

SENATE

to say something about him. He was Chairman of our Special Committee on Income
Tax a few years ago. Prior to that time I
was never certain just what kind of a person
he was, but since then I have always entertained the highest respect for him because of
the real contribution he made to our income
tax laws. As a practising lawyer I am
delighted that the government saw fit to
adopt most of the recommendations made by
that Special Committee, because they resulted
in fairer income tax laws for our people. If
the Senate never did anything else in the
sixteen years I have been here, that contribution alone has justified all the money the
Senate cost the country during that period.
I should also like to congratulate the
honourable member from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) on the splendid contribution his
report is making to the work of the Senate.
It illustrates the importance of the Senate in
our parliamentary system. The committee,
made up largely of Liberal members, brought
in a report which in some respects can be
used not only against the federal government
of today but against Liberal government in
every province. I admit, of course, that it
can be uscd against other governments as
well.
I agree with the honourable member from
Churchill that the heart of the Canadian
people is sound. We want to deal fairly
among ourselves and with other nations. We
have great resources and assets. No country
in the world, as the honourable senator from
St. John's (Hon. Mr. Pratt) said the other
day, offers young people the same opportunity that our country does. While we may
be criticized for the way in which we have
conducted our international affairs during the
last thirty or forty years, it cannot be said
that our generation has ever neglected to
appreciate the great resources of this country.
Our responsibility to the world is
increased because of these assets, and we
should not forget this. As Canadians we
hope that our government is fully co-operating with the governments of the United
States, the United Kingdom, and France, in
the cause of freedom and world liberty.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, I cannot let this occasion pass without referring to the excellent report of the
Standing Committee on Finance, and without complimenting the chairman and members of the committee for the time, energy
and thought which they have given to this
important question.
These reports become documents of more
than passing interest. They are carefully
drawn up, and the recommendations they

contain are logically arranged. Such reports
help to bring to the attention of the public
the serious problems which confront Canada.
Although I am a member of the Finance Committee I did not attend any of its meetings,
because I felt that I should leave the inquiry
entirely in the hands of other honourable
members. I did not wish in any way whatsoever to influence the decisions of the committee. I hope that at the next session of
parliament our Finance Committee will again
devote its time, energy and talents to a further consideration of proposed government
expenditures.
I realize that the references in the report
to governmental expenditures are directed
not only towards the federal government, but
also governments at all levels throughout
Canada. While I believe the government of
which I am a member has exercised great
prudence in respect to governmental expenditure, I would be the last one to say that every
cent that possibly could be saved has been
saved. On the other hand, while there is a
great deal of support for the idea of curtailing governmental expenditures, I am
reminded of what the late Honourable Mr.
Fielding used to say: "Economy is popular in
the other man's constituency." While there
is a general condemnation of excessive government expenditures, members of parliament are quite reluctant, except in individual
instances, to seriously oppose any specific
expenditure. On the other hand, they discover very ingenious devices to justify specific
government expenditures despite a great need
for econorny.
Hon. Mr. Reid: You can say that again.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Indeed, one of the
recommendations in the report bears out this
fact. I refer to paragraph 3, at page 410 of
the report of the committee's proceedings:
Your committee suggests that the government
should keep to the lowest point possible all capital
expenditures of every kind excepting those essential to defence, to provide the minimum of housing
necessary and those expenditures that are normally
directed to increasing the production of goods and
services required by the Canadian people.

has no control, and semi-statutory expendi-

Again, I compliment the committee on its
excellent report. I hope the chairman will
not weary in well doing, and that at the next
session, or as soon as convenient, he will again
address himself to this problem. It does seem
to me however-and this is not by way of
criticism-that the committee should seriously endeavour to correct the impression
that the great financial burden on the people
of Canada is brought about only by direct
taxation when, as a matter of fact, it springs
largely from a system of indirect taxation
that has been in vogue for many years.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
if the discussion of the report is concluded,
I should like to close the debate. I regret that
I was not present this morning to hear the
remarks that were made.
Hon. Mr. Euler: They would have caused
you to blush.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I doubt it.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I deeply appreciate the

kind, and quite undeserved, things that have
been said about my part in the preparation
of the report.
Let me say at once that I have never sat
with a committee that went about its task
more seriously than did the Finance Committee when it received its assignment from
the house on March 14 last. There was strong
evidence of a -desire on the part of every
member of the committee to explore this
problem thoroughly and, if possible, to get
at facts which would show the relationship
between governmental expenditures and the
problem of inflation. That in itself was
significant and very encouraging.
I quite agree with the remarks of the leader
of the government, that Canada has indirect
taxes which impose a heavy burden on the
people. I think it is fair to say, however, that
the question he raised was really outside
the scope of the reference to the ýcommittee.
That question might be dealt with another
year. What we were considering was the
effect of high government expenditures on
the rising cost of living. To me, there is no
doubt that if governments throughout Canada
could curtail their expenditures by, say, 10
per cent, and if each individualHon. Mr. Duffus: That is right.
curtail his
Hon. Mr. Crerar: -could
expenditures to the same extent, the problem
of inflation would disappear in a short time.
But it is difficult to bring these things about.
I have had some experience as a member
of a government, and I know the pressure that
is placed upon governments everywhere.

There is a great deal of ill-informed public
opinion which, if our democratic society is to
continue, must be exposed and corrected. I
remember the dark days of 1930 when the
province of Manitoba-and the honourable
leader opposite was then in the legislature
of that province-had a very difficult time
financially. The provincial treasurer of the
day found it necessary to advise his colleagues
that a tax known as the Wage Tax would
have to be imposed. The so-called Wage Tax
was in principle an income tax, which
extended down to the lower levels of income.
The interesting part of this experiment was
revealed several months after the tax was
imposed. One day, when at lunch with the
provincial treasurer, I asked what had been
the effect of the new wage tax that was so
unpopular. He replied that the most striking
effect was that within a few weeks the
demand upon the provincial government to
spend public money had been cut by 75 per
cent. That illustrates the importance of letting people see the taxes they pay, and indicates why I have been opposed to the
principle of indirect taxation. Most of us
are buying ever day some article to which the
sales tax applies. But not one buyer in a
thousand realizes that included in what he
is paying is a tax to the government. When
taxes are incorporated in prices they are
indirect, and the tendency to demand new
expenditures here, there and all along the
line is increased, because those who ask for
these things suppose that someone else will
have to pay for them. For this reason, taxes
should be direct.
Again I stress the need in these times for
governments to practice economy. I could
give illustration after illustration of expenditures, not only by the federal government but
by every provincial and municipal authority,
for objects which they consider necessary, but
which in these stressful times might well be
postponed. Within the last two years the
federal government bas sanctioned the construction of some very costly public buildings.
Of course we could have done without those
buildings. Things might not have been quite
as convenient for our servants, but we could
have got along in the same way that the old
pioneers in Manitoba, Ontario, and everywhere else in this country, got along with log
houses and primitive and inconvenient equipment until they were in a financial position
to afford something better. I believe that in
government affairs, if we are to make any
headway in solving the financial problem we
must adhere to the same principle. Some of
our government services have expanded far
too rapidly. It can no doubt be argued that

JUNE 28, 1951

useful or even necessary services have been
provided. But when an individual facing
straitened circumstances comes to decide
whether he should buy-for instance-a new
car this year or wait another two or three
years, he will, if he is prudent, decide to wait.
And it is the prudent people who succeed;
they defer their purchases until they can make
them without embarrassment. That is a very
simple principle, my colleagues, but it is a
principle which governments at all levels'tend
to lose sight of.
Also there needs to be on the part of our
public servants-among whom I include
senators-the recognition of this simple serious truth, that if people insist on demanding
from their governments increases of services, here or elsewhere, they must dig into
their pockets to pay for them. The only
way governments get money is by taking it
out of the taxpayers' pockets or borrowing
it from some persons or organizations that
will lend it to them; and the latter process
creates obligations which have to be met at
a later time. For myself, my insight into
this subject of expenditures is clarified when
I regard it in the same way as I would view
my personal expenditures or the expenditures of any other individual. After all,
there are a few simple, wholesome facts
which have stood the test of history and
will abide the test of the future.
If our -course in this matter is sane and
wise, there need be no doubt about the
future of this country. We have a great
country and a great people. No land is more
richly endowed with natural wealth and al
the elements necessary to a vibrant, successful human society. But in the management
of these great assets we must apply common
sense and prudence. At the same time we
must develop. I regard, for instance, as an
example of the right kind of expenditure
the bill introduced the other day by the
honourable senator from Winnipeg (Hon.
Mr. Davis), for assistance to build a railway
to develop a mine. Contrast that with the
vote of an even larger amount for a public
building which we could dispense with for
another five years.
I want to express once more, honourable
senators, my appreciative thanks to the members of the committee for the serious and
wholly admirable manner in which they
participated in the inquiry, and my gratitude to those who have been so kind as to
compliment me upon my part in this work.
The motion was agreed to, and the report
was adopted.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

DAIRY PRODUCTS BILL

MOTION FOR SECOND READINGDEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Wishar

McL. Robertson moved the

second reading of Bill 403, an Act to establish
national standards for dairy products and to
regulate interprovincial and international
trade in dairy products.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
may be divided into two parts. The first
part contemplates the establishment, for
dairy products, of grades and standards in
connection with interprovincial and export
trade, similar to existing grades and standards which apply to products under the
Fruit and Vegetable and Honey Act, and the
Live Stock and Live Stock Products Act. I
think it is safe to say that much the same
powers exist under present legislation as are
proposed here, except that the Supreme
Court and the Privy Council ruled that the
federal authorities have no power in regard
to grades and standards within the provinces.
The controls or powers of the federal authority are limited to interprovincial trade and
export trade.
Needless to say, the question of interprovincial trade in the products outlined in
this bill naturally arises. I may say to this
house at once, that I am not in a position to
discuss in detail the various constitutional
and other questions involved.
The control of grades and standards is
pretty well covered in the first five sections
of the bill before the house. Section 6 deals
with export or import of substitutes of dairy
products. It reads as follows:
6. (1) The Governor in Council may by regulation prohibit.
(a) importation into Canada or into one or more
designated provinces.
(b) exportation out of Canada or out of one or
more designated provinces, or
(c) sending or conveyance from any province to
any other province or from any province to one or
more designated provinces,
of any class of products that is designated by the
regulations as being
(i) milk, cream, butter, cheese, condensed milk,
evaporated milk, milk powder, dry milk, ice cream,
malted milk or sherbet, that contains fat or oil
other than that of milk, or
(ii) a substitute for milk, cream, butter, cheese,
condensed milk, evaporated milk, milk powder, dry
milk, ice cream, malted milk or sherbet.
(2) The Governor in Council may, by a regulation made under subsection one, designate any' class
of products as substitutes for a dairy product for
the purpose of the regulation if, in his opinion,
products of that class are produced wholly or substantially as substitutes for the dairy product.

May I draw attention to the fact that
whereas the first part of the bill deals with

SENATE

the certain prescribed grades and standards,
section 6 deals with the control of such
items as the Governor in Council may declare
to be dairy-product substitutes. The substitutes with which the dairy industry is most
concerned at the present time include substitutes for vegetable oils, in such items as
whipped cream, ice cream, condensed milk,
cheese, and fluid milk. In reply to a question
in the other house, the Minister of Agriculture said that under this bill there would
also be power to affect a commodity such as

establishing grades and standards in connection with interprovincial and export trade,
it seems to me that there is no question
about the government's authority in that
respect. The precedent has been established
in other statutes.
With regard to the latter part of the bill
the substitution of various products for products of the dairy industry. The government
feels it desirable to have power to control
interprovincial trade in such goods as may be
declared to be substitutes for dairy products.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Would the honourable
senator qualify that statement by saying
"restrictive control"?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Well, whether it is
restrictive or not might be a matter of opinion, I suppose, but the government certainly
is asking for power to control interprovincial
trade in all kinds of substitutes for dairy
products.
There may be some other points on which
I could give explanations if honourable
senators wish to ask questions of me,
although I am very humble in dealing with
these matters. Should the bill be given
second reading I shall move that it be
referred to committee, and I have arranged
for departmental officials and members of
the government who are more conversant
with the details of the measure than I am
to be present to answer any questions.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: I understood the
honourable senator to say that this measure
is along the lines of other statutes for the
control of interprovincial trade in fruits and
other goods. I am not aware of any such
legislation, and I should like to know if his
statment is correct.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I can only say that I
am advised that power of control is given
in the Fruit, Vegetables and Honey Act and
in the Live Stock and Live Stock Products
Act with respect to the establishment of
certain grades which are used in connection
with interprovincial trade.

Hon. Mr. Hardy: With respect to grades,
not substitutes?
I was careful, I
Hon. Mr. Robertson:
think, to point out that I was talking about
grades, not substitutes.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators,
this innocent looking bill, brought in on what
is almost literally the last day of the session,
is described as an Act to establish national
standards for dairy products and to regulate
interprovincial and international trade in
dairy products. I have no objection to granting the Governor in Council power to make
legitimate regulations to achieve proper purposes, but having examined the bill-and 'I
hope all senators have examined it-I am
amazed that any government, especially a
Liberal government, should sponsor legislation giving itself power to prohibit trade
between the provinces, freedom in which
may be described as one of the corner-stones
I am further surprised
of confederation.
that the House of Commons should, almost
without any comment, surrender to the
cabinet a power which, in my opinion, parliament itself should never exercise, and which
certainly should not be given to the cabinet.
Most of what I have to say will be about
clause 6 of the bill. If members will read
that clause they will discover there implica-

tions to which the Senate should never give
consent. If I bring margarine into the
discussion, it will be principally for two
reasons. The first is that the government's
past record in its opposition to margarine
leads me to suspect that this bill is another
method to handicap the sale and use of that
product. I may say, incidentally, that for
some more or less subtle or obscure reason,
margarine has now been promoted by this
measure into the family of dairy products;
but it is still the step-sister of them all, in
that it is subject to the 10 per cent sales
tax, to which butter and other foods are not
subject. My second reason for bringing
margarine into the discussion is that it provides a striking illustration of the application of the vicious principle-I say that
advisedly and deliberately-of prohibiting
trade between provinces, and of doing so by
order in council.
Let us examine clause 6, which in my
opinion is the essence of the bill. Clause 5
is similar, and to me seems somewhat
redundant, although I feel that both clauses
should be eliminated from the bill. Clause 6
says:
The Governor in Council may by regulation
prohibit
(a) importation into Canada or into one or more
designated provinces,
(b) exportation out of Canada or out of one or
more designated provinces, or

JUNE 28. 1951
-and

this is the essence of it-

(c) sending or conveyance from any province to
any other province or from any province to one or
more designated provinces,
of any class of products that is designated by
the regulations as being
(i) milk, cream, butter, cheese, condensed milk,
evaporated milk, milk powder, dry milk, ice cream,
malted milk or sherbet, that contains fat or oil
other than that of milk,

That means margarine, of course.
or
(ii) a substitute for milk, cream, butter, cheese,
condensed milk, evaporated milk, milk powder,
dry milk, ice cream, malted milk or sherbet.
And subsection 2 says:
The Governor in Council may, by a regulation
made under subsection one, designate any class of
products as substitutes for a dairy product for the
purpose of the regulation if, in his opinion,
products of that class are produced wholly or substantially as substitutes for the dairy produet.
That again means margarine, although it
seems to me rather significant that the word

margarine does not appear in the bill at all.
I will pass over paragraph (a), which deals
with importation, with very little comment,
except to point out that to prohibit the
importation into Canada of the products of
foreign countries is entirely out of harmony
with the spirit which was supposed to govern
the proceedings at Geneva some years ago.
The whole basis of the negotiations there, as
I have said in this chamber before, was that
no country should place a prohibitive tariff
against the products of any other contracting
country. Some products might get in over a
tariff wall, but an absolutely prohibited
article cannot come in at all. I may say, in
passing, that the attitude of Canada at the
Geneva convention was an exhibition of bad
faith, a statement which I can prove by
documentary evidence.
Now I corne to paragraph (b), which may
prohibit the exportation of these dairy products out of Canada. I have not a great deal
to say about that. I would just point out that
we are constantly trying to expand our trade,
and I do not regard the restriction of our
export trade as being a step in the right
direction.
Clause (c) is the one which I wish to direct
my remarks. This is pièce de résistance in
reverse, and in my opinion it is thoroughly
bad. I have said that I would refer to margarine as a dairy product-in fact, the bill in
effect says that it is a dairy product. I would
point out, as an illustration, that if this bill
becomes law the Governor in Council will
have the power to prohibit we will say, a
housewife-we will say from Hull-buying
margarine in Ottawa and carrying it to Hull
to feed her family. And even worse, they
could prohibit the sending of margarine from

a factory in Ontario, which I believe is the
only province manufacturing margarineHon. Mr. Beaubien: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. Euler:

Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I do not think it is being

Hon. Mr. Euler: The government could
prohibit Ontario margarine from being sent
to feed the hundreds of thousands of people
living in Western Canada. It would not
satisfy me for anyone to say that the government would not do such a thing. When
power is placed in the hands of the government they are apt to use it. I would say
that such is the purpose of the provisions of
this bill, and it must be regarded as such.
Until recently I have had the impression
that the clause of the British North America
Act which states-and I may not quote it
exactly-that products of one province may
be freely taken into another province,
means what it says. I think that it ought to
mean what it says. I am informed, however, that in another case-I think in connection with liquor-the Privy Council
interpreted the clause to mean that no province could erect a tariff barrier against
tkc pi x1uuLs or another province. That is
not as bad as the measure contemplated by
this bill: products can surmount a tariff, if
it is not too high, but a prohibition means an

ment be given the power to prohibit the
carrying into another province of any class
of product, such as a dairy product, why can
it not logically come back next session and
ask for similar legislation respecting any
other product manufactured in one of the
provinces? In the end we would have in
Canada ten small countries, each sufficient
unto itself, carrying on a prohibitionary war,
if you like among themselves. The illustration may be regarded as far-fetched, but a
condition might come about whereby the
manufacturers of boots and shoes in the province of Quebec would be prohibited from
sending their products into Ontario. I understand that very good shoes are also made in
New Brunswick.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: The best in Canada.

same articles are .produced in Quebec. The
government might pass regulations to prevent the shipment of such goods from Ontario
to Quebec.
* Hon. Mr. Beaubien: They :could not do it
under this bill.
Hon. Mr. Euler: But my point is that a
precedent established respecting dairy products can well be applied to other products.
Indeed, the fish caught in Nova Scotia might
well be prohibited from shipment to New
Brunswick; British Columbia might be prevented from sending its fish and forest
products to the other provinces of Canada;
Saskatchewan coal might not be allowed into
the province of Alberta, and vice versa. The
passage of this bill would establish an
absolutely vicious precedent, contrary to the
whole spirit under which confederation was
accomplished.
In conclusion I shall refer once more to
the matter of margarine, because I am quite
sure that this item was not absent from the
minds of those who inspired this bill. Look
at the record of the government, if you will,
respecting margarine. In 1946 a bill introduced in this house to provide for the legalized manufacture and sale of margarine
was defeated. In 1947 a similar bill was
introduced, and was again defeated. The
bill introduced in 1948 met the same fate.
Then this house-and I think it deserves
credit for it-passed a resolution requesting
the government to submit the question of
the constitutionality of the prohibitory law
to the Supreme Court of Canada. Somewhat
to my surprise-and I need not mention the
reason for it-the government complied with
the request and submitted the case to the
Court. The government argued at the hearing that the prohibition was constitutional.
This was just another move in its opposition
to margarine.
Notwithstanding that, the
Supreme Court of Canada declared the law
unconstitutional and ultra vires of the federal
parliament. The manufacture of margarinethe coloured product-began at once. Some
months later the Province of Ontario,
followed by the other provinces, with two
exceptions to which I shall refer later,
decreed that the manufacturers of margarine
should not be permitted to colour their
product. The sole purpose of this moveand I do not think it can be denied-was
that the housewife, by reason of being put
to the trouble of messing about in her
kitchen with the colouring of margarine,
would be discouraged from buying it and
would buy butter.

Hon. Mr. Dupuis: No; that is not the
reason.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That is the only reason.
Hon. Mr. Bishop: There is no other reason.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: The purpose was to
prevent margarine from being confused with
butter in the retail stores.
Hon. Mr. Euler: It cannot be. Al packages are marked. You cannot go into a
retail store and buy 'margarine except it be
in a clearly marked package. I know that
there is a good deal of margarine consumed
in Quebec, the province of the honourable
senator, so the provincial government's prohibition of the manufacture and sale of
margarine in Quebec is a most unjust discrimination against the consumers of that
province. The same statement, though perhaps not in a similar degree, is applicable
also to the Province of Prince Edward Island.
After the Supreme Court made its decision,
the manufacture of margarine was proceeded with, mainly in Ontario. Then the
Dairy Council of Canada decided-in its
wisdom, if one chooses to put it that wayto appeal the matter to the Privy Council,
and did so. Some of us defended in that
court the consumer of margarine, and again
we had arrayed against us the Government
of Canada, which sent to the Privy Council
in Great Britain, as it had sent to the
Supreme Court of Canada, the Deputy
Minister of Justice. Again we defeated the
opponents of margarine-a result, I may say
which gave me considerable satisfaction.
Last year I moved in this house that since
margarine was a recognized article of food,
consumed by millions of Canadians, it
should be exempt from the sales tax, from
which practically all food products are
exempt. The motion was rejected.
The
government, of course, took no action about
it. This year, in the present budget, another
2 per cent was added to the sales tax, with
the result that margarine is now subject
to a sales tax of 10 per cent, which is not
paid by its sister products to which I referred
some time ago. That imposition adds, I
suppose, from three to four cents a pound
to the price of margarine. Yet what a
boon this product has been to the people of
this country. I suppose no one will deny
that, in spite of the outrageous ban on
colouring, people buy margarine more and
more.
I was mildly amused yesterday when a
friend and colleague of mine remarked to
me, "You know, I have always voted against
your margarine bill". "Yes," I said, "I
know". He said, "I thought that when I
went home to my farmer friends I would

JUNE-' 28, 1951
receive a good deal of commendation from
them on my action, but to my surprise-they
were all buying margarine themselves".
Hon. Mr. Roebuck:
Hon. Mr. Davis:

Yes.
Not in Manitoba.

Hon. Mr. Euler: I ask the Senate to reject
this bill, not particularly because of the
effect it may have as regards margarineof which I have perhaps spoken more than
is necessary, though I used it illustrativelybut because of the bad precedent the bill
would set in restricting trade between the
In that respect, to
provinces of Canada.
my mind, it is entirely opposed to the principles of confederation.
Recently the Senate spent weeks, perhaps
months, in discussing a more or less futile
resolution as to how this body .could be made
more useful. I did not take any part in that
discussion; but if I were to give my opinion
on the subject now I would say that apart
perhaps from the abolition of this body, the
best way to reform the Senate would be for
us to reform ourselves by recognizing that
once in this chamber we are no longer Grits
and Tories or Liberals 'and Progressive Conservatives, and that we should judge legislation on its merits, for that, I think, is what
the people of Canada expect of us.
Sone Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Herein lies an opportunity
for the Senate to perform 'a real service. It
is sometimes said that we are here to review
"hasty legislation" which comes from the
other house. I believe this bill is an outstanding example of hasty and ill-considered legislation. It received practically no consideration in the other place, it comes to us on
almost the last day of the session, and in my
opinion should never have been presented in
its present form. The Senate now has an
opportunity to reject or to amend it. It is
certainly my intention to vote against the
bill if it is pressed to second reading. As a
matter of fact I am going to move an amendment, sleconded by the honourable senator
from Leeds (Hon. Mr. Hardy):
That Bill 403 be not now read a second time, but
be read a second time six months hence.

Hon. A. L. Beaubien: Honourable senators,
it is not my intention to speak at any length
on this bill. One thing that pains me a good
deal is that on this question I am unable to
agree with my honourable friend from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler), with whom I have been
associated in political activities for many
years. His whole argument has been based
on margarine.
Hon. Mr. Euler: No, no.

Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Well, if it was not,,he
certainly mentioned that comnnodity very
often.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Certainly. I used it as an
illustration.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: The point which concerns me is this. There are in this country
450,000 dairy f armers. The total annual
returns from the dairy industry are in the
neighbourhood of $500- millions. That industry is very important not only to the economic
well-being of the country but to the health
of the people. My information is that there
are about seven manufacturers of margarine,
I have nothing to say against margarine: I
have more objection to certain other substitutes which are sold all oVer the country and
are contributing to the destruction of the
dairy industry.
Two important questions in this connection
are: 1-Is the dairy industry important to the
economic well-being of 'Canada; and 2-Is it
important to the health of our children. I
contend that its importance under both these
headings is very great. It makes a valuable
contribution to the economic wellJ1being of
Canada, for if the dairymen were put out of
business the harm which would follow would
take years to repair.
Some years ago, when my honourable
friend from Waterloo introduced a bill with
regard to margarine, he argued that the
manufacture and sale of this product in
Canada would develop a national oil industry
in which the farmers thenselves would participate; that the production and extraction
of cil would form part of their farming
operations.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I said it could, not that it
would.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: I do not remember
precisely what you said, but I think that
was your contention. My information is that
close to 98 per cent of the oil that goes into
the manufacture of substitutes for milk and
milk products are imported. Therefore, the
contention that the manufacture and sale of
margarine would create an industry in
Canada which would benefit the farmers is
all shot to pieces. Not only that, but it will
be found today that margarine has reduced
our production of butter and of fluid milk.
If this trend continues there will soon be no
fluid milk for our children.
There may be some objectionable features
in this bill, but surely my honourable friend
from a Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler), for whom
I have a great deal of regard, will be
generous enough to permit the bill to be
read a second time. Then it could be referred
to the Standing Committee on Natural

SENATE
Resources, where officials of the department
and others concerned could fully explain it.
Then, if the bill were reported back from
committee, the honourable senator would
have full opportunity to make further representation against it.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: The honourable
senator from Provencher (Hon. Mr. Beaubien)
accuses the honourable member from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) of opposing this bill
purely in the interest of margarine.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Pardon me! Please do
not put words in my mouth. It was not an
accusation.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Well, then, it was an
allegation. It seemed to me that the gentleman from Provencher advocated the passing
of the bill purely in the support of his own
attitude with respect to margarine. If that
is so, it would appear to me that the proper
way to deal with the matter would be to
legislate on margarine as margarine, and not
in this backhand wayHon. Mr. Horner: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: -of giving the executive powers that are both vicious and
unprecedented.
My honourable friends all know the position I take with regard to margarine. When
I say that I am not much influenced by the
effect of this bill upon margarine as a single
commodity, the house will of course remember that I was in favour of allowing the
consumers of our cities, towns and farms to
use this product if they so desired. I oppose,
as I always do, the attempt of any single
class, for their own financial good, to restrict
the liberties of the public in general. I do
not care whether the people in this class
are on the farms or in the cities. I always
take that stand. I am not concealing in any
way my views about margarine, or changing
them in any way; neither am I entirely disregarding just what, in my judgment, this bill
is designed to do with respect to margarine.
It is a back-door method of attacking the
problem, in the interests of the government
of one particular province. This bill might
far better be described as an Act for the
relief of Mr. DuplessisSome Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: -than for an Act for
the establishment of national standards for
dairy products. Perhaps it 'could be just as
well designated as an Act to facilitate the
Minister of Agriculture in his political
manoeuvers as between provinces. In all
events it is entirely vicious.

The member for Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler)
has not overstated his case; in fact, with his
usual modesty he has understated it. As I
have said, I am not so much interested in the
effect of this bill upon margarine as I am
in its general principle. The honourable
senator from Provencher would have us give
second reading to the bill so that it could be
referred to some committee where officials
from the department could be heard. I should
like to hear from the minister myself, but
I do not think that can be done. It is on the
second reading of a bill that the principle is
discussedHon. Mr. Euler: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: -and it is because I
am opposed to the principle of this bill that
I could not bring myself to vote for second
reading for any mere procedural reason.
I am opposed to the principle of this bill
because, when Canada was formed, the rights
of the provinces to impose direct taxation
were expressly restricted, and the power to
tax indirectly was kept from them. This was
done for the express purpose of preventing the
erection of tariff walls between our provinces.
It was because we did not want Canada
divided up into small packages with trade
obstructions between them that we adopted
the kind of Act we did in 1867. Because of
that right of free trade among our provinces,
Canada has gradually grown to the great
nation she now is. The same thing has been
said in this chamber during this present
session about our great neighbour to the
south: because of the absence of inter-state
obstructions to trade, the United States has
grown to be the most powerful and wealthy
nation upon the earth.
Here, perhaps for the mere ulterior purpose of attacking oleomargarine, we are
handing to the executive of Canada the right
to prohibit the exchange between provinces
of all articles described in this bill as dairy
products. We are "Balkanizing" the Dominion of Canada and dividing it up into small
jurisdictions of trade. This is enough to ruin
the country over which we preside.
I am opposed to this bill on the grounds of
the deepest of principles. As a patriotic
Canadian I cannot agree to a proposition like
this, no matter what financial interests may
be involved. Expediency has nothing to do
with this question except the expediency
of nationality and the preservation of Canada
as one economic unit. Were we to pass this
bill today and give the executive the right
to control the passage of these articles from
one province to another, how long will it be
before we are asked to authorize the government to control interprovincial trade in
other commodities?
How long will it be

JUNE 28, 1951
before the western provinces ask that the
executive be empowerd to make rules preventing Ontario manufacturers of binders,
plows and other agricultural implements
from sending them into the West and
competing with implements produced out
there? How long will it be before the fishermen on one coast endeavour to prevent the
sale in that part of the country of fish caught
on the other coast, or perhaps in the inland
One's imagination would be dull
lakes?
indeed if it did not picture numerous
illustrations of the application of the
principle involved in this bill, leading
finally, through the efforts of pressure
groups, to our having in Canada a condition similar to that in the Balkans-a whole
series of small nations warring economically
one against the other.
I am opposed to the principle in this bill,
and it will certainly give me a great deal of
pleasure to support the motion of my honourable friend from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler)
for a six-months hoist-which I hope will be
agreed to and continued in perpetuity.
Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators,
I entirely agree with the honourable senator
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck).
Indeed, I am amazed, from a constitutional
point of view, that the Minister of Justice
could have approved of this bill. We have,
today, a splendid opportunity for strikingly
demonstrating the usefulness of the Senate.
The Senate has been created, as has often
been said, to prevent legislation of this kind
from being enacted.
Section 6 of the bill says:
The Governor in Council may by regulation
prohibit
(a) importation into Canada or into one or more
designated provinces,
(b) exportation out of Canada or out of one or
more designated provinces, or
(c) sending or conveyance from any province to
any other province or from any province to one or
more designated provinces,
of any class of products. . . .

Let us read section 121
North America Act:

of the British

121: All articles of the Growth Produce, or
Manufacture of any one of the Provinces shall,
from and after the Union. be admitted free into
each of the other Provinces.

It will now clearly appear to all, I think,
that sections 4, 5 and 6 of this bill are
unconstitutional, and ultra vires of parliament.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Vien: That fundamental provision, section 121 of the B.N.A. Act, has often
come up before our courts, but its purpose
and meaning was never more clearly
defined and determined than in the judgment
rendered by the Judicial Committee of the
80713-48

Privy Council in the case of the Canadian
Federation of Agriculture vs. Attorney
General of Quebec, commonly called "the
Margarine Case", and reported in 4, Dominion Law Reports, (1950) at page 689. The
headnote of this decision will suffice to substantiate my submission that -sections 4, 5
and 6 of this bill are ultra vires. That headnote is as follows:
The Parliament of Canada does not have legislative power to prohibit the manufacture, sale, offer
or possession for sale of butter substitutes manufactured wholly or in part from any fat other than
that of milk or cream. Hence, s. 5(a) of the Dairy
Industry Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 45 is, in those respects
ultra vires. It is not legislation in relation to the
regulation of trade and commerce since, according
to the current of authority, the Dominion cannot
regulate individual forms of. trade and commerce
confined to the province and, a fortiori, it cannot
prohibit them.
The fact that the prohibition
extends to inter-provincial transactions does not
enable the dominion to encompass transactions of
manufacture and sale taking place wholly in one
province.
Nor is s. 5(a) defensible as legislation in relation
to the criminal law, since its pith and substance
is protection of the dairy industry, and not the
safeguarding of the public against something of a
general or injurious nature to be abolished or
removed.

The reason for this statement being here
made is that the right of parliament to
impose restrictions upon inter-provincial
trade in certain goods had, in certain cases,
been upheld. A federal law restricting interprovincial liquor trade, for instance, was held
by the Privy Council to be a safeguard
"against something of a general or injurious
nature to be abolished or removed."
The headnote continues:
Again, the legislation cannot be supported as
being for the peace, order and good government
of Canada since it relates to civil rights in each of
the provinces, and there are no abnormal circumstances or exceptional conditions to override the
normal distribution of powers in ss. 91 and 92 of the
B.N.A. Act.

Hon. Mr. Dupuis: May I ask my honourable

friend a question? Does he think that a
province has the right to regulate trade as
between itself and other provinces?
Hon. Mr. Vien: No, it bas not.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: I will put a specific case.
Has the province of Quebec power to prohibit
the importation into that province of any
products exported from another province?
Hon. Mr. Vien: It cannot prevent the
importation from another province of anything but liquor, or some other thing deemed
to be of a general and injurious nature which
should be abolished or removed. The liquor
trade was held by the Privy Council to be
something of a general or injurious nature
which could be abolished or removed, and a
federal law implementing provincial legislation governing the liquor trade was upheld.

SENATE
My reply to the question that bas just
been put to me is emphatically: no. Only
when a product is deemed to be generally
injurious to the health and welfare of the
people is there any justification for intervention by parliament. With reference to
the particular item of food dealt with in
the judgment to which I referred, the Privy
Council held that there was no such
justification.
The headnote continues as follows:
Finally, s 5(a) is not legislation in relation to
agriculture within s. 95 of the B.N.A. Act since the
connection between its prohibitions and the operations carried on by farmers is too indirect and
remote.
Moreover, having regard to the history of the
legislation in question and to its present form, it
cannot be said that its purpose was to exclude
from Canada substances injurious to health.

It has been conclusively established, to the
satisfaction of the Privy Council, that margarine cannot be considered as being injurious
to health. Therefore, honourable senators,
I respectfully submit that the provincial
rights, as set out in the British North America
Act, are at stake, and it is the unquestionable
duty of the Senate not to permit those rights
to be invaded and violated, as is attempted
to be done in disguise 'by this bill. In my
opinion, this legislation is ultra vires; it is
obviously and fiatly in confiict with the
provisions of section 121 of the British North
America Act.
This measure is not a piece of liberal legislation. The Dairy Industry Act, s. 5, a, which
was declared unconstitutional was not truly
liberal legislation. The expression "liberal"
is here used not in the partisan but in the
democratic sense of the word.
I cannot reach any other conclusion but
that this bill, as it now stands, should be
rejected.
Hon. A. C. Hardy: Honourable senators, I
do not intend to deal at length with the subject matter of this bill. The honourable
senator who has just laid the constitutional
phase of the matter before the house bas, I
think, touched on a most important point. He
has made his views very clear, but I would
say that his argument might be carried even
further. Some sort of ýparallel has been
drawn between the powers granted in this
bill and powers prohibiting the transfer and
sale of liquor as between the provinces. I
would point out that the law prohibiting the
transfer of liquor was a general law, and
applied to all provinces. Quite apart from
the fact that liquor might be regarded by
some misguided people as a dangerous or
harmful beverage, we have in this case a

proposal
which would be applied to
designated provinces. It might be applied to
one province and not to another.
I have two chief objections. One, I am
sure, the leader opposite will agree with, for
as long as I can remember he has been
arguing against government by order in
council. His stand in this regard has, I think,
been justified, especially in the past few
years, when our legislation in Canada bas
consisted to too great an extent of government by order in council. This proposed
measure would give to the Governor in
Council power to deal with such a very important matter as interprovincial trade. I need
not dwell at length on that phase of the
argument, because it already has been
discussed.
I seconded the motion for the six months'
hoist because the bill bas only been placed
before us on what was supposed to have been
the last day of the present session of
parliament.
This bouse spent about two months debating the functions of the Senate and how it
could best serve the interests of Canada.
This bill-which is not of great importance,
except as a matter of principle-gives us a
very good opportunity to demonstrate that
the Senate is not, as some uninformed people
think, a rubber stamp for the administration
of the day. This bill provides the Senate
with an opportunity to declare itself for the
benefit of the people of Canada, and to uphold
its own dignity and power.
I do not intend to touch on the question of
whether or not the dairy farmer will suffer
by reason of the passage of this measure.
The senator from Provencher (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien) spoke with some feeling on that
matter. On the question of who uses the
so-called substitute for butter, I took the
opportunity while attending a meeting of
eight dairy farmers sometime ago to ask
them whether or not they used margarine in
their homes.
With one exception these
farmers said that they used margarine. The
one who did not use it was a high-salaried
man and an officer in several cattle associations, so for those reasons, I suppose, he did
not choose to use the product.
As to whether the dairy farming industry
is being injured by the use of margarine or
not, I may say that I operate a very substantial dairy farm, on which I produce a
breed of butter-fat cattle, called Jerseys.
In this large-scale operation I have not found
the sale of margarine injurious to my business
to the extent of one penny.
I do, however, object to this kind of
legislation being brought down on the last
day of the session. As the honourable senator

JUNE 28, 1951
from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) said, the bill
was very briefly discussed in another place.
I read the debate, which occupied only a
column and a half of Hansard. The honourable senator from Provencher (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien) asks us ta give the bill second
reading s0 that it can go to committee. My
understanding is that parliament will adjourn
tomorrow until October. What possibility is
there of having the bill go to committee and
be reported, or dealt with, in this short
period of time?
It is with great pleasure that I second the
amendment of the honourable senator from
Waterloo.

Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Within the last twentyfour hours we have had before us a bill to
amend the Criminal Code. Various objections to provisions of that bill were taken by
honourable senators; they were in exactly the
same vein as the objection to section 6 of
the present bill; yet that bill was sent to
committee, was discussed, and will come up
for further discussion, I understand, some
time tomorrow. Why cannot we take the
same course with respect to the present bill?
The committee could make any report it
deemed fit: it could declare that it had not

every piece of important legislation in all its
ramifications. Without denying that this bill
is introduced very late in the session, my
inadequate explanation of its contents may
be taken to confirm what I have repeatedly
said about the burdens which are cast upon
one man in this chamber.
If the house should adopt the amendment
of my honourable friend, it will thereby preclude itself from obtaining the full information which I believe would be forthcoming
in committee. It is the established practice
of this assembly to obtain through its standing committees the details of proposed legislation, and I suggest that the practice should
not be departed from on this occasion. I
might also point out that the mover of the
amendment remarked that he had no particular objection to the first part of the bill,
which prescribes standards for butter; his
main objection was to the contents of section 6.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That contains, to my mind,
the principle of the bill, which is what we
discuss on second reading.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: It is quite within
the province of my honourable friend or of
any other honourable senator to move an
amendment after the bill has received second
reading.
The existing practices in this house will
continue, and I make no undertaking that I
shall ever be in a position to give detailed
information about legislation which originates
in the other house. It simply cannot be done.
I have availed myself of the experience of
honourable senators in this chamber, but one
cannot expect them to have detailed information on House of Commons bills, many of
which have wide ramifications and involve
deep constitutional questions. I think it
would be unwise to preclude honourable
members from the benefit of receiving
detailed information in committee in regard
to bills brought before them. In committee
the members can deal with legislation as
they see fit.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
my purpose in rising is to offer the house
a suggestion. I am disturbed about the idea
of voting against any bill on second reading.
I entirely agree with what has just been said
by the leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Robertson). If I were in his position I would
feel exactly as he does.
Now, I object to clause 6 of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Let me make myself clear.
I have always voted in this house against
the lifting of the ban on the manufacture

and sale of oleomargarine. I spoke strongly
against this when the issue first came before
the Senate, and I need not speak about it
again because my views are well known here.
Let me say quite candidly that I am not
at all interested in this bill as it affects
oleomargarine.
I am disturbed, however,
about section 6. In that I agree with the
honourable member from Cariboo (Hon. Mr.
Turgeon). This section does not go all the
way to the principle underlying the bill. If
food substitutes are being put on the market
in this country then, of course, our Food
and Drugs Act could be amended to cover
that situation completely.
Hon. Mr. King: If the substitutes are
njurious.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes. I object to section 6
of the bill for the reasons set forth by the
honourable senator from De Lorimier (Hon.
Mr. Vien). I do not think the British North
America Act ever contemplated the prohibition of trade between our provinces.
Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Such a thing would be
disastrous to our country. I am not going
to say whether a Liberal or a Conservative
policy is involved here, because that is something which does not "cut much ice" in the
Senate. What I want to do is to suggest
to the honourable senator from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) that he withdraw his proposal of a six-months' hoist.
It may be said that when we give a bill
second reading we are in effect voting for
the principle of it. Well, there have been
many times when I have not blocked a bill
on second reading, but have later had it
amended in committee so that it did not look
like the same bill at all. I agree with the
honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) that this is the proper
stage at which to discuss the principle of this
bill, but I would suggest that we give it
second reading now and move to refer it to
Then the honourable senator

from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler), seconded by
the honourable senator from Leeds (Hon. Mr.
Hardy), could move that the committee be
instructed to strike out section 6 of the bill.
Some Hon. Senators:

Hon. Mr. Hardy: Why not strike out section
5 of the bill as well?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Section 5 is not quite the
same.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Section 3 is the same too.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The vital section is section 6.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Sections 3 and 5 are just as

JUNE 28, 1951
Hon. Mr. Haig: If my amendment is voted
on, it will then be known whether honourable
members want the Act amended in such a
way that no government will have power to
prohibit inter-trade between provinces. I
have been greatly impressed by the arguments presented by the honourable senators
from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien) and
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck).
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I would draw my
friend's attention to section 8. I have a
stronger objection to that section than any
other, because it makes provision for powers
that exceed anything I have ever seen in a
bill before.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not want to get this
house into a tangle. I want it to vote on one
issue. There may be other objectionable
sections, but if we vote to strike out section
6 it means that we do not want interprovincial
trade interfered with. That is all I want to
accomplish in my proposal to the house.
Hon. Mr. Bishop: Why not strike it out
here?
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is what I want to do,
by way of an instruction.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Honourable senators will
find the same principle involved in sections
3, 4 and 5.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear. The principle
is to be found al the way through the bill.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Let us put it this way. If
the honourable leader moves second reading,
then the honourable senator from Waterloo
can get up and move that all power to prohibit interprovincial trade be eliminated from
the bill.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: That would kill the
whole bill.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, it wouldn't.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: I shall prove that to
you in a minute.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I would not vote for
section 6, but, of course, if the house does
not wish to accept my suggestion I will withdraw it.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable sen:ators, I would point out to the honourable
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) that
the house can not instruct a committee as to
what it shal do. Our standing committees
are supposed to be free to do what they
choose. I do not think that this house can
vote on a motion to direct a committee what
it should do.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Oh, yes it can. The house
can instruct a committee to do anything it
wants. It can tell it to cross the "t"s and dot

the "i"s. The house is all-powerful. We can
instruct the committee to strike out this prohibition clause when considering the bill.
However, apparently my suggestion is not
meeting with favour, so the issue will not
arise.
The Hon. the Speaker: If the honourable
gentleman's proposal comes before the house,
I shall then give my ruling on it.
Hon. P. H. Bouffard: Honourable senators,
I have expressed my opinion about margarine
many times. I have said before, and I say
again, that the lifting of the ban on the
manufacture and sale of oleomargarine has
damaged our dairy industry. I think that
provinces other than Quebec and Prince
Edward Island have. suffered greatly by the
introduction of margarine. However, each
province has the right to say whether or not
it wishes to have margarine sold within its
boundaries. Eight provinces have decided
that they do want it, and I say at once that
that is their own business, just as I say that
it is the business of Quebec and Prince
Edward Island to decide that they do not
want to have margarine.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Is the honourable senator
sure of that point, in the light of section 121
of the British North America Act?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I fear I do not understand my honourable friend's question. I
say that every province has the right to
decide whether a certain product may be
sold or manufactured within its boundaries,
and once a province has made a decision on
this point no one else has any right to
interfere. I am not talking about importation or exportation now; I am simply saying
that a province has the right to say what
may be manufactured or sold within its own
territory. The Ontario legislature, for instance, has decided that margarine may be
manufactured or sold within that province,
and I claim that that decision is the business
of nobody else.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That point is not raised
by this bill at all.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: If my honourable
friend will let me continue I am sure that
my point will appear, though slowly.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Maybe after a while you
will join me.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I say that this bill is
in effect an amendment to the Dairy Industry
Act. A portion of that Act prohibited the
importation of margarine into Canada and
its manufacture and sale anywhere in the
country. The question was referred to the
courts, and the Privy Council decided that

SENATE

parliament had no right to prohibit the manufacture and sale of margarine within any
province. So, as I say, I regard this Bill
as being, in effect, an amendment to that
part of the Act which was held unconstitutional. Since the delivery of the Privy
Council's jud'gment eight provinces have
decided to permit the manufacture and, sale
of margarine within their boundaries. The
other two provinces, Quebec and Prince
Edward Island, have decided not to permit
this. Now, if they have the right to make
that decision, what is the objection to our
passing a law to implement the provincial
legislation?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Why should we do
that?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Why not? Why should
the province of Quebec, for instance, have
to organize a whole staff of employees to
search the border between Quebec and
Ontario in an endeavour to find what persons
are bringing margarine into Quebec?
Hon. Mr. Euler: Let the province enforce
its own laws.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: It cannot.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Why not?
Hon. Mr. Vien: My honourable friend is
arguing for something contrary to section
121 of the British North America Act.
Mon. Mr. Bouffard: I understood very well
'the argument of my honourable friend from
De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien), and I shall
come to it shortly, but in the meantime I
wish I might be allowed to develop my own
point. I cannot see why the federal government, which has a large staff of employees
in the Customs and Excise services, should
not help Quebec and Prince Edward Island
in their efforts to prevent margarine from
coming into those provinces. No one could
object to that.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: There is a great deal
of objection to that.

penalties for persons who send or take margarine into those provinces. Everyone knows
that Quebec itself has passed a law prohibiting the importation of margarine into the
province for sale, and also the sale of it
within the province, but a province cannot
fully enforce such a law unless there is a
federal law or regulation against importation into that province. A company in
Ontario or in any other part of Canada
where the manufacture and sale of margarine
are permitted knows it cannot be punished
for shipping or attempting to ship margarine
into Quebec or Prince Edward Island, and
so it is likely to do all it can to carry on
such business.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: You are suggesting
that a federal statute should provide penalties for persons in Ontario who violate a
Quebec law.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I say that every province has an absolute right to prohibit the
manufacture or sale of certain products
within its boundaries. What objection is
there to the federal government helping each
province to maintain its own rights? Why
should parliament stand idly by and do nothing to prevent a manufacturer or retailer in
Ontario from shipping margarine into Quebec, when he knows that that is against the
law of Quebec? After all, what is the objection to a federal penalty for a man in Ontario
who violates a Quebec law? What sympathy
should we have for him?
Hon. Mr. Euler: He cannot violate a law
that does not apply to him.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: But it will apply to
him if this bill is passed. The senator from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) pleaded in the
Senate and in the other house on numerous
occasions for a lifting of the ban on the
importation, manufacture and sale of margarine, and at last he succeeded in achieving
his object. But it was left to each province
to decide whether it would permit the importation, sale and manufacture within its own
boundaries. Is he now indifferent as to
whether the prohibition against margarine
in two provinces is violated or not? Does he
think, that a manufacturer or dealer in
Ontario, for instance, should be able to ship
his product into Quebec, in violation of
provincial law, and escape punishment?

Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Well, I cannot see
why. That is where my honourable friend
and I differ. This bill would empower the
federal government to prohibit the shipping
of margarine from one province into another.
At the present time if an Ontario manufacturer, wholesaler or retailer sends margarine into Quebec, there is no law under
which he can be punished, for he is not

Hon. Mr. Lambert: -instead of being made
out of gelatin or custard pudding, as some of
it is made today? Instead of focusing all
their attention on oleomargarine and other
butter substitutes, let the producers create a
better standard for their own legitimate
products.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I am not an expert in
agriculture, but I point out to my honorable
friend that the federal legislation in this
respect was first applied to poultry, livestock
and livestock products, fruits, vegetables and
eggs; and every province has followed up that
legislation, using the same methods of grading
as the federal inspectors use. This procedure
could apply to the legislation which is now
before us. Let the federal government take
the lead in promoting wholesome products in
Canada, and every province will follow its
example. But the provinces cannot protect
themselves without proper federal legislation.
The dominion, by this bill, is attempting to
prevent violations of provincial laws. This
legislation is necessary for that purpose.
Let us consider potatoes. They cannot be
exported from one province to another,
unless they are of certain grades. Of course,
there .can be no interprovincial trade in
liquor. That law was passed by the Dominion
Government a long time ago. It is part of
the law of the land. The same principle has
been followed in respect of wheat. Not many
years ago the Senate adopted, in relation to
wheat, legislation which is similar in principle
to the bill now before us.
Hon. Mr. Euler: It was wrong then too.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I do not know whether
or not my honourable friend voted for it, but
it is certain that a majority of the Senate did
so.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: That legislation had equal
application to all the provinces.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It is not quite the same law.
An Hon. Senalor: It is not the same law,
because in one case we deal with wheat and
in another, I suppose, with ice cream. But
the same principle is there.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: For example, in the
Canadian Wheat Board Act, as amended by
chapter 15 of the Statutes of 1947, we read,
in section 2, subsection (4):
The Governor in Council may, by regulation,
designate substances produced by processing or
manufacturing wheat, either alone or together with
any other material or substance, as wheat products
for the purposes of this Act.

That provision is pretty similar to the one in
this bill for the purpose of conferring on the
Governor in Council authority to declare
what shall be substitutes for dairy products.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Where can there be found
a prohibition on sending wheat from Alberta
to British Columbia, if it is desired to do so?
Quote the section where that can be found.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I will try to find it.
Here is section 27 of the Act:
27. Except as permitted under the regulations, no
person other than the Board shall
(a) export from or import into Canada wheat or
wheat products owned by a person other than the
Board;
(b) transport or cause to be transported from one
province to another province, wheat owned by a
person other than the Board;
(c) sell or agree to sell wheat situated in one
province for delivery in another province or outside of Canada.

Therefore, although the Canadian Wheat
Board Act is different in some respects from
the legislation we are dealing with, the principle is much the same.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: That is because of the
international control of the sale of wheat,
is it not?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: It may be.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: That is the reason.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: If the government had
no right to deal with wheat, it has no right
to deal with dairy products; but if it has the
right to deal with wheat, it also has the right
to deal with dairy products.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Will the honourable
senator permit me one question? He has
spoken at some length, and repeatedly, about
the rights of the Province of Quebec to pass
any law that it thinks are in its interests.
Does the Province of Quebec wish to remain
a part of Canada, subject to the laws of
Canada, or does it put itself in the category of
an independent state?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I do not like that
remark of my honourable friend. We in
Quebec have been just as fraithful as the
people of any province to the cause of Canadian unity. We, as much as the people of
any province, have co-operated with the
Government of Canada and with the Government of the United Kingdom. We do not
wish to be separated from anyone. We wish
to co-operate with the rest of Canada. But
we say that if we do not want to have
margarine in our province, that is our business, and not the business of Ontario. And
I say that if other provinces want to send to
the Province of Quebec any books or other
matter contrary to the faith of the citizens of
that province, the reactions of the citizens of

JUNE 28, 1951
the Province of Quebec are their own business and not the business of anybody else.
I do not think my honourable friend is warranted in talking of separation because the
Province of Quebec thinks that the government of Canada should pass a law which
protects provincial interests in respect of
something on which it has the right to legislate. If Quebec were separated and became
an independent country, and thereby cut off
from the rest of Canada, it might be that the
other provinces would suffer. We do not
wish for separation any more than the Province of Ontario or any other part of Canada;
neither do we like to be told, every time we
claim what is our right, that we want to
separate from the rest of Canada. We have
no desire for separation, but we believe that
our rights should be respected, and that we
should be entitled to talk about them without
being accused of separatism.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: Is this a debate on the
dairy products of 'Canada, or on whether we
should have separation or not?
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: This arose from a
question by the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck).
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: My honourable friend
is quite right. But I do not think the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity wished to
say or do anything offensive to the Province
of Quebec. If he was looking for an
expression of opinion, I think I have given
it to him, and I think I have voiced therein
the views of the majority of the people of
Quebec.
If we do not want to be
antagonized, neither do we try to antagonize
anyone. But I think we should be able to
discuss a bill of this kind without being told
that the Province of Quebec, because it has
prohibited the sale of margarine within its
boundaries, does not want to co-operate with
the rest of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: My question did not
involve any charge against the Province of
Quebec. My question implied that it was
implicit in the argument of my honourable
friend. I did not accuse the Province of
Quebec of anything of the kind. It was my
friend's argument, not the Province of
Quebec, which I suggested was separationist.
Hon.« Mr. Dupuis: Honourable senators, I
wish to add my views on this subject.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I have not finished,
but I shall not be long.

whereby the federal government, as I have
stated, will have the right to protect any
valid legislation of any province of Canada
with respect to margarine, and not only

Quebec, but Prince Edward Island has such
legislation. So far as substitutes for dairy
products are concerned, there may be six or
seven provinces which will have legislation
similar to that of Quebec. We in Quebec
feel it is important that legislation shall be
passed to protect the valid legislation of any
Canadian province, and that nobody should
make this a matter of reproach or try to
obstruct the passage of legislation which is
necessary and valid. If there is anybody in
any province, whether Quebec, Ontario, or
elsewhere, who wants to export into another
province a product which that province has
prohibited by law, dominion legislation which
prevents such an operation is, in my opinion,
good and commendable; and that is my view
of the present bill.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask the honourable senator from Grandville (Hon. Mr.
Bouffard) if he will say that the purpose of
the bill is what he now implies it to be.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: From what I know
of it that is the purpose of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The bill does not say so.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: No. It is impossible
to set out everything in a bill. That is why

Hon. Ray Petten: Honourable senators, I
thought I had long ago lost my capacity for
being surprised, but I must confess that I
have been very much surprised in this chamber this afternoon. I came here having heard
by the grapevine, as most honourable senators have also been informed, that we were
in the closing hours of this session of parliament. In addition to being surprised I have
passed through the gamut of various emotions-amusement at my own efforts ta attract the attention of His Honour the Speaker,
alarm as the various speakers have pointed
out the pros and cons of this bill, and finally
determination to ask at least one question
if at all humanly possible. I have prepared a
lovely speech containing nothing to which
anybody could possibly object; but do not be

ponder over them.
Now, the question that confronts me is:
The honourable leader of the opposition
that he is opposed to What shall I, as a member of this judicial
(Hon. Mr. Haig) says
section 6 of the bill, but let me point out that body, do about the bill? I use the expression

JUNE 28, 1951
"this judicial body" advisedly, for ever since
I have had the honour of being a member of
this high tribunal I have been convinced that
it is my duty to judge objectively, irrespective of party allegiance, any legislation that
comes before us. One honourable member
made some reference to party politics. Well,
party politics have nothing to do with this
bill at all. With due respect for the opinion
of some honourable members, I believe that
this debate is not being influenced in any
way by party allegiance. My honourable
friend from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) knows that I admire him greatly, for
many reasons, and perhaps he will not mind
my saying that a few minutes ago, when he
made a slip about Quebec's separation, he
reminded me of a certain song that we sing
in French. It is about Marlbrough going to
war, and there is one line which goes this
way:
Trinity will pass before Marlbrough cornes back.

I might parody that Une by saying to my
friend:
Trinity will pass before Quebec is satisfied with
anything less than freedom and liberty.

I think it is well known to honourable
members that before I was summoned to this
honourable body I was a Liberal to the core,
and so I am sure no one will doubt my word
when I say that I do not owe allegiance to
the party now in power in Quebec, whose
political views are diametrically opposed to
my own. But in considering this bill, as in
considering al other measures that come
before us, I try to rise above questions of
party politics and to look at the matter from
the point of view of the national interest and
the maintenance of that liberty which we
enjoy under our political institutions-institions that we are now defending against the
tyranny of communism.
Are we members of this high tribunal going
to refuse to a province the liberty or freedom
to be governed according to its own choice?
Surely we are not going to take that stand,
even though some people may regard the
statute as capricious. I remember that one
day our good friend from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar), when speaking in defence of personal
freedom, said "I want to be free even to rmake
mistakes, if I so wish". It is for freedom of
that kind that we in this chamber should
fight unceasingly. If a province, no matter
what the party politics of its government may
be, decides that such and such a thing should
be prohibited within the provincial boundaries, why should any other province prevent
that decision from being carried out?
That is one point. Now I wish to say
further-

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Before my honourable
friend continues, will he allow me to interrupt him? He will admit, perhaps, that the
national interest must sometimes take precedence over local or even provincial interests?
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Quite right. I agree, and
I am glad that my honourable friend raised
that point. It gives me an opportunity to
say that what is involved here is not a question of general and national interest.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: I say it is a question of
conflicting views on the value of margarine.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: You say "No," but I say
"Yes". And, as someone once said, I have a
right to my own opinion, even if I "share" it
alone.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: I say it is not in the
national interest to allow a right of one province to be interfered with by other provinces.
I go further. I should not be surprised if one
were to find that the opposition to this
measure sprang from a mere handful of
people who are interested in the manufacture
and sale of margarine. And I ask: If that is
true, are we going to be led by an arrogant
minority?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I rise
on a point of order. I do not think that any
member should charge that any of us here
represents some special interest. I will not
sit down and take that. I represent no one
but the people of Manitoba and of Canada as
a whole. I have no interest in any company
that manufactures margarine; I do not own a
single share of stock in any such company. I
would ask the honourable member to withdraw that charge.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: My honourable friend, has
misunclerstood me. I do not say that we here
are influenced !by some interests behind the
scenes. My point is that some people outside
of parliament are hopeful that this bill will
not pass.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I think that perhaps I
should take offence at the suggestion that has
been made, since I have been very active in
opposing the ban on margarine.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: You have permission to
be offended.
Hon. Mr. Euler: My honourable friend has
suggested that opposition to the bill cornes
from a very srnall number of people.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: I said that I would not
be surprised if that were so.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Euler: The only possible way that
could be shown would be through a member
of this house. I am the mover of the resolution asking for the six months, hoist. I say
to the senator-although I do not think it is
necessary, knowing where the charge comes
from-that I have never in any way, directly
or incirectly, had a personal interest in the
manufacture of margarine. I have only had
in mind the good of this country.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: My honourable friend
takes this subject too seriously.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Not too seriously.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: That is not the charge
at all.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Then what is it?
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: You read my remarks
when they are printed, and you will know.
The Hon. the Speaker: I think the honourable senator from Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Dupuis)
should not press the point after the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler)
has made his statement. The senator from
Rigaud should not impute to the senator
from Waterloo any party or sectional interest.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: With all due respect to
Your Honour, I do not wish to imply any
motives to my colleague.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: The honourable senator
is not dealing with the bill at all.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: I am dealing with the
bill.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: I ask, Mr. Speaker, that
he be required at least to keep within the
shadow of this bill.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Honourable senators, I
am dealing with the bill. It has to do with
permitting one province to sell a product
within another province, and I believe that
I am quite in order. If I have not expressed
myself clearly enough, I will certainly do so.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: Well, you certainly do
not.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: I am ready to do anything to satisfy my honourable colleagues,
but as far as this legislation goes we have
to choose between two matters. First, shall
we refuse a province freedom to deai with
other provinces in certain products, in a
country where liberty and freedom are practised? On the other handHon. Mr. Roebuck: May I interrupt?
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Let me finish my second
point.
Hon. Mr. Euler: There is no point.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: On the other hand, is the
present legislation constitutional? Those are

the two points we must decide upon in considering this legislation. For my part, I
am in favour of the bill, even if it is brought
down on the last day of the session. We are
all -conversant with the measure which is
before us.
Some honourable senators have said that
its passage would create a precedent. As the
senator from Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard)
has said, the federal government controls the
sale of many other products the same way.
For all those reasonsHon. Mr. Euler: What reasons?
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: -I am in favour of the
passage of this bill. It may appear that I am
in favour of certain legislation passed by a
certain party in my province, but I believe
the province should be allowed to govern
itself as it sees fit.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Now perhapsr
my friend
will permit me to ask a question that is pertinent to a point made earlier in his speech.
I do not think for one moment that he wishes
to imply that I have any private interest in
the manufacture of oleomargarine. Has he
read subparagraph (i) of section 6, which
includes the words "milk, cream, butter,
cheese", and if he has, would he approve of
an order in council, at the solicitation of the
dairy interests in Ontario, prohibiting the
export of those products from the Province of
Quebec to Ontario?
Hon. Mr. Reid: That is a good question?
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Without offering a direct
answer to the question, I may say that I am in
favour of freedom of trade as between
provinces.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Moreover, any legislation
that cannot properly be passed by the federal
government would, according to section 121 of
the British North America Act, be ultra vires
on the grounds that it interfered with trade.
But in this case, I think that we should at least
allow the provinces to manage their own
affairs, and the federal government should
allow a margin of freedom for the interpretation of legislation by those provinces which
do not like oleomargarine.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The question has to do
with butter, milk and cheese.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: I see no reason for preventing any province from making its own
decisions as to whether certain products
should be allowed to be sold within its boundaries. On the question of interprovincital
trade, the province should be free to act
according to its wishes in any such matter. If
anyone in this country is of the opinion that

JUNE 28, 1951
provincial legislation is unconstitutional, he
has the right to submit it to the proper court
of justice.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I have a particular reason for intervening at
this stage of the debate, but before doing so
I should perhaps say a word about my personal position in the house.
When my honourable friend the leader of
the government did me the great honour some
months ago of asking me to act as deputy
leader-an honour which any man would be
glad to receive-I accepted with pleasure and
humility. I did, however, say to him that
in taking the position I did not wish in any
way to be restricted in my liberty to deal
with legislation as I saw fit. I made particular reference to the question of margarine,
and I reserved the right to be completely. free
in the attitude I would take regarding it. I
think the honourable leader will agree that
that is my position.
I should like to deal for a few moments
with section 6 of the bill, and to indicate the
effect it is going to have. That section reads:
The Governor in Council may by regulation
prohibit
(c) sending or conveyance from any province ta
any other province or from any province to one
or more designated provinces.
of any class of products that is designated by
the regulations as being
(i) milk-

and so ýforth, and it goes on to say that the
Governor in Council may, by a regulation
made under subsection one, designate any
class of products as substitutes for a dairy
product.
That, of course, is all very bright and general and, as has come out in this debate, it
deals with a great number of subjects in
addition to margarine though the debate has
largely centred, around that commodity. The
purpose for which this section was introduced
in the bill was most clearly stated, in a very
brief discussion in the other place, by the
Minister of Agriculture. He was asked about
the constitutionality of such a provision in
regard to the laws of the provinces. Under
the rules of the house I cannot, of course,
quote him directly, but I can say that he
made it perfectly clear that the federal government intended to act under section 6 only
in the case of a province which has adopted
legislation prohibiting the use of margarine
in that province. So we come down to this
admitted fact, that section 6 is designed for
the purpose of assisting two provinces which
have passed legislation prohibiting the sale
and use of margarine. I refer to Quebec
and Prince Edward Island.
Let me deal with the subject from a slightly
different angle than that from which it has

been dealt with by any other honourable
senator. Let me ask the house to deal with
this matter from a practical point of view.
As you know, the Government of Quebec
prohibits margarine; the Government of
Ontario permits it. The boundary between
those two provinces extends for many hundreds of miles, practically from the confluence
of the Ottawa river with the St. Lawrence,
up the Ottawa river, to the Hudson Bay; and
virtually the whole of the Quebec side of that
boundary happens to be in the senatorial
district of Inkerman, which I represent in
this chamber.
Hon. Mr. Lacasse: We never thought of
that!
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Let honourable senators be frank with themselves. What is the
position today in the city of Hull and in the
Gatineau Valley? As every honourable senator knows, thousands upon thousands of
people from that area come to Ottawa, do
their purchasing here, buy a pound or two
of margarine in the stores and take it to their
homes. It is true there ýis a prohibition of
the use of margarine in the province of Quebec, but it is not enforced, and it would be
impossible of enforcement. Now what are
we proposing to do by this section 6? We are
asked to enact legislation whereby anybody
who imports-say by car, from Ottawa-a
pound of margarine into the Province of
Quebec is to be subject, first, to an investigation by inspectors, second, to confiscation
of the margarine in his home if it is found
there, third, to a fine of $500, or imprisonment
for six months, or both. That is the prospect
which a resident of Hull or of the Gatineau
Valley will face if section 6 of this legislation
goes through.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Why do they not obey
the law?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Here is another aspect
of the proposed legislation. In eight of the
ten provinces of Canada the production, sale
and consumption of margarine are completely
legal. What by this legislation we are asked
to do is to make illegal in two provinces what
is perfectly legal in the other eight. The
resident of Carleton or Russell county can
come to Ottawa, buy margarine, go home
perfectly happy with his purchase, and consume it. But the man who happens to live
across the river, in Hull or Gatineau county,
is liable to have his house broken into, his
margarine seized, and himself fined and imprisoned. That will be the practical result
of this legislation.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: May I interject a reminder to my honourable friend that during
prohibition days the same sort of thing
occurred. A man could be arrested on the
Hull bridge for carrying liquor in Ontario.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: The same is true today.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I am not prepared to
admit that there is any parallel between
dealing in margarine and dealing in liquor.
As the honourable senator from De Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Vien) pointed out a few minutes
ago, the two operations are subject to completely different rules of interpretation.
Theoretically, that is the situation in whicll
my constituents, the inhabitants of Hull and
Gatineau Valley, will find themselves. Theoretically they will be exposed to these penalties. I say "theoretically" because I do not
think that in practice very much of that will
happen. What will happen will be this: you
will pass this law and your law will be
ignored and flouted by the population.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The position will be
the same as that in which this country to
some extent, and more particularly the
United States, found themselves in the days
of prohibition when they attempted to enforce
a law which was repugnant to great numbers
of people.
Hon. Mr. Lacasse: Also the O.T.A., in
Ontario.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I do not need to tell
my honourable friends what were the results
in the United States in that period, when it
was the proper thing, the right thing, and
the smart thing, to violate and evade the
law. An outbreak of gangsterism and crime
occurred which has continued from that day
to this.
As the honourable senator from Ponteix
(Hon. Mr. Marcotte) said this morning in
relation to another bill, this is net a matter
of money. Nor is it a matter of moimls. It
is something that affects the ordinary everyday life of thousands and thousands of our
decent, honest Canadian fellow citizens, hardworking, law-abiding men and women who
live within a few minutes' journey from this
chamber. By this legislation you are going
to turn them into law-breakers. I think that
thought should make the Senate pause
before it agrees to section 6.
With regard to the practical position, I do
not know that I can support my honourable
friend from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) in
opposing the second reading of the bill. I
would certainly not vote for it, but I would
be willing to let the bill pass on division, on
the assumption that when it goes to committee section 6 will be struck out.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lacasse: When would the bill be
reported back?

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: To my honourable
friends who have criticized sections 3, 4 and
5, I would point out that these clauses are
no more than re-enactments of existing
statutory provisions. They do not deal
primarily with prohibition of interprovincial
trade; they relate in the main to the prescribing and enforcement of standards. I do not
particularly object to them. But, for the
reasons I have given, I do most seriously
and strongly object to section 6. I cannot
believe that the other place, during the few
minutes which it gave to this bill, or even
members of the government, when they
were considering it in the rush and hurry of
the last days of the session, can have realized
that practical results-what will happen if
this section should pass into law.
Hon. Mr. Horner: What is left if section 6
is deleted?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: All the provisions with
regard to grading, marketing, and the rest,
that are now in the Dairy Industry Act.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Reid the debate was
adjourned.
DOMINION ELECTIONS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. A. L. Beaubien moved the second
reading of Bill 404, an Act to amend the
Dominion Elections Act, 1938.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
short bill and does not require a lengthy
explanation.
The first section makes a change in the
ballot. The Chief Electoral Officer told me
today that by folding the bill as I am now
doing, and by putting the number on the
counterfoil, an impression invariably is left
on the face of the ballot. He said that as a
result of this procedure over 400 ballots were
thrown out at a recent election, although this
did not affect the results of the election.
Under the amendment each elector shall
receive from the deputy returning officer a
ballot paper. On the back of this ballot paper
the deputy returning officer will have placed
his initials so that when the ballot ipaper is
folded they will be seen without unfolding
the ballot paper.
Section 2 of the bill has to do with elections
in the Northwest Territories. It will be
remembered that earlier in the session we
passed a bill having to do with the members
to the Council of the Northwest Territories.
Five of these members are to be appointed by
the federal government and three are to be
elected. The bill before us provides that the
Chief Electoral Officer shall conduct the elections of the members to the Council of the

JUNE 28, 1951
Northwest Terrîtories on the same basis as
lie conduets the elections in Canada as a
w.hole.
I[onourable senators, as. I say, this is a
a1i rt bill, and I do not think it requires
further explanation. It passed the House of
Commons unanimously, and as the memýbers
of that 'body are the elected representatives of
the country, they are really more dîrectly
concerned, with this bill than are we, the
memibers of the Senate.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING POSTPONED

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable seniators,
when shall the bull be read the thýird time?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: 1 moive the third reading o! the bill now.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable ýsenaýtors, I have
been f amiliar with the contents of this bill for
four or five days now, not that I arn in the
confidence of the governmrent, but 'because I
attended a conference at which the question
of the general amendments to the Dominion
Elections Act came up. Iit was the opinion of
those attending that conference that these
sections affecting the Northwest Terrîtories
should be in the Act. I know that the bill was
unanim.ously passed in the other place.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honouirable senators,
the question is on the motion of the Honourable Senator Beaubien for the third reading
of this bill.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable -seniators,
this bill was placed in my hands less than
five minutes ago. I have neyer seen it before
and have not had an opportunity to read it,
yet I am being asked te consent to third rea&
ing. If that is not railroading legislation, I
do not know what is. Why not let the third
reading stand until tomorrow?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: I .shall withdraw my
motion.
Han. Mr. Roebuck: Yes.
The motion wa-s withdrawn.
JUDGES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. L. M. Goumn moved the second: reading
of Bull 405, an Act to amend the Judges Act,
1946.
He said: Honourable senators, the object of
this bill is threefold. It increases the judge§'
;salaries 20 per cent, except those of the
Supreme Court of Canada; increases the
number o! judges for the Hîgh Court of
Ontario and for the Superior Court of Québec,
and it has the effect of gîving pensions to
widows of juciges.

According to section 1 of the bill, judges
of the Exechequer Court will receive an increase of 20 per cent in their salaries. Section
2 increases the number of High Court
judges in Ontario from, sixteen to eighteen,
and the Ontario Legisiature is amending the
Ontario Judicature Act to provide for this
increase.
Section 3 of the bull increases the number
of judges of the Superior Court of Quebec by
three. In 1948 Quebec amended its legislatio«, authorizing the Lieutenant Governior in
Council to establish Up to six more positions.
A corresponding amendment was macle to the
Judges Act, authorizing salaries for such additional number of judges, not exceedinýg six,
as the Governor in Council might declare.
Pursuant to this authorîty four more offices
were estaiblished., three for Montreal and one
for Quebec City.
Two additional judges were to be appointed
after proclamation of the Lieutenant Governor
in Counceil, but this has not yet been done. I
mean that these seats on the Bench have in a
sense to be created by the province 0f Quebec.
The organization of the courts is of course a
provincial matter, but judges are appointed,
by the Governor General in Council, andl their
salaries are paid out of moneys voted by
parliament.
At its latesit session, in 1951, the Quebec
legisiature modified the provisions of its
Courts of Justice Act and authorized the
Lieutenant Governor in ýCouncil to provide for
the appointment of a total of f orty-six judges
for our Superior Courts. The amending Act
adopted in 1948, whîch I mentioned a few
minutes ago, was repealed., and therefore we
apparently provide for five additional judges;
but actually only three new judges will be
appointed in addition to the two whose
appointments had already been provided for
in 1948 but have not yet been made.
It is ýcontempiated that the five new judges
will be appointed to the following districts:
Montreal, 1; Abitibi, Rouyn-Noranda and Terniskaming, 1; St. Francis and Bedford, 1; Hull,
Labelle and Pontiac, 2.

Appointmnent of the extra judge in Montreal
will give us atotal of twenty-six members of
our Superior Court there. It is generally
known that the arrears of cases on the roll of
the Superior Court in Montreal ýcreate a very
serious prôblem; in fact, it takes almost two
years froin the time an action is begun in that
court until it gets down to trial. As a lawyer
I consider it is absolutely in the interest of
justice to have a larger number of judges in
the Province of Quebec.
The salaries of judges in Ontario and
Quebec are increased by 20,per cent. Section 3

SENATE
of the bill increases by the same percentage
the salaries of all Superior and County Court
judges in the eight other provinces.
I come now to sections 4, 5 and 6, which
simplify the procedure to be followed on the
granting of a pension or annuity to a judge.
Up to the present time it has been necessary
not only to pass an order in council but to
issue letters patent under the Great Seal, and
it is felt that an order in council alone should
be sufficient for the purpose.
Section 5 amends section 24 of the Act,
which deals with annuities for judges of
county courts. They were formerly covered
by section 25 of the Act, and had they
remained under that section they would not
have benefited from the increase in pensions
consequential upon the increase in salary. A
county court judge who is compulsorily
retired or has continued in office for at least
thirty years may be granted an annuity of
three-fourths of his salary of $6,666.66, or a
total of $5,000. If the salaries are increased to
$8,000, as proposed, the ordinary annuity of
two-thirds of salary will be $5,333.33.
The purpose of section 6, which arnends
section 25 of the Act, is simply consequential
upon the amendment to section 24, which I
have just mentioned.
I come now to the last section of the bill,
which provides for annuities to widows of
judges or, in certain cases to wives of judges.
Since August 15, 1944, a judge has been permitted to make an election under which he
will receive two-thirds of his pension and
his wife will receive one-third of it. Should
the wife predecease him, the judge will continue to receive only two-thirds of his pension. The amendment adopted in 1944 did
not apply to widows of judges who had died
before that date and some of those widows
are today in unfortunate circumstances. I am
sure that my colleagues who are members
of the Quebec Bar know, as I do, of some
pitiful cases.

Subsection 2 of the new section 26A provides for the widows of judges who retired
on pension before August 15, 1944, and who
have since died. These widows also will
receive an annuity of two-ninths of the
salary provided for a county court judge.
Subsection 3 would authorize a judge who
retired on pension before the date in question, and who is still living, to elect to divide
his pension between himself and his wife.
This election was provided for only on
August 15, 1944; and there are a number of
judges who had retired before that date to
which it was not made retroactive. I submit
that it is only fair that they be given this
privilege, otherwise, when they die their
widows will be left with nothing. Provision
is also made for the irrevocability of the
election; in other words, a judge's decision
to divide his pension is final. Provision is
made that when the widow of a judge
remarries she will lose her right to the
pension.
I am sure that all members of this house
are fully aware of the necessity for providing
adequate remuneration for our judges. Many
of them make a sacrifice when they abandon
private practice, even with the additional
remuneration which this bill would provide.
We in this bouse have the greatest respect
for the members of the judiciary. They represent a very noble tradition in this country,
and we desire to make sure that their standard
of living shall be adequate and dignified. We
would also wish to assure them that in their
retirement, after years of dispensing justice,
they will be given a decent pension. Finally,
we want to make adequate provision for their
widows.
If any member of the houses desires that
the bill be referred to a committee, I shall
be glad to so move. Personally, I feel that
little can be added to the explanation which
I have just given.

DOMINION ELECTIONS BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved the third reading of Bill 404, an Act ta amend the
Dominion Elections Act, 1938.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
CRIMINAL CODE BILL
THIRD READING

Han. Wishart McL. Robertson moved third
reading of Bill 391, an Act to amend the
Criminal Code, as amended.
Hon. A. W. Raebuck: Honourable senators,
I have already protested against the lateness
of the hour at which this most important bill
has been brought before the house, and I
have indicated my view that it býas flot
received adequate consideration. It is also
my view that the matters contained in the
measure are flot of such urgency that it
need be rushed througb without f ull consideration by the house and without time
being given to receive some indication of the
reaction of the public. However, I presume
that it is futile for me to addresýs sentiments
of this kind to the bouse, for no doubt the
bill will pass.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: How do you know?
Hon. Mr. Raebuck: Willy-nilly, it will go
through. But eacb one of us has a duty to
the public and to himself, and for my part,
1 feel that it is my duty to make some comment on the important matters involved in
this bill. I say positively that I do not join
in ahi the criticism of the measp~re that bas
been expressed, because some of it springs
from. misinformation; but tbe fact that criti-

cism exists strengtbens my contention that
the measure should not have been brought
before this bouse in the dying days of the
session. This legislation affects the right,
freedom. and security of the citizen; it
involves British justice and liberty, and that
sort of tbing, and sbould not be rushed
tbrough. The public should know what we
are doing, and have confidence in it. From,
my touch with the public, I arn satisfied that,
because of the manner in which this measure
bas been brought in, everyone bas not such
confidence.
I shail ask the 'bouse to bear w1th me whîle
I comment on some of tbe clauses of the bill.
To begin witb, section 2, at page 4, reads:
EverY one who aids, assists. harbours or conceals
a person who he knows is a deserter or an absentee
without leave from the Canadian forces is guilty
of an offence and liable on summary conviction to,
a fine flot exceeding ive hundred dollars..

By way 0f marked contrast to the lack of
consideration wbicb the bill is receiving, the
national defence bill of hast session was discussed fully wben it was before tbe bouse.
That measure, which contains wbat is reahly
the Criminal Co-de for the armed forces, was
studied for days, and every section was
thorougbhy considered. Indeed, if I remember
correctly, we brought in no less than 82
amendments. At that time I expressed the
view, and I repeat it now, that a quarrel
between the army and a deserter or absentee
witbout leave sbould be kept within the
army. It is an înter-army matter, and it is
unfortunate, unnecessary and inadvisable to
bring the public into the picture as tbis bill
does, and make guilty the father, mother,
brother, sister or friend, if comnfort or
assistance h"- been given to a member of the
forces who is absent without leave. What I
said on the previous occasion did get a little
way into the minds of tbe members of the
otber bouse, because tbe section was amended
and very much softened by providing that
no sucb proceeding shall be instituted under
tbe section I bave referred to witbout the
consent of the Attorney-General of Canada,
a change wbicb împroved the section tremendously, because one can rely upon the
Attorney-General not to use that section
under the circumstances that I bave indicated.
I tbink, therefore, that my principhe stands
that a quarrel between an officer and a man
who is away without leave, or deserting, if
you like to caîl it that, should be confined
to the army, and not slop over into civil 11f e.
My next comment is with regard to clause
6 of the bilh, which sets forth what will be
section 84 of the Code. I protest against the
making of tbe Royal Canadian Mounted Police
a sacrosanct force. The members of that
force are just policemen. The excuse given

SENATE
for these provisions, which I will read in a
moment, is that they have to do with security,
and that therefore the force is in some way
on a military basis. But the actual fact is
that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police now
does the local police work for all but two
of the provinces of Canada.
The proposed section 84 provides that every
one who
(b) aids, assists, harbours or conceals a member
of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police whom he
knows to be a deserter or absent without leave; or
(c) aids or assists a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to desert or absent himself
without leave, knowing that the member is about
ta desert or absent himself without leave,
is guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars
or to imprisonment for six months or to both fine
and imprisonment.

Now, can you imagine the outcry that
would go forth in Canada iflwe were to
apply this provision to the ordinary police
forces of our Dominion? Yet you obligate a
member of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police to stay on his job for, five, seven, or
ten years, whatever the enlistment period
may be, irrespective of the treatment which
is accorded him while he is there, and put in
jail anybody who assists him if he deserts.
It is wrong. The Royal Canadian Mounted
Police are a civilian force, and should remain
such. We want no SS. Guard in Canada.
There is no need to treat these men as
though they were a Praetorian Guard to
protect the lives of tyrants. They do nothing
of the kind. They enforce the civil law of
our country in, I understand, a quiet, efficient and very satisfactory way in those
provinces where they have been given control, and there is no need to make them a
military force, governed by military law and
subject to military domination.
Just a comment or two on the proposed
section 120 of the Code, which is contained
in clause 7 of the bill. This is an attempt
to prevent injuries and accidents resulting
from the handling by young people of airguns, firearms, air-pistols and the like. In
my judgment the amount of damage done in
this way is out of proportion to the value of
these instruments involved. I welcome the
new provision which restricts the sale of
these instruments to young people; but it is
confined to those under the age of fourteen
and does not go far enough. According to our
laws with respect to many things, the age of
maturity is sixteen years, and I think that
the age in this provision should be sixteen
years rather than fourteen. A large part of
the damage that is done by young people
with these instruments is done by those
from, say, fourteen to eighteen. That is the
age group which does the most damage.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That is right.

Hon. Mr. Golding: And less than fourteen
too.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, I include the ones
under fourteen; but most of the damage is
done by those between the age of fourteen
and the voting age of twenty-one. I should
have liked to see this provision made to fit the
usual age for young persons, the age for
instance at which they are callable in the
juvenile courts, namely, sixteen. The age of
consent is sixteen.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The members of these young
gangs are usually between sixteen and
eighteen.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Golding: Not all of them.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Not all of them, but
those who are under fourteen are usually led
and tutored by those who are between sixteen and eighteen. That is a minor point, but
it illustrates my original statement that this
legislation has not been given the consideration that is due to it.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Have any reasons been
given why the age should not be eighteen
instead of fourteen?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No, not that I know
of. I have heard of none.
Hon. Mr. Vien:
Would the honourable
senator be willing to move that this change
be made?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I am tired of doing
that kind of thing simply to have it voted
down in this house; but I shall support my
honourable friend from De Lorimier (Hon.
Mr. Vien) if he desires to move such an
amendment.

Section 7 of the bill has to do with the
possession of weapons, and I should like to
read subsection (3) of the new section 122.
It says:
Every one who is an occupant of a motor vehicle
in which he knows there is a firearm is guilty of
an offence unless some occupant of the motor
vehicle has a valid permit in Form 76 or Form 76B
relating to that firearm.

Now, then, honourable senators, just
imagine climbing into a motor bus and finding that somebody in that vehicle has a
pistol in his hip pocket. Under this provision every one in the bus will be guilty of
That is not what is really
an offence.
intended, but that seems to me to be the
effect of this provision. I am all for guarding against injury and damage by the illicit
use of firearms. I am as afraid of a gun
as anybody. I can remember as a boy being
taught that it was a sin to point a firearm,
loaded or unloaded, at anybody.

JUNE 29. :1951
We need more care and restrictions in the
use of firearms. As we all know, the use of
firearms by people engaged in crimes of
violence has reached terrible proportions. We
can hardly go too far in providing penalties
for such cases. But the section we havehere
is foolish. If a person is in a motor car with
.another person who has a concealed weapon-,
or even a weapon that is not concealed, is he
to ask him whether he has a permit in Form
76, and if not to get out of the vehicle? The
idea no doubt is to catch groups on marauding
expeditions, in which only one of the group
has a gun but all intend to use it. This
section does not cover that kind of case only.
This covers the odd case when someone in a
vehicle has a firearm and no permit, in which
event all the persons in the vehicle at the time
are guilty. And the penalty on summary conViction is a fine not exceeding $500 or imprisonment for six months or both fine and
imprisonment. I simply suggest that the
section has been ill thought-out.
I am in hearty accord with a good many
other sections dealing with possession of
firearms.
Next I call attention of honourable members to the proposed new section 128, on page
8 of the bill. Paragraph (a) of subsection 2
of this section exempts any person engaged
in the business of repairing firearms from the
necessity of having a permit to possess firearms. Now, I do not know any more questionable business in Canada than that of repairing
firearms. It does seem to me that any man
who repairs firearms might very well be
required to ask a person who brings a firearms to his place to be repaired whether he
holds it under permit or intends to use it for
the purpose of marauding on the streets of
our cities, holding up banks and so forth.
When I was mentioning a previous section
dealing with the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police I should perhaps have mentioned also
the proposed new section 132A, on page 9 of
the bill. Just listen to this.
Everyone is guilty of an indictable offence and
liable to imprisonment for five years who wilfully
(a) interferes with, impairs or influences the
loyalty or discipline of;
(b) publishes, edits, issues, circulates or distributes any writing that advises, counsels or urges
insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny or refusai of
duty by; or
(c) advises, counsels, urges or in any manner
causes insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny or refusai
of duty by
a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,
the Canadian forces or the naval, army or air forces
of a State other than Canada that are lawfully
present in Canada.

This section groups the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police, a civilian police force, with
our military forces and the naval, army or
air forces of another country that are law-

fully present in Canada, and it places a
restriction on the freedom of our people to
-counsel, advise, urge, or in any manner
encourage, the insubordination of any member
of this police force.
Well, honourable
senators, are we living in this fine, free
Canada of ours, or in Germany, where the
ordinary citizen has to be careful about what
he says to a policeman lest he encourage
him to be insubordinate to his officers? This
section would have been a perfectly good one
for Mr. Hitler to have promulgated when he
was building up the reputation and power of
his S.S. force, but it is utterly out of keeping
with this fine civilian nation of ours, where
everybody is free to speak his mind and to
act as he thinks he should, so long as he
does not commit any immoral or other act
prohibited by the Criminal Code.
We
should treat our police force, particularly
one that is policing the provinces, in the
ordinary way, just as we do the "flat-foot
cops" on our city streets. I use that expression in a joking way, for I have the highest
respect for the ordinary policeman. He is
a very intelligent citizen, a skilled artisan
pursuing his occupation efficiently, and
usually in a very kindly and good-natured
way. We have no finer class of citizens than
the policeman of our municipalities, including, if I may say so, the police of my own
city of Toronto. We should keep the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police a civilian force,
and not hedge its members around with
restrictions of the kind proposed here, and
thereby try to make them look upon themselves as sacrosanct.
Now I wish to refer for a moment to the
new subsection (4a) of section 285 of the Act,
on page 10 of the bill. This is the subsection
that provides a penalty for driving while
the ability to drive is impaired. Now, there
is nobody in the world who condemns more
strongly than I the driving of a motor car
by an intoxicated person. I remember one
terrible New Year's Eve that we had in
Toronto, when several deaths-I forget just
how many-were caused by accidents involving drunken motorists.
I was Attorney
General of the province at the time, and on
the day before the next New Year's Eve I
published a statement recalling the tragedies
of the previous year, and asking the good
citizens of Toronto, the reputable business
and professional men and others to refrain
from drinking or at least from driving after
they had drunk. Well, on New Year's Eve
I was in a club, and the bottle was passed
around. I was invited to join in the celebrating, but I expressed my views in no
uncertain way.
However, the gentlemen
present said: "That's right Roebuck" and

SENATE
kept passing the drinks around. I asked
myself "What is the use of appealing to
people to be careful?"
Nobody is more opposed to drunken driving
than I am. Yet, honourable senators, listen
to this subsection (4a):
Everyone who, while his ability to drive a motor
vehicle or automobile is impaired by alcohol or any
drug, drives any motor vehicle or automobile, or bas
the care or control of a motor vehicle or automobile,
whether it is in motion or not, is guilty of an
offence . . .

What is meant by the "care or control of
a motor vehicle"? In the courts in the
immediate past there have been cases where
motorists when driving have felt that the
liquor they have taken has made them incapable of exercising proper control, and so have
pulled over to the side of the road, got out
of the front seat and into the back seat,
and been found there by the police. The
courts have found such motorists guilty of
being drunk while in control or care of a
motor vehicle, and have sent them to jail.
When we were considering this bill in committee the leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig), who is not present this morning,
told me that recently the Manitoba Court of
Appeal had refused to support a conviction
in circumstances of that kind.
This measure would put the matter of
having the care of an automobile on a par
with the driving of an automobile. What does
the care of an automobile involve? Must a
garage operator who has a car under his
control and in his care be liable to go to jail
if his abilities are impaired? That is surely
not what is intended; but that is what is
said; and in legislation it is not what is
intended by drafters that counts, but what
they say. The provisions of this bill would
apply whether the car was in motion or not,
just so long as it was within an accused
person's care and control. The section is
most unfortunately phrased.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: But such a person must
be under the influence of liquor or a drug.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: When his driving ability
is impaired by liquor or drug, and he has
the care of a motor car. It seems to me the
ends of justice would have been met if the
rule had been made to apply to a person
driving a car. The court of appeal in the
Province of Manitoba recently refused to
support a conviction under conditions such
as -this bill provides.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Would my honourable
friend not agree that a large percentage of
the accidents are caused not by drivers who
are intoxicated but by those whose facilities
are impaired through the use of liquor or a
drug?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes.

Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Then why not put
something in the Act that will prevent such
people from driving?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I welcome the provisions of this measure which extend the
present drunken driving provisions to those
whose ability to drive has been impaired.
That is good; I like it. There may be some
difficulty in its administration, but in due
season the courts will take care of that, and
I look for the success of this legislation in
that respect. But that is quite apart from
the provision that a man who is sitting in
the back seat of an automobile, and has no
intention of driving it, may be sent to jail.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: But he is liable to
start it and drive it at any time.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, but we are not
going to put in jail a whole crowd of people
whose ability to drive has been impaired by
too free imbibing; the provision should apply
only to those who are driving or operating
a motor car.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I ask my honourable friend if the Criminal Code contains
any provision governing practice driving on
the streets, as conducted by certain driving
agencies? An unfortunate accident occurred
in this city the other evening, when a boy
of fifteen was being taught to drive.
Hon. Mr. Duffus: That was by his father.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: True; but there are
driving agencies that teach people to drive.
I notice cars frequently with the name of
some driving school on the back. Persons
who are being taught to drive are attempting
to observe all the courtesies of driving, but
they are liable to become confused and, for
instance, apply the accelerator instead of the
brake. If the Criminal Code is going to put
so much emphasis on intoxication, it should
not overlook other matters which involve the
public safety. To my mind these practicedriving cars are a menace to other drivers
and to pedestrians.
Hon. Mr. King: Order!
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: We must be most careful not to discuss the accident which recently
took place in this city, for charges have been
laid against the parties. There is, however,
provision in the Code against careless driving
and the provinces legislate on the matter of
granting licences, and so on. Undoubtedly
these driving agencies, as my friend calls
them, are licensed to teach people to drive.
In Ontario a special temporary licence is
given to enable the uninitiated to learn to
drive.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: But the area in which
such practice driving shall take place is not
set out.

JUNE 29. 1951
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No, it is not. Perhaps
the municipalities might provide for that. I
should not like to live in the area that was
selected.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The racetrack is the
place to do it.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That may be so; but
after all, the learning-to-drive period is something that lasts more than a few days. One
could be told in five minutes how to drive,
but experience and practice take many
months.
I should like, gentlemen, to make reference
to section 14 of the bill. This is new law, and
therefore should be very carefully drawn.
Clause (4d) of subsection 2 of section 14 has
to do with the introduction into evidence of
the results of a certain analysis. That subsection reads as follows:
In any proceedings under subsection four or four
(a) the result of a chemical analysis of a sample of
the blood, urine, breath or other bodily substance of
a person may be admitted In evidence on the issue
whether that person was intoxicated or under the
influence of a narcotie drug or whether his ability
to drive was impaired by alcohol or a drug-

The words to which I draw attention are
these:
notwithstanding that he was not, before he gave the
sample, warned that he need not give the sample
or that the results of the analysis of the sample
might be used in evidence.

The technique of analysis of blood samples
and other substances is now past the experimental stage; it is approved by judges and
not infrequently accepted by juries. But in
legalizing the use of evidence derived in
this way, I think exemption should be
afforded both to the person who refuses to
submit to the test-and this we have doneand to the one who, being in a muddled condition, does not object. If we are going to
allow a person who bas the intelligence to do
so to withhold his consent, we ought to
see to it that the person who is taken into
custody in a condition in which he is unable
to defend himself should have similar protection. But this amendment permits the police
to get such a man in their -custody, to take
a sample without the presence of his medical
adviser or his lawyer, and then, whether he
bas been warned or not, to use that sample
and the analysis in evidence against him.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Is not that done for
the protection of the man himself?
Hon. Mr. Howard: Why, certainly.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I said, it could be used
without his consent. I grant you that it
may be used by way of protection as well
as for prosecution; but because it can be
used in Case A for protection is no reason
why it should be used in the opposite way

in case B. We have gone just a little too far.
Hoonurable senators will realize, of course,
that for many years I have been a defence
counsel. Many a time I have seen a prisoner
in the box, and I have been impressed with
his position, with everything against himwith a steam-roller, so to speak, about to
go over him-and I am jealous for his protection in every British right. Not that the
criminal should enjoy exemption from the
law; I am anxious that he should be brought
to justice.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: May I ask my honourable friend whether he could not make as
good a speech if he had been a prosecuting
instead of a defending attorney?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Well, it is very seldom
that I have prosecuted. I have not had
very much practice that way. My thoughts
and impulses have more often been directed
to the defence.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: But you prosecuted
when you were Attorney-General.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Well, during that time
I directed many prosecutions. I did not
personally prosecute a single case, but for
three years I was head of the prosecution
force of my province. But I guided it. I
saw to it, too, that the prosecutors were
polite, that they did not bulldoze anybody:
I stopped the unseemly joking that went on
in our police courts: yes, and I made the
magistrates wear proper clothes and maintain decorum in their courts. There were a
good many other reforms which I could
mention that were made during the comparatively short time I was in control. As
far as I know I never invaded the rights of
any individual. I have protected the man
who was being attacked as zealously as I
have enforced the duties of the prosecution.
In this amendment we have -gone too far.
We should provide that evidence obtained
under this provision .cannot be used without
the consent of the accused person, and that
if he consents to a test he must be in a condition to intelligently give consent. That
would be a reasonable safeguard to surround the use of this new evidence in our
courts.
A word or two about the post office sections.
I do not know why it is that people in control
of departments want to acquire arbitrary
power, or powers which may be used
oppressively, or-to repeat an expression I
have already used-to make their operations
sacrosanct. On page 12, in section 16 we
find:
364. Every one is guilty of an indictable offence

wives and their children have been present,
and all the circumstances have been disclosed, that the common sense of twelve good
men and true has caused them to refuse to
carry out the parliamentary dictates. That
will be the case in this very instance. I sat
in court many times as a young man. I
remember one judge who was very generous
indeed in handing out five, seven and ten
year sentences, and I saw juries draw back
and refused to put prisoners in his hands, and
bring in acquittals when they were unjustified on any other ground than the attitude
of the judge. I have seen excessive sentences
in a court moderated by the reluctance of
juries to convict as charged. That is one of
the wonderful attributes of juries.
Here we are asked to do the very same
thing that other parliaments have done; not
to the excessive degree that one can find in
history, but along the same line of withdrawing from the judge the right to exercise the
milk of human kindness. It is taking away
consideration and common sense, and providing that technically when a man is guilty
he must be sent to jail for six months. Am
I not right when I say that this bill has not
been given the consideration it deserves?
Can anyone say that it bas undergone the
public discussion that should be given to all
important measures? It is absolutely wrong
to bring this kind of legislation to us in the
dying days of a session.
I refer now to page 15 of the bill, and I
read the following under the heading of
"Acts Prejudicial to Security".

I am quite willing to admit that special
care must be used in protecting the mails
against theft. But to do so it is not necessary to "go off the deep end" and talk about
sending people to prison for life for a theft
of this kind, which would be trifling were it
not theft from the mails.
There is another provision to which I
object even more than to the penalty provision, I object, because no common-sense judge
would go so far as to sentence an offender
for life. Hitherto it has been the rule to
allow magistrates and judges to use discretion in punishing thefts from the post.
Similar discretion is permitted them in cases
of theft from private individuals.
Many
circumstances are connected with every
transaction, legal or otherwise, and often a
person is charged and convicted of theft
from the post when the transaction was
trivial, was not regarded as serious at the
time by the individual himself, or there
were other extenuating circumstances over
which the imagination might run riot. So
time and time again judges who have had a
prisoner before them have felt that the
offender should not be sent to jail because,
though his hand or his foot may have slipped
on the particular occasion, he was not a
criminal. But I am told in the Department

Hon. Mr. Beaubien: I did not expect the
honourable member to agree with me.
Hon. Mr. Reid: You knew I would not,
from long experience.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I have no apology to make.
I am very glad that I have disagreed with
you.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: I am glad too.
Hon. Mr. Reid: My conscience is clear on
that. Now, if you want a general debate,
I will begin one.
Hon. Mr. Howard: You are not in the House
of Commons now.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The "family compact" in
the Senate does not bother me at all. I have
a duty to perform and I am going to perform
it. After all, I can speak about this bill as
a farmer, and not many who have discussed
it can say that. I mean, I can speak as a
farmer from British Columbia, not from
Quebec.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: What difference is
there?
Hon. Mr. Reid: There appears to be quite
a bit of difference.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Other farmers here
may not agree with you.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I do not think the
senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) knows very much about the farmers of
Quebec. He ought to come down to that
province some time.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I have been down there. I
think I can show wherein this measure would
react to the disadvantage of the farmers of
Quebec.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I do not think you gave
the bill a "second look".
Hon. Mr. Reid: I certainly did, and a third
look.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I suggest that the
honourable senator be allowed to continue
his speech.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I will take on anybody, one
at a time, but I do not want half a dozen
jumping on me all at once. However, if
anybody wishes to inject heat into this matter,
I will take him on.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Go ahead and make
your speech.
Hon Mr. Reid: I will make my speech. You
keep quiet too.
I say to honourable senators that it would
be of no avail to send this bill to committee.
My reason for saying that is that what we are

concerned about is the principle underlying
the bill, not the details. Can we get any
enlightenment on the principle frorn departmental officials?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The only person who could
discuss the principle with us is the Minister
of Agriculture or some other member of the
cabinet. We do not care whether inspectors
or other officials say this or that about how
the bill would work; the thing that we are
concerned about is the principle of granting
to the federal government power to prohibit
the shipment between one province and
another of not only butter substitutes, but
butter itself and milk and ice cream and
sherbet. That is the power that will be given
to the government if this bill goes through,
as I have no doubt it will, for I see the forces
marshalled here.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: I resent that remark,
Mr. Speaker. There is no marshalling of
anybody here. I suggest that the honourable
gentleman should be confined to an expression of his views on the bill, and not be
allowed to imply that someone else is acting
improperly.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I will let the remark stand.
The Hon. the Speaker: If a ruling is
required, I would point out that the remark
was not addressed to any honourable member in particular.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That is right, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you.
If the bill is sent to committee the Minister
of Agriculture will not be present to discuss
with us the subject in which we are interested. The Department of Agriculture will
be represented by officials only, and from
them we cannot get any answer on that
question at all.
The Honourable the Chief Government
Whip (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) said, I think, that
the low price of butter was caused by something or other having to do with margarine
and other butter substitutes.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: No; by low production.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Well, I have travelled
through a great deal of Ontario, as well as
through my own province of British Columbia,
and I have taken occasion to talk to farmers,
so I can speak from personal contacts that
I have made in two provinces. Here is what
I have found. Because of the scarcity of
farm labour and the high wages that have
to be paid to the men available, plus the
high cost of cattle feed in some quarters
of the country, large numbers of dairymen
have been selling their herds for big prices,

JUNE 29, 1951
principally to American buyers, who In their
attempts to meet the unprecedented demands
for beef in the United States have been paying as much as $350 for a heavy grade cow.
It has been pointed out to me that, if this
dangerous trend continues much further in
my own province, we shall have to import
milk from some other province or from
across the line.
The honourable senator from Cariboo (Hon.
Mr. Turgeon) took exception to section 6 of
the bill. I have read over the bill-not
hastily; not once or twice, but a number of
times-and looking upon it from a practical
point of view I express the opinion that the
entire bill is predicated on sections 5 and 6;
that the whole bill has been brought in for
one specific purpose-to give the government
of the Minister of Agriculture power to prohibit certain classes of dairy products or other
foods from passing from one province to
another. I say that if that were not the
purpose we never would have seen this bill
here. Can any honourable member successfully refute that statement?
I find the bill somewhat ambiguous, in
that in sections 5 and 6 powýer is given to
the Governor in Council to act, while in section 7 it is given to the minister.
I have every sympathy with the farmers
who, after raising certain products, find
themselves in competition with the products
of other provinces and with substitutes. I
cannot be accused of speaking on behalf of
the promoters of margarine, because I favoured the ban on its manufacture and sale.
I note by section 6 of the bill that power
is given to prohibit the conveyance from one
province to another of the following articles:
milk, cream, butter, cheese, condensed milk,
evaporated milk, powdered milk, dry milk,
ice cream, malted milk or sherbet. Now.
those are not substitutes; they are the genuine
articles. In the province from which I come
we make very little butter, but we have a
big market for fluid milk and powdered
milk. I am just wondering whether the
passage of this bill would mean that such a
product as powdered milk, which is manufactured in British Columbia-and which we
think is the best obtainable-would be banned
from shipment to other provinces. He would
be a poor man indeed, who did not stick up
for his own province; so I am wondering
what will happen to our powdered milk?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It will be barred.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The real danger from this
measure is that what may apply to dairy
products may be extended to other articles.
For instance, the poultrymen in British
Columbia last year-before the Manchester
disease disseminated their flocks-were faced
with heavy imports of eggs from Alberta and
80713-49

Saskatchewan. They appealed to the provincial authorities, and also to me, to see if the
sale of these eggs in British Columbia could
not be prohibited. But what will happen when
this bill passes? Will the Senate of Canada
refuse to give to the poultrymen the same
protection it would give to the dairy farmers?
And what about the apple growers? We know
that British Columbia ships apples into every
other province; it has even supplied apples
to the university in the Annapolis Valley.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: After the Annapolis
Valley apples were gone.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The statement made by the
university was that they were still available.
I recall the controversy that took place at
that time: the students were being chided
for purchasing British Columbia apples when
Nova Scotia apples were available. I can
foresee legislation of this nature being
extended so as to prevent the flow of British
Columbia apples to any other province; and
in turn I can see the fishermen of that province asking that Newfoundland fish be shut
out, regardless of price. The western fishermen may well ask, "Why should this province be getting kippered herring and smoked
codfish from Newfoundland, when we can
catch lots of fish in the Pacific Ocean"? I do
not think the Newfoundland fishermen get
the same financial return as the B.C. fishermen do with the help of their unions. I say
to honourable senators, no matter what sympathies they may have for the farmers, that
this bill brings in a principle that will have
a far-reaching effect.
I never thought I would see the day when
the House of Commons would so easily give
up freedom of trade between the provinces.
Now the Senate, the house that is supposed
to protect provincial rights and public opinion,
receives this measure in the dying days of
the session. I suppose there is a majority
in this house today who will vote for the
measure, but I warn them what the passage
of this bill will mean. The province of
Ontario, for instance, will be entitled to
protection from the importation of British
Columbia powdered milk. When the demand
comes for such an extension of the principle
of this bill, I hope honourable senators will
remember my warning that this measure is
bound to bring friction amongst the peoples
of the various provinces. Surely we have
enough friction in Canada without raising
tariff barriers.
Perhaps some lawyer will tell me it is
wrong, but let me give my own interpretation of the effect of this bill. We in British
Columbia, for example, import potatoes from
Washington and California at certain seasons
of the year. The farmers can do nothing
about it, and the government does not*choose

SENATE
ta interfere with a tariff arrangement with
another country. But if the dairy farmers
have a right to be protected, the potato
growers have the same right, and if this bill
should pass we would have the situation of
Canadian-grown potatoes being refused entry
into British Columbia while Washington potatoes were allowed ta come in. Surely that
is discrimination, and is not in the interests
of Canada as a whole.
We hear a great deal these days about
private enterprise; but let me pass on a newspaper despatch which recently came ta me
from my province, telling about a certain
fermer who was fined for selling not poor
milk, but milk that was too good. The fact
is that in that province one cannot even give
his friend a sack of potatoes or other vegetables without special permission. The regulations which prevent the marketing of
vegetables except through a marketing board
helped the farmers for a time, but today
they are in dire straits. Farmers are often
carried away at meetings by smooth talkers.
I recall that some three years ago a farmers'
organization on the Pacific coast wrote and
told me that if I did not vote for the abolition
of the open market for oats and other grains
all the members of the organization would
vote solidly against me. I pointed out ta
them: "You boys are just being told a little
story, which sounds good, about the open
market".
What has taken place?
Today wheat is
handled under a federal board, and in our
province the poultryman, the dairyman and
the stockman are paying more for grain than
they ever paid before. It is useless ta make
complaint, because these prairie boards, of
course, are out ta get every last cent for the
farmer. I mention this ta illustrate the
point I am endeavouring ta make, that often
there is a tendency ta ask for something
which looks good at the time without considering what it may lead ta. Hence I have
no compunction at all in rising this afternoon ta protest strongly against these concessions, which I prophesy-and I do not
lightly make predictions-will lead ta
demands fron- every section of agricultural
producers,-the poultrymen of British Columbia, who do not want eggs brought in from
any other province; the potato-growers, who
abject ta the importation of potatoes from
Alberta; the vegetable-growers, who dislike
competition from any other province; and an
association in which I am interested, which
may well say, "We do not want butter from
Ontario and Quebec".
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: What about the manufacturers? May it not extend ta manufactured products?

Hon. Mr. Reid: I am not quite sure.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It is the next step.
Hon. Mr. Reid: By this bill great power
is given ta the minister. It is a vicious
principle, and I foresee a difficult time for
the government when it is clothed with
powers ta set up trade barriers, and must
either consent ta or turn down requests from
egg men, poultry men, apple men, and every
other group or organization that abjects ta
competition from some other province. I will
do all I can ta help the people of British
Columbia and of all Canada ta fight unfair
competition from abroad. I am particularly
interested in the farmers. God knows the
industrialists have received plenty of protection. But if barriers are ta be erected
between the provinces at the behest of pressure groups which demand from the minister
protection against the producers from some
other province, I believe the result will be
considerable friction, especially with the great
consuming public.
Apart from section 5, I am concerned about
the power ta be conferred on inspectors.
An inspector may walk into a plant and
impound not only the product but the machinery by which it is made.
I think these powers are too sweeping. Sa
I make no apology for speaking on this bill,
although I realize that probably the stage
is all set for it ta be put through. My objection ta this legislation is strengthened by the
feeling that at same future time it may react
against the interests of the farmers. I am
not quite sure, but the possibility is there.
Another pertinent objection, I believe, is
that the bill covers before us at a time when
the Minister of Agriculture has vacated the
scene; and I am wondering who can tell us
what is the real purpose of this legislation.
I do not believe that any official can supply
the right answers.
Hon. J. H. King: Honourable senators, I
shall not take more than a few moments.
I do not suppose anyone will question my
loyalty ta and admiration for the present
government, but I am distressed and disappointed that that government has presented
this bill,Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. King: -which bears the innocent
title, "An Act ta establish national standards
for dairy products and ta regulate interprovincial and international trade in dairy
products." A beautiful title, covering everything we have been doing, for years, in the
interests of the public of Canada. But as
you go through the bill you run into a joker,
covered up. I am astonished that members

JUNE 29, 1951
of this government should attempt to disguise,
under a bill bearing the title I have read,
the joker we find among these sections.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. King: I do not deny that the
bill includes amendments to the Dairy Industry Act which may be both important and
useful. But these are not the object of the
bill. The purpose of the bill is to give to
a group of men who are entrusted with
executive administration the power to regulate trade between the provinces. Surely we
in this chamber cannot accept anything of
that kind. For weeks we have discussed the
position and duties of the Senate as one of
the component bodies of parliament, and
I maintain that as senators we should not
delegate to any group which may happen to
be the executive and governing group the
right from time to time by order in council
to regulaýte the trade, interprovincial and
international, of this country.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. King: I am deeply distressed
that the government has presented us with
a bill of this character. My confidence is
shaken more especialy because what I complain about is sought to be done under cover
of a bill dealing with dairy products. Al
of us are interested in the dairy industry;
all of us want to see it thrive. Has the
dairy industry ever been in a better position
than it is today?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Never.
Hon. Mr. King: Is the dairy industry
capable of producing, even for 70 to 80 cents
a pound, all the butter that Canadians can
consume? Some of us recall what happened
two or three years ago in Alberta, when a
bunch of hoodlums, supposedly acting in the
interests of the dairy industry, seized the
milk and cream which farmers were bringing
in from the range to sell, and dumped it
on the road, and it was only by police intervention that these actions were stopped.
I am a heavy butter eater. Years ago you
could get as much butter as you wished in
restaurants, but today you do not get enough
to satisfy your needs. I have never heard
these men who represent the dairy industrythese pressure groups which come to Ottawa,
and which express themselves so vigorously
in the press-say one word about the opportunity which exists for them to increase the
sale of their butter in our hotels and restaurants. Probably they are wise in not saying anything because they are not producing
sufficient butter for our people. The Minister
of Agriculture had to import some millions
of pounds to take care of our own consumers.

We are indebted to the honourable senator
from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien) for having
discussed yesterday the constitutional aspects
of this bill. He dealt with the court rulings
which have recently been handed down. Now,
the purpose of this bill in the light of those
rulings is to satisfy a pressure group, and
that is the dangerous sort of thing we are
coming to in this country. I refer to delegations telling the government that their
wishes are primary and must be given consideration above everything else. If we consent to this bill we will only be opening the
door to other groups who are just as important as the dairy group. And let us not
forget that the dairy group is only one small
branch of agriculture. Like other businesses
today, agriculture has become specialized. In
driving through the country one notices the
large farm buildings, stables and fine cattle
herds, giving evidence of the wealth of the
farmer who is engaged in the dairy business
today.
My good friend from Cariboo (Hon. Mr.
Turgeon) who is known as a peacemaker,
said yesterday that while he would not vote
for this bill he thought it should be referred
to committee. What is the value of doing
that? Why should a bill which is ambiguous,
and for which no real need has been proclaimed, be given second reading and sent
to committee at this late hour when our
honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson) is
awaiting word from the Prime Minister to
terminate our business for this session?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. King: Under the rules of the
Senate it is quite proper for any member who
feels that a bill is harmful to the interests of
the public to move, seconded by another
honourable senator, that the bill be given
what we call a six-months' hoist. This is a
drastic and rare method which is only
employed when there is substantial reason
for it. His Honour the Speaker has been
most generous in allowing honourable senators to extend the discussion on this bill,
but he now has before him a motion which
supersedes the motion of the honourable
leader (Honourable Mr. Robertson) for the
second reading of this bill.
It is said that horse meat is now being
sold in Vancouver. This should provide a
fine market for the horse breeders of Alberta
and Saskatchewan, but what is to prevent
the cattle ranchers of British Columbia from
coming to Ottawa and claiming that because
of importation of horse meat from the ranches
of Alberta and Saskatchewan there should
be restriction on the importation of horse
meat into their province. That is only an
illustration, but it comes under this bill.

SENATE
If this bill is passed it will destroy our
interprovincial trade; it will wreck confederation and this dominion of ours; so let
us not hastily rush into this matter. I am
not going to be a peacemaker and support
the second reading of this bill. I am going
to vote against it because I certainly think
that section 6 presents a danger and embarrassment to the trade of Canada and will
not serve any useful purpose.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Iva C. Fallis: Honourable senators, I
do not intend to delay the house, but I wish
to state my position on the motion of the
honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler) to give this bill the six-months'
hoist. I think I can make my position clear
in less than two minutes.
I am supporting the motion of the honourable member from Waterloo for two reasons.
In the first place, I do not think it matters
at all in connection with this bill whether or
not I am in favour of the manufacture and
sale of margarine. To my mind that is not
the issue involved in this bill.
Hon. Mr. Euler: No, it is not.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: In my opinion the issue is
the principle of establishing, as the previous
speaker so ably put it, interprovincial tariff
barriers between our provinces. I am opposed
to the bill for that reason alone, and I am
not going into the question of margarine at
all.
Any indication I might have had about
this matter was completely dispelled this
morning after hearing the remarks of the
honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) with regard to Bill 391,
an Act to amend the Criminal Code. It is
time the Senate took a stand about bills
coming to us so late in the session, when we
have only a few hours left in which to deal
with them. After all, who should be the
judge of how much time we in the Senate
should take in dealing with legislation? I
for one am prepared to stay here for another
weekHon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: -if there is worth-while
discussion to be continued on these measures.
In my sixteen years in this Senate there have
been more than twenty sessions, and at the
conclusion of each one we have had the same
experience that we are going through now.
At the conclusion of every session we have
had protests and more protests, but they have
never been of any avail. Nothing is ever
done to improve the system, and the end of
next session will be similar to the end of
this one.

I am an advocate not of rushing bills
through at the last minute, but of taking all
the time we need to consider them. If the
House of Commons happens to finish one,
two or three days before we do, well and
good. That has nothing to do with us.
So for the two reasons that I have statedfirst, that I am opposed to the principle of
the bill, which would establish provincial
barriers; and secondly, that I am against
important legislation being hurried through
this house in the last minutes of the session
-I
wholeheartedly support the amendment
to give this bill the six months' hoist.
Some Hon. Senators: Question.
Hon. Norman P. Lamberi: Honourable
senators, I should like to make way for the
taking of the vote now, but I wish to associate
myself with those who are opposed to this
bill, and I can do so very briefiy.
A bill, like a chain, is no stronger than its
weakest link; and in my opinion three clauses
of the bill render it as a whole an impossible
piece of legislation. It seems to me that to
come to that opinion all one need do is read
paragraph (b) of clause 2 of the bill-the
paragraph defining "dairy product"-and
apply it to clause 6. It will then be seen that
if the bill is passed the government will have
power to prevent me or anyone else in
Ontario from importing from the neighbouring province of Quebec such products as peanut butter and maple butter-and I may
say, incidentally, that a certain section of a
family with which I am intimate would at
any time prefer maple butter to creamery
butter or margarine or anything else as a
spread on bread. So that is one reason why
I object to the bill.
From the broader point of view, I think
that the passing by the federal parliament
of a measure which in its essence is narrow
class legislation, for self-centred special privilege, is contrary to every conception and
principle on which our federal system was
established. More than 60 per cent of the
present population of this country can be
as non-agricultural,
described definitely
people who live in urban communities and
are employed by the major industries that
are distinct from the industry of agriculture.
The interests of all those people would be
hurt by passage of this measure.
In addition, a considerable percentage of
the people in the agricultural industry itself
would be prejudicially affected by passage of
the bill. I can speak from personal knowledge of the dairy industry, for I rnyself am
directly interested in it in a small way; I
supply all the butter and other dairy products
used in my own house, and in some other
houses as well. Let me say here that any-

JUNE 29, 1951
one who is sufficiently interested in the
matter can provide butter for himself quite
easily.
However, I do not believe that enough
people will go into the producing of butter
to bring about impoverishment of the dairy
industry. Nor do I think that that industry
is languishing because of the consumption of
butter substitutes. If the facts were honestly
analyzed it would be found, I think, that
such factors as transportation and labour
costs have had a great deal more than anything else to do with the economie condition
of the industry.
Reference to substitutes brings up a very

economic

immemorial human beings have exercised
the right of discovering and using substitutes for articles that have become too costly
or out of reach. This bill would deny to our
people the exercise of that fundamental
economic right. If the principle of this bill
were to be generally adopted we might be
presented some day with a bill providing that
for the protection of persons engaged in the
breeding, raising and sale of horses, farmers
shall be prohibited from using tractors and
any other mechanical implements designed
to replace horses.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Similarly, we might
have a bill for the protection of churn manufacturers, prohibiting dairymen from purchasing or using separators. The principle
that human beings shall be free to establish
their own habits in the use of substitutes for
any products is as fundamental as life itself.
This bill takes the very reactionary position
that for all time the people of Canada may,
if the government so decides, be denied the
use of a substitute for butter.
Who can tell what butter substitutes

pull down the curtain on all intelligence by
denying the economic principle of freedom
to use substitutes, simply to satisfy one
entrenched class interest in this country?
When I say that, I have reference to a
certain intimation that was made during the
debate that this measure followed a recent
conference in Ottawa of representatives of
the various provincial departments of agriculture and of a federal department. A
similar conference is held here every year,
its purpose being to review the condition of
agriculture and to assess advisable policies
as to production and so on for the coming
year. The honourable leader on this side
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) suggested, and I know,
that the policy decided upon at the recent

conference reflected the point of view of the
National Dairy Council and the Canadian
Federation of Agriculture, and it is upon
that policy that this measure has been
formulated. Personally I object to being a
party to any sort of special pleading of that
kind, and for that reason I am going to
support the motion to give the bill the six
months' hoist.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Honourable
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancourt:
senators, I shall be very brief. After the
remarks that have been made by the senator
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck)
and the senator from New Westminster (Hon.
Mr. Reid), I do not know whether a member
from Quebec will be permitted to express,
his point of view. We should speak not only
for our own province, but for the whole of
Canada; we are all Canadians, and we love
our country as well as our province.
I have three points to make in answer to
the proposals of the senator from Kitchener.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Waterloo; he only
lives in Kitchener.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: I am not a lawyer,
so when I want legal assistance I go to a
lawyer, put my case before him and get
his advice. If I go to a second lawyer, he
may express the opposite point of view on
the same set of facts. The subject may then
come before the courts, and one side will
win and the other lose. The matter may be
appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada,
and on it goes. Whether I am right, I cannot
always be sure, but I do my best to see the
light.
If the laws respecting agricultural markets
are sound, then this bill is all right. My
friend from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) said
that he could buy maple butter in Ontario.
I would point out to him that my maple products cannot be sold in Ontario unless they
are properly graded and marked; and British
Columbia apples cannot be marketed in
Quebec unless they are in accordance with
marketing regulations. That has been the
law for the past thirty years. And now
we are questioning the principles behind it.
Why are we doing that? Is it because of the
introduction of margarine? For my part, that
is only one item, and should not be taken
too seriously. It must be remembered that
if this bill passes, the people who will administer the law are not entirely foolish; they
will apply the law with judgment, and the
minister involved will properly supervise it.
Again, I say that I am not a lawyer, but
I try to reach my own conclusions. The
senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) said
that Canada has general agreements whereby

SENATE
she may sell her products throughout the
world, but I point out that the United States
has signed an agreement prohibiting importation
of butter
except
with special
permission.
The senator suggested that the sales tax of
8 or 10 per cent on margarine should be
removed, to make the product more readily
available to the poor consumer. Well, honourable senators, let me put on the record a
table showing the costs of the ingredients of
margarine as of last winter and as of today,
and compare those figures with the price of
margarine some months ago and its price
today. This is the table:

In spite of the above figures, the price of
margarine is higher today than it was in
February. Poor consumers! Happy manufacturer!
Hon. Mr. Euler: It is still a lot cheaper
than butter, is it not?
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: This is my last point.
Much is said about margarine and what it
has done for the poor working man. Take,
for instance, a family of six, which by using
three pounds of margarine a week instead of
three pounds of butter will save roughly
60 cents. But what does that same family
pay for meat? It must spend $3 or $4 a week
for meat because Canadian cattle are being
sold south of the border. Yet last week meat
in the United States was cheaper by 10 or 15
cents a pound than it was in Canada. Indeed,
honourable senators, there are some things so
strange that no one can explain them. But
one reason that meat is so scarce is that the
farmers cannot get a market for their milk,
and so cattle are disappearing. Soon we
will not only not have butter, but we will
not have meat.
My honourable friend from Grandville
(Hon. Mr. Bouffard) spoke yesterday about
protecting Quebec. We want to protect the
farmers all across the country, for they are
the builders of our nation.
My last words are: Farmers, kill the cattle
before margarine kills you!
Hon. L. M. Gouin: Honourable senators, I
am quite prepared to make my few remarks
now, but I do not see how we can possibly
dispose of the bill before lunch-time. I move,
therefore, that the debate be adjourned.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

At 3 p.m. the sitting was resumed.
Hon. L. M. Gouin: Honourable senators, I
will try to be as brief as possible and to
consider quite objectively the bill which is
now before us. I do not intend to argue the
case either against or for margarine. What I
want to do is to throw a little more light on
the subject. I want to see the whole truth,
whether or not it appears to justify my own
attitude.
Our colleague from Kennebec (Hon. Mr.
Vaillancourt) referred to the differences of
opinion which exist so habitually between
lawyers, and to the constitutional aspect of
the question. On this latter point, I wish
to advert to the remarks which were made
by the honourable senator from De Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Vien), on the decision in the
Margarine Case, and which our colleague
from Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard) intended
to answer, but did not have time to refer to
as he had to reply to the remarks made by
the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) concerning the possibility
of an eventual separation of the Province of
Quebec from Confederation
The decision in the Margarine Case, as
was stated by our honourable colleague from
De Lorimier, is to be found in 1950, 4
Dominion Law Reports, page 689. That case
relates clearly and simply to the manufacture
and sale of margarine within a province. At
the moment we are dealing with quite a different problem: the bill is intended, rightly
or wrongly, to regulate international and
interprovincial trade.
I am of opinion that parliament has indubitable jurisdiction, under section 91 of the
British North America Act, the clause relating to the regulation of trade and commerce,
to regulate trade with foreign countries and
from one province to another. I do not
want to take much time on this point, but
those who are interested will find a very
clear review of the matter in the report of
the reference made to the Supreme Court of
Canada in Re Natural Products Marketing
Act, 1936, 3 Dominion Law Reports, pages
625 and following.
I come now to section 121 of the British
North America Act, cited by my honourable
friend from De Lorimier, which provides for
the free entry into one province of the products of another. But the interpretation of
the word "free" in this provision has been
given the meaning "free from customs duty".
That point was decided by the Privy Council
in Atlantic Smoke Shops Ltd. vs. Conlon,
1943, 4 Dominion Law Reports, pages 92 and
93. The noble Lords make their own the

We had the assistance of counsel, pretty
well-known lawyers. Every other province
did the same thing. It would have been
much better if at that time the federal
parliament had passed enabling legislation,
like the bill before us, to help the provinces
do openly what they were doing by a "backdoor" procedure. The people of this country
prefer to have their public business conducted
in a straightforward fashion rather than by
devious methods. That is why I am in
favour of this bill.
I have heard some people refer to the
farmers of this country as a pressure group.
Well, I would like anybody in this bouse to
indicate to me any class of the population
which, in proportion to what it represents in
the economic and social life of the country,
has exerted less political pressure than the
farmers, and in particular the dairy farmers.
I say to honourable members that our future
depends on the dairy farmers of this country.
Half a million people are directly engaged
in the basic industry of dairy farming. It is
a basic industry not only because it furnishes
nourishment to the population, but because
it provides to those engaged in it a way of
life. Further, the best classes of our people
come from the farms. This is so, not because
dairy and other farmers are naturally better
people than citizens in other occupations, but
because life on the farm brings people into
direct contact with elemental realities and
gives them a little time to think seriously
about such things as some of the new theories
that are being circulated everywhere. A
sound farming' class is, I say, the best protection against what we all fear above everything else.
The farmer must be protected, and if we
do not protect him now Canada will later
on find itself in the unenviable position at
present occupied by some other countriesone of which, England, is well known to most
members here. About one hundred years ago
England had to face the problem we are
facing now. Industry was developing very
rapidly, and agriculture was relatively so
unimportant to her economic life that she
forgot to take care of it. Today England has
to do for the protection of agriculture twenty
times what Canada is doing. I mention this
because I would not like to be a party to
tearing down something that our sons will
find it necessary to rebuild. The example
of England should cause every member of
this house to refiect on the present situation
in Canada.
Dairy farmers are operating now with a
very narrow margin of profit. In fact, I
contend that no farmer who produces milk

wage to which they are entitled can make

farmers are able to put aside a little money
are: First, that they do not spend much; and
secondly, that they do not pay a proper wage
to their sons who work on the farm. That
policy is not sound for the farmers, nor is it
sound for the country at large. I believe that
if we continue a little longer our neglect of
the farmers of this country they will be leaving the farms for the cities in 'even larger
numbers than they are doing now, and many
of them, instead of being an asset to the
country's economic life, will, by overcrowding
our urban centres, be in danger of becoming
a burden upon the country. I think the
farmers need the protection which this bill
will give them.
It has been said by those who advocate
the use of margarine that that substitute for
butter is considered by doctors to be not
poisonous-but we have not been given the
names of the doctors who came to even that
conclusion. Of course, no opponent of margarine ever contended that it was poisonous.
What we say is that it is not as nutritious
as butter, that it will not help to build up a
generation so physically strong as those generations that have made this country what
it is today. I do not think this bill gives any
more protection than dairy farmers need to
enable them to survive economically.
Parliament bas passed laws to protect
poultry producers, laws to protect producers
of fruit and vegetables, and laws to classify
fruits and vegetables that are shipped from
one province to another. Those laws have
proved the best incentive to farmers to improve their produce. For instance, farmers in
Quebec complained against the competition
they had to face from potatoes that are
shipped in by New Brunswick and Nova
Scotia producers. The reason for the keen
competition is that, as the potatoes are shipped
in from an outside province they have to be
classified and graded according to federal
regulations. Again, a Quebec farmer cannot
sell a bushel of apples in Ontario unless they
also are classified according to federal regulations. When farmers from the Maritime
provinces were capturing the Montreal market with their classified produce, Quebec
farmers decided that the only way to meet
the competition was by classifying what they
themselves produced and brought to the
market. I could go on and give many more
instances showing that compulsory grading
leads to improvement in the produce offered
for sale.
All that is being asked in this bill is that
the federal parliament authorize the government to pass regulations requiring that dairy
products passing from one province to

JUNE 29, 1951
another be graded. Producers of margarine
would like to have it appear as much as
possible like butter, and certainly it is important that these products should be
distinguished in some way so that people
will know what they are buying.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: My honourable friend
is a lawyerHon. Mr. Godbout: No, I am not.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I was under a misapprehension. Nevertheless, perhaps he will
permit me to ask him a question. Does he
draw a distinction between laws regulating
commerce and laws, like the measure before
us, which would prohibit commerce? Sections 5 and 6 of the bill would authorize the
Governor in Council to prohibit the shipment of certain classes of goods from one
province to another.
Hon. Mr. Godbout: The federal authority
undoubtedly has the right to prohibit the
entry of goods from another country into
Canada. It is equally certain that the
provinces have authority to prohibit the
bringing or sending of goods into their own
territory. Some provinces-not Quebec alone,
but Prince Edward Island as well-have
made it illegal to bring in margarine for
sale. Note what I say, honourable gentlemen; tomorrow nine provinces will prohibit
this trade. They have been given authority
to control produce within their own jurisdictions, and it is for the federal authorities
to support them. I prefer to deal with these
problems in the open, and to settle them
properly. We have the authority to do just
that, and to protect the farming industry
of the future. By doing so we will be
protecting a class of society which is the
backbone of the country.
Let us look for a moment, honourable
senators, at the change today taking place in
England. A hundred years ago that country
thought industrial activity was much more
important than agriculture, but today it is
coming back with measures that will extend
to agriculture twenty times as much encouragement as Canada is giving to that industry.
I would not like to place on my sons the
burden of rebuilding the agricultural industry
of this country; I would much prefer to
protect it while it is still buoyant.
Hon. Mr. King: I should not interrupt the
debate at this time, but perhaps I will be
permitted to ask a question. First, may I say
what a pleasure it is to hear the honourable gentleman from Montarville (Hon. Mr.
Godbout) speak. He should take part in
debates more often. He has dealt with the
control that provincial governments have over
merchandise, not only agricultural products.
80713-50

Does he think that it is proper to put within
the control of the executive of the federal
government, not of parliament, the interprovincial trade which exists between the provinces of Canada?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Including potatoes.
Hon. Mr. Godbout: I think on occasions it
is necessary for the federal authority to delegate its power to a more flexible body than
parliament. Let us take, as an illustration, the
Act affecting poultry producers. Obviously,
the sessions of legislatures in the various
provinces and the annual session of parliament do not always coincide; there is, therefore often a lapse of six months during which
regulations have to be enacted by order in
council. The federal authority has provided
regulations affecting the trade in poultry
products. Provincial regulations differ. For
instance, Ontario can sell to Quebec what it
may not sell to Manitoba, because the legislation in that province is different. For that
reason it is necessary that the government
should be allowed to pass regulations to take
care of changing conditions.
Hon. Mr. King: You are in favour of
flexibility?
Hon. Mr. Godbout: I have confidence in
the Department of Agriculture of this country, and I think power should be given to pass
orders in council to take care of changing
conditions when parliament is not in session. I am in favour of law and order, and
the authority of parliament- 1 and I have
given much to that cause-but I think there
are peculiar circumstances when a body more
flexible than parliament must act for it, and
under its authority.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Question!
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators will understand that the remarks of the
mover of the amendment will conclude the
debate.
Hon. Mr. Euler:-I presume that it is the
privilege of the mover of the motion for the
six months' hoist of this bill to say a few
words about the course of the debate. It is
not my intention to speak at any length, but
I should like at the outset to comment on
the trend of the discussion.
None of us, I am sure, have any prejudices
against farmers and dairymen, and none of
us object to the proper classification and
grading of farm products. To the extent
that the bill provides for such grading, we
are not opposed to it. I do not even wish
to mention again the question of margarine.
I would hope that that question is to some
extent settled, but I hope that the people

SENATE
in every province of Canada will some day
have the benefit of consuming coloured
margarine.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: And without a sales
tax.
Hon. Mr. King: If they wish to consume it.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Yes, if they wish it. I
for one would not lift a little finger to prevent the people of any province from consuming and enjoying this wholesome and
comparatively inexpensive food.
At this point I want to note a remark of
the honourable senator from Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Godbout), a former premier of
Quebec, who, in reflecting on the healthfulness
or wholesomeness of margarine, damned it
by saying "It is not a poison." I am afraid
he is completely out of touch with modern
-thought if he does not know that the highest
medical authorities in the United States,
Canada and other countries have stated that
margarine is as wholesome and nourishing
as butter. I could not allow the honourable
senator's remark to go without contradiction.
He also said something about "pressure
groups" being behind this legislation. I do
not know whether they are or not, but I
have not much doubt that the Minister of
Agriculture received at least a little pressure,
and I suppose thaýt he did not need a great
leal of pressure, to induce him to bring in
shis legislation. If my honourable friend is
looking for an example of a pressure group
in action, I think I can give it to him. When
the Supreme Court decided in effect that the
sale of margarine in this country was entirely
legal, the manufacturers immediately produced a coloured brand. In passing, I might
tell my honourable friend the leader of the
government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) that this
supply of margarine came on the market
within ýthree weeks after the prohibitory law
was declared unconstitutional, and not three
years afterwards, as he predicted would be
the case.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Conditions change.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Although the Premier of
Ontario said that he was not going to interfere with the colour of margarine, for some
reason or other-and I ram quite sure it was
through pressure from some quarter-he had
a law enacted to prohibit the colouring of
margarine; and his exemple was followed in
all the other provinces. I assert that there
was a pressure group behind that action;
and I will also say that that term describes
very well the Federation of Agriculture.
However, I did not rise for the purpose of
discussing the question of margarine. It is
not the chief and vital factor in this bill or
in this debate. The issue goes much deeper.

Of course I am and always have been interested in the question of margarine, and
as I said yesterday, I have taken a great deal
of satisfaction in the fact that its manufacture
and sale are legal in most of the Canadian
provinces. But as regards this bill, margarine comes only incidentally into the
picture. My objection to the bill rests entirely on what I regard as its vital principle:
that it would give authority to the executive
to restrict-no, more than that-to prohibit
trade between the provinces. That is contrary
to the spirit at least, of the constitution of this
country.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: And the letter.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I think it most reprehensible that parliament, as far as the Commons is concerned-perhaps also as far as
the Senate is 'concerned-is ready to surrender
a power which should never go out of the
hands of parliament itself. That is my chief
objection to the bill.
In that connection I may have gone a little
farther afield than was my original intention;
so I want to make it clear that my opinions
about margarine have nothing to do with my
motive in proposing my amendment or in
making this speech. Nothing in this bill is
devised to prevent the manufacture of margarine in Ontario or any other province. But
I have already voiced a suspicion, the reality
of which was acknowledged yesterday when
my honourable friend from Grandville (Hon.
Mr. BoufTard) said that what was wanted
under this bill was the right to prevent the
people of Hull and vicinity from coming to
Ottawa, buying a few pounds of margarine
and taking it home for the benefit of their
families. My honourable friend was very
frank about it. I suspected all along some
motive of that kind: that was the only reason
I mentioned the matter of margarine at all.
This debate, as I see it, bas presented four
more or less outstanding features. First, the
greater number of those who have spoken
expressed themselves as, in whole or in part,
against the principle to which I have just
referred, that is, interference by the federal
government in trade between the various
provinces. Second, those who supported the
bill-and I think I must include the last
speaker-spoke entirely from a provincial and
not a national standpoint.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: No, sir.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Third, the course of the
discussion has confirmed my suspicion that
clause 6 is definitely designed to restrict the
use of margarine in certain parts of the
country, and that it may be used, and I
suspect will be used if the bill becomes law,
to limit production, and sale in other provinces. Fourth-and this, it seems to me, is

JUNE 29, 1951
Hon. Mr. Farquhar: That is not very nice
talk.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I want to re-emphasize
that I would reject this bill because it is
a direct attack on the rights of the provinces
to sel to each other. That is the vital
principle involved here.
The suggestion has been made, by a number of those who have taken part in this
debate-in good faith, I think-and by a number of others to whom I have spoken, that
they are opposed to the principle of section
6 of the bill; but at the same time they have
said that they would like the bill to go to
committee where amendments could be made
to it. I should like to remind honourable
members that you cannot send a bill to
committee without it first having been given
second reading.
Sorne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: And you cannot give a
bill second reading without endorsing its
principle.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Therefore, if you give the
bill second reading you endorse its principle,
and I am sure that those gentlemen who have
said to me that they are opposed to the
principle of section 6 would hardly want to
endorse the principle of this legislation by
consenting to its second reading.
I am directly opposed to the principle of
the bill, and to the bill itself, because it is
shot throughout with all the implications
that we find in section 6. The first part of
the bill deals with grading, classification, and
so on. I have no objection to that. But in
clauses other than clause 6 there are implications of the same thing that we find in
clause 6.
It is for these reasons that I think it was
perfectly logical for me to move the sixmonths' hoist and to ask you to reject the
bill in its entirety. I do not question the
good faith of anyone, including the members
of the government, but I think the bill is
thoroughly vicious In principle. As such,

Hon. Mr. Euler: I am not insinuating rejected. If you send it to committee, as
probably you will, it will at best come back

If they do, what will happen in these last

days of the session? I repeat the question

Sorne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
of that gentleman than I have.
80713-50J
the important point-those who advocate this
legislation have paid very little attention to
the fact that the bill makes it possible, not to
restrict, not to regulate, but to prohibit interprovincial trade, one of the basic principles
of confederation.
The Minister of Agriculture, who is an
old colleague of mine, is the father of this
bill. I know him, or at least I used to know
him, pretty well. I have a very high regard
for his ability, though very little liking for
his policies. I think my honourable friend
from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. MacKinnon) will
agree with me that the minister's persistence
is as great as his success in getting what he
wants; and he knows what use he will make
of the powers available to him under this
bill. It may be said that he cannot do anything except by order in council, which means
except with the consent of the members of
the cabinet. But those who have been in
the cabinet of this country know that when
a minister brings in an order in council to
cabinet, what he wants generally goes
through: other ministers very, very seldom
offer any opposition. If restriction is imposed
in the case of Quebec, I would not be at all
surprised if the Minister of Agriculture, knowing his antagonism to margarine, were at
some future date to forbid the people of
Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia and
the Maritime Provinces having this product,
unless the margarine industries themselves
were established in those provinces. He might
not do that, but I would not be at all certain
that he could not be induced to do it.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: The provinces can
manufacture margarine now, can they not?
Hon. Mr. Euler: Certainly, but they cannot
deny the right of anyone to take the product
from one province to another. The manufacturers of margarine are largely concentrated in Ontario, and they can send
their product anywhere in Canada, except
to Quebec and Prince Edward Island. If the
Minister of Agriculture decided, however,
not ta let margarine into the province of
Saskatchewan or Alberta or British Columbia-

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Euler: For some twenty-five years
now we have operated pretty well under the
Dairy Industry Act, even though we have
not always agreed with all its sections, particularly the one dealing with oleomargarine.
Surely there is not going to be any great
harm done to the interests of the public if
we let the present Dairy Industry Act continue to operate until parliament meets again
in the fall. I suggest to the leader of the
government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) that he
consider dropping the bill now.
.Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
.on. Mr. Euler: Perhaps everyone will not
admit it, but I think it is clear that this is
an imperfect and ill-conceived bill. In fact,
it was really not considered at all in the
House of Commons, and it reached us only
three days ago. What possible harm can
come to the Canadian people if this bill is
dropped now, on the understanding that when
parliament meets again three months hence
the government will bring down a bill which
will be well considered, and which, if passed,
will be free of the defects contained in the
present bill. I most earnestly commend this
suggestion to the leader of the government.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, the question is now on the motion of
the Honourable Senator Robertson that this
bill be now read a second time. Is it your
pleasure to carry the motion?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Before the question
is decided, I should like to say that I have
followed the debate on this matter with the
greatest interest. I have been impressed by

the fair presentation of arguments by honourable members, but I am bound to say that
I was a little disappointed that the mover
of the amendment (Hon. Mr. Euler) seemed
to go out of his way to question the motives
and good intentions of the Minister of Agriculture. It is the duty and responsibility
of that minister to advance whatever
measures he considers to be in the interests
of agriculture, and I think it fair to assert
that he has served the people of this country
to a higher degree than any of his predecessors in office.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I regret that my
honourable friend from Waterloo should have
found it necessary to cast these general
aspersions on the Minister, and I do not
think that by so doing he added to the excellent arguments he previously advanced.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Honourable senators, I
claim the privilege of denying unreservedly
that I questioned the motives of the Minister
of Agriculture. What I said was that I did
not agree with most of his policies.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: I wish to emphasize
what the honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson) has said about the Minister of Agriculture. I come from the same province as
the minister, and although we have been
bitter political opponents he is a very dear
friend of mine. I admire him and I know
his love for agriculture. I know what he
wishes to do, but it has no bearing on the
principle involved in this bill. I hope the
government will do in this case what it has
done in other cases and refer the principle
of this bill to the Supreme Court of Canada
for a ruling.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time, on division.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I move that this bill be referred to the
Standing Committee on Natural Resources.
It has been suggested to me that this bill
should properly be referred to the Committee on Banking and Commerce. I would
point out, however, that I had already called
a meeting of the Committee on Natural
Resources in the expectation that the bill
receive second reading. Nevertheless, I
have no intention of going against the wishes
of the house in this matter.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Honourable senators,
I was the person who made this suggestion
to the leader. When the bill was introduced
several days ago the leader said, I believe,
that if it received second reading he would

refer it to the Standing Committee on

Natural Resources.
made the suggestion the honourable senator
from Leeds (Hon. Mr. Hardy) drew attention
to the fact that this bill would more properly
be sent to the Committee on Banking and
Commerce. In fact, I think that during the
absence of our leader the same suggestion
was made earlier in reference to other bills
by the deputy leader (Hon. Mr. Hugessen).
I think that in the later part of each session
it bas been the practice to send bills to the
Banking and Commerce Committee because
it is more representative, and that this committee has handled bills which strictly
speaking would ordinarly be dealt with by
other committees.
I maintain that this bill deals with what
are essentially matters of trade and commerce, and that it has nothing whatsoever
to do with the primary functions of the
Department of Agriculture.
Furthermore, the Committee on Banking
and Commerce is appropriately interested in
any questions having to do with interprovincial trade.
My third point is that the personnel of the
Banking and Commerce Committee is more
representative of the members who have
taken part in the debate than is that of the
National Resources Committee. If the bill is
sent to the Natural Resources Committee
and a vote is taken on it there, at least
eight senators who have opposed the bill
in the debate will be prevented from voting
in committee.
Hon. Mr. Godbout: How many members
of the Natural Resources Committee are in
favour of the bill?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I do not know. I am
simply pointing out that eight members of
the Banking and Commerce Committee who
have spoken against the bill are not members
.of the Natural Resources Committee, and so
would be unable to vote there. On the other
hand, a number of members of the Banking
and Commerce Committee have spoken in
favour of the bill and as they are not on the
Natural Resources Committee, they also
would be denied a vote.
I maintain that in order to continue the
customary practice of referring bills in the
closing hour of the session, and also to permit
a more representative expression of opinion
in the committee, this bill should be referred
to the Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
the question is on the motion of the Honourable Senator Robertson, that the bill be

referred to the Standing Committee on
Natural Resources. Is it your pleasure to
adopt the motion?
Some Hon. Senators: Carried.
Some Hon. Senators: On division.
The Hon. the Speaker: The motion is
agreed to, on division.
CRIMINAL CODE BILL
THIRD READING-DEBATE

CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Robertson for the third reading of Bill 391,
an Act to amend the Criminal Code.
Hon. Arthur Marcotte: Honourable senators,
it is getting so late and our time is so short
that I will make my remarks very brief
and keep them to the point. Reference to
the Senate Hansard of Wednesday, June 27,
page 706 will show that I reserved my right
to propose amendments to this bill after it
was reported back from committee. The
honourable the deputy leader (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) then said:
You undoubtedly will have that right.

I now wish to exercise that right by proposing the following amendment:
That the bill be not now read a third time as
amended, but that it be further amended as
follows:
Page 11, lines 30 to 33: Strike out the words
"notwithstanding that he was not, before he gave
the sample, warned that he need not give the
sample or that the results of the analysis of the
sample might be used in evidence", and substitute
therefore the following: "provided that he has been
properly warned that he need not give the sample
and that the results of the analysis of the sample
may be used in evidence against him."

This amendment is seconded by the honourable senator from Gloucester (Honourable
Mr. Veniot.)
Honourable senators, before I deal with
my amendment may I say just a few words
about other parts of the bill? If we were
not so short of time I would protest once
more against the practice of sending so
important a bill as this over to the Senate
in almost the last minutes of the sessior.
However, things being as they are, I will
make no further protest along that line just
now.
I am fully in accord with the criticism
expressed by the senator from TorontoTrinity (Honourable Mr. Roebuck) of several
sections of the bill. I refer particularly to
subsection (2) of the proposed new section
120, on page 4, which authorizes a peace
officer to seize any firearms which he finds
in the possession of a person whom he believes to be under the age of fourteen. Now,

SENATE
anyone who reads the newspapers or listens
to the radio knows that almost every day
there are reports of crimes being committed
by young men of sixteen or seventeen. It is
quite common to read of these young people
committing or attempting to commit burglary,
for instance, and often they are armed. But
I do not think we have so far had any cause
for believing that boys under fourteen are
likely to engage in this kind of criminal
activity. Under the Juvenile Delinquents Act
most provinces regard children under sixteen
as minors, and in certain provinces even
children up to eighteen are so classified.
Honourable members will recall that in a
recent discussion I stated my intention to
propose next session that the definition of a
minor under the Juvenile Delinquents Act
be made uniform in all provinces.
I wish to mention one other point that was
dealt with by the senator from TorontoTrinity. Subsection (2)(a) of the proposed
new section 128, on page 8 of the bill, exempts
persons in the business of repairing firearms
from the requirement to have a permit for
arms in their possesion. If no change is made
in this provision and the proprietor of a
repair shop does not have to be shown a
permit by anyone who brings in a firearm
for repairs, then any criminal will be quite
within the law in taking a gun for which
he has no permit to such an establishment
for repairs.
If we were not so near to the end of the
session I would criticize other sections of the
bill. But in the circumstances I will content
myself by going now to my amendment to
the proposed new subsection (4)(d) of section
285 of the Act, which provides for the chemical analysis of the blood, and so forth of
persons charged with driving a motor vehicle
while under the influence of alcohol or drug.
The subsection reads as follows:
In any oroceedings under subsection four or four
(a) the result of a chemical analysis is of a sample
of the blood, urine, breath or other bodily substance of a person may be admitted in evidence on
the issue whether that person was intoxicated or
under the influence of a narcotic drug or whether
his ability to drive was impaired by alcohol or a
drug, notwithstanding that he was net, before he
gave the sample, warned that he need not give
the sample or that the 'results of the analysis of
the sarmple might be used in evidence.

Honourable senators, I have been practising
law in the courts of Saskatchewan for nearly
forty years, and in that time I have been
connected with a good many cases brought
under the Criminal Code. As the years have
passed by, I have been more and more impressed by the fact that we are getting away
from British principles of law. I was born
in the Province of Quebec and am familiar

with the laws of that province.
I later
migrated to the province of Saskatchewan,
and am familiar with the laws of that province, so I have been able to compare the
laws of the two provinces. Frankly, I am
a great admirer of British institutions and the
principles enunciated in the criminal law,
that a man is presumed innocent until proven
guilty, and that he may not make a statement
or confession as to his guilt unless he has
first been warned that it may be used in
evidence against him.
Let us consider what may happen under
the provisions of the present bill. A man
may be drugged by his friends as a joke.
Oh, let us say that three people stop at a
restaurant and two order liquor and the
other takes tea. The tea drinker may
unknowingly be drugged by his companions
and then be placed behind the wheel of an
automobile which is presumed to be in his
care. You will note that the -section provides that whether or not the car is in motion,
it is presumed to be in his care and he is
responsible for it. The unfortunate victim
is then arrested, conducted to the police station, and without any warning of the consequences a sample is taken of his blood or
urine. This, to my way of thinking, is not
in accordance with the principles of British
justice and the application of criminal law
as I know it, and it is obvious that unless
such a sample is taken at the proper time
it is of no value.
I read in the Montreal Gazette this morning that the Minister of Justice had been
congratulated upon having removed from this
bill the provisions referring to what is called
the tapping of wires. Let him withdraw the
section providing that, without proper warning, some part of a human may be tapped,
and then he may properly be congratulated.
Honourable senators, I have moved the
amendment before the house because I am
opposed to the obtaining of convictions by
requiring an accused person to do something
he knows nothing about and over which he
has no control. The proposal to use against
him evidence obtained in such a way is contrary to all the best principles of criminal
law, as I know them. I do not think that is a
just way to treat an accused person.
During my years of practice I have always
respected and been on good terms with the
police officers of my province. At the same
time I despise the use of spotters a device
that is contrary to all principles of British
law. The amendments which have been
creeping into the Code have allowed such
practices to become all too common.

The report was read by the Clerk Assistant, as follows:
The Standing Committee on Natural Resources to
whom was referred the Bill 403, An Act to establish
national standards for dairy products and to regulate interprovincial and international trade in dairy
products, have in obedience to the order of reference of 29th June, 1951, examined the said bill, and
now beg leave to report the same with the following
amendment:

Speaker:

Honourable sen-

ators, when shall the amendment be taken
into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Now, I move concurrence in the report.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Before the report is
concurred in I am raising a point of order
affecting the rules of the chamber. It is true
I am not an old member of this house; but I
noted that when the bell had been rung
yesterday for the taking of the vote, and

after the doors were

closed, at least five

honourable members came in.

I would like

to know whether it is a rule of this house
that after the doors are closed a senator
cannot enter the chamber and vote. I know
that that is the rule in the House of Comnions. The result of the vote would have

CRIMINAL

CODE BILL
THIRD READING
The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion for the
third reading of Bill 391, an Act to amend
the Criminal Code, as amended, and the
motion in amendment of the Honourable
Senator Marcotte, seconded by the Honourable Senator Veniot, that the bill be not now
read a third time but that it be further
amended as follows:
Page 11, lines 30 to 33. For the words "notwithstanding that he was not, before he gave the sample,
warned that he need not give the sample or that
the results of the analysis of the sample might be
used in evidence" substitute therefor the following:
: Provided that he has been properly warned
that he need not give the sample and that the
results of the analysis of the sample may be used in
evidence against him."

senators, that apparently there

Honourable senators, the question is now

Robertson for the third reading of this bill.
Is it your pleasure to carry the motion?
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
CANADA DAIRY PRODUCTS BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved the third reading of Bill 403, an Act to establish national
standards for dairy products and to regulate
interprovincial and international trade in
dairy products.
Hon. J. H. King: Honourable senators, I
have a motion that I would like to move.
It is as follows:
That the said bill be not now read a third time,
but that it be further amended as follows:
1. Pages 3 and 4, being lines 22 to 45, both inclusive, of page 3, lines 1 to 6, both inclusive, of page
4: Strike out clause 6, and renumber the subsequent clauses accordingly.

Hon. Mr. King: We representatives of the
people are practical men and women, and we
know that undoubtedly an effort has been
made to circumvent the law, as it was understood, and as it has been declared by the
courts not only by the courts of Canada but
by the Privy Council. However, I do not wish
to develop that phase.
The provinces of Quebec and Prince
Edward Island have passed prohibitory laws
applying to certain products. In doing so
they were within their rights. The question
is whether it is expedient that at this time we
should interfere with what has been considered the proper exercise of a provincial right.
I think it inexpedient that we at this time
should give power, not to parliament but to
the executive, to prohibit the transportation
of numerous products from one province to
another. Power has been given, under the
Act as we understand it, to prohibit marketing of products which are not of the class and
kind that people should trade in. But section
6 of the bill goes far beyond that, and I do
not think the Senate of Canada, with its relatively small attendance this morning, should
consent to delegate to the executive of this
government-or any other governments that
may follow-the right to prohibit by order in
council the conveyance of products from one
I contend, and I
province to another.
emphasize this, honourable senators, that
there should be no hurry in passing this bill. I
note from the Official Report of Debates of the
other place, that there was very little discussion of this section in that house. Why then
should we not delay its consideration so that
the elected representatives of the people may
have another opportunity of expressing themselves upon it? It has been indicated that
parliament will adjourn today and reassemble
on October 9 next. That is only three months
away.
Hon. Mr. Reid: They have not won yet.
Hon. Mr. King: Surely honourable senators
will see fit to adopt my motion to delete section 6 from the bill, so as to allow a fuller
consideration of it when parliament reconvenes in October.

Honourable senators, I do not propose to
delay the house very long. We seem to be in
a great hurry. I was late for prayers, Mr.
Speaker, and was not here when the order for
consideration of the committee's report was
called. I greatly appreciate, therefore, the
gracious action of my leader (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) in asking that the order be not
proceeded with at once.
I am not a consumer of margarine or any
other butter substitute, but I do not think it
is expedient that the Government of Canada
say the government, not parliament-I
should at this time give to the executive the
right to prohibit the transportation of various
commodities between the provinces of this
country. It is true that under arrangements
with the various provinces certain federal
legislation has been passed--the Food and
Drugs Act, for instance-for the purpose of
Hon. Gustave Lacasse: Honourable senaensuring that only non-injurious foods, tors, I should like to say briefly that I wholedrugs, and other such commodities, should be heartedly support the amendment proposed

SENATE

meeting last night. A very important question, in my opinion, was asked by a senator
from Newfoundland, namely, whether the
attitude of the various provinces has been
determined by the federal government but,
unfortunately, it was not answered. It is
very important that the Senate should know
this, but that question remains unanswered.
As we all know-particularly my friend the
former premier of Quebec (Hon. Mr. Godbout)-Provincial elections have been won,
and lost, on the question of provincial
autonomy. That is a most delicate question
in the province of Quebec. I am prompted
to ask, therefore, whether the present
premier of that province is so eager and so
impatient to have the federal government
interfere with a prerogative of his own province that he would support the passage of
this bill?
Hon. Mr. Euler: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lacasse: I wonder whether that
is the case.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That is a good point.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, it would appear to me that the remarks
of the honourable senator from Essex (Hon.
Mr. Lacasse), are beyond the scope of the
amendment now being discussed. Furthermore, I would call the attention of the honourable senator to the fact that the rules do
not permit him, after a bill has been reported
from committee, to direct the attention of
the house to what has or has not been said
in the committee.
Hon. Mr. Lacasse: I abide by the ruling
of His Honour the Speaker. But perhaps I
will be permitted to reiterate my two points,
which I think are in order. First, I support
wholeheartedly the stand taken by the senator from Kootenay East (Hon. Mr. King);
and second, I shall have to refrain from voting by reason of the fact that I am paired
with an honourable senator from Quebec.
Hon. Mr. King: Honourable senators, my
friend who has just spoken has brought to
my mind a fact that I had intended to mention in my remarks. I am paired with the
honourable senator from Kennebec (Hon. Mr.
Vaillancourt), and I shall of course abide by
that arrangement and refrain from voting.
The Hon. the Speaker: The question,
honourable senators, is on the motion of
Honourable Senator King, seconded by
Honourable Senator Lambert,
That the said bill be not now read a third time,
but that it be further amended as follows:
1. Pages 3 and 4, being lines 22 to 45, both inclusive of page 3 and unes 1 to 6, both inclusive, of page
4: Strike out clause 6, and renumber the subsequent
clauses accordingly.

Some Hon. Senators: Non-content.

Speaker: In my opinion the

The question is now on the motion for the
third reading of the bill. When shall the
bill, as amended, be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I move that the bill
be read a third time now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill, as
amended, was read the third time, and passed,
on division.
BUSINESS

OF THE SENATE

Hon. Wishar McL. Robertson: Honourable

senators, the supplementary estimates are
here, but I would prefer to deal with them
when the Appropriation Bill is before us.
I move that the house adjourn during pleasure, to reassemble at the call of the bell at
approximately 12.30. I do not know when the
supply bill will be received, but I would ask
honourable senators to remain in the precincts so that the sittings may be resumed
as soon as the bill is here.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

The sitting was resumed.
Hon. Mr. Roberison: Honourable senators,
I have ascertained that there is no likelihood
that the supply bill will reach us before
2 o'clock. How much later it will be I cannot
say, but I thought that the honourable
senators whom I asked to stand by should be
officially advised, so that they may govern
themselves accordingly. I hope that when
we reassemble, those who have so faithfully
attended the sessions until this stage will
again be present.
I move that this house adjourn during
pleasure, to reassemble at the call of the
bell, not before 2 o'clock this afternoon.
a

Hon. Mr. Reid: Before we adjourn may I,
comparative newcomer, be permitted to

make a suggestion? In looking around the
chamber I observe that the attendance has
fallen to a point where there is a danger
of not having a quorum. Would it not be
well, for the purpose of assuring a better
attendance, to make some revision of the
rules? The idea has occurred to me that the
rule which permits of fifteen days' absence

JUNE 30, 1951
during a session should be amended so as
not to apply during the final ten days. A
quorum of the Senate consists of fifteen members. As only seventeen are present, the
muster is barely sufficient for our business;
and it is not right that only a few of us
should remain, in the endeavour to carry
on the proceedings of parliament here.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Needless to say, I
am quite willing to consider any suggestion
that is presented by a member of this
chamber. I cannot speak too highly of the
devotion of a group of our colleagues, who
session after session have remained "faithful
to the end". I notice that that group is
largely represented this morning. I commend
them for their sense of responsibility in this
matter. This was referred to yesterday by
the honourable member from Ponteix (Hon.
Mr. Marcotte), and I take this opportunity
to emphasize his remarks. It may be that
there are others among the membership who
can so arrange matters as to continue their
attendance in the closing days of the session.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

The sitting was resumed.
APPROPRIATION BILL No. 4
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 406, an Act for granting
to His Majesty certain sums of money for the
public service of the financial year ending the
31st March, 1952.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Roberison moved the
second reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, this is the
fourth Appropriation Bill that we have had
this session, and the third providing for
moneys necessary to meet the expenses of the
public service of the financial year ending
March 31, 1952. It will be recalled that Appropriation Bill No. 1 covered interim supply for
the two-month period ending May 31, plus
additional proportions of certain special items.
The total was $421,303,355.75. Appropriation
Bill No. 2 covered the end-of-the-year further
supplementary estimates for 1950-51, and
Appropriation Bill No. 3 was for interim
supply for the month of June, plus additional
proportions of certain special items. The
total under this bill was $208,274,991.25.
Therefore the total interim supply previously
voted for 1951-52 was therefore $629,578,347.
80713-511

The total sum asked for by this bill is
$2,048,147,247. This amount is made up of
the balance of the Main Estimates remaining
unappropriated at this time, $1,852,975,067,
plus $195,172,180 provided in the further supplementary estimates tabled in the other place
on June 23. Honourable senators will of
course realize that to these amounts appropriated by parliament must be added the
amount authorized by statute, in the sum of
$1,145,099,211, bringing the total of the expenditures authorized by this bill, by supplementary estimates and by statutes to the sum
of $3,822,824,805. The form of this bill follows in all respects that of the Supply Bills
which have come to us at the end of previouS
sessions.
Section 1 is the short title.
The purpose of section 2 is to provide the
balance of the Main Estimates after deducting
amounts which have already been voted
under Appropriation Act No. 1 and Appropriation Act No. 3 earlier in the session. This
balance, which I have already mentioned,
amounts to $1,852,975,067. Details of Main
Estimates items are set out in Schedule A of
the bill.
Section 3 votes further items of supplementary estimates totalling $195,172,180, the
details of which are found in Schedule B,
extending from pages 34 to 49 of the bill.
This amount of roughly $195 million is to a
great extent made up of a few large items
in the estimates. One of these, totalling
$10,500,000, is for freight assistance on Western feed grains and extension of the provisions of this policy to the end of the
current year.
Another major item is an amount of $50
million for defence production, to provide
capital assistance for the construction, acquisition and so forth, of capital equipment
or works by private contractors. An amount
of $25 million is included for grants or loans
to governments of countries in South and
South-East Asia. Under the Department of
Finance there is a sum of $7,100,000 to provide grants to universities and equivalent
institutions. This is in line with one of the
recommendations contained in the report of
the Massey Commission. A further item, of
$14 million, represents the government's
contribution to the Permanent Forces Pension Fund under the Department of National
Defence. The sum of $50 million is also
provided under Loans, Investments and Advances for Defence Production, to increase
the amount of the Defence Production Revolving Fund which is provided for under
the Defence Production Act passed during
this session of parliament.

SENATE
These six items that I have enumerated,
totalling slightly more than $156 million, or
80 per cent of the total of $195,172,180, constitute the Further Supplementary Estimates.
The remaining sum of roughly $39 million is
comprised of a large number of smaller items,
enumerated in the Further Supplementary
Estimates which are before honourable
senators.
Section 4 of the bill before us is the usual
authority for the Governor in Council to
raise by way of loan sums not exceeding
$500 million, which may be required from
time to time throughout the year for general
purposes. It may be recalled that last year
this borrowing power was increased in
amount from $200 million to the present
amount of $500 million.
Section 5 provides that the usual accounts
will be submitted in detail to the House of
Commons.
I am a little more at ease, honourable
senators, in presenting to this house-for its
approval-I hope, such a staggering figure
in comparison with those I have presented
other years, because of our adoption of a
system under which the Finance Committee
has been able to inquire into the estimates
earlier in the session. I am pleased that
through this committee honourable senators
have been afforded an opportunity to examine
the items which go to make up this staggering
total. I submit the bill for the favourable
consideration of the house.
Hon. Iva Fallis: Honourable senators, I
find myself tonight in the position of one who
has had greatness thrust upon her, in that
I have been assigned, temporarily of course,
the responsibility of acting as leader of my
party.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Your party could not
have made a better choice.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: It has not been the custorn
in the past for this house to review in detail
the estimates and appropriations which come
down in the dying moments of the session.
For that precedent I am very thankful, for I
shall not be expected to enter into a discussion of the details of the items at this time.
The honourable leader of the government
has referred to the work which has been done
by the Finance Committee during the past
session. May I point out that when the report
of that committee was presented to this house
it was unanimously acclaimed as being satisfactory to all. I think I could not do better,
at this late hour in the session, therefore, than
to read a paragraph frorn the report. It is as
follows:
Your committee suggests that the government
should keep to the lowest point possible all capital
expenditures of every kind excepting those essential

to defence, to provide the minimum of housing
necessary and those expenditures that are normally
directed to increasing the production of goods and
services required by the Canadian people. Where
expenditures are made on any of the items, including defence spending, efficiency and economy consistent with attaining the end in view should be the
watchwords guiding them.
If the government, during the days that lie

ahead, complies with the suggestions contained in that paragraph of the report, the
members of the opposition in this bouse will
be content.

Sone Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. J. H. King: Honourable senators, may
I say a word of congratulations to the acting
leader of the opposition in this house? I
think the government is fully conscious that
we in Canada must conserve our assets by
conserving our expenditures. Although the
leader bas announced tremendous expenditures, I think all of us here realize that the
House of Commons, whose members represent the people, have considered these estimates very carefully, and I believe the Senate
will accept them.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING
Hon. Mr. Robertson moved the third reading of the bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.

ADJOURNMENT
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I move that when the Senate adjourns today,
it stand adjourned until Tuesday, October 9,
1951, at eleven o'clock in the forenoon.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

HIS MAJESTY THE KING
EXPRESSION OF GOOD WISHES

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, before His Honour the Speaker
ordered a moment ago that the doors be
opened, he led us all in our usual prayers,
including the one for the health and wellbeing of His Majesty the King.
We have each one of us been so relieved
at the constant good news of the King's progress towards a speedy recovery since the
grave surgical operation which he underwent
two weeks ago, that I am sure we would all
wish His Honour the Speaker to convey to
His Majesty, with the expression of our
respectful duty and of our loyal devotion, our
gratification at his constant progress towards
recovery, and our sincere good wishes.
I venture to propose, with your permission,
that we now give public expression to those
sentiments by rising and singing together
God Save the King.
The Senators thereupon rose and sang "God
Save the King".

the Deputy of the Governor General, having
come and being seated at the foot of the
Throne, and the House of Commons having
been summoned and being come with their
Speaker, the Right Honourable the Deputy

of the Governor General was pleased to close
the Fourth Session of the Twenty-First Parliament of Canada with the following speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
The people of Canada, in common with His
Majesty's subjects elsewhere, were deeply concerned
that the state of the King's health made a surgical
operation necessary, and they rejoice at the rapid
progress of the King's recovery.
My ministers are gratified that the world situation did not require the resumption of the session
before the date originally set when you concluded
your deliberations in June. The international situation continues nevertheless to give constant concern
to the government.
In Korea, despite prolonged discussions, it bas not
yet been possible to arrange a cease-fire, and hosTo this United Nations'
tilities are continuing.
action to defeat aggression, our Canadian forces
are making an effective contribution.
Since you adjourned, the state of war with Germany has been terminated by proclamation, and
normal diplomatic relations have been established
with the Federal Republic of Germany. A treaty
of peace has been signed with Japan which you will
be asked to approve at a forthcoming session.
While hostilities have been confined -to restricted
areas, the governnent is convinced that general
peace can be assured only by the continued build-up
of the combined strength of the free nations.
To this end, my ministers welcomed the holding
in Ottawa of the most recent meeting of the Council
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Certain
of the recommendations of the council will require
to be considered at a future session.
Arrangements are now under discussion with
India and Pakistan for certain projects to be financed from the contribution you approved ta the
Colombo Plan for Co-operative Economic Development in South and South East Asia.
You also made provision for a Canadian contribution to the United Nations relief and rehabilitation program in Korea.
At the outset of the session, you enacted a
measure to vest in the Governor in Council additional powers which might be necessary to ensure
adequate defence preparations ta meet the emergency arising out of the present international
situation.
The legislation to establish the Department of
Defence Production bas been implemented and the
new department is in full operation.
Agreements are being worked out with the provincial governments to implement the measure you
enacted to provide for federal contributions for the
payment of old age assistance to those in need between sixty-five and seventy years of age, Registration is being proceeded with for universal contributory pensions to persons over seventy years of
age to facilitate administration when the necessary
legislation bas been enacted.
You also enacted a separate measure respecting
allowances for blind persons; as well as several
measures extending the benefits of the Veterans'
charter, and providing for an increase in pensions to
certain groups of veterans and their dependents.
You authorized the provision of grants to universities and equivalent institutions of higher learning.
The requirement of the fiat in the case of Petitions of Right has been abolished.
The Indian Act was completely revised and the
new legislation is now in operation. The Post
Office Act was also extensively revised.
Other measures were enacted respecting grants
to municipalities; the regulation of consumer credit;
the grading of dairy products; the construction of a
